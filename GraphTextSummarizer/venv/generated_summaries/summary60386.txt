Several reports indicated that Siddiqui was in U.S. custody after her arrest in Karachi. A jury in Manhattan convicted Aafia Siddiqui on seven charges, including attempted murder and armed assault on U.S. officers, in February. "Dr. Siddiqui is an enigma," Cardi said of her client, who had attempted multiple times to fire her team of attorneys hired by the government of Pakistan. " Before the judge sentenced Siddiqui to more than eight decades in prison, defense attorney Dawn Cardi told the court that it was the most difficult case of her career. Prosecutors said Siddiqui picked up a rifle and shot at two FBI special agents, a U.S. Army warrant officer, an Army captain and military interpreters while she was being held unrestrained at an Afghan facility on July 18, 2008.
