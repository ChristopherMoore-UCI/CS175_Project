"We want a new government and that can be brought to us by Dr. Abdullah Abdullah and Dr. Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai." -- Afghanistan has been thrown into political turmoil after a months-long dispute between two presidential candidates prevented a successor to outgoing President Hamid Karzai being named. In the June vote, Ghani appeared to pull off a comeback, gaining more votes over Abdullah. Meanwhile, both candidates appear they are backing off their July commitment with statements reported in the media that Abdullah would reject the official results and Ghani indicated he may not be open to power sharing. The two contenders, Abdullah Abdullah and Ashraf Ghani, have accused each other of fraud and manipulation.
