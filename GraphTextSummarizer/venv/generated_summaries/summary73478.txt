Williams collected her 18th grand slam singles title at the U.S. Open in September to match retired legends Martina Navratilova and Chris Evert but prior to that didn't get past the fourth round at the three other majors in 2014. It matched the number of games won by Williams in 1998 -- when she was just 16 -- against South Africa's Joannette Kruger in Oklahoma. The Romanian -- one of two debutants at the WTA Finals along with Canada's Eugenie Bouchard -- entered the year-end championships in patchy form Caroline Wozniacki and her pal Agnieszka Radwanska posted upset wins Tuesday over Maria Sharapova and Petra Kvitova, respectively. Halep had lost both her matches to Williams last year, with the latter inflicting two "bagels" -- or 6-0 sets -- of her own.
