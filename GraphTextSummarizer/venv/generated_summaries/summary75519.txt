Under current law, Medicare stops covering drug costs after a plan and beneficiary have spent more than $2,830 on prescription drugs. Raising the threshold for imposing the so-called "Cadillac" tax on expensive health insurance plans to coverage valued at more than $10,200 for individuals and $27,500 for families. Increasing the fine on large companies failing to provide health coverage for workers from $750 to $2,000 per employee. It also would expand Medicare's prescription drug benefit while scaling back the bill's taxes on expensive insurance plans. How will health reform affect you?
