I discovered a nasty pain called shin splints, from pounding those hard courts day after day. My minor injuries and pains are nothing compared with the hardships many people face every day. I've always wanted to participate, but the fear of pain or asthma has always kept me on the sidelines. 'Too fat to do a lot of things' But once again, the threat of pain kept me from running. I've developed a love of endurance sports and an admiration for the amazing athletes who compete in them, from runners to cyclists to triathletes.
