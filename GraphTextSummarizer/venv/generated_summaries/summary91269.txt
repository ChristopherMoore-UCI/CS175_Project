The regime of Bashar al-Assad is aligned with both Iran and al-Maliki, and -- likely under Tehran's encouragement -- has begun to use military force against ISIS along the Syria-Iraq border. Bottom line is that the real challenge is ISIS, which is likely to remain ensconced in parts of Syria and Iraq. Jordan is vulnerable to ISIS too, but can't exercise much influence in Iraq. There is, to be sure, a sense of Iraq national identity. The Saudis want al-Maliki out and are happy that the militant group Islamic State in Iraq and Syria may provide that opportunity, even as they fear the jihadists.
