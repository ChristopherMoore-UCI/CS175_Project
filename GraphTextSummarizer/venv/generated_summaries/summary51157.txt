-- Ohio State University President E. Gordon Gee, who came under fire after controversial remarks about other colleges, has announced plans to retire, school representative Gayle Saunders said Tuesday afternoon. According to the Columbus Dispatch newspaper, Gee apologized last week to top officials at schools in the Big Ten Conference and others. Gee reportedly made disparaging remarks during a December meeting with the Ohio State Athletics Council. CNN affiliate WBNS reported that in March the university's board of trustees sent Gee a letter that outlined corrective steps in the wake of the remarks and that he could be fired if there were any more gaffes. On Tuesday, the chairman of the school's board of trustees said Gee has transformed the school.
