It said that agreement allows CBS to "reuse photography from 'Happy Days' to exploit the television series without making additional payments to the plaintiffs," CBS attorney Keri E. Campbell wrote in papers filed with the court. The actors claim they never received revenue statements related to merchandising, and that CBS intentionally never intended to pay them anyway. "The undisputed evidence shows, however, that CBS reported all revenue it received in connection with merchandise bearing the plaintiffs' name or likeness in the merchandising royalty statements provided to them and that there is no revenue that has not been reported to plaintiffs," Campbell wrote. Revenue from "Happy Days" slot machines featuring images of the actors was not as high as originally believed, plaintiffs attorney Jon Pfeiffer said. Since the case was filed, Pfeiffer said CBS has sent the actors checks totaling about $10,000 each for owed merchandising payments.
