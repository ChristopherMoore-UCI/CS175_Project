-- The grandson of the creator of Red Bull energy drink allegedly crashed his Ferrari into a Thai police officer, killing him, and then fled the scene, Bangkok police said Monday. Major Wichien Klanprasert was responding to a robbery call when his motorcycle was hit by what a witness described as a black sports car at 5 a.m., according to Bangkok Police Maj. Gen. Parinya Jansuriya. Vorayud Yoovidhaya's grandfather, Chaleo Yoovidhaya, teamed with an Austrian businessman to create the Red Bull brand and products based on a Thai drink. Dozens of police surrounded the mansion before entering with a search warrant, where they found a badly damaged black Ferrari. Investigators followed the path of leaked oil from the crash scene to Yoovidhaya's home, Jansuriya said.
