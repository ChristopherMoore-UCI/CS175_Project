When Procter & Gamble shut down some access to the Internet this week, it wasn't to keep employees from messing around on Facebook or crafting personal e-mails on company time. Since the dawn of the Internet age, companies have struggled with how to handle personal computer use while employees are on the clock. "As P&G drives to become one of the most digitally advanced companies in the world, more and more of our business processes, applications and systems are being web enabled," Fox said in the e-mail. But as more and more businesses need Web access to function (and as web content becomes more data-intensive), many are struggling with a so-called bandwidth "spectrum crunch." "We are one of the more lenient companies in terms of providing access to the internet, but there are some sites which don't serve a specific business purpose -- in this case, Netflix and Pandora," Procter& Gamble spokesman Paul Fox said in an e-mail.
