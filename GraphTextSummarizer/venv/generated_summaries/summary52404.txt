That's what should have happened to Cellini, Dimino and Shapiro, according to Sirius XM radio host Jay Thomas of New Orleans, where he says "Steve Gleason is an icon." We sincerely apologize to Mr. Gleason, his family and all those touched by ALS," Rick Mack, the station's general manager, said in a statement All three hosts have apologized on Twitter and personally to the Team Gleason foundation, as Gleason himself wrote on Facebook. -- If he had been listening from his car Monday morning, radio veteran Steak Shapiro knew what he would have thought of a bit mocking a former New Orleans Saint now battling Lou Gehrig's disease. At the same time, he's personally shaken for his part in offending so many -- including Gleason, those fighting ALS and the city of New Orleans. He's a hero in New Orleans not just for his play as a defensive back but, more recently, for his battle against amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a neuromuscular disease also known by its acronym ALS and as Lou Gehrig's disease.
