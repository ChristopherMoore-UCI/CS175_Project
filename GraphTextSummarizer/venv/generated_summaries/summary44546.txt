Sharbat Gula was 12 when photographer Steve McCurry captured his iconic image of her living in a refugee camp for Afghan nationals in Peshawar, Pakistan. An official in Pakistan's National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) confirmed the account to CNN, saying the woman -- identified as Sharbat Bibi -- claimed to have been born in Peshawar. The cards have since been canceled and four NADRA officials have been suspended in connection with the investigation, Pakistan's Dawn newspaper reported, citing an anonymous agency source. The Afghan girl whose arresting green eyes made her face known around the world in 1985 has resurfaced, this time in connection with fraudulently obtained identity cards in Pakistan. This week, Pakistani media revealed that a woman believed to be her and two men said to be her sons allegedly obtained national identity cards using forged documents.
