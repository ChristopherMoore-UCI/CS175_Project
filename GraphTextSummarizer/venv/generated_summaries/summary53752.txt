"Many side effects from drug interactions (not all) are exacerbations of known side effects of the single drugs that are made worse by the two drugs together," says Dr. Russ Altman, a professor of bioengineering, genetics and medicine at Stanford University. Altman says, when possible, introducing new medications one at a time can help you recognize side effects and interactions earlier. "I opened my medicine cabinet and saw it lined with prescription pill bottles," she remembers. The cardiologist ran a few tests and prescribed medication to treat arrhythmias.
