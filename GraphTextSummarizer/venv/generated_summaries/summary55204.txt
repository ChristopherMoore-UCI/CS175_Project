Without the leap seconds adjustment, the precise time measured by atomic clocks and time according to the Earth's rotation will start to deviate. "Satellite navigation -- sat navs in our cars and homes -- depend on signals being sent out from atomic clocks on board satellites." "We have to have some means of making a correction but at the moment no one knows how that's going to be done." Since 1972 Whibberley said only 24 leap seconds have been used and the rate has slowed because the Earth has been speeding up over the last few decades. For example, telecommunications use atomic clocks to keep the networks around the world synchronized precisely together," he said. According to Whibberley, precise timing systems can be disrupted by altering them.
