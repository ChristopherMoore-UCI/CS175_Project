More from Wallpaper*: The new breed of designer hostels But this year's best business hotel is the Georges, a tiny boutique establishment in Istanbul's Galata district, which offers its pampered guests a private butler. Highlights include New York's NoMad, which houses a two-floor library that turns into a cocktail bar, and the Fasano Boa Vista, in Brazil -- a resort that has natural forest and lakes in its vast grounds. -- Tired of staying in anonymous corporate hotels? Who says you shouldn't mix business with pleasure? Maybe you should try one of the gorgeous lodgings named by Wallpaper* as its best business hotels of 2012.
