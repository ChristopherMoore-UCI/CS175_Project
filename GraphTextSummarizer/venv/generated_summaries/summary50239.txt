CNN's Jack Cafferty, speaking on "The Situation Room," said that regardless of the reasons for skyrocketing gas prices -- tension in the Middle East, the closing of refineries, increased demand for gas during summer vacation season -- "Whether it's fair or not, the American motoring public has always tended to blame the guy in the White House for high gas prices." Yet some things -- gas, stamps -- don't qualify as optional, discretionary purchases; people need them when they need them, which is where the frustration comes in. Will the once-unheard-of prices we appear headed toward seem someday like great bargains, to be remembered warmly by Americans accustomed to paying $20 a gallon for gas, and $6 to mail a first-class letter? -- Remember those carefree days when a gallon of gas was only $5? When you could actually buy a gallon of gas for five bucks, or a postage stamp for half a buck.
