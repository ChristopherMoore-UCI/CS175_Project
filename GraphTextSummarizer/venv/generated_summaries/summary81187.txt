For all the military actions since the end of the Vietnam War, only eight Medals of Honor have been awarded: two for the "Black Hawk Down" incident in Somalia, four for Operation Iraqi Freedom and two for the war in Afghanistan, the longest war in U.S. history. Compare the eight Medals of Honor that have been awarded for heroism in the last 40 years with World War II, when the battle of Iwo Jima produced 27 such medals and 15 men were honored for heroism during the attack on Pearl Harbor. Last year, Defense Secretary Robert Gates was asked about the lack of a living Medal of Honor recipient. One day before the White House announced the award for Giunta, the administration said it will also award the Medal of Honor to Staff Sgt. First Class Jared Monti was awarded the Medal of Honor for heroics in Afghanistan.
