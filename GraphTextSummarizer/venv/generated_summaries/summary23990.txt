As long as it stays in the air, "Red Tails," a George Lucas production written by John Ridley ("U Turn") and directed by Anthony Hemingway (a veteran of "The Wire" and "CSI: NY"), is a compelling sky-war pageant of a movie. The movie has potent sequences of aerial combat that recall Tom Cruise and his flyboys bombarding evil out of the air. The actors really appear to be flying, and that gives the Airmen's brushes with the enemy -- even when they're just providing ''escort'' cover for white pilots -- a heart-in-the-throat, you-are-there quality.

Not so with "Red Tails," a lavishly square historical drama about the Tuskegee Airmen, the very first African-American military pilots, who served in segregated units during World War II.
