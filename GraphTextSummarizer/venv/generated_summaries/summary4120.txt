At least some of animosity between the negotiators had dissipated, said FARC spokeswoman Tanja Nijmeijer, a Dutch guerrilla who joined the FARC after traveling to Colombia to teach English there. "Building peace is collective work," said lead government peace negotiator Humberto de la Calle. Negotiators from Colombia's government and largest insurgent group concluded their first round of talks Thursday and voiced cautious optimism that they will eventually forge a peace deal. FARC negotiators named Palmera to their peace talks team and carried a life-sized cut-out of Palmera into a news conference on Thursday. Providing land to Colombia's poor is one of five topics the negotiators are expected to spend months debating, as well as ending FARC's lucrative role in the drug and kidnapping trades.
