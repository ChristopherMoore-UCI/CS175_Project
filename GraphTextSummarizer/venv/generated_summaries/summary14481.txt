However, Saudi intelligence has been successful in subduing al Qaeda cells in the kingdom in recent years, while security at oil refineries and pumping stations has been reinforced. The last major attack attributed to al Qaeda sympathizers was the London subway bombings in 2005. In Somalia, al Qaeda affiliate Shabaab has taken advantage of anarchy; in the Sahel, al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb has made money from smuggling and possibly drug-trafficking. But according to one document recovered in February 2010, al Qaeda had discussed derailing trains in the U.S. Such a modest objective compared to the 9/11 attacks may be an acknowledgment of the group's tougher surroundings -- and a sign that al Qaeda is moving toward attacks focused on causing maximum disruption and economic cost. In the last year, al Qaeda has launched several attacks on oil installations and pipelines in Yemen.
