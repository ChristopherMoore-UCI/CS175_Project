Rooney said in October he wanted to leave the English Premier League team after complaining it lacked ambition, something manager Alex Ferguson said left him "shocked and disappointed." -- England striker Wayne Rooney apologized to fans Friday for the way his contract dispute with Manchester United played out in October. Rooney changed his mind a day later, however, after talks with Ferguson, club chief executive David Gill, and Rooney's representatives. "Everyone is saying I was definitely going to join Manchester City," Rooney said Friday. The star's original deal was due to run out at the end of next season, and his agent had told United in the summer that Rooney wanted to leave the club he joined from Everton in 2004.
