Before the uproar over the Rolling Stone story, UVA policy allowed student victims to decide whether or not police were contacted after a sexual assault. The university did not call police because Jackie did not want the police involved, Rolling Stone reported. It's the first report of a sexual assault on campus since the controversial and widely questioned Rolling Stone article, published in October, that depicted the brutal gang rape of a woman named Jackie. Jackie has not talked to any member of the media since Rolling Stone issued an apology for its reporting, and the writer of the story has not spoken publicly since the apology, either. According to Rolling Stone, Jackie first reported her allegations to the university in the spring of 2013, months after the alleged assault happened.
