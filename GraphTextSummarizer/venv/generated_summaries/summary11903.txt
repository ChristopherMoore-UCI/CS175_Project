Even if the defense can convince the jury that most of the blame lies with Tsarnaev's dead brother, "They still have to deal with several people being killed and many other people being injured for no reason that would make sense to just about anybody, other than someone who was mentally ill or believed in terrorism," Tabak said. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's lawyers might be able to spare their client's life if they can show jurors that Tamerlan held "an unusual sway" over his brother, Tabak said. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has been frozen in the public mind by four images. Tamerlan was run over by his kid brother as they battled police who were closing in, according to the indictment against Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. His lawyers have laid the groundwork for a case that argues that Tsarnaev, now 20, was under the "domination and control" of his brother Tamerlan, who was killed in the chase.
