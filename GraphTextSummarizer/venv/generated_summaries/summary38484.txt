Korean War veteran Don Guptill greets a returning soldier at Bangor International Airport in Maine. The goal is clear: "Greet the troops, and thank them for what they do," says Korean War veteran Don Guptill. Guptill and other veterans, including those who served in Vietnam and World War II, were determined not to let that happen again. She and the other 40 or so members of the Maine Troop Greeters have made it their mission to welcome every incoming and outbound flight of soldiers and Marines who use Bangor International Airport as a refueling stop. Cell phone carriers donate the minutes.
