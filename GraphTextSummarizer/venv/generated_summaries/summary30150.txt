The name Redskins is "an insult to Native Americans," according to the two lawmakers, Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Washington state and chairwoman of the Indian Affairs Committee, and Rep. Tom Cole, R-Oklahoma, who is a member of the Chickasaw Nation. " The team also pointed to letters from Redskins fans of Native American descent who support the name, such as Arthur Dymond, who said he went to every game this season. NFL officials "have heard from the leading representatives of Native Americans in our country," she said. "This term does not honor -- but rather disparages -- Indian people and tribes," they wrote in their letter to NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell. "Let me remind you, this is a name of a football team that has had that name for 80 years, and has presented the name in a way that honored Native Americans," he said.
