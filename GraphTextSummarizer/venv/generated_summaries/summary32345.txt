And so in an unprecedented mobilization, managers and workers have protested at Market Baskets across New England, calling for their beloved CEO Artie T. to be reinstated. In other words, at a time when corporate executives and wealthy investors regularly try to argue that companies cannot pay workers well and be successful in generating profits, Market Basket has been an impressive and stunning example to the contrary. Not only did Market Basket continue to expand and reap profits â€” generating $4 billion in revenues in 2012 â€” but workers have thrived as well. In 2008, Anthanasios and Efrosini's grandson Arthur T. Demoulas was elected president of the Market Basket board. But that's exactly what's been happening for several weeks all around New England at Market Basket grocery stores.
