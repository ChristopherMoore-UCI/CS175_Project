The Oakland Police Department said Tuesday in an e-mail that the Alameda County coroner's office has identified the remains of a woman found Friday in Solano County, which is between Sacramento and San Francisco, as those of Sandra Coke. The grief was palpable in the statement from Coke's family, who hailed her impact professionally and personally on many people. That day, family members announced a $100,000 reward for information that would lead to Coke. Her 15-year-old daughter called Coke's longtime friend, Wendy Springer, hours later when her mother hadn't returned home. According to Oakland police, Coke had been in good mental and physical health with no history of being reported missing.
