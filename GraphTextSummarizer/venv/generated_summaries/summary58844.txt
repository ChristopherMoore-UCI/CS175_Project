According to UNICEF, there were around 712,000 orphans in China in 2010, but child welfare groups believe that the number could be in the millions if you account for children in non-government orphanages and foster homes.

However, it since proved so popular that authorities have had to introduce new rules to limit the number of babies and children being abandoned.
