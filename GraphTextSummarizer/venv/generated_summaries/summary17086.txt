Regulation soon goes into effect that will require airlines to refund bag fees but only if the bag is lost permanently. "Did my bag make it?" In the last couple of years, another wrinkle has been added to the mix in the form of bag fees. United has a bag fee refund form, as do others, but the only reasons it says it gives refunds are if there were duplicate charges, if you didn't travel or if you didn't actually check a bag. Alaska led the way in compensating travelers when it first introduced its bag fees for the first checked bag. But on Delta it's a $25 credit for the first bag and another $25 if you had a second bag.
