"The attackers abducted two local guides and demanded they take them to where some foreigners are staying to carry out the attack," Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan told parliament on Sunday. The attack took place at the base of Nanga Parbat between midnight and 1 a.m. on Sunday, according to senior police official Ali Sher. The Pakistan Taliban targeted the foreigners because the international community supports drone strikes, said spokesman Ihsanullah Ihsan. At least 14 killed in Pakistan mosque bombing Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif condemned the attack. "This was not a big hotel, just a small log/hut type lodge, so no major security," Sher said.
