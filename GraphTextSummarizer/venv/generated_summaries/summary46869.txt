Masipa cast doubt on witness testimony and said she believes media coverage contaminated testimonies. Oscar Pistorius did not commit murder the night he killed Reeva Steenkamp, a judge said Thursday. The Olympian's trial in the death of his model and law graduate girlfriend started six months ago, transfixing the world with graphic details of how he fatally shot Steenkamp. He did not intend to kill her, Judge Thokozile Masipa said. There is no minimum sentence for culpable homicide in South African law.
