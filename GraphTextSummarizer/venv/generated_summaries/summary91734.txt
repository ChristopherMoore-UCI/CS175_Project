It was the first significant defeat this year for advocates of gun rights, after gun control advocates faced an unexpected setback in May.  Map: " Sen. John Barrasso, a Wyoming Republican who was a co-sponsor of the amendment, had argued that gun licenses should apply across state lines, like driver's licenses. In addition to the national parks measure, Senate gun-rights advocates in the spring attached a measure loosening the District of Columbia's tight gun control laws to a bill giving full voting rights to Washington's representative in Congress. And he said people carrying guns would still have to obey laws wherever they are. State rights continue to apply there."
