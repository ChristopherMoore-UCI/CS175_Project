Taking Zainab, it became a matter of family honor and family pride. Waleed Fares, a neighbor and family friend, told CNN on Monday that Zainab's father died when she was just a toddler, leaving her mother and three siblings to fend for themselves in a country with often-unfavorable conditions for a single mother. " The neighborhood where the family lived, Bab Alsibaa, held a rally for Zainab on Sunday, and people vowed the brutality that destroyed the Alhusni family could only strengthen their resolve. "Perhaps more than any other family they were chosen to be at the front lines of the Syrian revolution," Fares said of the Alhusni family. -- Zainab Alhusni was a simple seamstress in Syria, well-loved by all her neighbors and friends.
