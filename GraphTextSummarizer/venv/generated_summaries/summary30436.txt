The travel alerts -- issued by ACLU affiliates from as far away as Alaska and New York -- inform people of their rights when stopped by law enforcement in Arizona, the ACLU said. City governments and organizations opposed to the law have targeted Arizona with protests and boycotts But Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer and other state officials say the law is necessary because of the increasing number of people illegally entering the state from Mexico. "We hope the alerts provide people with some measure of protection from illegal harassment from law enforcement and inform them of their rights should they encounter it." Arizona's measure stipulates that police can ask the residency status of people being investigated for a crime. -- Dozens of affiliates of the American Civil Liberties Union have issued travel alerts for people heading to Arizona this Fourth of July holiday weekend -- the group's latest effort to condemn the state's new immigration law.
