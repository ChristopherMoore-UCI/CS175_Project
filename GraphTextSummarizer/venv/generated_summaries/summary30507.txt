"The training of the team will be controlled on an interim basis by Under-23 coach Karsten Heine." Favre took charge just over two years ago and, after consolidating their position in the top flight in his first year, he then led them to an unexpected fourth-placed finish last term. Favre's assistant Harald Gamperle has also been relieved of his duties with youth-team coach Karsten Heine appointed on an interim basis. The club were also knocked out of the German Cup by second division 1860 Munich last week and were held to a 1-1 draw by Lithuanian side Ventspils in their opening Europa League group fixture 10 days ago. Hertha were even still in the race for the Bundesliga title with two games of the season remaining. "Coach Lucien Favre and Harald Gamperle have been relieved of their duties effective immediately," said a statement on the club's official Web site.
