Water levels and flooding have hit record highs in many spots, putting severe strains on systems meant to prevent uncontrolled floods and the resulting loss of life and property. Walsh said he expected the Birds Point-New Madrid levee breach will cause river crests to drop three to four feet "for a few days," even as he voiced concerns that water levels could very well rise again. The explosions, near the southern border between Missouri and Illinois, marked the start of a three-stage process to intentionally breach the levee -- and, in the process, pave the way for tons of water to flood 130,000 acres of Missouri farmland -- to alleviate pressure caused by historically high water levels in the rivers. With rain continuing to fall and water levels continuing to rise, Walsh said the situation would only get worse without drastic action. He said Missouri authorities are ready for the blast and subsequent flood.
