Death highlights key role of digital evidence Harris messaged six women, one of whom was underage, and exchanged explicit texts from work while Cooper Harris was dying, Cobb County Police Detective Phil Stoddard testified at a probable cause hearing last week. The documents, which include applications for search warrants and eight actual search warrants in the case against Harris, seek the medical records of Harris and his late son, a DVD, a 2-gigabyte memory card, a 32GB thumb drive and an external hard drive. Police say Harris left son Cooper strapped into a car seat in his SUV for seven hours while he went to work on June 18. -- Justin Ross Harris apparently called himself RJ on a social media personal networking site through which he met a woman that police say he was messaging on the day his son was dying in a hot SUV outside his office building. Cobb County Chief Magistrate Frank Cox found probable cause to move forward on murder and child cruelty charges.
