-- Elisa Baker, the stepmother of 10-year-old Zahra Baker, was indicted Monday on second-degree murder charges in the girl's death, a Catawba County, North Carolina, court clerk told CNN. A search warrant dated October 27 shows police were looking for latex gloves used to dismember Zahra and trash bags used to store body parts. Hickory Chief of Police Tom Adkins called the indictment a "milestone" in the case -- "holding someone accountable that members of 'team Zahra' have been working towards since the first words spoken on that 911 call" in October, reporting the girl missing. Zahra was reported missing from her Hickory, North Carolina, home in October, and some of her dismembered remains were found a month later. Elisa Baker was also charged last month with bigamy.
