For expert car restorers at General Motors, a wrecked, supervaluable 1992 Corvette represents a tall mountain to climb. Of the three repairable Corvettes that fell down a sinkhole at Kentucky's National Corvette Museum in February, the 1 millionth Corvette -- a white convertible -- will be the hardest to bring back to its former glory. Car and Driver lists its worth at $750,000 or more. On Wednesday, General Motors and Chevrolet showed it off to the media at a special facility in Warren, Michigan, before restorers begin what's expected to be a long restoration process. At age 22, the car is old enough that it will be hard to find or create replacement parts.
