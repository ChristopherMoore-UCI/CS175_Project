Used widely during the years of military dictatorship in the 1970s and '80s, the law was designed to protect the state against North Korean propaganda and to prosecute spies. But Park was imprisoned in January of this year, accused of "acts that benefit the enemy" and spreading North Korean propaganda. That year, just five people were prosecuted on charges of pro-North Korean online postings. "The NSL has a chilling effect on freedom of expression in South Korea," said Sam Zarifi, Amnesty's Asia-Pacific director. -- Everyone's made a joke they thought was funny only to see it fall flat, but Park Jung-geun's attempt at humor could see him jailed for up to seven years in South Korea.
