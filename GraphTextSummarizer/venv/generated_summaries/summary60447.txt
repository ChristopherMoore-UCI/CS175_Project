Thursday's Los Angeles Dodgers game was a "safe" event, police said, after security was beefed up in the wake of a March 31 attack in which a San Francisco Giants fan was seriously injured. " Stow's cousin, John Stow, told CNN affiliate KRON on Thursday, it's not known when Stow will wake up. "I encourage Giants fans to support Mr. Stow in a positive way and hope there are not any more unfortunate acts between fans in this great rivalry." "We have received hundreds of tips, but we are far from a solution," Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck told reporters Thursday. "This was a senseless act of violence, and I wanted to help out Mr. Stow and his family," Lincecum stated.
