Gifford left the show in 2000 and Philbin was joined by current co-host Kelly Ripa in 2001. This will be my last year on this show ... but there is a time, there is a time that everything needs to come to an end for certain people on camera, especially certain old people," Philbin said. " No indication was given as to who may co-host with Ripa following Philbin's departure at the end of the year. Philbin has been plagued in recent years by health issues, including undergoing triple-bypass surgery in 2007 and a hip replacement in 2009. In 2001, he was awarded Daytime Emmys for Outstanding Game Show Host for "Who Wants to be a Millionaire" and Outstanding Talk Show Host for "Live."
