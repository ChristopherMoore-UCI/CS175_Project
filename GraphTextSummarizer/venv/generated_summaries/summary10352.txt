Lowering interest rates on subsidized student loans does little to address the real problems of higher education: rising tuition costs and diminishing returns. Taxpayers are now directly responsible for higher tuition costs and the resulting large amount of defaulted student loans. The threat of increasing loan rates on future college students has become the newest political cudgel. In 2010, total student loan debt exceeded credit card debt. Today, the average student loan debt exceeds $25,000 and total student loan debt exceeds $1 trillion.
