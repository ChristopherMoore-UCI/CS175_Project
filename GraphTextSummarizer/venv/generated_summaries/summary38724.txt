South Carolina law requires state officials to buy the lowest fares available for flights, and bars the use of state aircraft for personal use. The South Carolina Ethics Commission has charged Gov. Mark Sanford with 37 counts of violating state ethics laws, according to a complaint released by the commission on Monday. Sanford is accused of using tax money to buy business-class airfare on domestic and international flights, flying on a state-owned aircraft to political gatherings or events "which involved no official business," and spending campaign funds for personal use such as buying a ticket to attend President Obama's inauguration in January. The ethics case involves civil charges that are punishable by fines, and Sanford can appeal decisions up to the state Supreme Court. State legislators already have filed an impeachment resolution against the governor for leaving the state this summer to visit his Argentine mistress without installing a proper chain of command or informing his staff.
