Bipartisan House immigration talks foundering, Republican warns It aims to strengthen border security while raising the cap on visas for high skilled workers and establishing a new visa program for low skilled workers on America's farms and elsewhere. "I think the 'Gang of Eight' has made a substantial contribution to moving the issue forward," said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky. Immigration reform is a priority for both parties in Washington and so far is one example of bipartisanship this year on major legislation in a sharply divided Congress. The House is working on its own version of immigration reform. "This will be a hammer blow to the wages and employment opportunities of American workersâ€”both immigrant and native born," Sessions said in a statement after the vote.
