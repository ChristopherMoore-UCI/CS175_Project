Turkish government officials have repeatedly criticized bloody Syrian military operations against opposition protesters. The anti-government uprising that erupted in Syria last March, and the subsequent brutal government crackdown that has resulted in the deaths of more than 2,700 people, severely damaged close political ties between the Syrian and Turkish governments. The Turks have also been feeding more than 10,000 Syrian refugees, who have been housed in tent cities after they fled across the border to escape Syrian security forces. Moubayed wrote that many Syrian companies are already struggling because of U.S. and European sanctions that curtail trade and banking transactions. "There is fear," said Ibrahim Eminoglu, an official involved in foreign trade at the Chamber of Commerce in Antakya, a Turkish province bordering Syria.
