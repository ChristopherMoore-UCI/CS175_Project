Despite losing influential left-back Leighton Baines to injury and after Liverpool's Joe Allen missed a sitter, Everton pushed forward in the second half and got its reward through Lukaku strikes in the 72nd and 82nd minutes. "All in all a wonderful game and when you come to your rivals it is important not to lose," Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers told BT Sport. "It's really disappointing we didn't get three points," Everton manager Roberto Martinez, whose side still rose to fifth, told BT Sport. That wasn't the case Saturday when Liverpool and Everton played to a thrilling 3-3 lunchtime draw in the English Premier League. Chelsea pulled level with Liverpool on 24 points, dispatching West Ham 3-0 in the late kickoff thanks to a pair of strikes from former Hammer Frank Lampard.
