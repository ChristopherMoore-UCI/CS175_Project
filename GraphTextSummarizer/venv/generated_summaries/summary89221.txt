As The Wall Street Journal points out, KT Corp. -- the iPhone distributor in South Korea -- sponsored a film festival, featuring 12 short movies made with the iPhone 4, last October. The practice of using phones to shoot videos -- other than home movies uploaded to YouTube -- seems to have become a bit of a trend in recent months. The iPhone 4 has been used to shoot music videos, while generally striking a chord with those who do not have access to big budgets. Meanwhile, the Nokia N8 was used to shoot "The Commuter," a seven-and-a-half minute flick starring Dev Patel and Pamela Anderson. According to the Associated Press, Park says the iPhone's small size and light weight, as well as the fact that "anyone can use it," made it a good tool.
