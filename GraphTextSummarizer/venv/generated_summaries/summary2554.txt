Prince William's wife, Catherine, plans to give birth to their first baby in the same hospital wing where her husband was born to Diana, Princess of Wales, almost 31 years ago, sources familiar with the plans said Wednesday. According to the prices listed, a stay in the Lindo Wing doesn't come cheap by comparison with National Health Service care, which is free at the point of delivery. The first indication that the baby is on its way will be the announcement to the media that the Duchess of Cambridge has been admitted to the hospital in the early stages of labor, royal sources told CNN. According to sources familiar with the plans, the birth will take place in the private Lindo Wing of St. Mary's Hospital in Paddington, west London. According to the Lindo Wing website, it has been offering private obstetric and neonatal care for mothers and babies since 1937.
