That was the subject of a meeting about long-term cleanup up efforts Thursday between the man overseeing the federal response to the oil spill and coastal parish officials. The coming static kill should also provide a ream of data that will give experts a better idea how much oil actually leaked from the well during the nearly three months it was spewing oil. And as flight crews find it harder and harder to spot oil on the surface of the water, Allen offered another bit of good news. "The chances that oil will become entrained in the loop are very, very low -- and will go to zero as we control the leak at the well with the cap and ultimately kill it," he said. That's partly because oil hasn't moved beyond the Florida panhandle and partly due to a stroke of luck from Mother Nature.
