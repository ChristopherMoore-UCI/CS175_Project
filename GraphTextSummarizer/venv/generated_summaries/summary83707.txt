In the Ultimate Universe of Marvel Comics, Peter Parker -- the original alter ego of Spider-Man -- is dead, and his replacement is a half-African-American, half-Latino teenager named Miles Morales. The book will be a glimpse into the Ultimate Comics universe after Peter Parker, when a new, multi-racial Spider-Man arrives on the scene. With Spider-Man one of Marvel's most iconic super heroes, the simple fact that Peter Parker will no longer be the man in the Spider-Man costume will be enough to turn heads, regardless of his ethnic background. "The key thing is (that) the 'wow' factor goes without saying," Alonso said, but he believes Miles Morales will be loveable and recognizable to long-time fans of Spider-Man, as well as relatable to a whole new demographic of readers. "He swings into action, kicks butt, and when he pulls back his mask, there is another face there," said Axel Alonso, editor in chief of Marvel Comics.
