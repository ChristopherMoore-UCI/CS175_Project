The group encountered Terry and other Border Patrol agents along Arizona's border with Mexico, and a gun battle broke out. Manuel Osorio-Arellanes, 37, had pleaded guilty to first-degree murder in October 2012 in the slaying of U.S. Border Patrol agent Brian Terry. The indictment also alleges the defendants assaulted Border Patrol agents William Castano, Gabriel Fragoza and Timothy Keller, who were with Terry during the firefight. But U.S. officials have not produced evidence proving that Terry was killed with either of those guns. " Osorio-Arellanes was the first conviction in a case with a connection to the "Fast and Furious" operation the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives began in 2009 with the purpose of tracking around 2,000 weapons intended for drug cartels.
