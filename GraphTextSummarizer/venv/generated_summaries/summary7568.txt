A top liberal advocacy group is lambasting ABC, NBC and CBS for deciding to not air President Barack Obama's primetime address on immigration Thursday despite running a 2006 primetime address by President George W. Bush on the same issue. While the Bush speech aired on a Monday night in May 2006, Obama's speech comes at 8 p.m. on a Thursday night -- one of the most-watch TV nights of the week. "[People] should make the choice whether they want to tune in or not and not have it preempted by network executives," said Justin Krebs, one of the group's campaigners who organized Thursday's push. " Krebs added that he "absolutely" believes MoveOn.org's efforts to mobilize supporters could prompt network executives to change their minds on airing Obama's speech. Obama is expected to announce sweeping executive actions to reform the immigration system and shield millions of illegal immigrants from deportation.
