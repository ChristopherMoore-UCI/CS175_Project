"In almost every case, NDS officials stopped the use of torture once detainees confessed to the crime of which they were accused or provided the requested information." Countries with troops in Afghanistan should suspended transfer of detainees to facilities "where credible allegations or reports of torture and ill treatment have been made pending a full assessment," the report said. Canada and the United Kingdom ceased transfers of detainees to facilities in Kandahar and Kabul at various times based on reports of torture and ill treatment, the report said. And in July of this year, the United States and NATO'S International Security Assistance Force stopped transferring detainees to authorities in certain areas based on reports of consistent torture and mistreatment, the report said. " "UNAMA's detention observation report found compelling evidence that 125 detainees (46%) of the 273 detainees interviewed who had been in NDS detention experienced interrogation techniques at the hands of NDS officials that constituted torture," the report said.
