But the ICC begs to differ with the definition of a state for its purposes and refers to the territories as "Palestine." "The Office considers that, since Palestine was granted observer State status in the UN by the UNGA (General Assembly), it must be considered a "State" for the purposes of accession to the Rome Statute," it said in a statement. In doing so, they officially become ICC members on April 1, giving the court jurisdiction over alleged crimes in Palestinian territories. The International Criminal Court opened an inquiry into attacks in Palestinian territories, paving the way for possible war crimes investigation against Israelis. The International Criminal Court was set up in 2002 to prosecute genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. The inquiry will include alleged war crimes committed since June.
