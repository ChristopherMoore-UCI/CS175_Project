This is why Italy's upcoming government bond auctions will be scrutinized for any sign that investors are losing confidence in Italian debt - particularly since foreign buyers of Italian debt are already few and far between. Having kept a relatively low profile since being forced to step down as Italy's premier last year, Silvio Berlusconi, the bad boy of Italian politics, has decided to run for the fourth time as the centre-right's prime ministerial candidate in a keenly awaited parliamentary election likely to take place in February. The scandal-plagued Berlusconi, who was recently sentenced to four years in prison for tax fraud but has a knack of successfully appealing against his convictions, epitomizes the dysfunctional nature of Italian politics, with its discredited leaders and unstable governments. Still, Monti's decision to stand down as premier once parliament approves the 2013 budget provides the first big test for Italy's bond market since the ECB-driven rally in Italian debt began in late July. Fortunately for Italy, the bond-buying programme of the European Central Bank (ECB) is providing a powerful counterweight to concerns about Italian politics.
