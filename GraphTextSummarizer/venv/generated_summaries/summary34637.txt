But Arab leaders shunned his responses, Vandewalle said, seeing him more as a "buffoon" and a "clown" than a potential pan-Arab leader. Although U.S. leaders initially tried working with Gadhafi, it quickly became clear he was an Arab nationalist and relations with the West quickly deteriorated, St. John said. Gadhafi's growing anger over the rejection of Arab and African leaders and his own growing anti-Western sentiment led him to turn to terrorism in the 1970s and 1980s, said Dirk J. Vandewalle, a Libya expert at Darmouth University. While Gadhafi has a substantial number of enemies within Libya, his use of the county's enormous oil revenues to provide subsidized health care, education and housing to citizens, as well as his willingness to stand up to the West, granted him a reserve of good will that he still draws on today, said Vandewalle. But Libya's 679,362 square miles and 6.4 million people have rarely seemed enough for Gadhafi, who in 2008 gathered a group of African tribal leaders and had them grant him the lofty title, "King of Kings."
