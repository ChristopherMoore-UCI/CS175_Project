DNA taken from a water bottle thrown away by one of DeSalvo's nephews is a "familial match" with genetic material preserved in the January 1964 killing of 19-year-old Mary Sullivan, Suffolk County District Attorney Dan Conley said Thursday. Those tests had been unable to find a match between DeSalvo family DNA and the killings, but Conley discounted them Thursday because they weren't conducted by law enforcement. Conley said 11 murders have been attributed to DeSalvo -- who confessed to the killings -- including Sullivan. DNA from DeSalvo's remains is needed to prove "once and for all" that the onetime handyman was Sullivan's killer -- and perhaps to close other cases to which DeSalvo confessed. " DeSalvo's brother, Richard DeSalvo, offered blood and saliva samples at that time in hopes of proving his brother's innocence in 2001.
