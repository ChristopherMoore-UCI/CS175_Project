"Unlike its predecessor al Qaeda, which raised money principally from external sources ... ISIS is principally, primarily self-funded," Jimmy Gurule, a former U.S. Treasury undersecretary, told CNN's "The Lead with Jake Tapper" on Thursday. ISIS is planning to mint its own currency in gold, silver and copper, the group said Thursday. How ISIS makes its millions He said its funding comes from oil, ransom payments, taxes and the sale of stolen artifacts. So I think the Treasury needs to be focusing on banks -- banks in Qatar for example, and in Kuwait -- that may be the recipients and handling money for ISIS. The move is "purely dedicated to God" and will remove Muslims from the "global economic system that is based on satanic usury," ISIS said.
