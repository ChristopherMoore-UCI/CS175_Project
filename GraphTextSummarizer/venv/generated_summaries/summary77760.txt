Kwiatkowski was working at Arizona Heart Hospital in 2010 when a fellow employee found him passed out in the men's bathroom, according to documents obtained by CNN. Kwiatkowski was immediately fired from Arizona Heart Hospital, according to a hospital spokeswoman. Exeter Hospital in New Hampshire said it consulted the American Registry of Radiologic Technologists before hiring Kwiatkowski and he held the required certification for his cardiovascular tech position. Those are two areas that Kwiatkowski visited during his "routine duties to transport patients," an Exeter Hospital statement said.
