" U.S. officials insist that the Obama administration wants to work with Russia on missile defense as part of a network of interconnected systems that might include sites in Russia. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev spoke to Italian media about conflicting views on U.S. missile defense. "The Russian Federation is not against the development of such a means of defense," Medvedev said, "but we believe that it should not be unilateral nor, in essence, directed against one of the participants in this dialogue, a major nuclear country such as Russia. And then we can agree on the basic foundations of a new START treaty and agree at the same time on how we will approach missile defense." I do not understand how people can say that missile defense is linked to the problems of the Middle East," he told the Italian media.
