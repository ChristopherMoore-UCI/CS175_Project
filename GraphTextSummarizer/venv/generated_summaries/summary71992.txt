A new permissive atmosphere in Venezuela has led to lax enforcement and increased trafficking, especially with drug flights to Hispaniola, say U.S. officials. And meanwhile, in Hispaniola, the U.S. DEA and local drug agents are up against the huge surge in drug flights. Gen. Ramirez Ferreira, a two-star general in the Dominican Army, has just secured the purchase of eight airplanes from Brazil to intercept drug flights. With the surge in drug flights, it's hard for the Dominican Republic to stop the drugs from getting in, and it's also hard to stop the drugs from getting out to the next stop in the drug pipeline -- Puerto Rico. Â» The number of drug smuggling flights from Venezuela to Hispaniola increased by 167 percent from 2005 to 2006, according to the most recent U.S. State Department International Narcotics Control Strategy Report.
