-- Nickey Van Exel, the 20-year-old son of former NBA player and current Atlanta Hawks coaching staff member Nick Van Exel, has been charged with capital murder in the shooting of a close friend, his attorney said. Van Exel does not live with his father, Johnson said. When asked why Van Exel allegedly moved the body, Johnson said Van Exel went "into a state of shock and panic. Van Exel tried to call his family, but he "couldn't get a hold of anybody," Johnson said. Van Exel and Johnson went to police and cooperated, Johnson said.
