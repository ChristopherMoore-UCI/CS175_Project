The first assignment for Prince Michael Jackson, who celebrated his 16th birthday last Wednesday, was an interview with actors James Franco, Zach Braff and director Sam Raimi about their remake of "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz." Michael Jackson's three children -- Prince, Paris and Blanket -- were kept out of public view until they appeared at his memorial service, when Jackson died in 2009. "I'm looking to become well-rounded as a producer, director, screenwriter and actor," Prince Jackson told ET's Brooke Anderson, who coached him on interviewing techniques. Michael Jackson's sister La Toya was "very instrumental" in setting up the job, a source close to her told CNN. Michael Jackson's oldest son launched his showbiz career this week with a gig as a guest correspondent for "Entertainment Tonight," a job his aunt La Toya Jackson arranged.
