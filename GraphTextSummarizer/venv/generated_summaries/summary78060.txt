They also each face seven counts of aggravated child abuse and seven counts of child neglect, with the mother being so charged Saturday and the father charged on all the counts Monday. -- State investigators concluded there were "no safety threats" at the home of a 10-year-old girl two days before she was found dead in her adoptive father's pick-up truck near her seriously ill twin brother, according to a report released Monday by Florida child welfare authorities. Both of the twins' adoptive parents -- mother Carmen Barahona and father Jorge Barahona -- are charged with first-degree murder in the girl's death. Jorge Barahona earlier pleaded not guilty on charges of attempted first-degree murder with a weapon and aggravated child abuse with a weapon in the case. Days before the twins were found, the Florida Department of Children and Families received tips alleging poor treatment of children at the Barahona household in Miami-Dade County.
