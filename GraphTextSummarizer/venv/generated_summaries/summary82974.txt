-- A series of bomb attacks throughout Iraq left 35 people dead and scores injured, officials with Iraq's Interior Ministry and police said Sunday. In a jihadist forum intercepted by intelligence officials on August 19, ISI leaders said they would conduct several phases of its "Plan of the Good Harvest" campaign, SITE reported, one of which would take place during the holy month of Ramadan. In Tarmiyah, about 40 kilometers north of Baghdad, two people were killed and five were wounded after a bomb exploded near a Sunni mosque as worshippers finished up a nightly prayer for the celebrations of Ramadan, an Interior Ministry spokesman said. At least 28 people were killed in a suicide bombing attack in a Sunni mosque in the Ghazaliya neighborhood in western Baghdad late Sunday, an Interior Ministry official said. According to intelligence analysts with SITE, the al Qaeda-affiliated Islamic State of Iraq (ISI) vowed to step up attacks in the country to avenge the death of Osama bin Laden.
