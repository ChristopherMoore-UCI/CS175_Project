That said, the real test will come next weekend when distributor A24 expands the film nationwide. The bumbling cop duo of Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum turned in the second-highest-grossing opening weekend for an R-rated comedy, ranking just below "Hangover II" ($85.9 million), but besting both "Ted" ($54 million) and "Sex and the City" ($57 million).

Then there's last weekend's top earner, "The Fault in Our Stars," which saw its ticket sales drop by 67%. The Fault in Our Stars — $15.7 million Despite this being only the fourth time the box office has had two films grossing more than $50 million in their debuts, the overall yield was down 7% compared to the same weekend last year, when Man of Steel had a $116.6M debut and This is the End bowed to $20.7M. Yet the strength of these two openers (22 Jump Street also scored well with audiences, earning an A- Cinemascore) coupled with minimal drop-off from previous weeks' releases has done a lot to keep the summer box office happy and healthy.
