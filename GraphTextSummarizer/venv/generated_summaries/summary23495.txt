We have all succumbed to city noise: A 5 a.m. call to prayer courtesy of a mosque after a lengthy flight, a late-night New York bar crowd living it up in the wee hours, a raucous Carnival scene in Rio during an important business trip. Several renovations later, guest rooms feature solid mahogany doors, dense triple curtains and thick luxurious fabrics, all of which absorb sound. It features triple-glazed windows, weighty 175-pound doors, wood floors topped with thick carpets, dense velvet blinds and wood ceilings with micro holes that absorb noise. Luxury Rooms and the garden-view Junior Suite are the quietest, but thick Egyptian marble and dense leather also help absorb noise in the plaza-facing accommodations. Others, such as the Tribeca Grand in New York, outsource soundproofing to companies like K.R. Moeller Associates, which has installed LogiSon sound-masking devices in rooms.
