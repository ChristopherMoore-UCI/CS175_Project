And while South Korean brands might be little known outside the region, thanks to the popularity of K-pop and Korean soap operas -- whose stars such as Song Hye-kyo and Kim Hyun-joong and Yoona of Girls' Generation are household names in the Asia-Pacific region -- Korean beauty brands are now the hottest ticket item in China. "The success of South Korean brands has a lot to do with Chinese consumers copying the style of South Korean soap opera and music stars," Rudd told CNN. Despite the coverage that South Korean brands have received recently, it is still brands from Europe and the U.S. that rule the roost in China. Beauty expertise "Western brands such as L'Oreal still have the brand recognition in China," Rudd said, adding that because South Korean brands have been slowing recently, they have been marketing more aggressively in the Chinese market with products aimed directly at Chinese consumers. Apart from creating brands that build on the idea that South Korea has a special expertise in terms of Asia beauty, South Korean cosmetics are seen as lighter and more fun than their Western counterparts.
