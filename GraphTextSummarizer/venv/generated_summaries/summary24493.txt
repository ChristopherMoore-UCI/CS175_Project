Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Spencer Eig temporarily barred the Florida High School Athletic Association from disqualifying Brian Delancy, who was born in the Bahamas, and Dr. Michael M. Krop Senior High School from the district playoffs, which begin Thursday. " "Playing athletics is a privilege and not a right," said Polansky, adding that it is up to schools to police themselves on student eligibility. Dearing said public schools must have such student visa forms and that Delancy's form had expired. An I-20 is a student visa that gives international students permission to attend school. Now that Krop is in the playoffs, North Miami High School will be bumped from the four-team field in the district playoffs, Dearing said.
