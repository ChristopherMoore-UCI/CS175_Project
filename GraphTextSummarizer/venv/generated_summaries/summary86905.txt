-- NASA scientists say they have captured the first-ever detailed airborne measurements of a major iceberg about to break off into the sea. Scientists aboard the flight noticed a large crack in the glacier and asked colleagues in the United States to review satellite data to see when it appeared, according to the NASA video. The NASA crew was able to use laser range-finding tools to create a three-dimensional map of the rift, the first time such an image has been created, said IceBridge project scientist Michael Studinger. The discovery of the approximately 340-square-mile iceberg-to-be came October 14 as scientists were flying over the glacier as part of Project IceBridge, a six-year mission to map a three-dimensional view of Arctic and Antarctic ice, according to NASA. But this time we were," John Sonntag, a scientist with the NASA survey team that captured the data said in a video posted to NASA's website.
