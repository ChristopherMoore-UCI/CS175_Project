Bolt won the 100m and 200m events in record times at Beijing 2008, and earned a third gold in the 4x100m relay, but Blake is closing the gap on his idol with personal bests last year. They are firm friends as well as training partners, but when the starting gun sounds at this year's London Olympics, there will only be one thing on Blake's mind -- scooping another one of Bolt's titles. " Gold in Daegu Blake posted a time of 9.92 seconds, enough to beat a strong field in the final but still well short of Bolt's world record of 9.58. "What happened at Daegu -- Usain Bolt is on the world stage and people are always going to look at that," Blake says. The competition "When you have Tyson Gay, Asafa Powell, Usain Bolt and myself lining up for the 100m, I'm always excited because the competition is really good and I want to be the best person on the day, the best person to execute well," Blake says.
