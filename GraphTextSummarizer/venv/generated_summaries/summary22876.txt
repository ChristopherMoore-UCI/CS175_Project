As the energetic crowd of South Africans and numerous world leaders surrounded me Tuesday inside Johannesburg's FNB stadium, I wanted to minister through song and lift my heart toward the memory of Nelson Mandela. Not wanting to miss an opportunity to embrace a culture most African-Americans never experience, I asked to go to Mandela's home in Johannesburg. I wish that I was more familiar with how it felt when Mandela was released from prison when I was 24. We were scheduled to hit Johannesburg, Durban and Kimberley. Upon arriving at the hotel, I sat glued to the TV as the news broke of the passing of Africa's favorite son and global role model.
