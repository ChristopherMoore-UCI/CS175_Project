The world-champion boxer announced he had entered treatment just days before Canelo Alvarez, who De La Hoya's Golden Boy Promotions represents, is set to square off against Floyd Mayweather. -- Boxing great Oscar De La Hoya says he's back in rehab. His is in the ring and mine in treatment," De La Hoya said in a written statement Tuesday. It's not the first stint in rehab for De La Hoya, 40, who has previously spoken about problems with drug and alcohol abuse. "He understood that my health and longterm recovery from my disease must come first," De La Hoya said.
