-- Former Federation Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) president Max Mosley is championing the introduction of added safety measures in motorsport following the death of IndyCar driver Dan Wheldon in a multi-car crash on Sunday. Mosley said a canopy could help stop accidents like the one experienced by F1 driver Felipe Massa in 2009, when a spring fell from the Brawn GP car of Rubens Barrichello and struck the Ferrari driver in the head leaving him in a coma. " On the canopy test, Mosley said it was an example of the FIA's continued commitment to improving driver safety. Mosley went on to back the FIA, expressing his confidence the organization will continue researching how to further protect racing drivers. " Former champion Stewart calls for change Despite backing the potential use of a canopy, Mosley warned such a device could benefit the car aerodynamically and potentially cause further accidents.
