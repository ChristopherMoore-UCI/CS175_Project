Russia claims the 33-year-old is behind the killings of two Russian journalists hit by mortar fire at a checkpoint in eastern Ukraine, allegations she has always denied. Savchenko's case has attracted wide international attention and turned her into a symbol of resistance against Russia in her home country, with Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko awarding her the title "Hero of Ukraine," one of the nation's highest honors. "I'll be on hunger strike as I said until I am returned back to Ukraine, or at least [until] detention is changed to a house arrest at the Ukrainian Consulate in RF, which is actually a part of Ukraine in Russia. Captive Ukrainian pilot Nadiya Savchenko has sent a stark message to Russian President Vladimir Putin as she awaits trial in a Moscow jail. " Savchenko's lawyer recently told CNN's Christiane Amanpour in an interview that President Putin holds Savchenko's fate and that she wanted to await trial out of jail.
