Reed was a rock pioneer who went from record label songwriter to a member of the short-lived but innovative and influential Velvet Underground. Neil Portnow, president and CEO of The Recording Academy, called him "an exceptionally gifted singer, songwriter, and musician who has had a profound impact on rock music and our culture," "We have lost a true visionary and creative leader, and his groundbreaking work will forever hold its rightful place in music history," Portnow said. And Tucker said Reed "influenced probably millions of people into maybe reading more, into playing music." In 1982, Reed told The New York Times that his goal wasn't just to make music, but create literature. "Lou Reed's influence is one that there are really only a tiny handful of other figures who you can compare to him," said Simon Vozick-Levinson, a senior editor at Rolling Stone.
