"We used the qualifying as an extended practice session as we don't always have enough time to do everything during the 45-minute sessions," said Stoner, who won the race last year before also triumphing at Valencia in November and then at Jerez in April. Rossi had hinted at a return to the form that won him seven world titles when he finished second in wet conditions at Le Mans, but the Italian was 0.88 seconds off Stoner's pace in the Spanish heat.
