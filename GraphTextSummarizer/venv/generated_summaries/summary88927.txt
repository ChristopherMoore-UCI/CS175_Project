Previously, another U.S. official said bin Laden was shot when he made a threatening move. The United States is asking Pakistan for information on who built and owned the compound where bin Laden lived, two senior U.S. officials said Wednesday. The al Qaeda leader's adult son was among those killed in Monday's attack by U.S. commandos, according to American officials. The news agency says they were taken by a Pakistani security official about an hour after U.S. forces left bin Laden's compound and that it is confident of the authenticity of the purchased images. The commandos took bin Laden's body with them, U.S. officials have said.
