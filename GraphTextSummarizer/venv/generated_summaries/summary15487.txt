Maksim Gelman, who is unemployed and known to authorities mostly as a graffiti artist, was arrested aboard a northbound train in Manhattan around 9 a.m. Saturday, about 28 hours after he allegedly began a spree that spanned three New York City boroughs, Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said. Around 8:30 a.m. Saturday, New York police got a phone tip that Gelman might have been riding on a southbound subway train in Manhattan. Shortly before 1 a.m. Saturday, according to Kelly, Gelman hopped into a cab in Brooklyn and stabbed its driver. As of Saturday afternoon, Gelman had not yet been charged with any crime and was in a Manhattan police precinct. Kelly said Gelman had 10 previous arrests, mostly for drug charges and graffiti, plus one robbery charge.
