Tuesday's ceremony coincided with the Capitol/EMI announcement that it will release Harrison's first solo greatest hits collection -- "Let it Roll: Songs by George Harrison" -- on June 16. Scores of Harrison fans showed up for the event, with some traveling from as far as Liverpool, England. Harrison was a pioneer of what has since become a tradition of rock stars supporting charitable causes with their music. Harrison played lead guitar and sang for the Beatles. Songs penned by Harrison included "Taxman," "While My Guitar Gently Weeps," "Something" and "Here Comes the Sun."
