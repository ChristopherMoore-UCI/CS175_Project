The deal offered by Middlesex County prosecutors would have required Ravi, 19, to undergo 600 hours of community service, counseling and to dispose of any information that could identify the man that Clementi was with.

Last month, Ravi turned down a plea deal that would have allowed him to avoid jail time.
