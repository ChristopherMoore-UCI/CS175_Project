Williams said he had wanted to see if he could get free, landlady Jennifer Elliot told the court, but she and her husband "thought it to be more likely to be sexual than escapology," according to Press Association. Reports about the "body in a bag spy" detail how two experts spent days trying to figure out whether Williams, who was athletic and of medium height, could have contorted himself in such as way as to lock himself into the North Face holdall bag, with a key to the padlock inside. At Westminster Coroner's Court, a solid red-brick building across the River Thames from the headquarters of MI6 -- where fictional spy James Bond worked -- the disturbing tale of the final hours of a man known for closely guarding his privacy has unfolded in the most public of ways. The family's lawyer accused MI6 of showing "total disregard for Gareth's whereabouts and safety" before he was found dead at his government-provided home, Press Association reported. Williams was recruited into the intelligence services straight from university, working with Government Communications Headquarters before MI6.
