"I'm the managing director of the International Monetary Fund...and our voice is listened to by policy makers," says Lagarde, who is helping coordinate empirical research and analysis to provide evidence of the strong contribution that women provide to the economy. "It's a common trait of women, to be concerned about the collective success more than about their individual visibility respectability and success," she says. She is now the first woman to lead the IMF and is in control of the global economy during an extended period of austerity. Lagarde is considered one of the most powerful women in the world - Forbes placed her in 5th position in their 2014 list -  as well as a pioneer in her profession. "I hope that there will be plenty of other female paintings," Lagarde says.
