-- A student found dead in her dormitory at a South Carolina college bled to death because of complications from childbirth, medical examiners reported Thursday. Officials at Benedict College, a private, historically black institution in Columbia, identified the student as 19-year-old Ayaanah Gibson. Gibson's body was found Tuesday. "The Benedict College family is deeply saddened this evening about the unexpected loss of one of its students," the school said in a written statement. She was about 32 weeks pregnant when she delivered a stillborn fetus late Saturday or early Sunday, the Richland County Coroner's Office said.
