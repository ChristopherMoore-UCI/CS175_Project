The casting of the "Frozen" characters had been speculated about for months before it was finally announced that "Fringe" star Georgina Haig had been cast as Elsa alongside "Greek" alum Scott Michael Foster as Kristoff and newcomer Elizabeth Lail as Anna. The ABC series, which concerns fairy-tale characters who are transported to the real world, had its highly anticipated fourth-season premiere with a storyline that included characters from the hit animated Disney film "Frozen." Elsa comes to Storybrooke in search of her sister Anna. (Disney, it should be noted, owns ABC.) The Sorcerer's hat from the film "Fantasia" made an appearance during the characters Rumple and Belle's honeymoon -- possibly portending all types of magical action this season.
