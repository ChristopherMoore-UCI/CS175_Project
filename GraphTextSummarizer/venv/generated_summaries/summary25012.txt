Unlike hotspot services such as Boingo (which powers Skype's mobile Wi-Fi service), which require a day pass or a monthly subscription, Skype Wifi charges Wi-Fi users by the minute. If you find mobile access to pay-per-minute Wi-Fi tempting, you can try the app for free this weekend -- August 20 and 21 -- for 60 minutes. Access rates start at $0.06 per minute, but may be more depending on the provider. You can now use Skype credit to pay for Wi-Fi access on your iPhone or iPad. In a blog post about the new feature, Skype suggests it might be useful for avoiding data roaming charges abroad.
