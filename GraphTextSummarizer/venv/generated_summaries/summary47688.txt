On the other side, an almost equal number of people -- mostly parents, young people, minorities, and those who work with young people -- found Jeantel to be a normal girl in abnormal circumstances. There is no middle-of-the-road opinion on Rachel Jeantel, the "friend, not-girlfriend" of Trayvon Martin who testified in the George Zimmerman trial Wednesday and Thursday. This doesn't mean that any juror or viewer who found Jeantel problematic is necessarily prejudiced or pro-Zimmerman. For the prosecution, Jeantel establishes Martin as a scared teen who was trying to run away from a stranger (Zimmerman) on his way back home. The real impact of Jeantel is how a jury -- made up mostly of white women and mothers whose only knowledge of Martin comes from his friends and family -- would view this young girl.
