The Cleveland Plain Dealer analyzed similar CDP force data in 2007, finding that out of 4,427 uses of force over four years, supervisors justified the force in 100% of those cases. The Cleveland report itself is almost chilling in its detailed narration of specific instances of excessive police force. In the past several months citizens have repeatedly demanded, and expected, the intervention of federal law enforcement in these alleged cases of excessive force. According to the Justice Department, this is an unreasonably high standard reserved for criminal prosecutions and inappropriate for internal police investigations. The Cleveland department failed to produce deadly force investigations that occurred after April of 2013.
