"There is a strong scientific link between consumption of sugary beverages and obesity," study author Sara Bleich of Johns Hopkins' Bloomberg School of Public Health Department of Health Policy and Management said in a statement. According to a new report published in the American Journal of Public Health, the number of calories in a food or beverage item doesn't mean much to many folks. One type of sign posted the number of calories in a regular bottle of soda. Soda makers want to cut calories: But is diet really better? Overall, the study author found that providing any calorie information encouraged more teens to purchase water or diet soda instead of a sugar-sweetened beverage. By early next year, more than 20 chain restaurants will be posting calorie counts on their menus.
