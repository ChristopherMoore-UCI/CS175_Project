To oversimplify things, we'll say that photons are subatomic particles that make up light. The photons, elements of light, did not shoot through at the speed of light but acted a little like regular matter instead. A beam of light is supposed to shine off into infinity, but when Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker whip out their lightsabers for some spark-flying action, the light blades extrude like stick deodorant and then just stop. Scientists create mini-brains from stem cells The newly created photon molecules don't behave like traditional light, but more like a lightsaber, Lukin said. But physicists Mikhail Lukin and Vladan Vuletic recently got them to stick together to form molecules.
