Sporting heroes Pistorius has been an inspirational figure around the world with his exploits, while his own sporting heroes both come from track and field: Britain's former 110m world record-holder Colin Jackson and Namibian sprinter Frankie Fredericks. Early years Pistorius came from what he describes as a "sports-crazy family, pretty much obsessed with sport" and did not allow his disability to restrict his activities. "To try to repeat my achievement in Daegu to reach the semifinals of the individual 400m." Having already achieved the qualifying standard with a time of 45.20 seconds in Gauteng earlier this year, Pistorius is well on the way to achieving selection and will also be pressing for a place again in the South Africa's 4x400m relay squad. With so much already achieved it is easy to forget he has many years of competition potentially ahead of him, but when Pistorius does eventually retire he wants to have left nothing on the track. Jackson has become a "great friend and mentor" for Pistorius, who has made many trips to the UK in recent years.
