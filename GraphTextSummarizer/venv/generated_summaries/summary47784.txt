-- Rep. Henry Cuellar has lost patience with President Barack Obama over his response to the surge of minors from Central America crossing the southern border. Boehner on immigration: When will Obama take responsibility? Obama seeks emergency immigration funds, more authority CNN's Deidre Walsh contributed to this report. Cuellar's sentiment is right in line with Republican critics giving Obama heat over the unexpected influx of minors from Central America, many of them unaccompanied, and now mired in bureaucratic limbo and caught in the middle of a partisan political firefight. He also was one of 27 Democrats who voted against Wall Street reform legislation backed strongly by Obama early in his presidency. He told Fox News on Wednesday that he's gotten calls and visits from White House officials but is not giving much thought to that.
