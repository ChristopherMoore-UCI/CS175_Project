However, he held it together enough to sink a huge eagle putt on the final hole to win his fifth European Tour title by two shots from Spain's Pablo Larrazabal and Scotland's Richie Ramsay at the Hilversumsche course. Ramsay birdied three of the last four holes to match Hanson's final-round score of 67, but was just short of repeating his victory at last week's European Masters in Switzerland. Should he go back to the U.S. or stay in Europe and take the risk of further complications for one-year-old Tim, who was being treated for a respiratory virus at the Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children in Orlando, Florida? and luckily it was my day," said Hanson, who pocketed the $380,000 first prize to be eighth in the Race To Dubai standings. Hanson, who also has membership of the PGA Tour this season, had looked like missing out when, trailing Larrazabal by one shot, he drove into the trees at the 16th hole.
