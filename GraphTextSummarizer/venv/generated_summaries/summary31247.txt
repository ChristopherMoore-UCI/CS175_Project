After CNN exclusive, USDA probing 'personnel issues' in meat recall How 9 million pounds of bad meat escaped into the food supply Food safety tips from a pro CNN's Chris Frates, David Fitzpatrick, Jacque Wilson, Miriam Falco, Elizabeth Cohen, William Hudson and Stephanie Smith contributed to this report. Some are as follows: • Gordon Food Service Marketplace stores in Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Wisconsin • Giorgio's Italian Delicatessen in Stuart, Florida • M Sixty Six General Store in Orleans, Michigan • Buchtel Food Mart in Buchtel, Ohio "While none of the Wolverine Packing product has tested positive for the pathogen implicated in this outbreak, the company felt it was prudent to take this voluntary recall action in response to the illnesses and initial outbreak investigation findings," Chuck Sanger, a spokesman for Wolverine Packing, said in a statement. The ground beef is sold under a variety of labels, according to the USDA, but comes from Wolverine Packing Co. in Detroit. Ten of those people were sickened after eating at restaurants that received contaminated meat.
