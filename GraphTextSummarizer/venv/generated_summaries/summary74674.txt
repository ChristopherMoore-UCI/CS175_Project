And, in a prediction likely to be welcomed by travelers the world over, he said that other low-cost, long-haul carriers were likely to follow in Asia, and in other regions when market conditions were right. But Osman-Rani said the airline had proven low-cost long-haul worked in markets like China and Australia. But now, in Asia, an increasing number of operators are beginning to offer long-haul air travel for low fares, opening a new frontier in the fiercely competitive aviation market. Budget airlines have largely focused on short- to medium-haul routes, with their success in winning passengers through low fares forcing many full-service "legacy carriers" to launch their own low-cost options in response. He said Asia was a logical market for long-haul budget carriers to succeed, as a natural outgrowth of the low-cost short-haul carriers that had proliferated in the region in response to deregulation of the aviation industry.
