Fifteen people, many of them teenagers and some as young as 11, were shot early Sunday morning at a Miami nightclub, Miami-Dade police reported. Authorities said the shooting happened about 1 a.m. at The Spot nightclub at NW 64th Street and Seventh Avenue. Several victims were released from hospitals Sunday afternoon and a person who'd earlier been listed as critical was upgraded to critical but stable, police said in a news release. No public safety officials have explained why so many youths 16 and younger were inside a nightclub after the midnight Miami-Dade County curfew. According to CNN affiliate WFOR, the Miami-Dade County curfew makes it against the law for children younger than 17 to be out on their own between midnight and 6 a.m. on Fridays and Saturdays.
