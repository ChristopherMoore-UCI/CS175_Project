"While undeniably special, it is not surprising to me that we found this because Ted always worked on multiple projects and started new things all the time," Audrey Geisel said in the release. Geisel's widow, Audrey Geisel, found the manuscripts and illustrations in their La Jolla, California, home soon after her husband died. Cathy Goldsmith, Dr. Seuss' former art director, said she believes Geisel wrote "What Pet Should I Get?" According to the release, Goldsmith is the last Random House publishing executive to have worked directly with Geisel while he was alive. More than 20 years after his death in 1991, a box filled with text and sketches will come to life in the latest creation by Theodor Seuss Geisel, aka Dr. Seuss: "What Pet Should I Get?"
