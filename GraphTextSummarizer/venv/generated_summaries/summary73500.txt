"We just have not been able to locate Mr. Bush, and so for that reason, the rescue effort is being discontinued," Hillsborough County Administrator Mike Merrill told reporters Saturday. By Monday afternoon, all the walls of the house were gone and "a lot of the debris" had been removed, Hillsborough County spokesman Willie Puz said. Workers demolished the blue, one-story home as carefully as they could Sunday and Monday to try to protect family belongings. Once officials get a better view of the sinkhole, "they can get a sense of what the next step is," Merrill, the county administrator, said Sunday. After the search for Jeff Bush ended, attention turned to razing the house because officials warned it could collapse at any time.
