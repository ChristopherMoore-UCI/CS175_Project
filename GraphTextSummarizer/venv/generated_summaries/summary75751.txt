Who wins the election will influence Taiwan's relations with mainland China and impact business, geopolitics and security in the region, including China-U.S. ties. Since Taiwan opened its borders to mainland tourists three-and-a-half years ago, says Shao Qiwei, head of China's tourism agency, over three million mainlanders have visited the island. "Even if Tsai Ing Wen wins the election, she will adopt a moderate policy to mainland China," he opines. Jia Qingling, a top communist party official who oversees Taiwan affairs, recently warned: "If we deny the status quo there is no way to carry on any further negotiations, and what we have achieved so far would be in vain. China keeps hundreds of missiles aimed at Taiwan, an ominous threat to the island to stay in the fold.
