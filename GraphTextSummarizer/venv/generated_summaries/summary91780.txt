New Mexico's "public accommodations" law forbids businesses from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation, among other things. Without comment Monday, justices denied the petition of a New Mexico photographer who was sanctioned under state law for refusing to document a lesbian couple's commitment ceremony. Willock argued that by offering client services to the general public, the photography business could not then pick and choose based on sexual orientation. The U.S. Supreme Court's denial of this appeal comes a month after Arizona's governor vetoed SB 1062, a Republican-led measure that would have allowed businesses to deny services to gay and lesbian customers, as long as the owners asserted their faith-based beliefs. Supporters said the measure promoted religious freedom, but opponents said it discriminated against gays and lesbians.
