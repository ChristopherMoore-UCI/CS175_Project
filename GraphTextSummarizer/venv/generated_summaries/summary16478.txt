The bodies, found Monday at a Sheraton Hotel in Towson, Maryland, were identified as being those of William Parente, 59; his wife Betty Parente, 58; and their daughters Stephanie, 19, and Catherine, 11, said Baltimore County Police spokesman Cpl. William Parente was an attorney, he said, and Stephanie Parente was a student at Loyola College in Baltimore. Stephanie Parente, 19, was found dead along with her sister and parents in a Baltimore hotel Monday. The bodies were found Monday after a housekeeper told hotel management about 3 p.m. that the door to the room was locked and there had been no response from inside, county police spokesman Bill Toohey said Monday. He said the family frequently traveled to Baltimore to visit Stephanie Parente at school.
