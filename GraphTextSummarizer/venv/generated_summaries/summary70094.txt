" Jacobson is expected to travel to Havana in January to lead U.S. efforts to normalize relations with Cuba, U.S. government officials had previously said. "We are deeply concerned about the latest reports of detentions and arrests by Cuban authorities of peaceful civil society members and activists," State Department spokesman Jeff Rathke said in a statement. Bruguera had tried to convince Cuban officials to allow the event to go forward but on Tuesday the government-run union for artists and writers released a statement calling her proposal a "political provocation" meant to derail improving U.S.-Cuban relations.

His freedom was part of a landmark deal paving the way for a major overhaul in U.S. policy toward Cuba.
