"He was diagnosed a while ago, but it became obvious that he had a serious problem about two years ago," his wife, Washington Post columnist Sally Quinn, said in the C-SPAN interview Sunday. " In November, President Barack Obama awarded Bradlee the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest honor awarded to civilians. "With Ben in charge, the Post published the Pentagon Papers, revealing the true history of America's involvement in Vietnam; exposed Watergate; unleashed a new era of investigative journalism, holding America's leaders accountable and reminding us that our freedom as a nation rests on our freedom of the press," Obama said at the ceremony. Ben Bradlee, the former top editor of The Washington Post who oversaw the paper's coverage of the Watergate scandal, is in hospice care as his health has declined over the past six weeks, his wife said in a C-SPAN interview. Bradlee was the executive editor of The Washington Post from 1968 to 1991 during which time the paper covered the downfall of President Richard Nixon in the Watergate scandal. Bradlee, 93, began end-of-life care at his home last week after suffering from Alzheimer's disease and dementia for several years.
