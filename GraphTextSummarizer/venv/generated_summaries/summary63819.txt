Had the government not delayed its controversial order that all computers be equipped with Green Dam by July 1, the result would have been the same -- Chinese computer retailers were far from ready. "I have no idea since I have not used it yet," said a seller of computer software. Computer experts say manufacturers have not had enough time to pre-install new computers with the software -- which is one reason behind the government's delay. Domestically, Chinese Internet users are rallying against the government. "China is putting companies in an untenable position by requiring them, with virtually no public notice, to pre-install software that appears to have broad-based censorship implications and network security issues," said U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gary Locke in a press-release.
