Gaza hospital shelled The Shuhada Al-Aqsa hospital in central Gaza was hit by shelling, leaving five people dead -- one patient and four relatives, the Gaza Health Ministry said. Obama also "raised serious concern about the growing number of casualties, including increasing Palestinian civilian deaths in Gaza and the loss of Israeli soldiers. The death toll on both sides of the Gaza battle jumped Monday, as Palestinian officials reported scores more killed and Israel announced seven more soldiers died -- including several on Israeli soil. Four were on Israeli soil, killed as a result of infiltration by Hamas operatives, the Israel Defense Forces said. Hamas said Monday it had killed Israeli soldiers in an ambush and that the Hamas fighters were uninjured.
