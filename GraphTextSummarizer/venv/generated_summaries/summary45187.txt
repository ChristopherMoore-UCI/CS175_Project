" Another issue, said educational psychologist, consultant and parenting coach Lori Day, is when parents rely on social media, when they should instead be talking to professionals such as a teacher, pediatrician or child psychologist. In conversations over email with parents across the country, I found a real split in opinions about whether using social media to help parent is positive or inappropriate. Asking not just your followers but random strangers to choose a name for your child is no doubt one of the more extreme examples of crowdsourced parenting, but what about deciding discipline based on social media responses or asking for help with deeply personal issues such as a child's depression or anxiety, or a case of bullying, or a child's exploration of sex? "I think the ease in which parents can go to social media often chips away at their confidence to trust their gut," said Engelman, co-founder of the blog Mommy on a Shoestring. And pretty much every time I read one, I wonder about the pluses and minuses of a world in which many parents now head to their social networks to make parenting decisions.
