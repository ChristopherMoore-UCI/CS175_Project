Freedom Partners Action Fund, the sole super PAC in the Koch brothers' vast network of political groups, is launching two TV ads in Kansas that link Orman to President Barack Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. It's a strategy the Koch-backed group has also adopted, dropping $6.5 million of ads in six other battleground Senate races to paint a vote for Democratic Senate candidates as a vote for Obama. Orman has remained tight-lipped on which party he would caucus with if elected, but the Koch-backed super PAC is funneling more than $1.1 million into Kansas airwaves to make sure Orman doesn't get the chance to cast the deciding vote for Senate control. The super PAC backed by the Koch brothers is making its final push in Kansas on Thursday with a seven figure ad buy urging voters to keep independent candidate Greg Orman out of the Senate. " Recent polls show Orman is neck-and-neck with incumbent Republican Sen. Pat Roberts in one of the most watched Senate races this cycle.
