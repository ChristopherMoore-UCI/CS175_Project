New York Yankee Alex Rodriguez sharply criticized Major League Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig and the league's investigations division Thursday. Since the arbitration hearing began on September 30, Rodriguez has filed two lawsuits: one against Selig and MLB, and a second against Yankees team physician Christopher Ahmad and his hospital, New York Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center. "I am deeply troubled by my team's investigative findings with respect to MLB's conduct," Rodriguez said through his spokesman Ron Berkowitz. He continued, "Mr. Rodriguez's use of (performance-enhancing drugs) was longer and more pervasive than any other player, and when this process is complete, the facts will prove that it is Mr. Rodriguez and his representatives who have engaged in ongoing, gross misconduct. The worker told police that MLB representatives had "offered him a job and up to $125,000 for the client files."
