Watch mom talk about hopes for son Â» Both children -- Jaycee Dugard and Jacob Wetterling -- were 11 years old at the time of their abductions. " Wetterling's son Jacob is still missing after a gunpoint abduction almost 20 years ago near their home in St. Joseph, Minnesota. "Most parents know nothing about child abduction, so when it happens you just scramble for what's out there," Wetterling says. Since her son's kidnapping, Wetterling has turned being an advocate for families of missing children into a full-time job. Within minutes [the child] was found." An instance like that or Jaycee Dugard's could very well be what brings Jacob home someday.
