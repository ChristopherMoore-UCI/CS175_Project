I don't want you to pity parents of children with special needs, but do understand that many of us are looking for answers to questions we barely understand. Parents of children with autism, in particular, have proven especially susceptible to fraud and fear. In the world of special needs parenting, a world to which both McCarthy and I belong, parents are even more afraid and seek answers. Studies found that stress levels for primary caregivers of children with autism compare to those of soldiers deployed in combat zones. In previous years, panels at the same conference have promoted the practice of giving autistic children bleach orally and as an enema -- all as part of a detox method (predicated on the idea that autism is an environmental disease).
