"Nobody can afford Egypt to fail." Six years after winning the Nobel Peace Prize for his work as head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, ElBaradei was among those who pushed successfully for the overthrow of President Hosni Mubarak in January 2011. While ElBaradei stated flatly that he personally isn't interested in becoming president, he said he is "deeply concerned" about Egypt and willing to do what he can to help steer it to a brighter future Opinion: Will the Muslim Brotherhood survive? That government should include members of the Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamist organization that was banned under Mubarak but has become Egypt's most powerful political force, according to ElBaradei. Fast Facts Morsy won that race, but since taking office he hasn't won over liberals, reformists and others such as ElBaradei who criticized him for not governing for all Egyptians, failing to bolster a faltering economy and promoting a constitution and social policies that some call too restrictive.
