Kameny recalled his service fighting in the wake of the Battle of the Bulge: "I dug my way across Europe slit trench by slit trench, practically." Pioneering gay rights activist Frank Kameny died Tuesday evening at home in Washington, a spokesman said. In 1968, he got the only existing national association of gay rights organizations to adopt as its slogan a phrase that Kameny had coined, "Gay is Good." "From his early days fighting institutionalized discrimination in the federal workforce, Dr. Kameny taught us all that 'Gay is Good.' Kameny died peacefully of natural causes, according to his sister Edna Kameny Lavey.
