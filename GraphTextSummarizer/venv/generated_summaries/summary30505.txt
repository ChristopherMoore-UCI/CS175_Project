The H7N9 strain responsible for the bird flu outbreak in China is unlike any that has previously been seen in this type of virus. No travel restrictions; low U.S. risk The CDC is not advising against traveling to China, but travelers who go there should refrain from touching birds and other animals and wash their hands often. WHO: H7N9 virus 'one of the most lethal so far' In normal cooking temperatures -- so all parts of the meat reach at least 158 degrees Fahrenheit (70 degrees Celsius) with no "pink" -- the virus would be inactivated, including in poultry and game birds. New bird flu well-adapted to infect people There's still a lot of unknowns It's not clear why this virus strain is infecting humans now, and the source of the infection is unknown.
