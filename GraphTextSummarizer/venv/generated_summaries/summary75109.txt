"Our findings offer a very compelling case for a potentially habitable planet," said Astronomy Professor Steven Vogt of the University of California Santa Cruz who lead the research along with Astronomer Paul Butler of the Carnegie Institute. -- Astronomers have discovered a new planet that just may be able to support life in a nearby solar system a mere 20 light years from Earth. "If we discover life outside our planet, it would perhaps be the most significant discovery of all time," said Ed Seidel of the National Science Foundation. The scientists believe the new planet has a mass three to four times that of Earth and orbits its star approximately every 37 days. When a planet falls in the "habitable zone" it means that it orbits the star at a distance that allows for the planet to have both liquid water and an atmosphere, two conditions that are considered important for life to exist.
