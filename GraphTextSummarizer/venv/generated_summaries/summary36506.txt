Most of the villages have been washed away by water," said Joseph Prior Tio, who's working with Doctors Without Borders in Pakistan's Swat Valley. "We are fighting to get safe water to many areas," Tio said "There is simply no electricity anywhere in the entire valley. -- Intense rains let up in parts of northwestern Pakistan on Thursday, giving humanitarian groups a chance to get more aid to the millions of people suffering. All over the valley there are about 1 million people who depended on electricity to get basic services such as safe drinking water. Another big issue is the many left without electricity, Tio said.
