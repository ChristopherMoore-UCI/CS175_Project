Statistics quantifying crimes against children are hard to come by in Afghanistan, an impoverished nation ravaged by three decades of war. Coomaraswamy went to Afghanistan this summer to establish a monitoring and reporting system on what is deemed as grave violations committed against children. "I can't think of any country in the world in which children suffer more than in Afghanistan," Coomaraswamy says. Radhika Coomaraswamy, the U.N. special representative for children in armed conflict, plans to release a report in October on the state of Afghan children. The 12-year-old girl, gang-raped in Afghanistan, weeps as her family demands justice.
