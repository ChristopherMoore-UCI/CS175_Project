Justice Anthony Kennedy expressed concern that the congressionally-approved law giving Americans the discretion to change "Jerusalem" on current passports to "Israel" offers a "cramped" view of the president's power to conduct foreign policy amid undue congressional interference. "There have been 50,000 Americans in the last 10 years that were born in Jerusalem, and many of them would like to have Israel indicated as their place of birth in the passports," said Sarah Cleveland, a Columbia University Law School professor, and until recently a counselor on international law at the State Department. Menachem Zivotofsky was born in Jerusalem, a disputed region in the eyes of the Obama administration, which argued in court the larger issue should be resolved by bilateral negotiations, not by a 2002 federal law favoring the family and 50,000 other Americans born in the holy city. "But what if the question is whether the president has exclusive jurisdiction -- plenary authority, unreviewable authority -- with respect to anything that the president thinks has a bearing on the question of recognition?" Just three weeks before Menachem was born, the United States Congress gave U.S. citizens born in Jerusalem the individual discretion to ask that Israel be listed on passports and consular reports, where it says "Place of Birth."
