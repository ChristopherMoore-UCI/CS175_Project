International Monetary Fund and World Bank boards released a statement Thursday supporting $12.3 billion in debt relief for the central African nation. -- The Democratic Republic of Congo is in line to get billions of dollars in debt relief, World Bank officials said, cutting the amount the nation owes by more than 80 percent. The nation remains one of the world's poorest countries despite abundant natural resources such as copper and cobalt. Congo qualifies for the relief because it has made efforts to strengthen its economy and resume good governance despite years of conflict, according to the Washington-based organizations. Congo received $11.1 billion in relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative and $1.2 billion under the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative, the organizations said in a statement.
