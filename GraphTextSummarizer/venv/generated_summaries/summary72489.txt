See also: Why we pick bad leaders Recognize and reward for "how" and not "what" Leaders and managers should go out of their way to recognize employees for how they do what they do, not for what they do or how much they get done. When the world is tied together this intimately, everyone's values and behavior matter more than ever, because our actions affect more people than ever and in ways they never have. Instead, behavior is now an offensive strategy that inspirational leaders need to deploy all over the pitch to create the conditions that result in the game being won, not just being played. We're asking for distinctly human qualities and behaviors and how leaders elicit and guide those inspired behaviors must shift accordingly. The Greek philosopher Heraclitus said, "Character is fate" and it is the responsibility of leaders to enlist employees who can contribute their full character and creativity to perform their best work and whose reason and purpose for going to work every day extends beyond their paycheck.
