The picketing, which includes chants and placards stating "God Hates Fags" and "Thank God for Dead Soldiers," have enraged supporters of the U.S. military and the families and friends of slain soldiers. -- An estranged son of anti-gay Kansas pastor Fred Phelps said Wednesday that the spiritual leader of Westboro Baptist Church hit his wife and beat his children with a mattock handle until they bled. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled earlier this month that Westboro's practice of picketing the funerals of fallen soldiers with offensive placards is constitutionally protected free speech. Nate Phelps called his pastor father "one of the best reasons that America has been forced to get off the fence and address this issue (of gay rights). "So since the United States is taking steps to move in the direction of equality for gays in America, he says that has doomed America," Phelps said.
