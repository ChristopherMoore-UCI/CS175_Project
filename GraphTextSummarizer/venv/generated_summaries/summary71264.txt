After that morning, Dad and I didn't visit parks, nor did he want to play catch. He joked that curled lips had already lent him a handicap, thereby giving him more time to perfect his renditions of "Hound Dog" and "Burning Love." "If you thought night baseball was a thrill, just wait," Dad told me. My earliest childhood memories were of Dad whistling to songs on the radio. Dad and I love baseball and hate sleep.
