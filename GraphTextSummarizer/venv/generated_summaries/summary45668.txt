That classification makes it difficult for banks -- which are federally regulated -- to do business with marijuana retailers, even legal ones. The two recognize that "budtender" might not be a career path any family expects their child to embark on, but for the most part, there has been surprising support: McGuire even got permission to use the remainder of her college fund to start Breckenridge Cannabis Club more than five years ago. The two said they brought in more than $47,000 in sales, roughly 30 times their normal daily sales of medical marijuana. Previously, they were only permitted to sell medical marijuana to the approximate 4,500 permanent residents of Breckenridge; when the new legislation took effect on January 1, 2014, they could then sell to any of the 30,000-plus tourists (21 years or older) who visited the town during peak season. As pioneers in a newly legalized business, the risks Rogers and McGuire face go above and beyond those of your average small business.
