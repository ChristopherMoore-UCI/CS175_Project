A strong storm over the Bering Sea -- the remnants of Super Typhoon Nuri -- will bring intense winds, massive waves and heavy rain and snow to coastal Alaska and the Aleutian Islands. But a second cold front with really cold air will make its way into the Upper Midwest Sunday and the East Coast by the end of next week. This incredibly strong cyclone will alter the jet stream allowing for the cold air to plunge into the United States next week. This arctic outbreak will funnel down through Canada over the next week, bringing a deep freeze to the eastern United States, with temperatures forecast 20 degrees below average. The ripple of frigid air starts in Alaska, where the remnants of Super Typhoon Nuri -- which earlier in the week was tied for the strongest storm typhoon of the year based on wind speed  -- have strengthened, though it isn't a typhoon any longer.
