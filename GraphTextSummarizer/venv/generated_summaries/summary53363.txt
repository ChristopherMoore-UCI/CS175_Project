"The balance of the evidence weighs heavily against the FCC's contention that its restrained enforcement policy for fleeting material extended only to fleeting words and not to fleeting images," wrote Judge Marjorie Rendell for the 2-1 majority. They worry, however, about unplanned, often spontaneous indecent or profane incidents at live events, such as awards shows and sporting events. The government clampdown on obscene images and words began in 2003. The Supreme Court is currently deciding a separate but related issue over whether FCC enforcement policies violate the free speech rights of broadcasters airing profanity and sexual content, both in live and scripted form. The Justice Department in its appeal over the Janet Jackson incident told the high court there is no "fleeting images exemption from indecency enforcement" and that the singer's act was "shocking and pandering," airing "during a prime-time broadcast of a sporting event that was marketed as family entertainment and contained no warning that it would include nudity."
