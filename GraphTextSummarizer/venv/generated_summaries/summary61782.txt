"My brother ... thought the whole situation was sketchy." Timothy Kern ended up going to the would-be job site alone, not with the 17-year-old son who'd accompanied him to the interview, Zach Kern said. The Summit County medical examiner's office on Saturday identified one of the victims as Timothy Kern of Massillon, Ohio. A phone call led police Friday to Kern's body in a shallow grave behind an Akron mall, authorities said. Multiple authorities since then have also linked the two bodies discovered Friday -- including that of Kern -- with the same investigation. On November 15, authorities -- including agents from the FBI and Ohio's Bureau of Criminal Investigation, plus "cadaver-sniffing" dogs -- found "the body of a white male buried in a shallow grave" near where the first man had been shot, Hannum said.
