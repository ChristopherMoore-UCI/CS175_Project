Passengers booked on flights that have been canceled by the strike will be offered seats on flights with BA or other airlines, or will be offered a full refund, the airline said. BA will be able to run a full operation from London's Gatwick Airport and London City Airport this weekend because so many cabin crew members will be working as normal, the airline said in a statement late Tuesday. "Letters are going out to staff who took industrial action concerning staff travel," a statement from the airline said. Staff who joined the strike last weekend will now lose benefits including free and heavily discounted travel, BA said. " BA Chief Executive Willie Walsh had threatened last week to take away the travel perks, which may have been one reason why some union staff agreed to work despite the strike last weekend.
