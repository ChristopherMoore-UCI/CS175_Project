And as a principal point of contact for investors in Madoff's investment advisory business, DiPascali said, he also regularly fielded calls from investors curious about how their money was being managed, knowing that the trades he told them about were entirely fictitious. DiPascali is the second person involved in the Madoff scheme to land behind bars as a result of the fraud. -- Frank DiPascali, formerly the finance chief at Bernard Madoff's investment advisory business, pleaded guilty in federal court in Manhattan on Tuesday to 10 charges including securities fraud and international money laundering. That set the stage for a dramatic statement from DiPascali about his history at Madoff's firm, his personal relationship with Madoff, and the mechanics of a multibillion-dollar Ponzi scheme for which Madoff was convicted in June. Prosecutors told the judge they believed remanding DiPascali would impede the "efficiency" of their Madoff investigation.
