Spearheaded by France in the days of post-war shortages, the Common Agricultural Policy saw the then European Community granted the power to subsidize exports to give non-EU countries. Two decades after the Iron curtain shut out the EU's goods completely, Russia is now the bloc's second largest consumer of foodstuffs after the U.S., taking $15.8 billion of foodstuffs annually. But it's not just Russia's retaliatory sanctions that have the propensity to cause discord among EU members. They would be measures designed to hit different EU countries in different ways -- pitting their individual economic interests against their supposed common goals. Russia is already making a show of seeking new food suppliers like Brazil to make up the shortfall.
