-- Prosecutor Jack Mallard was waiting for the moment Wayne Williams, on trial in the Atlanta child murders case, would take the witness stand in his own defense. " Under cross-examination, Williams blew up at the prosecutor, saying, "You must be a fool," and then telling Mallard, "You want the real Wayne Williams? Now in his mid-70s, Mallard was a prosecutor for 40 years, winning a number of Atlanta's highest profile trials: a drug-dealing lawyer who had his wife murdered in front of their own children to silence her; a woman who poisoned two paramours with anti-freeze. While Williams was convicted only of killing two adults whose bodies were found downstream from the river bridge where police spotted him, Mallard believes Williams was responsible for many more deaths during two years of terror in the city. In retirement, living on a lake north of Atlanta, Mallard has written his own book on the Atlanta child murders, subtitled "The Night Stalker."
