If Jackson is buried in Forest Lawn, that won't stop fans and grave hunters from trying to sneak in, says Karen Fogarty, a paralegal from the San Fernando Valley area in California and an occasional celebrity grave hunter. The 48-year-old education administrator began searching for celebrity graves in the early 1970s. Since then, she's visited hundreds of celebrity resting places in Southern California. A private gathering for the pop icon was held Tuesday at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Hollywood Hills, California. Forest Lawn Memorial Park remains one of the most exclusive Hollywood burial sites.
