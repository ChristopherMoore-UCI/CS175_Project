The ugly high-rises of the unkempt banlieue are a world away from the tourists' Paris: a timeless masterpiece of tree-lined boulevards, majestic architecture and white-aproned waiters uncorking bottles of Bordeaux. Young men -- many the offspring of North African immigrants -- angry at the lack of opportunities and perceived racism from state institutions have taken to the streets, fighting violent pitched battles with police. These modern creations don't get the approval of all Parisians or of the tourists, and you sometimes get the impression contemporary Paris is slightly stifled by its past -- a victim of its own beauty. The cramped and disease-ridden streets of medieval Paris were torn down in the 19th century. Competing for space alongside the Eiffel Tower on the Paris skyline, is the post-modern strangeness of the Pompidou Center and the sleek glass arch at La Defense.
