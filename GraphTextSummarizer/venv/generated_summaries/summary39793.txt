Outgoing Iowa Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin, who said just a few weeks ago that Republican Senate candidate Joni Ernst was "wrong for the state of Iowa," has changed his tune. Asked for advice he would give Ernst as he concludes his 40-year career in Washington, Harkin said "if you want to be a good senator, when you come here, forget about the headlines, learn the rules, try to get on good committees, and think about the long term -- about what you can do for your state, for Iowa, in the long term because things don't happen overnight around here. "I think she has the potential to be one, yes," Harkin told reporters in typical "Iowa nice" fashion on Capitol Hill, when asked if Ernst would be a good senator. Harkin, who was an ardent supporter of Democratic Congressman Bruce Braley in the race to succeed him, sees promise in Ernst as she prepares to represent the Hawkeye state for the next six years. Harkin did reach out to Ernst on election night to congratulate her for running a "great campaign" but didn't offer any other details.
