Post-election Russia will look remarkably similar to pre-election Russia, according to CNN's Fareed Zakaria, because Putin was already pulling most of the strings during Medvedev's four-year presidency. While Putin warned during the election campaign that Putin 2.0 would look a lot like Putin 1.0, expert Richard Sakwa says there is significant political change on the horizon in Russia. -- Prime Minister Vladimir Putin says he has won Russia's presidential election, restoring the former KGB officer to the office he held for eight years before term limits forced him to step down in 2008. Putin's official return to the helm comes at a time where Russia has found itself at odds with much of the Western world due to its support for Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria and its rejection of further U.S. and EU sanctions against Iran for its nuclear activities -- and Sakwa doesn't expect that to change anytime soon. While the West has long tried to delegitimize his policies and regime, Sakwa says Putin has always been careful not to let Russia become a new Soviet Union-style anti-Western bloc.
