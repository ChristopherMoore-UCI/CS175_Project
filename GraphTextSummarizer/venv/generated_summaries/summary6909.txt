-- President Obama said Monday that federal officials are "gathering up facts" to help ensure that embattled oil giant BP fairly compensates people and businesses suffering losses. Speaking at a Coast Guard staging facility in Theodore, Alabama, Obama said he hopes to hammer out with top BP officials Wednesday a new structure for processing claims so that they "are dealt with justly, fairly, promptly." The president plans to push BP to create a BP-funded escrow account that will pay for damage claims from the oil spill, said David Axelrod, a senior adviser to Obama. Obama is scheduled to meet with BP executives in person at the White House on Wednesday. Obama will talk about the oil-leak containment strategy, the reorganization of minerals management at the Department of the Interior and the beginning of a process to restore the Gulf to a place better than it was before the Deepwater Horizon exploded, a senior administration official said.
