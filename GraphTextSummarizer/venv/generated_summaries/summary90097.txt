There have been reports of attacks on property and sources said demonstrators in Sohar have blocked routes to the port and the industrial zone, prompting port staff to leave work. There have been protests recently in the key port city of Sohar and other places this week, and one person was killed on Monday. Oman's public prosecutors cited the setting of fires, damaging public and private property, blocking roads and impeding traffic flow in the city of Sohar and other locations. Protesters' demands include greater freedom of expression, higher salaries, a clampdown on government corruption, a new constitution, and the prosecution of security officials whose actions led to the death of demonstrators. The news agency said Saturday that Sultan Waboos bin Said replaced three high-level government figures.
