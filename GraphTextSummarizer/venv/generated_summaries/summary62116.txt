This is Vickers' top five list, but he's quick to point out that it's only five locations, and he loves exploring new places, cultures, experiences and of course, thrills. That's certainly the case for NASCAR driver Brian Vickers. No. 4 on Vickers' list strays a little from the other favorites, but it feeds into two more of his passions: food and history. In fact, CNN caught up with Vickers on a recent trip to Atlanta to promote Atlanta Motor Speedway. When not behind the wheel of the No. 83 car in the Sprint Cup Series, Vickers is known as a bit of a daredevil: an avid skydiver, spear fisherman and scuba diver, to name a few of his extracurricular actives.
