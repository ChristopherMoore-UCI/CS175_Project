-- British journalist Paul Martin was released without charge Thursday, a month after Hamas officials arrested him in Gaza, his lawyer and the British Foreign Office said. Palestinian journalists are subject to various forms of restriction and intimidation by authorities in Gaza, but Martin's case was the first time Hamas had arrested a foreign journalist. Officials from Hamas, the Islamic militant group that rules Gaza, suggested at the time of Martin's arrest that he had been communicating with a Palestinian affiliated with the rival Fatah movement and whom Hamas had accused of collaboration with Israel. Ahmed Yousef, an adviser to Hamas Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh, said the decision to release Martin was made as a "good will gesture" and was in response to the many calls they had received to let him go. Before Hamas took over Gaza in 2007, the kidnapping and abduction of foreign journalists was a frequent occurrence as part of the factional warfare in the territory.
