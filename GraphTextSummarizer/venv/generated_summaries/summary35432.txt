It must be noted, however, that few countries have the same natural resources for music as Cape Verde. "We try to invite lots of producers and a lot of journalists from around the world to see the festival and the musicians from Cape Verde," said Jose Da Silva, long time manager of the late Cape Verdean songstress Cesaria Evora. Bereft of oil, gas, gold, diamonds or the conventional natural resources that have fueled growth in many other African countries, Cape Verde has had to look for alternative sectors to aid its development. "Besides fish, it is pretty common (for Cape Verde) to say 'our biggest richness is in music and culture,'" said Christine Semba of Womex, an international networking platform for the world music genre. Da Silva is one of the driving forces behind AME as well as being the founder of the Lusafrica and Harmonia record labels that aim to discover a new generation of artists from Cape Verde.
