Investigators determined that the fire was sparked after an aspen tree knocked down by strong winds struck a power line and caught fire, said New Mexico State Forester Tony Delfin. -- New Mexico homeowners who were evacuated more than a week ago will be allowed to return home Tuesday, fire officials said. It had burned thousands of acres on the Santa Clara Indian Reservation and had spread onto the Bandelier National Monument, home to ancient Pueblo homes, rock paintings and petroglyphs, fire officials said. On Monday, more than 2,100 firefighters were battling the wildfire that was still threatening hundreds of buildings and ancient sites on Indian lands in northern New Mexico. The fire has engulfed much of the Santa Fe National Forest, the Valles Caldera National Preserve and Bandelier National Park.
