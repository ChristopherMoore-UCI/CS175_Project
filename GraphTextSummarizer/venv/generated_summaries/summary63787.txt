"We are committed to building features that improve the experience of discovering and participating in conversations about things happening in the world right now, including entertainment, sports, politics and news," Justin Osofsky, Facebook's vice president for media partnerships and online operations, wrote in a blog post. Facebook says it has begun discussions with other media partners and marketing developers and will make the tools available to more partners in the coming weeks. "If there is something interesting going on, people are talking about it on Facebook," he wrote. -- CNN is among a handful of news outlets partnering with Facebook on a feature that will help share data about what users are talking about on the social network. So, for example, it could be used to show how quickly new references to "Syria" were appearing on Facebook during coverage of the conflict there.
