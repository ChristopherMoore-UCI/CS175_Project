-- A group of killer whales that had been trapped beneath ice and in danger of dying in Canada's Hudson Bay have not been seen Thursday, authorities said. "We're in a stand-down mode, but we're still ready to go if needed," said Ray Lee, the president of Kasco Marine, which helped save whales in a celebrated rescue in 1988. Inukjuak Town Manager Johnny Williams said shifting wind patterns overnight allowed the ice to break as the 11 whales struggled to stay alive. In that incident, three gray whales were trapped in ice near Barrow, Alaska. Williams said emergency crews redrew plans for deployment.
