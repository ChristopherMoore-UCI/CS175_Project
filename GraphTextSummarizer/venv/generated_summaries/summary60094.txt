The six-party talks involve South Korea, North Korea, China, Japan, Russia and the United States. Kim met with Chinese President Hu Jintao in Changchun, capital of northeast China's Jilin Province, on Friday, the state-run Xinhua news agency of China reported Monday. Kim said he hoped for an early resumption of six-party talks to ease tension between North and South Korea, the news agency reported. Kim's visit to China was seen as related to his anticipated transfer of power to his son, Kim Jong-un, the Yonhap news agency of South Korea reported last week. On Monday, the state-run Xinhua news agency quoted Kim as saying that North Korea "is not willing to see tensions on the peninsula."
