Nine former administrators of the Drug Enforcement Administration wrote Holder to criticize the department's decision not to challenge laws in Colorado and Washington state, which are allowing legal recreational use of marijuana after voter-approved ballot measures. Buoyed by the Justice Department's move and by public polls showing increasing voter support, pro-marijuana activists are now looking to the ballot box to legalize marijuana in more states. -- A group of former top counternarcotics officials are taking on Attorney General Eric Holder over the Justice Department's decision to soften its stance on marijuana legalization. The federal government still classifies marijuana as one of the most dangerous substances, and it remains illegal under federal law. More than two dozen other states and the District of Columbia allow medicinal use of marijuana.
