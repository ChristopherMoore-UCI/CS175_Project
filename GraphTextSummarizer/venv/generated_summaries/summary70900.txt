In short, conservative House Republicans don't think they get enough of it from President Barack Obama and the Senate. In particular, they want to halt the pattern of the Republican-led House being forced to accede to the will of Obama and the Democratic-led Senate, as occurred in the past year over emergency funding in response to Superstorm Sandy and when Congress voted to raise tax rates on high-income Americans despite a conservative pledge against any tax increases. " Now, House conservatives take umbrage with the heated rhetoric from Obama and Reid as frustration has risen with the government shutdown. " Obama, however, said Stutzman's comment reflected "reckless" tactics by House Republicans pursuing a purely partisan agenda instead of fulfilling the basic responsibility of Congress to fund the government. "Put it on the floor and let every individual member of Congress make up their own minds, and they can show the American people are you for a shutdown or not," Obama said, adding that House Republicans need to stop what he called careening from crisis to crisis instead of fulfilling their congressional responsibilities.
