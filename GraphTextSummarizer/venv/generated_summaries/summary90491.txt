IDF soldiers are prohibited from posting classified information online, including photographs of military interests. The Israel Defense Forces called off a raid after one of its combat soldiers posted information about the operation, including the time and place, on Facebook, the IDF said Wednesday. "The division commander decided to cancel the operation out of concern that the information had reached hostile groups and would harm IDF forces," it said. "On Wednesday, we are cleaning up (the village). The post was removed after other soldiers in the company saw it online and reported it to their commanders, IDF said.
