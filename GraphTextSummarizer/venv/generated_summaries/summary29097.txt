Denise Richard underwent surgery for an injury to her brain, and Martin's 6-year-old sister lost her leg, CNN affiliate WHDH reported. On Tuesday at the Richard home, a 10-year-old girl who went to school with Martin came by with her mother. After early reports conflicted about whether William Richard ran the marathon, a family spokesperson told CNN Tuesday afternoon that he was a spectator. "My dear son Martin has died from injuries sustained in the attack on Boston," Richard said in a statement Tuesday. Almost a year ago, 8-year-old Martin Richard wrote four simple words on a sign at school.
