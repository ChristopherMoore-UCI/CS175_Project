Amid ominous economic forecasts and repeated bleak reports about America's financial future, messages of hope can be hard to come by. The clever expressions, presented on backdrops meant to look like lined notepad paper, can be found on digital billboards, traditional billboards and posters. New billboards offer upbeat messages to get people to stay positive during the recession. The economic "lessons," which include such catchphrases such as "self worth beats net worth," and "stop obsessing about the economy, you're scaring the children," started going up in May and now number around 2,000 postings across the country, according to Jeff Golimowski of the Outdoor Advertising Association of America. Members of the OAAA donated printing, materials and billboard space, while a private anonymous donor paid for the campaign's design, Golimowski said.
