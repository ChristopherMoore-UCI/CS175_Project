Last month, two doctors at Madigan Army Medical Center were removed from clinical duties and assigned to administrative work, the Seattle Times newspaper reported, citing Army Medical Command officials. Last month, Army officials said the forensic psychiatric review process at the base's Madigan Army Medical Center was itself being reviewed. The incident shocked U.S. officials and prompted outrage in Afghanistan and has fueled fears of intensified anger against U.S. troops in Afghanistan that erupted in deadly riots last month over the inadvertent burning of Qurans by American troops. Army Medical Command told the Times it has "initiated a top-to-bottom review of the process associated with the forensic psychiatric reviews conducted at Madigan Army Medical Center." U.S. Sen. Patty Murray told the Times that the two included Dr. William Keppler, a retired Army officer who leads a forensic psychiatric team responsible for assessing the post-traumatic stress disorder diagnoses of soldiers under consideration for medical retirement.
