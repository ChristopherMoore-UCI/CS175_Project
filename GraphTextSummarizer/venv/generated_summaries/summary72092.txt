Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, R-New Hampshire inquired about but what kind of "buy in" the men in Arab Spring countries are giving to equal rights for women? -- As portions of the Arab world struggle to extinguish decades of oppression and dictorial rule, the rights and opportunities for women in these societies stand at a delicate precipice, U.S. State Department officials told a Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee Wednesday. With the implementation of democracy and universal rights, Wittes said the rising Arab population of young men and women can push back against the narrative of extremists in their societies. "Certainly, if women cannot freely worship and are being threatened with murder their human rights are not being duly respected," he said, and questioned the role of women in Libya in light of recent calls by Libya's National Transitional Council to enact Islamic law in the country. "This is not a favor to women, it is not simply a nice thing to do," Melanne Verveer, Ambassador-at-Large for Global Women's Issues, said at a hearing called to examine the role of women in the aftermath of the Arab Spring.
