The start of the final Test, which England needed to win to stay top of the rankings, was overshadowed by claims that key batsman Kevin Pietersen sent negative texts about his teammates to their South African rivals. Bairstow, called in to replace Pietersen, made 95 in the first innings and he again impressed with a quickfire 54 off 47 deliveries faced in his second knock before being bowled by spinner Imran Tahir. "We are in receipt of Kevin's apology, but further discussions need to take place to establish whether it is possible to regain the trust and mutual respect required to ensure all parties are able to focus on playing cricket and to maintain the unity of purpose that has served us so well in recent years," said ECB managing director Hugh Morris. South Africa-born Trott was the next to go with the score on 146 as he fell to pace bowler Dale Steyn for the second time in the match, on this occasion succumbing to a superb diving catch at second slip by Jacques Kallis as he posted 63 off 159 balls. Ian Bell and James Taylor both fell for four as England crumbled to 45-4, but Jonathan Trott and Jonny Bairstow added 89 for the fifth wicket to revive faint hopes of victory.
