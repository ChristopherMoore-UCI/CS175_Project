"Babies are not spared; adults are not spared; mothers are not spared; sisters are not spared." Despite the escalating violence and the loss of its clinic, KOFAVIV regrouped to help victims in Haiti's "tent city" camps, where about 500,000 people still live today. " Accurate numbers are difficult, if not impossible, to find in the aftermath of such devastation, but KOFAVIV and other groups say they have seen a definite increase in rape cases after the January 2010 earthquake. Even before the quake, she says, rape was an issue in Haiti, historically underreported because of social stigma, retaliation from perpetrators and a lack of legal support.

When the earthquake hit Haiti, KOFAVIV's founders watched their clinic and their offices collapse along with their homes.
