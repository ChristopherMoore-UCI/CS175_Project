"Americans always believe things are better in their own lives than in the rest of the country," said CNN polling director Keating Holland. "There is a tiny sliver of good news -- the number of Americans who think things are going very badly has dropped from 40 percent in December to 32 percent now," Holland added. Seventy-three percent of those questioned in a CNN/Opinion Research Corporation survey released Monday say they're very or somewhat scared about the way things are going in the United States. -- A new national poll indicates that nearly three out of four Americans are scared about the way things are going in the country today. The survey also says that three out of four Americans are angry about the way things are going in the country.
