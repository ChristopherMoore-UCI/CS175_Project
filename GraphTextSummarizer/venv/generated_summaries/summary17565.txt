Gary Cohen leads the agency that made many of the rules for the Affordable Care Act and established the Marketplaces, where Americans can buy health insurance through Obamacare, including Healthcare.gov, according to a statement Wednesday announcing his departure. The CCIIO is also responsible for implementing measures concerning private health insurance. February saw 700,000 new enrollments, and to meet its goal, Obamacare would have to garner a record monthly number of new enrollees. Rep. Ann Wagner, R-Missouri, cited a "quietly-released report" from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the agency over the CCIIO, that claimed 11 million people would face higher premiums because of the healthcare law. With this year's goal for enrollment in Obamacare seemingly out of grasp and the President under renewed partisan attack over the program, an official key to implementing it has resigned.
