Officials say they value Johnson's bringing attention to the disaster because some residents simply don't know what would happen if they told authorities about their lack of running water. What began as a mission of charity by Donna Johnson, a retiree, is now a well-publicized relief effort, inspiring businesses and others to donate bottled water. With one jug of water in each arm, Johnson moves at a frantic pace through the dust and often 100-degree heat to deliver drinking water to as many people as possible, as fast as she can. It's really hard," 17-year-old Sandra Tapia said as Johnson delivered water. She started by buying bottled water with her own money and delivering it to a list of people -- which just kept getting longer.
