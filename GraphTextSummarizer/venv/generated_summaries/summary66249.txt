The low pressure system that brought snow the Midwest and below freezing temperatures deep into the South was centered in Canada north of Maine late Monday. -- The main thrust of a raging storm that dumped snow in parts of the Midwest over the weekend moved north of the border Monday, but the United States will still feel some of its effects in the form of rain, snow or frigid temperatures. The roof collapsed under the weight of snow, forcing the NFL to delay Sunday's scheduled Vikings game against the New York Giants until Monday night and to move it to Detroit. By late Sunday night, sheets of ice, many large ice chunks and snow remained frozen on the field. Minneapolis Public Schools called off classes for Monday as a result of heavy snows and dangerously cold temperatures.
