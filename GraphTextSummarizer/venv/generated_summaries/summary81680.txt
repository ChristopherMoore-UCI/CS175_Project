"Ironically Facebook could be dealing [with] the same problem with public scrutiny after the IPO as most of us do when deciding what to post on Facebook," wrote user Mark Glaser. Facebook earned $1 billion last year on sales of $3.7 billion. He even encouraged users to take their case to CEO Mark Zuckerberg. And we don't see Facebook being sold for a paltry $35 million -- as Myspace was last year -- anytime soon. And that's the number that had user Phillip Pambrun thinking that maybe Facebook should spread the wealth a little.
