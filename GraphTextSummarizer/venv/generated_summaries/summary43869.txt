St. Louis County police said protesters hurled bottles of "what appears to be urine" at them. -- It was freezing, wet and a busy travel day before a holiday, but a few dozen protesters showed up outside police headquarters in Ferguson on Wednesday night. "We were perhaps not optimistic, but we were at least hopeful we would have a better night," said St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar. Also Wednesday, Ferguson police were looking for clues as to who stole an AR-15 that was locked in a rack plucked from a police car that was torched by rioters this week. Also Tuesday, St. Louis police identified a man who was found shot to death and set on fire.
