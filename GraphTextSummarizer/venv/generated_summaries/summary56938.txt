But even without autopsies, military prosecutors have been able to present evidence at previous trials establishing cause of death. Prosecutors have faced that problem in several of the cases growing out of incidents like this in Iraq and Afghanistan," said Neil Puckett who in his 20 years as a Marine, worked as defense counsel, prosecutor and a military trial judge. But that could present one of many challenges military prosecutors will have in making a case against the alleged shooter, U.S. Army Staff Sergeant Robert Bales. To prove someone caused a person's death, prosecutors need a cause of death. And although you don't have the body, you present evidence depicting the wounds and the dead body and you present these to a prosecution witness (and) a doctor, and the doctor testifies these wounds would unequivocally would result in death," Solis said.
