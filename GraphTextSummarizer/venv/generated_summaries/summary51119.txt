LONDON, England  -- Models younger than 16 should be banned from catwalks during London Fashion Week over fears that some girls are developing eating disorders because of their work in the industry, fashion experts have recommended. However, they want more information on whether a minimum body mass index (BMI) requirement of 18.5 should be introduced for London Fashion Week models. It called on the British Fashion Council which owns and runs London Fashion Week to develop new best-practice standards for model agencies. During the inquiry, panel members heard from many models who described the fear of not being selected for work because they were not thin enough, according to Panel chairwoman Baroness Kingsmill, the UK's Press Associated reported. Recent controversy over skinny models was sparked in August 2006, when Uruguayan model Luisel Ramos, 22, died of heart failure after not eating for several days.
