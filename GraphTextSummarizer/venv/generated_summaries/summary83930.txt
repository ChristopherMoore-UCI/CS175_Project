Day shades: Chanel Rouge Hydrabase in Pink Sugar, $25; Laura Mercier in Candy Pink, ($22). Day shades: Benefit Silky Finish in Candy Store, $16; Givenchy Rouge Interdit in Secret Pink, $26. We'll show you how to apply lipstick perfectly, along with the most flattering shades for day and night. Melissa Silver uses fuchsia on cool skin tones and peachy nude on warm ones for day. To avoid an unnaturally dark outline, use a shade that's lighter than your lipstick, like Revlon Colorstay lip liner in Plum ($8; at drugstores).
