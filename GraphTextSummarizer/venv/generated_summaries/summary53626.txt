Watch how LeCroy's Messages Project helps inmates connect to their children » LeCroy and volunteers have recorded roughly 3,000 video messages, stories, poems and wishes from inmates to their children and families. Watch LeCroy describe the personal experience that led her from marijuana to messages » "For many of the inmates, these videos are the first time they have taken responsibility and apologized to their kids, and the first step to establishing a bond that was lost when they went to jail," LeCroy says. Carolyn LeCroy started The Messages Project after seeing how a lack of family visits left other prisoners unhappy. "When I was in prison, and I would get visits, I would come back to the floor, and I would see the women who never got visits," LeCroy recalls. There, they recorded video messages with mothers to be mailed to their children and families as Christmas gifts.
