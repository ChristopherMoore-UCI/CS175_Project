The girl's stepmother, Elisa Baker, has been jailed on a charge of obstruction of justice after police said she admitted to writing a ransom note found at the family's Hickory, North Carolina, home. But Hickory Police Chief Tom Adkins said Tuesday authorities have been unable to find anyone outside Zahra's immediate family who has reported seeing her in the past month, and investigators are not sure how long she has actually been missing. -- Sheriff's deputies, police and firefighters began draining a pond Wednesday night as they resumed their search for the body of a missing 10-year-old North Carolina girl. North Carolina social services officials declined to comment on the case. Zahra's father, Adam Baker, frequently worked there hauling loads of wood and brush to be fed into a wood chipper and turned into mulch, witnesses said.
