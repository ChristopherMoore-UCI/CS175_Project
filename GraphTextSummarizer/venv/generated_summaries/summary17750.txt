While Mercedes enjoyed a fruitful preseason and took the checkered flag at Sunday's Australian Grand Prix through Nico Rosberg, Ferrari struggled by comparison. Alonso finished Sunday's race in fifth position, but he was elevated to fourth place after Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo -- who crossed the line in second -- was disqualified for breaching fuel flow regulations. Like every team on the grid, Ferrari has had to contend with a raft of regulation changes introduced by the sport's rule makers for the 2014 season -- including the introduction of 1.6-liter V6 hybrid engines. That's the view of technical director James Allison, who admits the legendary Italian marque is some way behind early pacesetters Mercedes, labeling Ferrari's performance in Sunday's opening race as "unacceptable." Double world champion Fernando Alonso was the team's highest-placed driver in fourth position, but the Spaniard finished over 30 seconds behind the victorious Rosberg.
