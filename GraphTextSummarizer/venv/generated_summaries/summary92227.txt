Below is a state-by-state summary of key parts of new gun laws that are in effect or will take effect this year: States that have loosened gun laws: Alabama: Residents can carry loaded guns in their vehicles to their workplace if they have a concealed-carry permit. In addition, police departments that conduct gun buyback programs to get guns off the street must sell the guns instead of destroying them. At least eight states -- including Arizona, where a 2011 mass shooting killed six people and left then-Rep. Gabrielle Giffords badly wounded -- have passed laws that exempt gun permits from public records. Those laws were largely in reaction to a suburban New York newspaper that published an online map pinpointing the addresses of people with gun permits. Maine: Names and other personal information of people with gun permits are no longer part of the public record.
