Parsons has traveled to Zimbabwe for several years, but only last year began hunting elephants at the request of local farmers, he said. Parsons said he killed the animal for the good of local farmers whose crops are often destroyed by elephants. Elephant experts say it is not illegal to kill rogue elephants in Zimbabwe. In a press release, PETA said it is pulling its business from GoDaddy.com, and the group labeled Parsons "Scummiest CEO of the Year." Meanwhile, asked if the PETA boycott had affected GoDaddy.com's business, company spokeswoman Elizabeth Driscoll said, "There has been no significant change in business." "It takes a guy like me" to protect villagers' crops from rogue elephants, he said.
