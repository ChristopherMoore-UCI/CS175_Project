Historically, Iraq hasn't always needed Shiite militias under Iran's command to fight Sunni extremists. Sunnis willing to fight ISIS should be given control over their own affairs in northern Iraq in the way that Kurdish aspirations have been accommodated. The growing fear among many Sunnis has been compounded by Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi's statement to parliament that any Iraqi choosing to stay neutral was effectively aligning themselves with ISIS -- remarks that create an atmosphere that enables violence against ordinary Sunnis, many of whom feel caught between the extremists and a Shiite-led government from which they have been systematically oppressed and alienated. That simply emboldened then-Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki to deepen his purge of Sunni elected representatives, and to parlay the 2010 election result into a governing coalition despite his own list drawing fewer votes than a rival bloc that included many Sunni leaders. All this suggests that the "Awakening" experience, which showed that Iraqi Sunnis will reject violent extremists if they believe they will get a fair shake from the system for doing so, is as vital as ever to the prospects of defeating ISIS.
