"To go into deep space, to asteroids, the Moon and Mars, governments will have to foot the bill initially, but the possibilities are immense and there is a very exciting future for humans in space," he said. "To help this low-cost approach happen, purely private space tourism spacecraft companies will offer affordable flights to space, with Virgin Galactic's SS2 and the XCOR Lynx going sub-orbit in the next two years. The end of the Cold War led to the end of the space race -- governments no longer had to prove their nation's technical superiority in space. Space tourism and small payloads have very different launch requirements that are best satisfied by new systems -- like Virgin Galactic's Spaceship 2 and XCOR's Lynx spaceplanes. Another important factor of space exploration is in its relations with the dual areas of education and outreach.
