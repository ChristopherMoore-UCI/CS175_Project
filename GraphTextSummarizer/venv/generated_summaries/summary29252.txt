Hardy had no problem saying, "Morons dehumanized it," when asked about his views on public distaste of the Ed Hardy brand. At its height, Ed Hardy clothing could be seen on celebrities from Madonna and Catherine Zeta Jones to cast members of "Jersey Shore" and Jon Gosselin of the "Jon and Kate Plus 8" reality show. So why would people buy something "fromage-y" like Ed Hardy apparel? This could explain why there's a "Hating people who wear Ed Hardy" Facebook group with more than 1,800 members, and a Funnyordie.com sketch titled "The Ed Hardy Boyz" with less-than-likeable characters who go on misadventures to protect the Ed Hardy brand name from rival clothing lines. French fashion businessman Christian Audigier came across the shirts and approached Hardy to do a licensing deal that would make him "a global phenomenon," Hardy wrote in the book.
