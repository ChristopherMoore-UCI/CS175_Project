Gay couples have marriage equality in all corners of the world, not just in liberal Scandinavian nations such as Denmark and Norway, but also in Latin America -- in Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay -- and as far away as South Africa and New Zealand. It is excellent news for the cause of freedom and equality around the globe, and not just for gay people. -- America's right place is at the vanguard of the quest for freedom and equality. A country that stands on the side of freedom and equality is inevitably a country on the right side of history. The country was founded on that principle, as a nation whose very identity is built on equal rights and true freedom for its citizens.
