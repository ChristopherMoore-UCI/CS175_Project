"Just about anybody that's heavily tattooed, if they don't have it already, [a mom tattoo] is definitely on their list of things to get," said tattoo artist Alan Flores, who works out of 13 Roses Tattoo Parlour in Atlanta. Once you've got your mom ink, be sure to share the love and show off your design on CNN iReport. In cultures from ancient Egyptian to Polynesian, they've served as medicine, rite of passage, good-luck charm, punishment, decoration, religious, political or status symbol, and, of course, tribute to a loved one. "I've done plenty of mom tattoos with banners around hearts," said Flores. In Flores' experience, people usually get mom or dad tattoos as memorials for a parent after they've passed away.
