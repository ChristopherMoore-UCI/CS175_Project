I'm not one of those crazy Trekkies -- you know, those fanatics who go to Star Trek conventions and own all kinds of preciously cheesy Star Trek memorabilia. And, of course, there's my official first-grade school portrait, taken in a green Star Trek uniform (little known fact: the yellow uniforms made famous by Captain Kirk originally were green but took on a more golden hue on camera). And, somewhere in my mom's attic, an original hardbound edition of "Star Fleet Technical Manual," which contains the schematics of every class of starship in the Federation, as well as the color schemes and insignia for all Star Fleet uniforms. Today in American life, when we are divided along so many chasms of race, class, faith and ideology, when it's becoming more challenging than ever to sustain a cohesive sense of shared identity, we should remember two lessons from "Star Trek." "Star Trek" showed me a way of being -- of being American -- that was about inclusion without assimilation.
