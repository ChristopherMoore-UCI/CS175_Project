'Inactivists' to San Francisco: Ban circumcision "While we are confident that the overwhelming majority of San Franciscans would have voted to defeat this extreme measure and are grateful for the outpouring of support from every sector of the community, we believe the right decision was made in the right venue," said Abby Michelson Porth, associate director of Jewish Community Relations Council. Circumcising our son -- how do we decide? "To remove an initiative before it comes on ballot is an extraordinarily irregular thing to do," said Lloyd Schofield, who is part of a Bay Area advocacy group that says the surgery violates human rights and likens it to "male genital mutilation. -- San Francisco residents will not be voting on whether male circumcisions should be banned in the city this fall. Superior Court Judge Loretta Giorgi wrote that male circumcision is "a widely practiced medical procedure" and that medical services are left to the regulation of the state, not individual cities. The measure proposed banning male circumcisions with the penalty of jail time or a $1,000 fine.
