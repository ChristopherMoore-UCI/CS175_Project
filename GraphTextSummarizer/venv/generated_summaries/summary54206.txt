The only other time Chicago police took the step of designating a Public Enemy No. 1 was in 1930, when it targeted Al Capone. -- Last winter, the Chicago Crime Commission and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration named Mexican billionaire Guzman Loera the city's "Public Enemy No. 1." Today, suspected drug lords like Guzman and Zeta cartel boss Miguel Ãƒ Also known as "Shorty," Guzman heads the world's largest narcotics operation, the infamous Sinaloa cartel, and allegedly pushes 1,500 to 2,000 kilograms of cocaine through Chicago each month. The head of the city's DEA's office, Jack Riley, says the Sinaloa cartel causes so much havoc in Chicago that Guzman deserves the title.
