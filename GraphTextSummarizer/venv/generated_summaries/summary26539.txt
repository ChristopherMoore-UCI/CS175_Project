Protesters in Bangkok have been calling for months for the ouster of  Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra, who they allege is a puppet of her billionaire brother, the deposed, exiled former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra. Long-simmering tensions exploded anew in Ukraine on Tuesday as clashes between police and anti-government protesters left more than 25 people dead and the capital's central square on fire. Deadly violence erupted in the heart of Bangkok on Tuesday as anti-government protesters clashed with police, and the country's anti-corruption commission filed charges against the Prime Minister. Many in the opposition have called for the ouster of President Viktor Yanukovych and the ordering of new elections. In November, thousands spilled onto the streets after Yanukovych did a U-turn over a trade pact with the European Union that had been years in the making -- with Yanukovych favoring closer relations with Russia instead.
