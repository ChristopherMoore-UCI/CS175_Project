"I call on the Somali-American community not to send their youth to Somalia to fight alongside al-Shabaab," President Sheik Sharif Ahmed said on Sunday. According to several witness accounts, AMISOM -- the African Union Mission to Somalia -- supported government forces to push back al-Shabaab as the militia attacked the presidential palace. The president's call came after fresh fighting erupted Sunday between Somalia's transitional government forces and Islamist rebels. The transitional government has struggled to establish authority, challenged by Islamist groups that have seized control of Mogadishu and much of the south. The United Nations estimates that more than 200,000 people have been forced to flee Mogadishu since the latest round of fighting began in early May between the government and the Al-Shabaab and Hisb-ul-Islam groups.
