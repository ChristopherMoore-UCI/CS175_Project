A report Friday on the Web site of Iran's state-run Press TV did not contain any responses from Iranian officials. "For two decades, the Alavi Foundation's affairs have been directed by various Iranian officials, including Iranian ambassadors to the United Nations, in violation of a series of American laws. The mosques -- in New York, Maryland, California and Texas -- just happen to be among the tenants of the buildings in question, the official said. When a CNN reporter arrived at one of the seized mosques -- in Queens, a New York City borough -- he found it to be operating normally. "As today's complaint alleges in great detail, the Alavi Foundation has effectively been a front for the government of Iran," Preet Bharara, U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, said on Thursday.
