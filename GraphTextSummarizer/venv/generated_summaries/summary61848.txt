Police patrols have been stepped up near east Texas churches, while in some cases, church members are staying at their churches to protect them or patrolling churches themselves. The two latest fires in a string of church blazes in east Texas have been ruled arson, bringing the total of deliberately-set fires to 10, authorities said Thursday. There is no clear theme linking the fires, which have struck churches of different denominations, including Baptist, Methodist and Church of Christ Scientist, on different days of the week and at different times of the day, Crowley has said. A large brass cross that hung over the church's choir loft was recently found, church member Kay Crosby told CNN. Fires destroyed Dover Baptist Church and Clear Spring Missionary Baptist Church on Monday night.
