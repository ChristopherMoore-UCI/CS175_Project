Days of heavy rain had triggered flash floods and landslides around Machu Picchu, the ruins of an Incan settlement in southern Peru's Andes Mountains. Machu Picchu is an ancient city on a mountain in the Andes, standing 8,000 feet (2,430 meters) above sea level in a tropical mountain forest. Known as the "Lost City of the Incas," Machu Picchu attracts tens of thousands of international tourists every year. The floods closed roads, bridges and rail lines, stranding tourists from around the world in the small town closest to the ruins. The Peruvian government declared a state of emergency in two regions around Machu Picchu -- Cusco and Apurimac.
