The senior official said the U.S. believes that the bin Laden compound was in effect a command and control center for al Qaeda because the confiscated materials "clearly show that bin Laden remained an active leader in al Qaeda, providing strategic, operational and tactical instructions to the group. "We expect to learn more how bin Laden communicated, who he communicated with and how often he did it, what guidance did he pass on, what questions were passed on, how he operated, how he ran al Qaeda and what did other people expect from bin Laden," said the official. A senior U.S. intelligence official said Saturday that the materials seen so far appeared to show that bin Laden had a "continuing interest in transportation and infrastructure targets." Though separated from many al Qaeda members who are located in more remote areas of the region, he was far from a figurehead." The initial review of the materials confiscated from Osama bin Laden's compound in Pakistan has found mostly "aspirational" planning but has yielded "real intelligence," according to a U.S. official.
