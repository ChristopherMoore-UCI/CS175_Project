-- Michaele Salahi, best known for crashing a White House state dinner with her husband last year, suffers from multiple sclerosis, according to a new book released Wednesday. " The Virginia couple slipped through White House security and shook hands with President Barack Obama in November despite not being on the guest list for a state dinner for the prime minister of India. They also had their pictures taken with Vice President Joe Biden and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. However, according to the book, the 44-year-old has suffered from multiple sclerosis for nearly 17 years. Multiple sclerosis is a potentially debilitating disease in which the body's immune system eats away at the protective sheath that covers the nerves.
