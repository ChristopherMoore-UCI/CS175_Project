-- South Sudanese government forces have recaptured the key town of Bor from rebels after fierce fighting, the town's mayor said Saturday. South Sudan seceded from Sudan in 2011 after decades of war. U.N. Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights Ivan Simonovic warned Friday, at the end of a four-day visit to South Sudan, that one month of fighting had "set South Sudan back a decade. Speaking Wednesday at a summit of the International Conference of the Great Lakes Region in Angola, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni said some of his country's troops were fighting alongside South Sudanese government forces, the Sudan People's Liberation Army. The conflict has forced many South Sudanese to flee their homes.
