The report will likely kick off a fight next year between Democrats and Republicans over redistricting, as states gaining or losing seats will have to draw new districts. But even most states which are assigned the same number of House seats may redraw the boundaries of their congressional districts to make each one roughly equal when it comes to population. Its primary purpose is to determine how many people live in the United States and which states will gain congressional seats and electoral votes and which states will lose them. But Census population figures are also used to distribute federal funds to states and communities. An estimate by Election Data Services, a political consulting firm that specializes in redistricting, suggests that Texas will likely gain four congressional seats, with Florida adding as many as two, and Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, South Carolina, Utah, and Washington state possibly each gaining a seat.
