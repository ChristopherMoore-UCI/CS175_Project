HRW dismissed Putin's decision late last year to free jailed activists from the punk band Pussy Riot and environmental group Greenpeace, as well as Kremlin critic Mikhail Khodorkovsky as attempts to avoid international criticism ahead of the Winter Olympics. These are some of the trends in 2013 that Human Rights Watch (HRW) cited in its annual account of human rights records around the world on Tuesday. HRW expressed concern other governments, including those will a poor rights record, could follow the American example in surveillance, forcing "user data to stay within their own borders, setting up the potential for increased Internet censorship." "For the second time since the fall of (former leader Hosni) Mubarak in February 2011, a government is in power with little apparent inclination to limit itself by respecting basic rights," HRW said. HRW said international pressure on China over its human rights situation was "inconsistent" last year, saying that some countries, such as France and Britain, had toned down criticism in summits with the Chinese leadership.
