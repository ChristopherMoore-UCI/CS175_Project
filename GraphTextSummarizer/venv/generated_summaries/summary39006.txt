And heating is provided by geothermal power -- an abundant source in energy due to Iceland's geographical position sitting above two continental plates. Grimsson promotes the intelligent use of renewable energy resources and is providing world leaders with an invaluable insight into how their own economies might make the switch to more renewable sources of energy. Olafur Ragnar Grimsson Whilst Iceland still imports oil for its transport, electricity is generated from hydroelectric power.
