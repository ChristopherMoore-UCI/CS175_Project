Conceptually, this is simpler than Priority Inbox, since Gmail is only trying to sort messages into general categories rather than figure out which people are more important to you than others. It's good to see a major new Gmail feature debut in both old-school and mobile Gmail at the same time â€” and for a while, at least, this is going to be the Gmail inbox I'll use. -- Last week's rumor was the real deal: Google is rolling out a new Gmail inbox today which autosorts incoming messages so important stuff is easy to find and clutter stays out of the way. Instead of attempting to figure out which messages matter most to you and then promoting them to the top of your inbox, the new one sticks tabs across the top â€” up to five of them, for "Primary" messages (basically, ones from real people, plus anything else you haven't chosen to weed out), Social (stuff like Facebook and Twitter updates), Promotions (ads), Updates (bills, notifications, etc.) and Each tab indicates how many unread messages you've got in that category, so you can monitor incoming messages even if they don't pop up on your current tab.
