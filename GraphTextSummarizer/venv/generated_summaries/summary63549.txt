It's lurking like some deadly thing in the water which can take our children's lives and we all have to be aware," said Orange County Health Department Director Dr. Kevin Sherin. Speaking in Will's old bedroom, which Steve Sellars has decorated with photographs of his son, Sellars said he hopes he can help get the word out. Even if public lakes had been closed, private lakes would have remained open. As he investigates the deaths of the three boys from the amoeba, Sherin is concerned these type of deaths may be underreported. Very quickly, in from one to 14 days, the symptoms worsen, Sherin said.
