The violence occurred in Maiduguri, the capital of Borno, said Red Cross Borno secretary Mohammed Barma. -- A gubernatorial candidate in the northern Nigerian state of Borno was assassinated, and five police officers and the governor's brother were also killed in a gun attack outside a mosque Friday, said Borno state police commissioner Abubakar Mohammed. Three men on motorbikes gunned down leading Borno state gubernatorial candidate Modu Fannami Gubio of the All Nigeria People's Party, Mohammed said. Also killed were the Borno governor's younger brother, Goni Sherrif, and five plainclothes police officers, commissioner Mohammed said. In Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, more than 13,500 people have died in religious or ethnic clashes since the end of military rule in 1999, Human Rights Watch said in a report last year.
