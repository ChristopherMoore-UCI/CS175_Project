Southwell said the Atlanta airport will begin reprogramming employee badges to limit the number of points employees can enter secure areas of the airport. The day after a CNN investigation uncovered airport employees access airplanes and tarmacs without undergoing daily security screening, officials admitted that no one checks criminal backgrounds after workers are hired. Hatfield cited a 2008 study by the Homeland Security Institute that concluded random screening of airport employees proved nearly as effective as 100% screening, but he added an updated study could benefit current discussions. Katko questioned the logic of spending billions of dollars per year on passenger screening while not implementing similar security for employees. Miguel Southwell, the general manager of Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, where the breaches occurred, expressed support for implementing full screening of employees with access to secure areas of the Atlanta airport Tuesday, but he did not specify if and when this screening will begin.
