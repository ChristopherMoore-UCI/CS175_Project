"Dale Earnhardt's story is really the story of so many of the great drivers in NASCAR history, someone who came up really tough," said Daniel Pierce, head of the history department at the University of North Carolina-Asheville and author of "Real NASCAR: White Lightning, Red Clay and Big Bill France." Earnhardt, the son of dirt track campaigner Ralph Earnhardt, was a ninth-grade dropout, divorced twice before he was 30, a subsistence racer early in his career who took mill work and cleaned industrial boilers to keep himself fed. "Dale Earnhardt was to NASCAR what Elvis Presley was to rock-and-roll," said Larry McReynolds, Earnhardt's crew chief when he won his only Daytona 500 in 1998, and currently a racing broadcaster with Fox. Where Earnhardt would spar with media and NASCAR officials alike, Johnson's public presence is seamless. In the four years since NASCAR signed a multibillion-dollar media deal, average race viewership has fallen from 7.85 million at its height to 5.99 million last year, according to the Sports Business Journal. Losing Earnhardt this way was to NASCAR what losing Michael Jordan to a heart attack in mid-dunk would have been to the NBA.
