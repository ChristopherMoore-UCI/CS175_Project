The win also marked the first time Argentina has reached a World Cup semifinal since 1990, when -- after overcoming host nation Italy on penalties -- it was eventually defeated by West Germany in a bad-tempered final. -- If anyone wondered about Argentina's World Cup-winning credentials, surely there can be little doubt now. It was a fine instinctive finish from a man who had failed to find the net all tournament before this game, and it drew him level with Messi on five World Cup career goals. With genuinely top-class players such as Eden Hazard, Thibaut Courtois and Vincent Kompany in the squad, this was a quality of opposition Argentina had yet to face this tournament. But it was Argentina which came closest to scoring again, though Messi was unable to add to his 2014 tournament tally of four as the onrushing figure of Courtois blocked his dinked strike on the counter attack.
