For starters, the NFL's exhibition season was filled with gaffes, bloopers and worse than that involving its collection of replacement officials. The only silver (or shall we say black-and-white striped) lining is, the more the NFL uses replacement officials, the more folks will see the original ones were better than they thought. This doesn't apply just to NFL officials, but to those of the NBA, the NHL and even baseball umpires, who have been known to have a few nose-to-nose chats with managers and players. As for the short term, there is encouraging news for those who know replacement officials are just a ticking bomb waiting to explode with a slew of errors. In contrast, history hasn't been kind to replacement officials.
