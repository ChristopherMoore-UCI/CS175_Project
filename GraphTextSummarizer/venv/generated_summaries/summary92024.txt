Afghan President Hamid Karzai will decide when he will nominate replacements after meeting with his national security council on Sunday, a Karzai spokesman told CNN. The voting to dismiss Defense Minister Gen. Abdul Rahim Wardak and Interior Minister Gen. Besmillah Mohammadi was aired on national TV. NATO-led forces and Afghan government forces have been battling the Taliban and al Qaeda in the region for years. The Pakistani military has shelled Afghanistan several times this year, actions that have enraged Afghan authorities. There are militant strongholds on both sides of the Afghan-Pakistani border.
