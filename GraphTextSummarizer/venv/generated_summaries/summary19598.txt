Vivian said they viewed the Center For Democratic Renewal as "the political side" of  what they were doing with the SCLC, which was focused on the country's morality struggles during the civil rights movement. Bayard Rustin and Muhammad Ali have two things in common Rustin and Ali both were conscientious objectors to war who resisted the draft and were sentenced to federal prison as a result. Vivian is a civil rights leader who participated in the freedom rides, and Rustin was considered to be one of the masterminds behind the March on Washington.

Rustin persuaded boycott leaders to adopt complete nonviolence, teaching them Gandhian nonviolent direct protest."
