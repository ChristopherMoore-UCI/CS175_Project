And some Yemeni security experts argue that drone strikes have aided al Qaeda by turning peaceful tribal communities into vengeful killers. Intelligence reports had identified the targeted convoy as carrying al Qaeda militants, but the passengers were actually members of a wedding party, the officials said. The attacks are part of a joint U.S.-Yemeni campaign against al Qaeda, and Yemen's government is unlikely to approve any measure that would limit the use of unmanned aircraft, the government official said. The nearly unanimous but non-binding vote was "a strong warning" to both the United States and the government of Yemeni President Abdo Rabbo Mansour Hadi, a Yemeni government official told CNN. That anger was further stoked last week after what Yemeni security officials said was a U.S. attack in southwestern Yemen last week.
