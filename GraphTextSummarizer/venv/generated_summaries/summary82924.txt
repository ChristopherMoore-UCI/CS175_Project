State regulators sued Fairfield for misleading investors and acting as a feeder fund to Madoff's Ponzi scheme. "Rather than take Madoff's suggestion to conceal the call, Fairfield Greenwich executives did the opposite. "You know, you don't have to be too brilliant with these guys, because you don't have to be," Madoff said, referring to SEC investigators. They told the SEC about the call and answered all questions accurately." "Any implication that the Madoff call affected Fairfield's responses to the SEC is demonstrably false," the statement added. Authorities continue to unravel the far-reaching Ponzi scheme masterminded by Madoff that bankrupted some once-wealthy investors and forced many nonprofit groups and foundations to shut down or make drastic cuts.
