Michael Annear, Vietnam country representative for the International Federation of the Red Cross, said the threat for heavy rain, flash floods and landslides remains as Haiyan moves into China. The typhoon made landfall early on Monday morning in northern Vietnam, packing winds of 120 kph (75 mph), before weakening to a tropical storm and heading to southern China. "In general, we do not anticipate that the damage will be on the scale of Haiyan in the Philippines but there will be recovery needs," said Snigda Chakraborty, country manager of Catholic Relief Services Vietnam. The typhoon, which had initially been forecast to hit central Vietnam, skirted the country's long coastline on Sunday before making landfall near Ha Long Bay, a popular tourist destination known for its limestone peaks that jut dramatically out of the Gulf of Tonkin. -- Early assessments by two aid agencies suggest that Vietnam looks set to escape the scale of death and devastation wrought by Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines.
