-- Former Manchester United footballer Eric Cantona said Tuesday he wanted to campaign for the French presidency -- but commentators said the announcement was a publicity stunt to turn the spotlight on the plight of poor people. Former Pakistani cricket captain Imran Khan's party is campaigning in elections, while International Monetary Fund boss, and former French finance minister Christine Lagarde was once a member of the French teenage national synchronized swimming team. And in 2010 Cantona urged bank customers to withdraw all their money from French banks. Cantona has written to French mayors to obtain the 500 signatures needed to stand in April's election, Liberation newspaper reported. Nicolas Sarkozy of the UMP party is bidding for re-election in April against Socialist rival Francois Hollande.
