Sahil, a British citizen of Pakistani descent, was on the last day of a two-week vacation in Pakistan before he was to return home to Oldham, in northern England. Sahil Saeed was released at a school in the Punjab province of Pakistan, said Assistant Chief Constable David Thompson of the Greater Manchester Police in England, near his parents' residence in Oldham. "He is with members of family in Pakistan and the Pakistani police, and there is also contact from the British High Commission," Thompson said. Thompson, of the Greater Manchester Police, could not comment on the possibility of arrests in England. Pakistan's Interior Minister Rehman Malik had said the captors included someone close to the family.
