Three people died and 23 were hurt in Zeitoun, in western Cairo, and one person was killed and 17 injured in Manial in central Cairo, according to state media. -- After weeks of relative calm, clashes erupted between supporters of ousted President Mohamed Morsy and Egyptian security forces and local residents in several areas in Cairo, state media outlets reported. Dawoud resigned from the government in August in protest of the bloody crackdown on Muslim Brotherhood supporters. State media reported that Khaled Dawoud sustained stab wounds to his chest and hand. The unrest came amid reports on state media concerning the fate of 170 imprisoned members of the Muslim Brotherhood.
