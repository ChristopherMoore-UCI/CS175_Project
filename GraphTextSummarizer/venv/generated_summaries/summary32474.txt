Lin burst onto the basketball scene in early February when then-Knicks coach Mike D'Antoni called him off the bench as the Knicks struggled against the New Jersey Nets. An MRI revealed a small chronic meniscus tear in Lin's left knee, the Knicks said on their Twitter page. -- Jeremy Lin, who brought "Linsanity" into the lexicon when he came off the bench and led the New York Knicks to a string of wins, suffered a knee injury and will be out about six weeks, the team said Saturday. Lin responded with 25 points, leading the Knicks to victory. Lin noticed the injury about a week ago, but he told reporters it had not gotten better by Saturday.
