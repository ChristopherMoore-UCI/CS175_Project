Laying the foundations Write A House is the brainchild of Toby Barlow, a writer and creative director at advertising agency Team Detroit, and Sarah Cox, a writer and journalist originally from New York, who have been collaborating on the idea since 2012. It has since been renovated by local companies employing young apprentices from across Detroit thanks to a $30,000 donation from Team Detroit and $33,000 raised on the crowdfunding site Indiegogo. A problem that has arisen due to the comparative lack of storytellers in Detroit, Cox believes, is that negative stereotypes about life in the city have been allowed to flourish. While Detroit has certainly suffered its fair share of hardship, including filing for bankruptcy in 2013, both Rocheteau and Cox say countering the simplistic narrative of a city in ruins is important in providing perspective. Tackling the many misconceptions surrounding Detroit and focusing on growing as a writer is for the months and years ahead, however.
