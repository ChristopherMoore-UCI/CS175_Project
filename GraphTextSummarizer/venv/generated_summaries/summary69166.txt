Since 1981 WaterAid has reached 19.2 million people with safe water and 15.1 million people with sanitation, and we are proud to be the world's largest international NGO focused entirely on water, sanitation and hygiene. These organizations recognized that alongside vaccines and treatments like oral rehydration salts, access to safe drinking water, basic sanitation and good hygiene are vital in helping to prevent these diseases. Globally 1 in 10 people are without safe drinking water, while over a third of the planet (36%) goes without basic sanitation. Access to these services is the crucial first step in tackling killer diseases, and in helping lift people out of debilitating poverty. WaterAid believes that these new Sustainable Development Goals should include a dedicated commitment from governments for everyone everywhere to have access to water, sanitation and hygiene.
