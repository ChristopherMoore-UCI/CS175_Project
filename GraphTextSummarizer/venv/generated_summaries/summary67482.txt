Within hours of the first National Ebola Taskforce meeting in Sierra Leone, the King's team was invited to join the response, advising Connaught Hospital on how to develop a preparedness plan, identify cases, set up isolation units, protect staff and dispose of medical waste. These guidelines were held up as a model for other hospitals, and we continue to act as advisers to the Health Ministry, along with groups such as Medicines Sans Frontieres, Emergency Hospital and the World Health Organization. We found ourselves amongst the first responders, alongside heroic Connaught colleagues such as Sister Cecilia (Sister-in-Charge of A&E) and Dr. Modupe Cole (Consultant Physician) who did not hesitate to step forward and manage the response. Two days ago we heard that Dr. Sheik Umar Khan, a leading doctor from Sierra Leone specializing in viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF), had died aged 39. The people of Sierra Leone have been through many challenges over the years, from war to cholera, and they remain resolute.
