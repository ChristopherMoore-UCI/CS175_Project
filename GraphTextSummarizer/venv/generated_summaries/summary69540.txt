-- New York police have made an arrest in the case of an Ecuadorian immigrant beaten to death in an apparent anti-Latino and antigay hate crime in December, New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly announced Wednesday. Brooklyn District Attorney Charles Hynes said the incident should send a message that antigay violence endangers straights and gays alike. They interviewed bridge toll booth employees and combed through videotape of cars passing through cash-only lanes on the bridge. Jose Sucuzhanay, 31, died of his injuries in December hours before his mother arrived in New York from Ecuador. The second assailant proceeded to "savagely beat Jose about his ribs, shoulders," head and back with an aluminum bat, according to Kelly.
