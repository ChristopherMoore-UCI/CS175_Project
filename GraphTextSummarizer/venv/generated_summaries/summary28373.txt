So, I need a Republican in Missouri, or anywhere else, to explain to me why the state is holding a GOP primary Tuesday that will cost taxpayers more than $7 million and will have no effect whatsoever on the delegates chosen by the party in the GOP presidential race. Missouri state officials need to tell the state GOP that if they want a primary, they should pay for it themselves. And then on June 2, the Missouri GOP will meet in a statewide convention to choose the remaining delegates. Look no further than today's GOP nonbinding primary. Then on April 21, they will select 24 of the state's 52 delegates and award them to presidential candidates.
