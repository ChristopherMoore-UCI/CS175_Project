Since the deadly school shootings in Newtown, Connecticut, last year, school security plans have included arming teachers, adding police officers and armed security guards, changing how schools are designed and adding bulletproof backpacks and whiteboards to schools. On a recent Saturday in Lake Mary, Florida, Hudson and his partner, Mike Friedman, conducted a free active shooter self-defense workshop for teachers and school staff members. What really makes schools safer? This course offered guidance on how to escape or take cover but focused most of its four hours on how to fight and disarm an attacker -- something few educators have ever considered how to do. That, Hudson said, is the best time to attack a shooter if one enters the school or classroom.
