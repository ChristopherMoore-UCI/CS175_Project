Obama is a drag in two respects: It's a difficult environment for Democrats who need Republican voters in Republican-leaning districts, and Democratic voters are not motivated to show up at the polls. And they won't have cakewalks in Connecticut and Massachusetts Key governor races Still about Obamacare: For the first several months of the year while the Affordable Care Act seemed to be a rolling disaster, Republicans made it the main issue in campaign, attacking Democrats for their support of the law. In addition to the Affordable Care Act, Republicans are also attacking Democrats on ties to the President and government spending. Why won't Democrats pick up seats?: "I don't think at the end of the day (disappointed Republicans are) going to stay home."
