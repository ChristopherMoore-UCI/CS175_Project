In nearly two thirds of Middle Eastern countries, there are more women than men in university, according to United Nations statistics. Qatar has the region's second highest percentage of women in higher education -- 63% of the university population, and 93% literacy among women. "The idea that education is key to more women reaching positions of power has not materialized. " In Lebanon, for example, women make up 54% of university students, but only 26% of the labor force and 8% of legislators, senior officials and managers, according to the United Nations Statistics Division. In Europe and the United States, women also make up the majority of university graduates -- 60% according to the European Union and U.S. Department of Education.
