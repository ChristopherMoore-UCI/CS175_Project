It ruined the night for England captain Steven Gerrard, who had hoped to celebrate his 100th cap with victory. The Swedish skipper had given his side a 20th minute lead before goals from Manchester United's Danny Welbeck and Tottenham's Steven Caulker gave England a half-time. After netting a 78th minute equaliser, Ibrahimovic slammed home a rasping 30-yard free-kick before rounding off his night with a scarcely believable scissors kick. " Hodgson added: "The fourth goal was extraordinary, but it was the second and third goals which cost us. "For 70 minutes we were playing very well and we deserved to be in the lead, but we made changes and they took the initiative." Elsewhere, France recorded an impressive 2-1 victory over Italy after it came from behind in Parma. Milan star Stephan El Shaarway gave the hosts the lead only for France to hit back through Mathieu Valbuena and Bafetimbi Gomis.
