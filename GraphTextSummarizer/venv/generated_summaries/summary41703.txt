The Republica Cromanon nightclub was made to hold about 1,000 people, but it was estimated that more than 3,000 fans were packed inside the night of the fire, which began when fans began lighting flares that caught the roof on fire. "Personally, I think it's good because the band didn't have anything to do with it," fan Mauro Fernandez told CNN. The incident happened in December 2004, when a fire broke out in the overcrowded Republica Cromanon venue in Buenos Aires. But the members of the Callejeros band, whose fans were gathered outside of the court house, were acquitted although band members had been indicted. CNN en Espa√±ol's Javier Doberti contributed to this report.
