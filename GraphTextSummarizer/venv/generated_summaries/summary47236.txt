Lassana Bathily, an employee at the Hyper Cacher kosher supermarket in Vincennes, helped guide a group of hostages into a downstairs walk-in freezer while gunman Amedy Coulibaly was allegedly preparing to kill them, according to French television station, BFMTV. A man who claims to be Bathily's cousin, Abdoul Bathily, posted, "Bravo to my cousin, Lass Bathily, you showed courage yesterday, the rest of the world would not have done it." France's "L'Express" newspaper ran a headline titled, "Lassana Bathily, 'musulman malien,' h√©ros de la prise d'otages de Vincennes," or "Lassana Bathily, 'Malian Muslim,' hero of the hostage situation in Vincennes. The exact number of hostages who remained safe in the freezer is unknown, according to French newspaper L'Express. Bathily, a "practicing Muslim," says he entered the freezer with some people, then switched off the freezer and the light and told everyone to stay calm, according to BFMTV. A young Muslim man is being hailed as a hero in French newspapers and social media for his actions during Friday's deadly hostage situation in a Paris supermarket.
