[of Zimbabwe] plans to introduce a number of new, higher denominations; review the cash withdrawal limits, as well as commence aggressive campaigns for increased usage of alternative means of payment," bank governor Gideon Gono said in a statement. Gono said the RBZ intends to introduce Z$100,000, Z$500,000 and Z$1 million (about U.S.$8) bank notes in a bid to help consumers who are battling to make simple purchases and to ease cash shortages that have been prevailing for about two years. The current highest denomination bank note is Z$50,000, not enough to buy half a loaf of bread. Meanwhile, the fight against a cholera outbreak in the capital city, Harare, seems to be faltering as more deaths are reported. President Robert Mugabe's critics blame his policies for Zimbabwe's near decade of economic crisis.
