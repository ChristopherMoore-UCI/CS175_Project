-- Universities nationwide were recovering Friday, a day after protests over education budget cuts hit campuses from coast to coast. Police stopped students from shutting down a freeway near the University of California, Davis, in northern California. On the West Coast, the University of California, Santa Cruz, was scheduled to reopen Friday. "The less affordable education becomes, the less likely low-income students will be able to get a college education," said Lillian Taiz, president of the California Faculty Association and a professor of history at California State University, Los Angeles. Many of Thursday's demonstrations focused on cuts in state funding for colleges and universities, which supporters say drive up tuition, limit classes and make higher education unobtainable to many.
