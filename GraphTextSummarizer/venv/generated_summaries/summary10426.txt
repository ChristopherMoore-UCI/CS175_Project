-- Hawaii Gov. Neil Abercrombie signed into law a bill that will legalize civil unions for same-sex couples in the Aloha State. Five states and the District of Columbia issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. California recognizes same-sex marriages performed during six months in 2008 after its Supreme Court granted same-sex couples the right to marry and before the passage of Proposition 8, which overturned the court's decision. Three states -- Rhode Island, New York and Maryland -- recognize same-sex marriages from other states, according to the conference. Hawaii joins New Jersey in allowing civil unions.
