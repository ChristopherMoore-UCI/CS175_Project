-- Embattled Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari met with Army Chief General Ashfaq Pervez Kayani -- a sign that, some say, shows tensions between Pakistan's civilian and military leadership are cooling down. A second meeting between civilian and military leadership took place afterward, as Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani convened the Cabinet's defense committee. The meetings come one day after Pakistani and British official denied a report that Pakistani prime minister contacted the British High Commission to express fears that a military coup was imminent in his country. Pakistan's government has formally disputed the findings of the U.S. investigation into the airstrike, saying the bombardment went on long after it reported its troops were under fire. Military officials did not immediately comment on the meetings and their outcomes.
