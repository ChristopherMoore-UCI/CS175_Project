The successful Gawker hack followed a week of escalating attacks in the wake of Wikileaks's continued release of U.S. State Dept. documents and counter-attacks by hackers associated with group known as Anonymous, which has staged a campaign called Operation Payback. A 500MB file containing thousands of Gawker user IDs, passwords and email addresses was easily available Sunday night. The source code to Gawker's website was also released, according to the hackers, as were internal chat communications among Gawker employees. Gawker's attackers managed to infiltrate the company's content management system (CMS), user database, and internal communications system. The email addresses and passwords of hundreds of thousands of Gawker users have been compromised, the hackers said.
