Former Chinese national team players - Shen Si, Qi Hong, Jiang Jin and Li Ming -- who were jailed for five-and-a-half years last year for taking bribes -- were also banned for life, as was former World Cup referee Lu Jun. Allegations of corruption linked to gambling have long damaged the reputation of Chinese football, but the acquisition of Ivory Coast star Drogba, fresh from helping Chelsea to win the 2012 European Champions League, was seen as a major coup. "Acts of corruption violated national laws, and did serious damage to the image of Chinese football," said a statement on the CFA's official website. -- Big-spending Shanghai Shenhua have been stripped of their 2003 league title and handed a $160,000 fine in the latest crackdown by Chinese football authorities against match-fixing . Shenhua, who achieved worldwide prominence with their audacious signing of Chelsea's Didier Drogba last year, will also start the next Chinese Super League (CSL) with a six-point deduction.
