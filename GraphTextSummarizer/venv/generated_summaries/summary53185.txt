For two decades until his death in 1997, Deng Xiaoping was driven to modernize China quickly while maintaining stability, ordering the brutal Tiananmen Square crackdown in 1989 while single-mindedly pushing the reforms that opened and transformed his country. From the era of feudal warlords to modern China, rulers have been obsessed with avoiding bottom-up peasant revolts. Many have compared the protests in Cairo's Tahrir Square to those in Beijing's Tiananmen Square in 1989. There have been whispers of a "jasmine revolution" on the internet and although calls for street protests have fallen flat so far, no matter: China appears jittery. To better manage rural affairs and address the farmers' day-to-day concerns, China has been experimenting with direct village elections.
