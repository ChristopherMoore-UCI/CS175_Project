The new constitutional articles come months after a military coup  unseated elected President Mohamed Morsy in July and touched off a series of protests that ended in violence. U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel on Saturday called his Egyptian counterpart, Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, to express concerns over the law restricting demonstrations and protests, among others. The next steps in the process for the the draft to become law are for Egypt's interim President Adly Mansour to ratify the charter on Tuesday and then announce a date for it to be put to a popular referendum. Also on Saturday, security forces dispersed protesters who were demonstrating against Egypt's anti-protest law. Egypt's new constitution would ban religious parties and put more power in the hands of the military, according to a draft posted on state media earlier Sunday.
