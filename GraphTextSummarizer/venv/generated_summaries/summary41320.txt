Rubalcaba's comments followed the Sunday explosions on Mallorca of what he said were four small ETA bombs that caused no injuries, and two weeks after an ETA car bomb killed two Civil Guard officers on the same Mediterranean island. -- Britons, Germans and other tourists on the Spanish island of Mallorca "can feel safe because they aren't targets of the ETA terrorist band," which recently bombed the popular resort, Spain's interior minister said Tuesday. Hours before Sunday's bombs, ETA claimed responsibility for a series of bombings across Spain in June and July: the one that killed two Civil Guard officers, another that killed a police officer, and another that heavily damaged a Civil Guard barracks, slightly wounded dozens, including children. Police initially attributed three small bombs on Sunday to ETA, which is listed as a terrorist group by Spain, the United States and the European Union. The group said, "What ETA has been looking for during long decades is a negotiated political solution."
