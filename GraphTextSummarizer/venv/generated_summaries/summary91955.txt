His sons, Edward Kennedy Jr. and Rep. Patrick Kennedy of Rhode Island, have been mentioned as possible successors, as has his nephew, former Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy II. Kennedy family friend Benjamin Smith was appointed to the seat but did not run in 1962 when John Kennedy's term expired, clearing the way for Edward Kennedy. When John Kennedy was elected president, Edward Kennedy was not yet old enough to be a senator. The seat may remain in Kennedy hands. Edward Kennedy's wife, Victoria Reggie Kennedy, has no interest in filling the seat, a source close to the senator said.
