-- Golf legend Gary Player has told CNN that 20-year-old Rory McIlroy "has the world at his feet" after the Northern Ireland ace claimed his seventh top-10 finish from eight stroke play events with a third-place finish in Abu Dhabi. However, Player -- who was in Abu Dhabi to open a new course of his own design -- said McIlroy's versatility would stand him in good stead for the future and ultimately lead to success in America. South African-born Player, 74, started his stint in the U.S. in the late 1950's competing for titles against the likes of Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer. McIlroy then raised eyebrows, after achieving his breakthrough win in the 2009 European Tour, by then committing to play on the rival U.S. Tour for 2010. McIlroy will also face challenges to win titles, but Player was confident that with the help of father--figure and manager Chubby Chandler, McIlroy would also prove competitive.
