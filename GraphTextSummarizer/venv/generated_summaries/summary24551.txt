When I commanded Coast Guard cutters undertaking hazardous military missions, I invariably chose the safer path whenever I had the opportunity to do so. In the case of a cruise ship, thousands of passengers have come aboard with the expectation that they are in the hands of a competent crew headed by a competent captain. One can only imagine how many might have perished had the ship run into trouble at sea with this particular captain and crew. We must all await the findings of a proper investigation, but for anyone remotely familiar with a captain's awesome responsibilities for the lives of his passengers and crew, the reported behavior of the Concordia's skipper, Francesco Schettino, is almost unfathomable. First, he came in close to the island in spite of the obvious navigational challenges that meant in terms of safe passage.
