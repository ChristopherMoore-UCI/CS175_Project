-- Pilot error, slight intoxication of the navigator, and a failure of the crew to interact properly caused a plane crash that killed 47 people in June of this year, Russia's Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC) said Monday. "The first thing that the plane had contact with was a pine tree of about 15 meters high," Alexander Neradko, head of the Russian Federal Aviation Agency said on Russian state TV at the time of the crash. The IAC investigates and analyzes aviation accidents in the former Soviet Union, and oversees civil aviation across the region. The report comes out nearly two weeks after another plane crash that killed dozens of Russian and international hockey players in Yaroslavl, Russia. Monday's report examined a Tupolev-134 airliner that went down June 20 in the Russian northwest city of Petrozavodsk.
