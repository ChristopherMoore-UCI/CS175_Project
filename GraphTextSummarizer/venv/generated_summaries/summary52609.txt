Not to be bested, New York City officials gave the go ahead Wednesday to a proposal for 625-foot wheel in Staten Island, which developers hope will be completed by 2016. Now, more than 100 years later, New York City and Las Vegas are engaged in a contest with dueling plans to erect the world's largest Ferris wheel. "The New York Wheel will be an attraction unlike any other in New York City -- even unlike any other on the planet," Mayor Michael Bloomberg, an enthusiastic advocate, said in a news release. -- When George Ferris unveiled the first Ferris wheel at the World's Fair in Chicago in 1893, it was meant to rival the engineering feat of Paris' newly constructed 1,000-foot-plus Eiffel Tower. " Caesars declined to comment on the proposed New York Wheel.
