-- Rui Costa rode to his second stage win of this year's Tour de France Friday as Chris Froome moved ever closer to overall victory in the centenary edition of cycling's most famous race. Cunego, who is riding this year's Tour de France, but languishes in 56th position, one hour 42 minutes behind Froome, is the biggest name caught up in the potential scandal. Froome, all set to succeed fellow Briton and Sky teammate Bradley Wiggins as Tour de France winner, was again grateful for the support of his loyal lieutenant, Richie Porte of Australia, in a dramatically whittled down main bunch. but I'm really relieved to have today behind us," he told the official Tour de France website. The Movistar rider burst out of a chasing group to catch long time leader Pierre Rolland of France (Europcar) on the final big climb of the Col de la Croix Fry and finished clear in Le Grand-Bornand.
