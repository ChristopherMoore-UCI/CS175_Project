On Saturday, the '60s-era story of a struggling folk singer beat out other awards season favorites "American Hustle," "12 Years A Slave" and "Her" for the best picture honor from the National Society of Film Critics. Full coverage of Awards Season Cate Blanchett's work in "Blue Jasmine" nabbed the star a best actress win, while Jennifer Lawrence scooped up a best supporting actress award for "American Hustle." In the end, "Inside Llewyn Davis" pulled ahead for the best picture win, while "American Hustle" was second. In the best supporting actor category, the Society of Film Critics favored James Franco's turn as Alien in "Spring Breakers" over Jared Leto's praised performance in "Dallas Buyers Club." The love for "Llewyn" didn't end there: Joel and Ethan Coen shared the best director win, and star Oscar Isaac -- who plays the ornery, ambitious artist Llewyn -- was named best actor.
