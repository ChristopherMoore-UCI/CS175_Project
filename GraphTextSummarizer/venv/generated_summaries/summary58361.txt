In that survey, 40 percent of those questioned say the United States would be better off if Democrats ran Congress while 39 percent feel things would be better if Republicans ran Congress. Democrats had big victories in recent years, taking back control of both houses of Congress in 2006 and the White House in 2008. And yet, Republicans look pretty good compared to Democrats, whose moves have been even more questionable. For that, you need to look at a CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll from last month that found that Republicans had closed the popularity gap with Democrats. Just a few months earlier, in August, Democrats had enjoyed a 10-point advantage over Republicans.
