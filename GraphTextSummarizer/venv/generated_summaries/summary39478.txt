The company's Web site states Best Buy reserves the right to "revoke offers or correct errors" even if a credit card has already been charged. A recorded message on Best Buy's customer service line told customers "we will not be placing any more orders for this unit," and messages were sent on Twitter apologizing "for any disappointment." Dozens of customers were posting to Twitter and Bestbuy.com, saying they also placed often multiple orders. Customers who placed orders early Wednesday were left wondering if they got away with the bargain. As customers jumped on the Web site trying to take advantage of the offer, Best Buy announced it was a "pricing error" and was no longer available.
