MBDA Missile Systems, Europe's largest missile manufacturer and owned by the continents big aerospace companies, has a promotional video playing on its stand showing weapons destroying moving cars and other real targets in combat in Afghanistan and Libya. However, a fearsome title alone won't clinch a multi-million dollar sale, so military trade events like air shows give weapons manufacturers a chance to show off their products -- even if the hard sell has been done over months and years of networking and negotiations. Giving it a name that conjures up images of destruction or protection is a good start; weapons called "Iron Dome defense system" or "Predator" are unequivocal. "There's no new business here, but new sales prospects," says Mikael Olsson of Saab Technologies. While plenty of technical detail and test footage can be used in support of any demo, being able to say a weapon has been used in combat situations gives it far more kudos.
