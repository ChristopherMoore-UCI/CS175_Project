Flash flood warnings were in effect Thursday for parts of middle Tennessee after heavy rain battered the state overnight. -- The Cumberland River in Nashville, Tennessee, is predicted to be at flood stage overnight Friday, and flood levels should begin to fall after daylight, according to the National Weather Service. Dozens of roads were closed and some schools in middle Tennessee were closed or starting late Thursday, the Macon County (Tennessee) Times reported. Some areas, like the town of Red Boiling Springs, were pounded with as much as eight inches of rain in a 12-hour stretch Wednesday. Heavy rain in parts of the state this week caused rivers and creeks to crest, and sent flood waters into the streets.
