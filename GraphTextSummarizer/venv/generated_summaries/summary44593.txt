I was armed with a LASER focus that in life I am not alone, that storms come and go. I used those experiences to form a list of guiding principles that I have honed through life that I use to weather those everyday storms of life. My pastor recently told me I have become a living testimony of how a support network can help others find rest in the midst of storm. I created a system for myself to remain focused, LASER focused, on staying free from storm. For young people who face storms of their own, here's my story.
