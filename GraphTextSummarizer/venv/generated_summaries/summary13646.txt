-- British royal watchers are in a tizzy over comments reportedly made by Prince Charles comparing Russian President Vladimir Putin to Adolf Hitler. The failures of Western European governments to stop the German advances under what was then known as the policy of "appeasement" have been endlessly debated by historians considering the impact of Hitler's early moves on the bloody and brutal years that followed. Representatives for Prince Charles declined to comment. According to the Daily Mail newspaper, a woman claims Charles made the offhand comment during a tour Monday of the Canadian Museum of Immigration in Halifax, Nova Scotia. "However, we would like to stress that the Prince of Wales would not seek to make a public political statement during a private conversation," Clarence House said in a statement.
