Tornado watches remain in effect from Mississippi northeastward through northern Alabama, eastern Tennessee, southwestern and central Virginia and central and eastern Maryland through Monday evening, according to CNN meteorologist Sean Morris. The winds that ripped through the state were accompanied by heavy rains that left motorists stuck in their cars on flooded streets in Kansas City, Missouri. High winds to the east didn't produce any tornadoes, but were strong enough to knock down power lines and damage road signs in St. Louis. Tornado warnings were issued Monday afternoon and into the evening for the Atlanta metro area as heavy rains and wind moved into the region, according to the National Weather Service. One man was killed in Tennessee after being pinned by a trailer that was lifted by strong winds, said Sgt.
