"And me, Ms. Healthcare CNN interview tough person now a scared little girl who after beating cancer 4x now sits in bed with oxygen and breathing treatments," Elder wrote to Jacobs. In the midst of the family's confusion, Elder was unwittingly suffering from cancer again -- her fourth diagnosis. During the interview with CNN three years ago, Elder admitted to volleying between fear of the unknown and acceptance of her fate, even though without insurance, she had no idea whether she had cancer again. I don't know anything anymore," said Elder, who died in July at age 63 without insurance coverage. Her insurance company Aetna later said Elder's previous cancer diagnoses were not the culprit for the rate increases.
