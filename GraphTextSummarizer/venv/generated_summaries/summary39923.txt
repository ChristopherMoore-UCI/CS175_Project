The Argentine advertisement brought attention to the country's athletes training for the upcoming Olympic Games in London, and the video makes a statement about the war over the Falklands. An article in  Argentine state media agency Telam called the advertisement "impressive." The advertisement was "far from any military connotation, and is part of the national government policies towards the Malvinas, to continue to claim sovereignty by peaceful means," the article said. The video ends with the slogan: "To compete on English soil, we train on Argentine soil." " "We are in contact with the Argentine NOC (National Olympic Committee) on a regular basis and we have been reassured on a number of occasions that the NOC will not seek to use the Games as a political platform and will fully respect the Olympic Charter. The advertisement shows  Argentine field hockey star Fernando Zylberberg training in the streets of Port Stanley in the Falklands, a UK territory in the South Atlantic.
