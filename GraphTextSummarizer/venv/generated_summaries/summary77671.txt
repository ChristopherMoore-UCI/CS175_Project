Among the new suspects are six more people who allegedly used British passports in the commission of the crime, four others using Irish passports, two other French passport holders and three people, including a woman, traveling on Australian passports, police said in a statement Wednesday. Officials have said the passports are not fake or forged but were authentic passports meant for other people. The total number of suspects using British passports is now at 12, police said, along with six Irish passport holders and four French passport holders. "Dubai police investigators are not ruling out the possibility of involvement of other people in the murder." "At this stage, Australian officials have no information, no information to suggest that the three Australian passport holders were involved in any way, other than as victims of passport or identity fraud."
