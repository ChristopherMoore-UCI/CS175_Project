-- The Florida judge presiding over the George Zimmerman murder trial ruled Monday that Zimmerman's attorneys will be able to present evidence about how Trayvon Martin may have been high on marijuana the night he was shot to death. Ben Crump, Martin's family's attorney, says Zimmerman should have been tested for drugs the night of the shooting. Martin's toxicology report indicates that THC, the active drug in marijuana, was in his blood at the time of his death on February 26, 2012. The two got into a physical altercation, and Zimmerman said he was forced to draw his gun and kill Martin. It is not clear whether Zimmerman's drug use the night of the shooting will be admissible at trial.
