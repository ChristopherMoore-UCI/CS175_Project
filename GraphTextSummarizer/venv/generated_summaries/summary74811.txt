The victory lifted the Rome side into second place above AC Milan and Udinese, who play Bologna and Chievo respectively on Sunday. Striker Giampaolo Pazzini netted the opening goal against his former club four minutes before halftime, pouncing for his second league goal this season after a mistake by Cesare Natali allowed him space to hook the ball past keeper Artur Boruc. Genoa moved up to seventh with a 2-0 win at Siena, as captain Marco Rossi and Argentine striker Rodrigo Palacio scored in the second half. Sixth-placed Palermo remained behind Napoli on goal difference after suffering a shock 1-0 home defeat by second-bottom Cesena. Inter Milan bounced back from last weekend's home defeat by Udinese with a 2-0 win against Fiorentina at the San Siro that lifted Claudio Ranieri's team into ninth place.
