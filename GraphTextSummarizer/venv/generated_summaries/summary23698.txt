The preliminary rates for Medicare Advantage program, which covers seniors through private insurance, will be announced next month, and final rates will be set in April. The insurance industry is launching a seven-figure advertising, grassroots and lobbying campaign to persuade Washington officials not to cut Medicare Advantage funding next year. Insurance officials say the cuts are already forcing insurers to cut their doctor networks, and they warn that further cuts will increase cost and limit access to seniors "If the Medicare Advantage plan is cut once again, seniors are going to find out in October that their costs are going up, their benefits are being reduced and they have fewer choices of providers and fewer coverage options," said Robert Zirkelbach, spokesman for the insurance industry trade group America's Health Insurance Plans. In the TV ad, seniors tell Washington that they depend on their Medicare Advantage coverage and will spread the word. The ad, which will begin airing Thursday, comes as policy makers begin to set payment rates for next year.
