On Friday, the Two Eagles balloon, piloted by American Troy Bradley and Russian Leonid Tiukhtyaev, surpassed a gas balloon world record for duration aloft. Friday's duration achievement follows another milestone Thursday, when the balloonists surpassed a 1981 distance record for gas balloons, set by Double Eagle V. Under the same rule, the balloonists had to best the 1981 record of 5,208 miles or 8,382.54 kilometers by 1%. According to rules set by the Federation Aeronautique Internationale, the record must be surpassed by 1% in order to qualify as a new record. The record of 137 hours, 5 minutes, 50 seconds was set by Double Eagle II on a 1978 transatlantic flight. A team piloting a helium-filled balloon across the Pacific has set two major ballooning records.
