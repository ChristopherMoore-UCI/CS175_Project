U.S. State Department spokesman Philip J. Crowley acknowledged the surveillance program at a press briefing in Washington on Monday, but said Norwegian authorities had been informed. On Norwegian soil, Norwegian law must be followed," Storberget said in a statement. The investigation follows a report by Norway's TV2 claiming that the U.S. Embassy in Oslo has been conducting an "illegal systematic surveillance of Norwegian citizens." "What we can say is that it is only Norwegian police that should conduct police work on Norwegian territory," he added. These reports were then collected in a database called SIMAS, where information is shared between different U.S. authorities and posts, TV2 reported.
