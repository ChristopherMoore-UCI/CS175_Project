"We do not want to end up in refugee tents if the worst happens." Nasheed's government said it has broached the idea with several countries and found them to be "receptive." Lands owned by Sri Lanka and India were possibilities because the countries have similar cultures, cuisine and climate as the Maldives. Maldives is grappling with the very likely possibility that it will go under water if the current pace of climate change keeps raising sea levels. "We are trying to send our message to let the world know what is happening and what will happen to the Maldives if climate change isn't checked," Nasheed said, according to his Web site. The Maldives declaration will be presented at a U.N. summit on climate change in December. The Maldives is an archipelago of almost 1,200 coral islands south-southwest of India.
