The statement came after the second day of delegation-level talks led by China's state councilor Dai Bingguo and Indian national security adviser Shivshankar Menon. "As neighbors and two big countries with a combined population of 2.5 billion, China and India can join hands, seize the historic opportunity, and work together to further advance our friendship and cooperation," he said. -- Locked in a long-running border dispute, India and China Tuesday agreed to set up a new system aimed at maintaining peace along their treacherous Himalayan boundary. The world has enough space for China and India to achieve common development, as there are so many areas for us to work together," Dai added in the column. Called a "working mechanism for consultation and coordination on India-China border affairs," the system will be composed of civilian, military and diplomatic officials from both sides, the Asian neighbors said in a joint statement in New Delhi.
