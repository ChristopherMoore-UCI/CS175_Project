-- China says it is opposed to an upcoming meeting between the U.S. president and Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, and is calling on Barack Obama to cancel the visit. The term "Dalai Lama" is a Buddhist religious title. But the issue of Tibet is one that "involves China's sovereignty and territorial integrity," Foreign Ministry Spokesman Hong Lei said in a statement. In traditional Tibetan belief, the title is given to those who are the reincarnations of a line of revered religious teachers. The foreign ministry statement went on to ask that Obama reverse his decision to meet with the exiled spiritual leader, as well as to "stop interfering with China's internal affairs and damaging Sino-U.S. relations."
