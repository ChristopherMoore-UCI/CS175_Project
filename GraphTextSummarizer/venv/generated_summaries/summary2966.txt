-- The FBI and Justice Department are undertaking a broad review of thousands of criminal cases to see if any defendants were wrongly convicted based on faulty forensic analysis. "We remain committed to working closely with our law enforcement partners to go through thousands of cases, all of which are more than a decade old, and to assemble evidence for purposes of conducting a thorough and meaningful review of convictions. In addition to analyzing evidence in federal cases, the lab provides assistance to state and local law enforcement agencies. "The department and the FBI are in the process of identifying historical cases for review where a microscopic hair examination conducted by the FBI was among the evidence in a case that resulted in a conviction," said Justice Department spokeswoman Nanda Chitre on Wednesday. The FBI has been able to provide more thorough analysis of small or degraded hair sample evidence since it began using mitochondrial DNA testing in 1996.
