Opposition leaders Mir Hossein Moussavi and Mehdi Karrubi, along with former reformist President Mohammad Khatami, should be tried for attempting to lead a Western-backed "velvet revolution" that aimed to topple the regime, the official said. A top official in Iran wants to put former President Mohammad Khatami, left, and Mir Hossein Moussavi on trial. "If Moussavi, Khatami ... and Karrubi are the main suspects believed to have been behind the velvet coup in Iran, which they are, we expect the judiciary to go after them, arrest them, put them on trial and punish them according to the law," said Brigadier General Yadollah Javani. Moussavi and Karrubi ran in the presidential election on June 12, in which hardline incumbent President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was declared the overwhelming winner. The two opposition leaders unsuccessfully challenged the results for weeks, and Ahmadinejad was sworn in for his second term last week.
