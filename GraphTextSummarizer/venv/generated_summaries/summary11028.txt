Ireland tried hard to find a way back into the match and Robbie Keane had an appeal for a penalty turned down, but Croatia were too strong and held on with ease to move top of Group C ahead of a meeting with Italy in Poznan on Thursday. Spain next face Republic of Ireland on Thursday, and the Irish lie bottom of Group C after a 3-1 defeat at the hands of an impressive Croatia in Poznan. Almost immediately Italy coach Cesare Prandelli withdrew Balotelli, replacing him with Di Natale. Croatia 3-1 Republic of Ireland Sunday's second Group C contest was supposed to take second billing, but in torrential rain in Poznan the Croatians laid down a marker for the tournament with a clinical display against the Republic of Ireland. Aiden McGeady's wickedly inswinging free-kick from the left caught Vedran Corluka cold at the back post, as Sean St Ledger sneaked in to head past Croatia keeper Stipe Pletikosa.
