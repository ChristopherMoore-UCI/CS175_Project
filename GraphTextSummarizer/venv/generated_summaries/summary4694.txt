The group called the TLC show "propaganda that riskily hides the Islamic agenda's clear and present danger to American liberties and traditional values. Lowe's has pulled its advertising from the reality TV show "All-American Muslim," which the retail store called a "lightning rod." "All-American Muslim" is an eight-part series that follows five Muslim families living in Dearborn, Michigan. "This is NOT about standing up for All-American Muslim - This is about Standing Up Against Bigotry and Hatred in this Country Founded on Peace, Justice, and Equality. "We believe it is best to respectfully defer to communities, individuals and groups to discuss and consider such issues of importance." Both CAIR and Shadia Amen-McDermott, who is featured on the show, posted links on their Facebook pages to a petition, calling on advertisers to continue their support.
