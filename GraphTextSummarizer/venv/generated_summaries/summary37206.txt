The money comes from big brands like Citibank, Procter & Gamble, Kraft Foods and Sears, who have together provided more than a million dollars in marketing money that consumers turn into charity donations. These karmas turn into real money contributions to charities. Enter CauseWorld, a location-based platform that allows you to turn your shopping into charity. Made possible in part by Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers' iFund, which funded 14 business plans out of the thousands it received, the company that created CauseWorld has capitalized on the check-in craze to turn marketing dollars into charitable donations -- donations that reached an impressive milestone. As long we get donation money, we will keep donating.
