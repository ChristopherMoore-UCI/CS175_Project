Kaymer, an early starter on Friday, leads the way from Jordan Spieth in second place at 11-under-par and Russell Henley three shots further back at 8-under par. The German carded a three-under-par second round of 69 to take his overall tournament score to 12-under-par. " Kaymer started the day two shots ahead of Henley but will be looking over his shoulder from the start on Saturday after a barnstorming second round from Spieth. Jim Furyk, Lee Westwood, Gary Woodland, Justin Rose and Sergio Garcia are all tied for fourth place at six-under-par. The 20-year-old Texan has yet to card a bogey in 36 holes at the famous Sawgrass course and produced a near majestic display again Friday, holing six birdies to secure a second round score of 66.
