" Most in the U.S.'s growing footballing community have disagreed with the man who "shockingly" left out Donovan -- that was the word used by the 32-year-old's MLS team, the L.A. Galaxy -- but Germany's Klinsmann tends to court controversy, or at least divide opinion. There can be few more uplifting scenarios than an adored former player guiding a national team to World Cup glory on home soil -- Klinsmann made 80 international appearances, netting 38 times -- and the Germans indeed almost prevailed in 2006, falling to bogey side and eventual champion Italy in the semifinals. Klinsmann and Lahm will meet again, since Germany -- as well as Portugal and Ghana -- landed in the U.S.'s group. " Klinsmann's brutal assessment of his charges' chances at the World Cup -- "I think for us now, talking about winning a World is just not realistic" -- also didn't go down well in the court of American public opinion. Although it's not strange for players born in one country to represent another -- in-demand striker Diego Costa picked Spain over Brazil for the World Cup -- Klinsmann selected more than merely one: Jermaine Jones, John Brooks, Timothy Chandler and Fabian Johnson were all born in Germany.
