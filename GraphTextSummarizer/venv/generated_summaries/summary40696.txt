" "Her pain and suffering is going to be of that type that a jury will have to tell us what it's worth," said Hanna's co-counsel Patrick Duffy. Because of the pending litigation, Pierre Mayor Laurie Gill refused comment on Saturday. Grandpre told KSFY last October that Pierre police had used Tasers nine times in the past two years, with the girl, who is identified in the lawsuit only as "L.M.J.," the youngest recipient of the electric shock. "That's bull****," Stenstrom's attorney Dana Hanna told CNN on Saturday. She won't shake that." Since the incident, Stenstrom and her daughter, who are members of the Rosebud Sioux tribe, have moved from Pierre back to the tribal reservation, Hanna said.
