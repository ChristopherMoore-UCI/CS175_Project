A memorial ceremony is scheduled for Sandra at 1 p.m. Thursday at a high school in Tracy, police said. Huckaby is the granddaughter of Clifford Lane Lawless, pastor of Clover Road Baptist Church near the mobile home park, and she taught Sunday school at the church, police have said. If convicted, Huckaby would face the death penalty or life in prison without parole, San Joaquin County District Attorney James Willett told reporters after the hearing. Sandra was last seen alive March 27 in the mobile home park where she lived with her family -- the same mobile home park where Huckaby lives with her daughter. Melissa Huckaby is charged with killing 8-year-old Sandra Cantu, who was a friend of her own daughter.
