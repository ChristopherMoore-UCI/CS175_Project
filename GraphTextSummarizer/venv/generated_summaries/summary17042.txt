Over the past decade, Parness' nonprofit, New York Says Thank You, has assisted victims of wildfires in San Diego, tornadoes in the Midwest and Hurricane Katrina in Louisiana. For Parness, a native New Yorker, the work carried extra significance. Every September, Parness brings hundreds of volunteers from New York to help another disaster-stricken community in the United States. Last weekend, more than 300 volunteers -- at least half of whom were from outside the New York area -- helped rebuild 13 homes damaged by Superstorm Sandy in October.
