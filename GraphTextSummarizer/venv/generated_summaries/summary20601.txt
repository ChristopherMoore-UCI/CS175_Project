The document later said that al Qathani "received computer training from al-Qaida member Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti in preparation for his mission to the U.S." Al Kuwaiti was then "a senior al Qaeda facilitator and subordinate" of Mohammed. Since the operation that killed bin Laden, U.S. officials have described the courier they were tracking as a protege of Mohammed and another senior member of al Qaeda, Abu Faraj al Libi, a Libyan detainee who was named as al Qaeda's third most senior leader when he was captured in May 2005. It was the first of several encounters with the al Qaeda leader, to whom al Qathani swore a personal oath of allegiance. The document established that al Kuwaiti was close to bin Laden and traveled with him. No obvious replacement to succeed bin Laden as al Qaeda's leader Al Qathani reportedly spent about three months in basic training with al Qaeda from December 2000 to February 2001 when he was introduced to bin Laden.
