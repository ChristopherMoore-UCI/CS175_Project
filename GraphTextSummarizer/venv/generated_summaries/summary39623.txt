Thursday's shelling of a transit stop in Donetsk city -- an attack that Ukraine's Defense Ministry blamed on rebels -- killed eight civilians, according to state news reports. The White House says Vice President Biden spoke with Ukraine President Poroshenko on Saturday. Pro-Russian separatists are blamed for the attack on residential areas in the port city, Donetsk regional police chief Vyacheslav Abroskin said on his Facebook page. The shelling comes amid a surge in fighting between government forces and pro-Russian separatists. The conflict in eastern Ukraine broke out after Russia annexed Ukraine's southeastern Crimea region, as pro-Russia separatists claimed control of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions.
