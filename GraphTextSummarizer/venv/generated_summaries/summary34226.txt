-- A Nigerian man accused of attempting to detonate an explosive device in his underwear aboard a flight to Detroit last Christmas pleaded not guilty Thursday to new charges, authorities said. During a 20-minute hearing Thursday, AbdulMutallab stood mute when asked his plea, so U.S. District Judge Nancy Edmunds entered a not guilty plea on his behalf, said Rod Hansen, court spokesman. Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab was indicted on two new counts -- conspiracy to commit an act of terrorism transcending national boundaries and possession of a firearm or destructive device in furtherance of an act of violence. AbdulMutallab was a passenger on Northwest Airlines Flight 253 en route from the Netherlands to Detroit on Christmas Day. However, the first batch of charges did not include the specific word "terrorism."
