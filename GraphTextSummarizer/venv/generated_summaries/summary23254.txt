"This was an accident, but Mr. Benschop was not responsible," Grey said, in remarks captured by CNN affiliate WPVI. Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter blamed Benschop's "reckless and irresponsible behavior" for the building collapse and said Saturday he hopes that Benschop faces "the harshest level of charges ... and he is punished accordingly. Many of the related charges -- related to alleged firearms violations and theft -- were withdrawn, dismissed or resulted in not guilty verdicts, though he was found guilty in the mid-1990s on drug charges. "And we believe that, in time, the facts will show that he is not responsible." Benschop had marijuana and pain medication in his blood after the collapse, a law enforcement source told CNN. He is charged with six counts of involuntary manslaughter, 13 counts of recklessly endangering another person, and one count of "risking a catastrophe," District Attorney spokeswoman Tasha Jamerson told CNN.
