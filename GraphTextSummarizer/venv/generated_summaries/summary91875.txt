Scott Walker, the governor of Wisconsin and potential Republican presidential candidate, has stripped away the power of public unions and signed a right to work law that barred unions from collecting dues from employees who weren't in unions. In the 1970s, President Jimmy Carter treated unions like one more special interest in Washington that needed to be brought down while President Bill Clinton demonstrated lukewarm support to these organizations as he aggressively pursued global free trade policies that labor opposed. Shoring up the strength of unions is one area where the government can help protect jobs for middle class Americans. When Democrats chose Charlotte, North Carolina, for their 2012 political convention -- a city not friendly to labor -- unions were livid.
