I have played the beta and let me tell you: This is the best video game of the year by far and will be played by the masses for years to come just like "Halo 2." Brian Baker of Beatrice, Nebraska I am 30 years old, and for my 30th birthday my wife pre-ordered "Halo 3" for me as a birthday present. "Halo 3" was the best game I have ever played. We asked other CNN.com readers for their take on "Halo 3." After getting the brand new Box with a copy of "Halo" and throwing myself into the game, I quickly realized this wasn't a standard gaming experience. Then came November 2004, when, of course, a friend and I were in the lines for the Midnight release of "Halo 2."
