Clicking +1 on Google search results, embedded on other sites or from within Google+ pages, allows you to share links with friends or selectively with groups of friends. The +1 button, which was previously made available as an optional program for Google account holders, ties this all together, not unlike Facebook's "Like" button. How tech bloggers are reacting to Google+ When crafting a service to take on Facebook, Google was wise not to ignore what that popular network, with its more than 600 million users, already does well. Google appears to be rejecting the idea that Google+ is meant to take Facebook head on. The video conferencing ability may be Google's sharpest edge over Facebook's current product.
