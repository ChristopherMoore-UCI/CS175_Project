With his hunched shoulders and upper lip exposing his teeth (the high hair would come later), sweet Ed would smooth things over in a way Short confessed he was too stubborn to do. Nevertheless, long after they moved to L.A., Short noted in the book that Dolman never let him forget about his moment on the bench. " "SCTV" ended in 1984, and Short made the jump to "Saturday Night Live" as part of what became known as the "all-star cast," a group that included Christopher Guest, Billy Crystal and Harry Shearer. The next day, Short joined Toronto's Second City troupe, where he debuted some of his most popular characters, including Ed Grimley. Though he grew up idolizing Frank Sinatra and hosted a faux variety show from his attic bedroom in his hometown of Hamilton, Ontario, Short maintains he was too far, psychologically, from the United States to harbor Hollywood dreams.
