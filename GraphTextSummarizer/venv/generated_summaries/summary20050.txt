" Alonso, from Spain, is currently third in the drivers' world championship standings, 13 points behind McLaren's British driver Jenson Button in second. The Ferrari driver was in pole position to grab his third career title last year, needing to finish in the top four to claim the crown. Alonso acknowledges that winning will be "difficult" in Abu Dhabi but says he is keen to fight for a podium place to counter last year's bitter disappointment.
