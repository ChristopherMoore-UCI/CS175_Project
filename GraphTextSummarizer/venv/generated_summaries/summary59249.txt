-- North Korea has entered a "state of war" with neighboring South Korea, according to a report Saturday from the state-run Korean Central News Agency that included a threat to "dissolve" the U.S. mainland. " "We will first target and dissolve mainland United States, Hawaii and Guam, and United States military based in South Korea. North Korea and South Korea technically remain at war since their conflict between 1950 and 1953 ended with an armistice and not a peace treaty. Having already declared the armistice invalid, North Korea more recently said it was cutting a key military hotline with South Korea.
