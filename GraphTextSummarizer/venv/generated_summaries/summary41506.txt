The pattern of fatal crashes associated with weaker GDL programs was similar, though less pronounced, than the pattern seen with stronger programs. But McCartt, who coauthored an editorial accompanying the new study, says this and other research suggests that GDL programs do help protect younger teen drivers. When teen drivers of all ages were pooled together, the link between these programs and the rate of fatal crashes was statistically negligible. For the purposes of the study, Masten and his colleagues considered GDL programs that prohibit teens from driving after 1 a.m. and carrying certain passengers to be "stronger," while they considered programs with just one of those restrictions to be "weaker." In states with weaker programs, fatal crash rates were 16% lower among 16-year-olds and 10% higher among 18-year-olds than in states with neither of the two key restrictions.
