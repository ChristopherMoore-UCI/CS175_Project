-- A Venezuelan mayor who says President Hugo Chavez is persecuting him on trumped-up corruption charges is seeking political asylum in Peru, his lawyer said Tuesday. Manuel Rosales, a leading political opponent who lost the 2006 presidential race to Hugo Chavez, faces corruption charges in Venezuela. "According to the jurisprudential traditions of Peru and the historic traditions of asylum, Peru has to accept this petition for asylum, because it concerns a political leader, a man of great responsibility, and because Hugo Chavez has made impassioned public declarations against him in plazas and stadiums," attorney Javier Valle Riestra told CNN en Espa√±ol. Manuel Rosales, mayor of Maracaibo in Venezuela's Zulia state, is seeking asylum in Peru. Rosales denies the allegation and says Chavez is out to get him for political reasons, and is persecuting him on trumped-up corruption charges.
