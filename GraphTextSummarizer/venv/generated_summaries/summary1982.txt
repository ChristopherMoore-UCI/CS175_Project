In a 5-4 decision, Supreme Court on Wednesday struck down limits on the total amount people can donate to various political campaigns in an election season, a blow to federal election laws ahead of November's congressional midterm elections. The Roberts court believes in a simple idea -- spending money in political campaigns is the equivalent of political speech. Because the First Amendment prohibits most limits on speech, most limits on political contributions are in the process of being struck down. Chief Justice Roberts' opinion said that campaign contributions can be regulated by Congress, but only under narrow circumstances. The decision was 5-4, so the four dissenters want to preserve campaign finance limits.
