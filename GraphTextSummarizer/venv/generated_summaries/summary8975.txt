Police told CNN that another person with weapons and explosives had been taken to court Wednesday, but privacy laws prevented them from sharing more details. Despite the incident's proximity to the site of the G-20 summit, there are no specific signs it's linked to the meeting, said Constable Samantha Nulle of Peel Regional Police. The sessions will offer a first appearance on the world stage for British Prime Minister David Cameron and Japanese Prime  Minister Naoto Kan. Police said McCullough was charged with one count of possessing dangerous weapons -- an offense with a maximum sentence of 10 years. The spotlight is on security -- as well as economic recovery plans -- as leaders from the world's biggest economies gather in Toronto for a pair of summits this weekend.
