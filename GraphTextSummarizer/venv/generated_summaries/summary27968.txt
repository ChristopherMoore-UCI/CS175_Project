Dodd told CNN on Wednesday that he was responsible for language added to the stimulus bill to make sure that existing contracts for bonuses at companies receiving federal bailout money were honored. "We intend to hold Sen. Dodd accountable for his record in what is shaping up to be an extremely competitive race in a traditionally blue state," said NRSC spokeswoman Amber Wilkerson. At the Enfield event Friday, Dodd said that he was misled on the issue of bonuses for AIG executives. Dodd initially denied that he had anything to do with the language that AIG used to justify paying out millions in bonuses. -- Fallout from anger over AIG's bonuses is following Sen. Chris Dodd from Washington back home to Connecticut.
