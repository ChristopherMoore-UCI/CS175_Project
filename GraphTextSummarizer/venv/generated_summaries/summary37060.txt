One of the first things doctors will do is try to get Giffords back to a regular schedule, said Dr. Alan Novick, medical director of rehabilitation for Memorial Healthcare System. One immediate worry is an infection in her brain, according to Dr. Greg Zorman, chief of neurosurgery at Memorial Healthcare System in southern Florida. "In our everyday lives, there are snippets of info coming in all at once, and we integrate multiple things that are going on at the same time," said Dr. Ross Zafonte, chairman of the department of physical medicine and rehabilitation at Harvard Medical School. Surgeons in Arizona implanted a drain to get rid of the fluid, and on Monday, Dr. Dong Kim, Giffords' neurosurgeon in Houston, removed the drain, saying she no longer needed it. "In the intensive care unit, patients get their days and nights mixed up." Rehab doctors will give Giffords a series of tests to assess her physical and cognitive abilities, he said.
