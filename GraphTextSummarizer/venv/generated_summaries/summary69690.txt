An April press release described the planned show this way: "After a decade of flipping houses for profit, brothers David Benham and Jason Benham now help families buy the homes they never thought they could afford. Twin brothers David and Jason Benham have lost their opportunity to host their own HGTV show. The Benham brothers were the planned stars of the HGTV show "Flip It Forward," set to premiere in October, in which they would have helped families purchase homes they otherwise could not afford. But after the post went public, HGTV tweeted, "HGTV has decided not to move forward with the Benham Brothers' series." Thursday night, Jason Benham told CNN's "Erin Burnett OutFront" that HGTV had vetted the pair. Right Wing Watch published a post about the pair, labeling David Benham as an "anti-gay, anti-choice extremist" for reportedly leading a prayer rally in 2012 outside of the Democratic National Convention held in Charlotte, North Carolina.
