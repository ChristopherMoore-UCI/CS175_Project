There is also a fear that change will bring instability. "The local opposition forces remain deeply divided and have yet to show true unity of purpose, command and control, and a socio-economic platform that the average Syrian can look to as a viable and stable alternative to the ruling Assad regime.

Most if not all of these groups are unhappy with how the Assad regime has managed Syria's nearly year-long unrest," he said.
