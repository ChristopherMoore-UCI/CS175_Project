Radel spoke to reporters after returning home to southwest Florida, hours after he pleaded guilty to misdemeanor cocaine possession. Federal agents approached Radel after he left the vehicle, and Radel dropped the cocaine to the street, according to court documents. He was charged after he bought 3.5 grams of cocaine from an undercover police officer in Washington's Dupont Circle area on October 29, court documents say. A tea party favorite, Radel was elected last year to represent southwest Florida's 19th Congressional District. " "Beyond that, this is between Rep. Radel, his family, and his constituents," Boehner's spokesman said.
