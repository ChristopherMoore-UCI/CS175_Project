-- California public television icon Huell Howser has died, his longtime station said Monday, an announcement that set off a flood of heartfelt condolences from his fans in the Golden State and beyond. That led to "California's Gold" and six other series about life in the Golden State, including "Visiting with Huell Howser," "Road Trip with Huell Howser," "California's Golden Parks," "California's Green," "California's Water" and "Downtown." Less than 20 minutes after KCET posted news of Howser's death on its Facebook page, more than 150 fans had posted responses mourning his loss and remembering his impact on California and their lives. He died Sunday night at his home in the Los Angeles area, said Ryan Morris of Huell Howser Productions. Six years later, Howser joined forces with KCET, a public television station, to produce a program known as "Videolog" showcasing the stories of all types of people.
