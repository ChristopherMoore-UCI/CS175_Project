Trimarco's story has become the basis of one of Argentina's most popular nighttime soap operas, "Vidas Robadas," or "Stolen Lives." The investigation that has followed has led police and Trimarco to believe that she was kidnapped and forced into prostitution, either in rural Argentina or Spain. "I am delighted that the show has been able to bring this topic to light, because no one ever talked about human trafficking in Argentina before," Trimarco said. Argentina passed its first national law against human trafficking this year, a law that Trimarco lobbied hard to get passed. Trimarco travels around Argentina constantly, educating people about human trafficking, and following up on clues about Marita.
