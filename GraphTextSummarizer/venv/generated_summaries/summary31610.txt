-- Manchester United and former England midfielder Paul Scholes announced his retirement Tuesday and will join the coaching staff of the English Premier League champions. Scholes won 10 Premier League titles with United and helped them to two Champions League triumphs. But with his club form still impeccable, England coach Fabio Capello reportedly tried to persuade him to return for last year's World Cup campaign in South Africa. " Scholes was part of the famous "Class of 92" which claimed the English FA Youth Cup in 1992 and included David Beckham, Nicky Butt and Gary Neville, who quit his United career earlier this season. He won 66 England caps and played at the 1998 and 2002 World Cups, but quit international football in 2004 at the age of 29.
