But when historians talk in the future about drones and the Obama White House, they won't  be referring to be the two-foot long quad copter that was discovered on the Southeast corner of the White House grounds  and sent Washington into a security-related lather early Monday morning, but rather to the unmanned aerial vehicles -- the Pentagon calls them UAVs -- like the one that was confirmed on Monday by the U.S. Government to have delivered its payload in Yemen. It was in 2010 that the Department of Justice lawyers wrote a secret memo for the Obama administration that argued extra-judcial killings of people suspected of being terrorists was justified under U.S. Law, even in the case of U.S. citizens thought to be plotting abroad. A spokesman for U.S. Customs and Border Patrol said U.S. authorities have not yet encountered a drone as part of the war on drugs. All of this is in the way of saying drones are taking on an increased importance in the U.S. economy and becoming more visible in the nation's airways. It is ironic that a drone could strike down near the White House -- as one did Monday morning -- since the issue of drone strikes is one that will follow President Barack Obama and mark his legacy.
