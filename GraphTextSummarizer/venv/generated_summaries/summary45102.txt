Griffith said the boy "may be brain dead," and the attorney's office expects to file first-degree murder charges against Dejesus as early as Wednesday night or Thursday. Lee Willie Dejesus, 23, of Homestead was arrested Tuesday and charged with aggravated child abuse and child neglect, according to the criminal complaint against him. Miami-Dade police said the incident occurred Monday night when Dejesus was watching the child while his mother was at work. The complaint alleges that Dejesus waited to call for medical help for as long as an hour after the boy became unresponsive. The boy -- identified by CNN affiliate WSVN as Willy Brown -- was on life support Wednesday and not expected to recover from his injuries, said Ed Griffith, spokesman for the Miami-Dade state attorney's office.
