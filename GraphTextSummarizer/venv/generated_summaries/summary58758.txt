You don't sustain a population of 10 million to 12 million illegal aliens without lots and lots of fake Social Security numbers. But Social Security numbers are notoriously prone to theft, fraud and tampering. The IRS counted more than 400,000 cases of theft of Social Security numbers in the 18 months from mid-2009 to the end of 2011. The card would have encrypted information useful to prevent social service fraud; for example, the number of children you have so you can't enroll for more benefits than for which you qualify. Many expect Justice Department action against the Texas law.
