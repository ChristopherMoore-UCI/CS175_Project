Wildland firefighters are a group, Vicki Minor says, that tends to be scattered throughout the country, and their work often takes them far from home. Minor, a 2008 CNN Hero, created the Wildland Firefighter Foundation to provide emergency funds and long-term assistance to families who often have nowhere else to turn. The assistance not only helps families get through hard times, it helps them feel that they are still a part of the wildland firefighter community. We've got women and family members who will be supporting these people after everything calms down. Minor arrived in Prescott, Arizona, shortly after the tragedy and has already provided financial assistance to 12 of the 19 families.
