-- Once upon a time, work took place outside of the home during designated hours. Despite the monumental shift in the accessibility of work, organizations continue to offer employees the same advice they did before the invention of the BlackBerry: Seek work/life balance. Instead of endorsing the work-life balance myth, organizations are far better off empowering employees to integrate work and life, in ways that position them to succeed at both. Flexible work schedules allow employees in both camps to leverage their best hours instead of conforming to an artificial eight-hour "shift" -- one that was originally designed to maximize the productivity of a factory, not human beings. For one thing, placing employees in control of their schedules encourages them to work during hours when they are most effective, instead of requiring them to sit comatose in front of a computer because it's not yet 5 p.m. Most adults function best in the first few hours after waking.
