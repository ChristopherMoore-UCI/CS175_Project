In a way, the state and evolution of libraries and literature is a litmus test of Myanmar's development and change since the military leadership formally stepped aside in 2011 -- as the new translation of "Burmese Days" shows. Years later, when the Internet finally arrived in Myanmar and the country was still under the control of the military junta, the library was one of the few places where users could access international news and uncensored information, says Susana Galvan, director of Education and Arts at the British Council. According to a survey by the Asia Foundation, almost 90% of books at libraries such as this one are religious texts. In 2012, Aung San Suu Kyi established the non-profit Daw Khin Kyi Foundation -- mobile libraries set up to compensate for the crumbling libraries. As the military consolidated its control, the original British Council library was closed down.
