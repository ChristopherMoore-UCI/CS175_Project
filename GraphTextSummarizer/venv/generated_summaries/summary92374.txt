Women's rights groups responded angrily Tuesday to comments by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan that women and men are not equal "because their nature is different. " Hailing the achievement of motherhood, he cited the needs of pregnant women or nursing mothers as examples of why women could not be equal to men in the workplace. "You cannot bring women and men into equal positions; that is against nature because their nature is different. They also argued that the rejection of universal equality is an important factor in increased violence against women. According to Turkey's semiofficial Anadolu news agency, Erdogan also insisted his government has always been behind women in their struggle for equal rights and said it would continue to support them.
