-- A motorcyclist has been charged with pulling a driver from his SUV and beating him in a clash with bikers on a Manhattan roadway that was captured on video, New York authorities said Saturday. When his SUV was surrounded by several bikers, Lien called 911, told police he feared for his life and drove off, running over bikers and critically injuring one. Kaliq Douglas, 27, of Brooklyn, did not enter a plea during his arraignment on allegations of gang assault and assault with intent to cause bodily injury, according to the Manhattan District Attorney's Office. Authorities say Alexander Lien was chased by bikers after he initially bumped one during a biker rally on September 29. The NYPD, which has appealed for the public's help in identifying people in photos, hasn't ruled out more arrests or charges.
