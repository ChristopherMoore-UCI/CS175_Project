Pirates have captured more than 50 ships this year off Somalia and are currently holding 12, including the fishing vessel Alakrana, Spanish Defense Minister Carme Chacon said recently. More than half of this year's attacks were carried out by suspected Somali pirates off the east coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden, a major shipping route between Yemen and Somalia. -- An oil tanker bound for the United States was hijacked off Somalia with a crew of 28 aboard, maritime authorities said. The crew consists of 16 Filipinos, nine Greeks, two Ukrainians and a Romanian, said the security agency, which is run by the European naval force. The first nine months of this year have seen more pirate attacks than all of last year, the bureau reported on October 21.
