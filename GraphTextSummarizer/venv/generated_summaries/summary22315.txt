Jim Messina, Obama's 2012 campaign manager, has joined the pro-Clinton super PAC Priorities USA as a co-chairman, and White House advisor John Podesta is expected to leave his post soon and is considered a top pick for Clinton campaign manager. The grassroots organizing group geared towards a Clinton run, Ready for Hillary, has signed on 270 Strategies, the firm launched by top Obama campaign aides Mitch Stewart and Jeremy Bird. " It's signed by both low-level field staffers and researchers and a handful of more prominent Obama alums, including Rajeev Chopra, who served as chief information officer for both of Obama's presidential campaigns; Judith Freeman, who was new media field manager on the 2008 campaign; and Catherine Bracy, who directed the tech field office for Obama's reelection fight in San Francisco. The letter draws parallels between Obama's come-from-behind insurgent candidacy and Warren, who would enter the race an underdog against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton if the latter runs, as expected. More than 300 former Obama campaign staffers signed an open letter Friday morning urging Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren to run for president in 2016.
