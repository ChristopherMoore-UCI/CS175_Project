In the ruling Tuesday, Judge Carl Barbier notes the similar contractual indemnity issues between Transocean and Halliburton, and accordingly left it open as to whether Halliburton would also be held liable for punitive damages or civil penalties under the Clean Water Act. -- A federal judge in New Orleans has ruled that Halliburton is not liable for the some of the compensatory damages sought by third parties in the worst oil spill in U.S. history, leaving BP responsible for the majority of those claims. Last September, the government issued a formal report on the oil spill, finding that BP, Transocean and Halliburton all shared responsibility for the explosion, but that BP was "ultimately responsible" for operations at the site "in a way that ensured the safety and protection of personnel, equipment, natural resources, and the environment." Halliburton was contracted by BP to cement the Macondo well that was the source of the oil spill, and had argued its contract protected the energy company from legal action resulting from its work. "BP is required to indemnify Halliburton for third-party compensatory claims that arise from pollution or contamination that did not originate from the property or equipment of Halliburton located above the surface of the land or water, even if Halliburton's gross negligence caused the pollution," the order states.
