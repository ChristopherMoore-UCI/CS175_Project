Nor does he mention that numerous distinguished Americans have come out publicly in favor of clemency, including former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, former Attorney General Michael Mukasey, former Vice President Dan Quayle, former CIA Director James Woolsey, former Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Dennis DeConcini, dozens of members of Congress and many others. The most recent manifestation of this phenomenon is the June 16 opinion piece by Roland Martin, "Israel wrong to demand release of American traitor." Mr. Pollard is serving his 27th year of an unprecedented sentence of life in prison for delivering classified information to the state of Israel, a close ally of the United States. For example, Martin refers confidently to Pollard's "trial," and says that during his "trial," Pollard was accused of attempting to pass classified information to Pakistan and other countries. Then again, Martin claims Mr. Pollard had a trial and committed treason. And Pollard was never charged by the United States with passing (or attempting to pass) classified information to any country other than Israel, for the very simple reason that he never attempted to do so.
