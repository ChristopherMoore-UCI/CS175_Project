The U.S. got on the board when Solheim Cup standout Morgan Pressel teamed with Jessica Korda -- the daughter of retired tennis grand-slam winner Petr Korda -- to down Catriona Matthew and Jodi Ewart Shadoff 3 and 2. She's joined by 17-year-old Charley Hull, who became the youngest participant in Solheim Cup history when she later played in the fourball matches. Swedish pair Anna Nordqvist and Caroline Hedwall earned Europe's first point by upsetting British Open champion Stacy Lewis and Lizette Salas 4 and 2 before Suzann Pettersen and Beatriz Recari topped Brittany Lang and Angela Stanford 2 and 1. Pressel, though, improved to 8-2-2 in the Solheim Cup as she played alongside rookie Korda. While world No. 3 Pettersen is a veteran, Recari is one of six Solheim Cup rookies on the European team.
