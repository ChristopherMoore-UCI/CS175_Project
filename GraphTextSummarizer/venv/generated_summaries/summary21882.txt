Minow is the daughter of former Federal Communications Commission head Newt Minow. In her mid-50s, Minow replaced as dean the woman considered near the top of potential high court nominees, Elena Kagan, now solicitor general. Harvard Law school dean Martha Minow has been on the school's faculty since 1981. Two women who were not on other published lists of potential candidates are now being seriously considered. One name mentioned by some analysts for years as a potential blockbuster choice has been all but ruled out for consideration.
