"Piers Morgan Tonight" airs weeknights on CNN/US at 9 p.m. ET and on CNN International at 0200 GMT (Live simulcast), 1200 GMT and 2000 GMT / HKT 2000 CNN -- "If Charlie [Sheen] is to sort his life out," Piers Morgan asked Denise Richards. Richards opened up about her recent adoption of a baby girl, whom she named Eloise Joni Richards. "If anyone would know, it would be Charlie," said Richards, referring to Sheen's well-documented testimony in Fleiss' 1995 trial that he had spent over $50,000 on 27 hookers. Richards told Morgan that she and Sheen have been split up for six years. Morgan asked Richards about her take on "the recent circus of Charlie's life." "From the beginning of it I was very worried," she said.
