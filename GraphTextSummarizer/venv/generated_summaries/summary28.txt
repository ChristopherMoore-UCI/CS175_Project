There is a long history of government programs securing their political strength through sheer numbers. While the program still faces many challenges and numerous Republicans remained determined to keep attacking, the news that 7 million people have enrolled through the health care exchanges is a big victory for President Barack Obama and his supporters. As that number increases, opponents of ACA will be going after the benefits of many millions of Americans -- not just the President. In American politics, there is strength in numbers. As farmers, farms and the entire agricultural industry came to depend on federal government assistance to ensure that prices remained stable, legislators shied away from trying to fix the program.
