Another scene suggested that Greene's character was arrested with a Swiss banker and that he arranged a meeting with the banker to help Belfort launder money, the suit said. "The motion picture included other scenes depicting Mr. Greene's character in a reckless and depraved manner, including more than one scene wherein his character is depicted having sexual relations with a prostitute." Greene's real-life nickname is "Wigwam," because he often wears a hairpiece, the complaint said. The federal lawsuit said it was "readily apparent" that the character Nicky "Rugrat" Koskoff, played by actor P.J. Byrne, was based on Greene. Greene, a lifelong friend of Belfort, served as the firm's head of corporate finance in the 1990s. "In one scene, Mr. Greene's character is depicted shaving a woman's head after Jordan Belfort's character states the woman was offered $10,000," the complaint said.
