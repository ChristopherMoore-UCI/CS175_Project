Neil Barofsky, The independent watchdog appointed to investigate the TARP program, wrote in his book, "Bailout: An Inside Account of How Washington Abandoned Main Street While Rescuing Wall Street," that the federal government committed $23.7 trillion in various initiatives to save the financial industry. It is clear that Wall Street doesn't care about American consumers, except to keep them shackled in debt through sky high credit card balances, thus allowing the financial industry to make billions off the high interest rates. Mitt Romney, who made his millions in private equity, is most certainly the guy Wall Street is betting big on. Romney seems to want Wall Street to keep doing what it's been doing, offering no specifics on what kinds of regulations should be imposed to put it in check. So we should recognize Romney's recipe of ideas as a disaster for consumers and a boon for Wall Street.
