The stadium tax Fees for new stadiums and concert halls are technically not new, and technically they're not even controlled by car rental companies. "Apparently the city is trying to pay for part of the Sprint Center through car rental fees," he told me. Car rental companies typically don't charge their customers for cancellations, so Swofford, who frequently rents from Hertz, said he didn't want another car he'd reserved for later. It's easy to see why car rental companies are taking these steps. At best, car rental companies are coming up with new and confusing names for their fees.
