The beating occurred when her father was punishing her for using the Internet "to acquire music and games that were unavailable for legal purchase at the time," Hillary Adams, wrote on the Internet posting. The move to allow the judge back on the bench angered Adams' former wife and daughter. The video posting said, "Judge William Adams is not fit to be anywhere near the law system if he can't even exercise fit judgment as a parent himself. I see the justice system is failing and justice review system is failing." Hillary Adams, the judge's daughter, was also upset. Adams was suspended last year after the 2004 video went public.
