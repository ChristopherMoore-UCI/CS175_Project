"In the ensuing almost six years, he had legally and morally good conduct, he was reinstated in sex offender treatment and the undisputed evidence supported community placement and treatment." Judge G. Todd Baugh said he gave 47-year-old Stacey Dean Rambold "the right kind of sentence:" 31 days in jail and more than 14 years on probation. After Morales' death, the state offered to defer prosecution if Rambold agreed to undergo sex offender counseling and live under other restrictions. Rambold had sexual relations with Morales in fall 2007, when she was 14 and a student in one of his classes at Billings Senior High in Billings, Montana. In his response to a complaint filed against him with the Montana Judicial Standards Commission, Baugh acknowledges making controversial remarks about victim Cherise Morales at Rambold's sentencing in August.
