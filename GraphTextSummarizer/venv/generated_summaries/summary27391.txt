The very day that Boko Haram kidnapped the schoolgirls in April, just a day after it set off a bomb at a bus stop killing over 70 innocent victims, President Jonathan reportedly danced and sang at a political rally for himself and his ruling party as general elections approach in February 2015. As a result of all this, fears are growing that government claims of the girls' imminent release is a public relations stunt designed for election year consumption and to divert attention from the Jonathan administration's problems. After all, kidnapping is one of the most important sources of Boko Haram financing, and the girls' return will certainly come at a heavy price. Up to this point, the inaction and/or ineptitude of President Goodluck Jonathan's administration in managing both Boko Haram and the liberation of the kidnapped girls has prompted heavy criticism within Nigeria and abroad. The announcement came as a surprise, since the administration of President Goodluck Jonathan had refused to negotiate for the girls' release up to that point.
