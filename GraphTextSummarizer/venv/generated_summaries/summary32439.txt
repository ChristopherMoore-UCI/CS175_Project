"The lava spread out and ignited the house before noon local time," said USGS spokeswoman Janet Baab. While the main lava flow has been stalled for a week, a smaller side flow of lava oozed out toward the home, according to Hawaii County's Civil Defense Agency. There is nothing residents can do about the 2,000-degree Fahrenheit river of lava that's been inching towards their town since June 27. "It's very difficult for the homeowners, because it's a stop-and-go phenomenon," said Darryl Oliveira, the civil defense agency's administrator. Evacuation advisories for residents down slope of the lava flow will continue as needed, officials said.
