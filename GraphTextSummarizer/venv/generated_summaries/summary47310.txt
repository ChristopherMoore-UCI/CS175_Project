That's because "fragmentation" makes it more complicated to develop Android apps that will run on most Android phones. That's not the most recent version of Android (so far 4.0 "Ice Cream Sandwich" runs on only a handful of phones and tablets), but it's robust enough to run the vast majority of Android apps well. Screen size and resolution are also key variables for creating Android apps. And over 60% of Android app sessions came from phones with a screen resolution of 800 x 480 pixels -- such as Samsung's popular Galaxy S series of phones. Nearly three-fourths of Android app usage came from devices running some version of Android 2.3 "Gingerbread."
