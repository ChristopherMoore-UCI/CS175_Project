While the late Neil Armstrong's "one small step for man," as we began our exploration of the Moon back in July 1969, is ageless, so, too, is Spock's iconic "live long and prosper," a phrase that also spans time and space. During the next few years we must choose whether we rebound as a vibrant nation leading our global civilization toward a permanent presence beyond Earth, or relinquish American leadership in space. Thanks to Mr. Spock, the stage is set -- in more ways than one -- to continue our voyage outward into deep space. I recently testified before Congress, and in my opinion, there is no more convincing way to demonstrate American leadership for the remainder of this century than on July 20, 2019, the 50th anniversary of our landing on the moon, to commit to and strive toward a permanent human presence on Mars. Indeed, there are strange new worlds to explore -- to seek out new life and start new civilizations.
