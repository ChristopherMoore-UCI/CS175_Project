By comparison, heart disease was blamed for nearly 600,000 deaths in 2010 and cancer about 575,000 -- but those numbers are going down, while deaths from Alzheimer's are going up. Of those, nearly a quarter developed Alzheimer's, and the disease was the cause of death in about 400 people, James said. "Death certificates are well known to underreport deaths from Alzheimer's and other types of dementia," said James, the lead author of the study published Wednesday. Overwhelming burden, cost of Alzheimer's to triple, report says James and his colleagues -- co-workers at Rush University in Chicago and at two California institutions, the University of California-San Francisco and the Veterans Affairs Medical Center there -- then statistically extrapolated their results to arrive at their estimate of 503,000 Alzheimer's deaths a year. Now, a study of aging patients suggests its true toll may top half a million lives a year -- a figure that would put Alzheimer's just below heart disease and cancer on the list of America's top killers.
