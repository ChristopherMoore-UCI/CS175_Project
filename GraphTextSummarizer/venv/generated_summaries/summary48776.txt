He and other Republicans claimâ€”ludicrously--that President Obama needs to secure the border and that they can't trust him to enforce immigration laws Why is this ludicrous? Then they blame President Obama for sending the wrong signals to other countries? Here is an example: On Tuesday a group of protesters in Oracle, Arizona, whipped up by a local sheriff known for his extremist views on immigration, mistakenly blocked a bus full of YMCA children. The fact is this president has tripled enforcement resources on the border and doubled the number of border patrol agents, which is more than any other president in recent history has done. Texas Gov. Rick Perry said this past Sunday that President Obama's request for emergency funding did not include enough money for border security.
