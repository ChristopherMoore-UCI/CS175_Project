-- Two cosmonauts and an American astronaut were on their way back to Earth from the International Space Station Saturday morning after engineers used jumper cables to fix a glitch that delayed their departure, NASA said. They are scheduled to land in Kazakhstan on Saturday morning after spending 176 days in space and 174 aboard the station. According to NASA, a Soyuz space capsule took the first crew to the orbiting laboratory in November 2000. After the February 2003 Columbia accident, the Soyuz became the means of transportation for crew members going to or returning from the International Space Station.
