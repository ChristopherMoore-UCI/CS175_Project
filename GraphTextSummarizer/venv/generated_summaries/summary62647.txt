-- Bayern Munich sacked coach Louis van Gaal Sunday after poor results threatened their participation in next season's Champions League. But their form in the German league this season has been poor, trailing runaway leaders Borussia Dortmund, while defeat to Inter in their Champions League last 16 clash last month ended their hopes of silverware. Van Gaal took Bayern to the domestic double last season and they lost in the final of the Champions League to Inter Milan. Currently in fourth, Bayern need to finish in the top two to gain automatic entry into the Champions League next season, with third place going into the final qualifying round. A statement on the club's official website said the decision had been taken in the "interests of the club as a whole." It added that the draw meant Bayern had slipped back into fourth place in the Bundesliga "increasing the danger of the club failing to hit its minimum target for the season, the chance of qualifying for the UEFA Champions League." Van Gaal, 59, was informed of his sacking on return from Nuremberg.
