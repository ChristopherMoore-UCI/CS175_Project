Road-testing the new material this summer by mixing it up with hits such as "6th Avenue Heartache," "One Headlight" and "The Difference" on a mini-tour has given the band a chance to see how audiences respond or even who that audience is anymore. For now, the band -- guitarist Stuart Mathis, bassist Greg Richling, new drummer Jack Irons and Jaffee -- has enough cleverness to tide them over on "Glad," which includes such rousing new tracks as "Hospital for Sinners," "Misfits and Lovers" and "Reboot the Mission," featuring one of Dylan's guitar heroes, Mick Jones. "It's probably happened before (to Bob Dylan), and I don't know that he's necessarily be by bothered by that or expect the guy to resign." While Lehrer's fabrications went against the ethics and standards of his profession, the songwriting community is more open to invention and interpretation. -- "Well, if it's a comeback you want, then get your hands raised," Jakob Dylan declares on the Wallflowers' first album in seven years, "Glad All Over." Rob Thomas claimed recently that the Wallflowers were considering naming the new album "North," but Matchbox Twenty (orchestrating a comeback of their own?) beat them to it, a claim Dylan laughs about.
