Jolie's mother died of ovarian cancer, and the actress has a gene mutation that makes her chances of developing breast cancer and ovarian cancer much higher than the overall population. Angelina Jolie's essay in the New York Times revealing that she had her ovaries and Fallopian tubes removed to lower her risk of cancer provoked an outpouring of support as the news spread across social media. Jolie, 39, wrote that she had opted for the surgery after blood tests revealed markers that might have been an indication of early cancer.

Others saw an opportunity for helping educate women and advocate for their health, a cause near and dear to Jolie's own heart.
