The Atlantic's Alexis Madrigal got an inside look at the previously undisclosed program, which was headed by MIT roboticist Nick Roy and Google[x] lab director Astro Teller. UAVs can rise above traffic congestion, make a beeline for remote locations where roads are shoddy or nonexistent, and potentially cut down on pollution by replacing cars or trucks. "What excited us from the beginning was that if the right thing could find anybody just in the moment that they need it, the world might be a radically better place," Teller told Madrigal. The technology giant started running its first test flights earlier this month as part of Project Wing, a secretive, 2-year-old program exploring drone delivery. Google is the latest company to branch out into delivery by drone, it revealed Thursday.
