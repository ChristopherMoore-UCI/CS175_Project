Restaurants, clubs and the festival immediately shut down and the parties turned into bumper-to-bumper traffic jams as residents headed to higher ground. Earlier, local television showed images of bumper-to-bumper traffic on roads leading from the coast to higher ground. The tsunami was spawned by a sizable earthquake in western British Columbia, prompting a local tsunami warning. The Alaska Tsunami Warning Center issued a warning for western British Columbia from Vancouver to the southern panhandle of Alaska. Canadians as far away as Prince Rupert, on mainland British Columbia, felt the quake.
