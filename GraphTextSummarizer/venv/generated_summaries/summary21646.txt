"He says he was hiding in the attic," said Falcon's father, meteorologist Richard Heene, clutching his son. -- After scouring northern Colorado by foot and air, frantically chasing a Mylar balloon for miles and repeatedly interviewing his big brother, authorities ended the search for 6-year-old Falcon Heene where it began -- at his house. 6-year-old Falcon Heene says he was hiding in a box in the attic while authorities were searching for him. The story took a turn when ABC said that Falcon's parents, science enthusiasts Richard and Mayumi Heene, were featured on the 100th episode of ABC's prime-time program "Wife Swap" in March 2009. Authorities began to fear the worst after reports surfaced that a box possibly carrying Falcon may have fallen off the balloon.
