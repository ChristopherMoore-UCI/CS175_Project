We owe it to ourselves, our soldiers and our children to take a more careful look at our foreign policy, to not rush into war, and to not attempt to score political points with wrongheaded policy ideas. Before taking our country closer to war, shouldn't we at least ask the viewpoint of the significant Christian population in Syria? This "act first, think later" foreign policy has real consequences. Al-Assad is by no means a saint but Christians flocked to Syria from a war-torn Iraq because they feared al-Assad less than the Islamic government we brought into being. No president, Republican or Democrat, has the unilateral power to take our nation to war without the authority of the legislature.
