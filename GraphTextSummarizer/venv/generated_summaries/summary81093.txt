Orange sweep Later, Dutch dominance in speed skating continued apace in the women's 1500 meters event but hot favorite Ireen Wust had to give second best to compatriot Jorien Ter Moors in the battle for gold. The 28-year-old Jansrud won bronze in the downhill last week so his triumph was not entirely unexpected while Miller's teammate Weibrecht had claimed the super-G bronze in Vancouver four years before enduring a period of poor results.
