As for comedy actresses, Tina Fey, Edie Falco and Julia Louis-Dreyfus have all won Emmys for their respective roles on "30 Rock," "Nurse Jackie" and "Veep." Fey might get the sentimental vote for being the show's creator and the show having its last season, but it's also time for her pal Amy Poehler to get a win for "Parks and Recreation." Photos: What we'll miss most from '30 Rock' Outstanding TV movie/miniseries "Game Change" was a clear favorite in the TV movie/miniseries category last year, and this year, it's Steven Soderbergh's "Behind the Candelabra," starring Michael Douglas as Liberace and Matt Damon as his lover, Scott Thorson, with 15 nominations. (Unfortunately, historically Emmy voters tend not to favor fantasy shows, save for "Lost" before its supernatural elements became prominent). ("Mad Men" was shut out last year, and if the Creative Arts Emmys this year are any indication, "Game of Thrones" won't sweep). The real race is between defending champion "Homeland," which won last year for its freshman season, and "Breaking Bad," which has better odds to triumph given that the critically acclaimed show's fifth season is its last.
