-- A 6.7-magnitude earthquake struck near Vancouver Island, British Columbia, on Friday afternoon, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Many people on Vancouver Island felt the quake, especially those in high-rises, which swayed back and forth, said John Cassidy of the Geological Survey in Victoria, British Columbia. The shaking lasted 10 to 20 seconds, Cassidy said, and there were no reports of damage or injuries Friday afternoon. The center of the earthquake was approximately 175 miles west of the city of Vancouver and nearly 50 miles underground. CNN's Deanna Proeller and Michael Martinez contributed to this report.
