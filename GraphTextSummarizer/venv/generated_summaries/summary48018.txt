People say: "The U.S. could become Europe if we keep accumulating debt." Yet America's debt burden is already higher than France's, and markets accept U.S. debt with profound calm. It was a crisis caused by issuing debt in a currency (gold back then, euros now) that the issuing government did not control. Many Americans perceive the euro crisis as a crisis of government deficits and government debt. European financial institutions may lose the ability to repay U.S. creditors, inflicting more losses on an already traumatized U.S. financial system. At that point, the federal government refused to release any more gold, and the country plunged into one of the worst depressions in U.S. history, exceeded only by the Great Depression of the 1930s.
