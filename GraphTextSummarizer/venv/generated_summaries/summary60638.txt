Instead, as Lewis and others expressed to me, it was their own response to seeing the film that compelled such personages as Charles Phillips, CEO of Infor, Ken Chenault, the CEO of American Express, Tony Coles, former CEO of Onyx Pharmaceuticals, Ursula Burns CEO of Xerox, Edith Cooper, Goldman Sachs' Global Head of Human Capital Management, and 22 others to shape, develop and implement their plan in a series of email exchanges over one weekend. The push to expose students to "Selma" speaks to their desire that young people today be aware of our rich history and the continuing advocacy still needed for racial equality. For many African-Americans, the civil rights challenges of 2015 have served as a sobering reminder of the ongoing salience of race and racism in American life. It started right on New Year's Eve with one prominent businessman posing a simple question to a few of his close friends and fellow business leaders:  "How can we make sure that young people will see this movie?" "Selma" has the potential to play a similar role, engaging young people with a history that has powerful resonance for the challenges and struggles we confront today, and bringing to life the courage, the determination and humanity of a generation of African-Americans on whose shoulders we all stand.
