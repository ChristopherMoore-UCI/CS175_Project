Police found Peters, 55, and her daughter Mary Corinne Peters, 19, Tuesday evening after city officials asked them to check on the family's welfare when the mayor did not show up for a scheduled council meeting. Stover said close friends only learned of Peters' financial struggles after her death. "I think that the weight of it all became too much for her," said Doug Stover, who preceded Jayne Peters as mayor of Coppell, Texas. Peters was elected mayor in May 2009 and had been a member of the city council since 1998. "She felt unfortunately, for her, this was the only option she had." Police in Coppell said last week that Peters shot and killed her 19-year-old daughter before turning the gun on herself.
