Democrats appear ready to tap current House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California as the new minority leader, while also keeping Maryland Rep. Steny Hoyer and South Carolina Rep. Jim Clyburn in the leadership. GOP senators face a tough vote Tuesday on whether to ban earmarks, a policy House Republicans already have in place and are expected to keep in the new Congress. House Republicans want a nearly yearlong extension, but with funding cut to 2008 levels. At the same time, House Democrats are pushing a measure to give Social Security recipients a $250 payment to make up for not getting a cost-of- living adjustment this year because inflation is low. The Senate must also take up ratification of the nuclear arms reduction treaty with Russia, a long-stalled food safety measure, an extension of unemployment benefits for the long-term jobless and funding for the settlement of a discrimination suit by black farmers.
