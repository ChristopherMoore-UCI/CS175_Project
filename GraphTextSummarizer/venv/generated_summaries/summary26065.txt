According to Aberdeen University, the drug works by dissolving these tau fibers to prevent a build up of tangles which destroy nerve cells and neurons critical for memory. In a statement on the university's Web site, Professor Claude Wischik, Chairman of TauRx Therapeutics and Professor of Psychiatric Geratology and Old Age Psychiatry at the University of Aberdeen's Institute of Medical Sciences, who led the research, said: "This is an unprecedented result in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. The pioneering research -- a joint initiative between the University of Aberdeen in the UK and Singapore-based TauRx Therapeutics -- was announced this week at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference on Alzheimer's Disease (ICAD 2008) in Chicago. Tangles are made up of the protein, tau, which forms inside nerve cells in the brain. The product -- remberTM -- is the first drug to act on the "tangles" discovered by Alois Alzheimer over a century ago.
