Over the last few years, the Balkan country has produced a string of global male and female tennis superstars -- from former world number ones Ana Ivanovic and Jelena Jankovic to singles and doubles champion Nenad Zimonjic. -- Grand slam triumphs, world number one rankings, Olympic medals -- Serbia, a country of just over seven million people, has defied crushing odds and financial difficulties to emerge in recent years as an unlikely tennis powerhouse. Since the dark days of the conflict, the country has sought to find equilibrium for an economy that was subject to years of mismanagement, suffered infrastructure damage during NATO bombings and endured extended economic sanctions. "In the past, we didn't have that much success in individual sports but it turned out to be that our generation was maybe the beginning of something new -- you know to have world number ones, for such a small country, it was amazing. Yet, despite the limited financial backing and crumbling facilities, Serbia's tennis future still looks bright as a new generation of young athletes is determined to follow on the footsteps of their compatriot superstars.
