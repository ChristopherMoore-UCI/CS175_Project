-- Substance abuse, addiction and its consequences cost U.S. governmental bodies nearly $500 billion in 2005 with only a fraction of state and federal dollars spent on prevention and treatment, according to a report released Thursday. Of the $373.9 billion spent by federal and state governments, some 95.6 percent was spent to "shovel up the consequences and human wreckage of substance abuse and addiction," while only 1.9 percent was spent on prevention and treatment, 1.4 percent on taxation and regulation, and less than 1 percent on research and interdiction, says the report from Columbia University's National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse. "States spend more on substance abuse and addiction than they spend on Medicaid, higher education, transportation or justice," it says. "Despite a significant and growing body of knowledge documenting that addiction is a preventable, treatable and manageable disease, and despite the proven efficacy of prevention and treatment techniques, our nation still looks the other way while substance abuse and addiction cause illness, injury, death and crime, savage our children, overwhelm social service systems, impede education -- and slap a heavy and growing tax on our citizens," Susan Foster, the addiction center's vice president and director of policy research and analysis, said in a written statement. The center found that if substance abuse and addiction were its own category within the federal budget, it would rank sixth in size behind Social Security, national defense, Medicare and two other programs, consuming 9.6 percent of the entire budget.
