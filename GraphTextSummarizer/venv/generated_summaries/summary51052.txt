By showing how we are coming together, networking with people to find solutions for helping them, I pray that other areas around the U.S. will come together with their local people to make a difference. I want to cry thinking that CNN and people recognize the poverty that is out there so we can help even more people. CNN: What do you want people to know most about your work? And with this recession right now, there are a lot of people in extreme desperate need. I grew up as a little boy watching her cry through our utilities being off, of us being evicted, of us having little food, and with her pride of not letting people know.
