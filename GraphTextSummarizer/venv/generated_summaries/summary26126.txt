The following week in Santiago de Cuba, I noticed a Castro quote on a sign that read "La grandeza de un estado se mide por la forma en que brinda attencion a los discapacitados" which roughly translates to "the greatness of a country is measured by how it treats its disabled." And while there will certainly be critics pointing out what the deal with Cuba does not contain -- such as removal of the Castro regime -- it is important not to limit discussion about our relationship with Cuba to one family's ascendance to power. In addition to his annexation of Crimea and invading the Ukraine earlier this year, Putin has quietly been re-establishing Russia's ties with Cuba. When President Obama's critics demand we seek some say in Cuba's future leadership ask them about our history of picking leaders for other nations. Here we are decades later, Cubans are once again hurting economically because of our actions...should we sit back and allow an anti-U.S. sentiment to encourage Cuba to side with Russia once again?
