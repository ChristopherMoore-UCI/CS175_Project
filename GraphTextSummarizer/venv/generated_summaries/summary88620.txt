Alan Gross was arrested in 2009 while working as a subcontractor on a U.S. Agency for International Development project aimed at spreading democracy. But Cuban authorities say Gross imported sensitive communications equipment to connect dissidents. Last year, Cuba's highest court upheld the 15-year sentence imposed on Gross for committing crimes against the security of the state -- charges Gross described as "laughable. Gross, 63, has been held in Cuba for two years and five months. " His case sank U.S.-Cuba relations to a new low after initial signs of thawing when President Barack Obama took office.
