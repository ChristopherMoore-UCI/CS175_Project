The list of requirements could include jointly owned property, shared child custody, joint bank accounts, joint credit cards, proof of a commitment ceremony and photographs of shared vacations and holidays with extended family, among other things. According to a spokesman for Immigration Equality, Vermont Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy intends to offer an amendment later this month allowing foreign-born individuals in committed same-sex relationships with Americans to apply for green cards. The bill "was not intended to cover everybody in every situation," Rubio told conservative radio talk show host Hugh Hewitt. Currently, such rights apply to only to foreign-born men or women in heterosexual marriages with U.S. citizens. A prominent gay rights advocacy group says a key congressional Democrat will push for new rights for same-sex couples in the Senate's immigration reform bill -- a move which could undermine the legislation's bipartisan support.
