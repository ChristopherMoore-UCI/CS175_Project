Dutch police researching corruption in professional football in 2009 identified groups dubbed "belchinezen" or "phone Chinese" -- groups of people of Asian descent standing in near-empty stadiums of even youth league matches phoning in results for gambling companies in China or South East Asia. The advent of the internet coupled with millions of illegal Chinese gamblers coming on stream has seriously skewed the market in soccer gambling. A cheeky group of contemporary artists -- the Yangjiang Group -- has almost made an industry from lampooning the Chinese love of illegal soccer gambling. With artworks like "Soccer Gambling -- Fiercer than a Tiger," a title swiped from a local newspaper headline, or pamphlets that at first glance look like Taoist temple augurs that are really thinly disguised soccer predictions, the artists' work attempts to show how much illegal betting is now part of Chinese cultural life. Europol's revelations that hundreds of matches have been fixed may have hit the industry in Europe, but will come as no surprise in soccer betting-crazy China.
