But who is Debrah Lee Charatan, the wife of millionaire heir Robert Durst? Charatan says she met Durst in 1988, six years after his first wife went missing. Like Durst himself, Charatan is a powerful player on the New York real estate scene. The series also includes excerpts from jailhouse recordings of phone conversations between Durst and Charatan. Recorded jailhouse calls from Durst's imprisonment during that case suggest that Charatan was his rock.
