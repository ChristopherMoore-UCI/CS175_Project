More than 200,000 dolls from China, apparently shipped for holiday gift-giving, won't be going to any American children because U.S. authorities seized the shipments and alleged the toys contained banned chemical compounds, officials said Tuesday. Tenenbaum said her agency and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection have been targeting dangerous imports at several major ports through the use of a risk management system. "Using advanced technology to track certain shipments before they reach our shores is helping CPSC better protect America's consumers," Consumer Product Safety Commission Chairman Inez Tenenbaum said in a statement. The U.S. Commercial Targeting and Analysis Center began targeting the shipments in April because they threatened children's safety, authorities said. U.S. authorities didn't identify the manufacturer of the toys Tuesday.
