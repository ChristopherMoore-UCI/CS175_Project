The side of a mountain broke off in the darkness of night and tore through remote Zhouqu, burying many homes and ripping others apart. The death toll doubled Tuesday to 702 people in massive mudslides triggered Sunday by rain in China's Gansu province, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported. -- Chinese soldiers frantically dug through the mud with shovels, even with their bare hands, Tuesday to reach the second story of an apartment building in northwestern Zhouqu County. Chen Jianhua, an official in Zhouqu, said 218 injured people had been treated at local hospitals, and 41 severely injured survivors had been transferred for treatment in the provincial capital of Lanzhou, according to Xinhua. After 60 hours trapped under mud, Liu Ma Shendeng was alive.
