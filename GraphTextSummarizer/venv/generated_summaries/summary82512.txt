However, I've spoken to Mr. Cowboy, I mean, Mr. Burke, and he didn't seem kooky to me at all. A federal judge's opinion includes side-by-side photos of the key players in The Naked Cowboy case. Judge Chin then explained that "beginning in April 2007, Mars began running an animated cartoon advertisement on two oversized video billboards in Times Square, featuring a blue M&M dressed "exactly like The Naked Cowboy," wearing only a white cowboy hat, cowboy boots, and underpants, and carrying a guitar." In fact, in a lengthy decision, Judge Chin ruled against the makers of M&Ms, rejecting Mars, Inc.'s attempt to dismiss the Cowboy's lawsuit. Although he performs in New York City's Times Square in little more than underwear and a smile, he has registered trademarks to "The Naked Cowboy" name and likeness.
