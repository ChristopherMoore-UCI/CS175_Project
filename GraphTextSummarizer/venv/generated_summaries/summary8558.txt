For 12 bloody, horrific months, Syrian dissidents and many world leaders have dreamt of one outcome for the Syrian crisis: the ouster of President Bashar al-Assad. As remote as it may seem, al-Assad's downfall could come in the form of an internal coup, said former U.S. ambassador to Syria Edward Djerejian. But Jouejati said there are no big names among rebel ranks inside Syria that are emerging as possible interim leaders. " "I think he's very scared of the people around him and the different security apparatus," said Ribal al-Assad, founder and director of The Organisation for Democracy and Freedom in Syria. Exactly who would lead Syria, he said, depends on how al-Assad leaves.
