-- One week after being shot through the head, U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords is off the ventilator and breathing on her own through a tracheotomy tube, the University Medical Center of Tucson, Arizona, said Saturday. Giffords, who authorities say was the target of a mass shooting by Jared Lee Loughner that left six dead and another 13 wounded, remains in critical condition. Police say that a gunman -- who they claim is Loughner, a 22-year-old Tucson resident -- killed several others in a Safeway parking lot in Tucson while trying to assassinate Giffords, who was then holding a constituent meeting. Doctors on Saturday morning replaced the breathing tube that ran down her throat with a tracheotomy tube in her windpipe. A law enforcement source said Saturday that Loughner had photographed himself posing with a 9mm handgun while wearing a red G-string.
