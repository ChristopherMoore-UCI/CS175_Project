"Nearly 60% of physicians in those specialties had high levels of burnout," says Shanafelt. "Policy makers and health care organizations must address the problem of physician burnout for the sake of physicians and their patients." Nearly 1 in 2 U.S. physicians report at least one symptom of burnout, with doctors at the front line of care particularly vulnerable, the study found -- a significantly higher rate than among the general working population. Job burnout can strike workers in nearly any field, but a new study finds that doctors are at special risk. Led by researchers from the Mayo Clinic and the American Medical Association, the study asked participating physicians to fill out a questionnaire asking about their feelings of burnout -- including "emotional exhaustion" or losing enthusiasm for their work; feelings of cynicism or "depersonalization"; and a low sense of personal accomplishment.
