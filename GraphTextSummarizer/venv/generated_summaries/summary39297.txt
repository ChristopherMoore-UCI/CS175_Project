"The reason why they organized the demonstration was to bring the refugees back to Ras Al Ain and to tell the FSA to leave the town," said Nurooz al Ahmad, a female Kurdish activist and Ras Al Ain resident, in a phone call with CNN. On October 27, at least 21 people were killed and more than 100 kidnapped after Kurdish gunmen linked to the PKK fought FSA rebels in the battleground city of Aleppo, in northern Syria. " Monday's battle in Ras Al Ain marked the second time in less than a month that anti-regime rebels have clashed with Kurdish militia members. "It was wrong for the FSA to enter Kurdish areas like Ras Al Ain," he added. On November 8, Syrian rebels mounted an assault on Ras Al Ain.
