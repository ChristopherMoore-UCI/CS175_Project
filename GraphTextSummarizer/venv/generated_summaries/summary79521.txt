Unfortunately, the DOD policy and U.S. Navy Arctic Roadmap 2014 do not articulate what the U.S. Arctic leadership agenda will entail. While recent U.S. policies either dance around the core issues, or worse, do not acknowledge that they exist, the Russians are taking the lead on Arctic policy. U.S. Arctic policy should prioritize four things: One: Demonstrate leadership in the Arctic and develop a strategy and policy to match. While much of the world is focused on the Russian incursion into the Crimean Peninsula of Ukraine, another long-term move may allow the former Soviet navy to dominate U.S. interests to the north: the Arctic. The time is now for more U.S. leadership to ensure the Arctic becomes a safe, secure and prosperous region in which to live and work.
