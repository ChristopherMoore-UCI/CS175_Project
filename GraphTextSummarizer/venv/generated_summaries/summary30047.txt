By a strange quirk, while Pakistan has a better record against India in both Test and One Day cricket, India has won all five of its World Cup games against Pakistan. There is a maturity to the India Pakistan game now that I don't remember in my childhood. Pakistan's Prime Minister visited India to watch a World Cup semi final game. But when you consider that 65% of all Indians were born in the 1980s or later, well after the two big wars of the 1970s, perhaps young Indians have a different relationship with 'India versus Pakistan.' (The longer version, Test cricket, takes five days per game; a Test World Cup has never been feasible.)
