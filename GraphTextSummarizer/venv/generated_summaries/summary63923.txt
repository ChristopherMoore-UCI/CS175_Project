It was broken in the Cayman Islands last year," Australian Guinness World Records adjudicator Chris Sheedy told the crowd. At 332, a cheer went up as the crowd realized the parade had broken the previous record: 331, set in Grand Cayman on the Cayman Islands in June 2010. The women, in tiny two pieces and pink visors, paraded around Surfers Paradise beach on the Gold Coast as throngs of onlookers whooped, hollered and snapped pictures. That's the number of women it took for Australia on Sunday to seize the record from the Cayman Islands for the largest bikini parade. Yet, more women sauntered past.
