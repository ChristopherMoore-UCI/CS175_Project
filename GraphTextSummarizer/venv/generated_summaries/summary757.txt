-- 95% of Gen Xers report talking with friends or family on the telephone at least once a week, and 29% say they do so at least once a day. The study defines Gen X as those born between 1961 and 1981, though others sources tag Gen X as those born starting in 1964. The analysis bolsters findings in a recent marketing study, "Gen X: Flirting With 40," which stated that Gen X has matured into a group of "technologically savvy, adventurous pragmatists." -- Having spent their formative years in the era of growing divorce rates (divorce peaked in 1980) might lead to speculation that Gen X would run away from marriage en masse. Reality: Generation X devotes more hours to work than average and pursues continuing education.
