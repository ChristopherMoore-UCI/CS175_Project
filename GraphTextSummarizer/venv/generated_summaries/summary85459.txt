On the same day, gossip magazine US Weekly published a report alleging that Woods had an affair with a 24-year-old cocktail waitress named Jaimee Grubbs. US Weekly's report followed a National Enquirer article before the crash that the athlete was having an affair with a New York nightclub hostess -- an assertion the hostess vigorously denied, according to The New York Post. -- A British court has granted Tiger Woods an injunction prohibiting the publication of pictures of him taken or obtained in certain circumstances. Woods was not required to talk to police about the wreck and declined to speak with investigators on several occasions. In the week after the crash, Woods apologized for "transgressions" that let his family down.
