Hugh Grant almost replaced Sheen on 'Men' Kutcher, who gained his early fame on a TV sitcom -- "That '70s Show" -- has more recently been seen on the big screen. Ashton Kutcher teased Twitter followers Thursday night about reports that he'll join the "Two and a Half Men" cast to fill the gap left by Charlie Sheen's departure. The answer is 2.5, as in "two and a half." Kutcher's posting may the best clue amid silence from CBS, the network that airs the hit sitcom, and Warner Bros., the studio where the show is produced. Producers have been scrambling in recent weeks to find a replacement for Sheen to keep one of TV's highest-rated sitcoms on the air for another year. He's also made his mark as a TV executive producer, most notably for MTV's hidden camera show "Punk'd."
