Just as important, the exchange between Romney and Perry over Social Security underscored their competing views about the meaning of limited government. But he persisted in characterizing the issue of Social Security reform primarily as one of increased state control. "The issue is, are there ways to move the states into Social Security, for state employees or for retirees." Romney, by contrast, has proposed a variety of measures that in his view will shore up Social Security without either increasing taxes or reducing the federal government's involvement. Romney accused Perry of trying to scare senior citizens and ruin the Republican Party by calling Social Security unconstitutional, a Ponzi scheme and a failure. But should Perry win the nomination, we can expect President Obama to pick up right where Romney left off on Social Security.
