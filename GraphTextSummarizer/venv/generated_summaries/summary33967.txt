On Wednesday, Harris-Moore was returned on a U.S. marshals flight for federal prisoners to Washington state where he faces a dozen state charges including burglaries, identity theft and fleeing from police in a stolen automobile. -- An attorney for alleged "Barefoot Bandit" Colton Harris-Moore on Thursday agreed with a request by federal prosecutors that the captured teen fugitive remain in prison -- for the time being -- and said his client does not want to be considered a role model. At his initial appearance Thursday in U.S. District Court, dressed in a gray prison jumpsuit, the 6-foot-5-inch Harris-Moore was the tallest person standing as the courtroom rose for Magistrate Judge Brian Tsuchida. Browne said he didn't ask for his client to be freed since multiple jurisdictions also suspect him of crimes, which would "start a traveling road show." Following the hearing, Browne told reporters that his client was no role model, despite Facebook sites dedicated to him with thousands of fans. She also said that anyone who helped him flee from authorities could face charges and that the following Harris-Moore generated was misplaced.
