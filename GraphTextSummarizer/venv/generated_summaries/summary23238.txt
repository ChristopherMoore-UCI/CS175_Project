Not if you ask Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, who spoke at length during a news conference Friday night about his allegations of conspiracy, which others call conspiracy theories. It may have seemed like an eternity to foreign correspondents, but it was brief by Venezuelan standards, especially compared to Maduro's predecessor. Maduro, a former bus driver and union leader, spoke not only about alleged conspiracies involving an international plan to destabilize his government, but also about Venezuelan and Latin American history, United States politics, democracy, the right to a free higher education, free trade agreements, the Venezuelan opposition and Spider Man, just to name a few. "There's a world campaign against Venezuela," Maduro told correspondents. The campaign "has created the perception in the world that Venezuela is on the verge of civil war, that here in Venezuela we have a group of docile students opposing an illegitimate government," Maduro said.
