In a civil suit filed this week in state Supreme Court in Queens, New York, Cho -- whose name is listed as Heather Hyun A-Cho in court documents -- is accused of "verbally and physically" attacking flight attendant Kim Do-hee in December on a Seoul-bound flight departing from John F. Kennedy International Airport. In a statement, Kim's lawyer, Andrew Weinstein, called Heather Cho's behavior "humiliating, degrading, and damaging to Ms. Kim, but ... also emblematic of Ms. Cho's unbridled arrogance and disturbing sense of entitlement. The suit describes Cho as the "princess" of the "so-called royal" family that controls Korean Air, and says the executive screamed obscenities at Kim before hitting, shoving and threatening the flight attendant. Park and Kim, the flight attendant who served the nuts, had knelt in front of Cho in apology. Heather Cho, a Korean Air executive and daughter of the airline's chairman, is serving a one-year prison sentence in South Korea after throwing a fit on a New York flight because her nuts were served in a bag instead of a porcelain bowl.
