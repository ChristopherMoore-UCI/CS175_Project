The Soviet Union, to borrow Brezhnev's term, "really existed," and its policies of mass killing were widely known: the deliberate starvation of millions of Ukrainians in 1933, the mass shootings of peasants and ethnic minorities in 1937 and 1938, the alliance with Nazi Germany in 1939, the executions of Polish prisoners of war in 1940, the postwar domination of eastern Europe, the crushing of reform movements in Hungary and Czechoslovakia, and all the rest. Communists could be great historians (fascists could not), because communism provides history with a plot. To be a man of Hobsbawm's generation was to have experienced the collapse of capitalism in the Great Depression, to be a Jew of Hobsbawm's generation was to have seen the rise of Hitler and Nazi Germany. The motor of history was changes in means of production. In Hobsbawm's extraordinary history of the modern world, the last part is the weakest, in part because he must face this problem of a Soviet Union that itself poses a problem for a communist scheme of history.
