But last week the Justice Department said it won't challenge state laws that legalize marijuana and will focus federal enforcement on serious trafficking cases and keeping the drug away from children. Officials estimate that 13% of marijuana users in the state will go through licensed retailers at the outset, and that the number will increase to 25% by the end of the year, according to Mikhail Carpenter, a spokesman for the liquor control board. -- Up to 334 retail marijuana stores could be licensed to set up shop in Washington state, officials said Wednesday. "These rules fulfill the public expectation of creating a tightly-regulated and controlled system while providing reasonable access to participation in the market," Sharon Foster, the board's chair, said in a written statement. New proposed rules approved by the Washington State Liquor Control Board come nearly 10 months after voters passed a measure legalizing recreational marijuana use.
