After President Barack Obama took office in 2008, Holbrooke took one of the toughest diplomatic assignments -- U.S. special  representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, the region Obama regards as critical to the fight against terrorism. " "Achieving peace and stabilization of a country with complex realities on the ground, as well as in the region, is not an overnight task, but there was no doubt that he was pursuing his mission not only objectively, professionally and patriotically as an American, but at the same time as a friend of Afghanistan," said Dr. Abdullah Abdullah, Afghanistan's former foreign minister. One of the world's most recognizable diplomats, Holbrooke's career spanned from the Vietnam War era to the war against the Taliban and al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan, coinciding with presidencies of the past five decades, from John F. Kennedy to Barack Obama. A statement appearing on numerous radical Islamist websites used Holbrooke's death to condemn the U.S. military presence in Afghanistan. Shortly after taking office, Obama appointed Holbrooke to the special representative job and Holbrooke dove in headfirst to tackle the challenges.
