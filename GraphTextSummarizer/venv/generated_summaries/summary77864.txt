False alarms are still alarms, after all. While there are certainly groups such as al Qaeda with political goals and a modicum of organization, for every plotted attack with strategic goals, there are many more that arise haphazardly, randomly -- by either sympathizers, copycats or mentally ill nihilists with no political justification whatsoever. And even if network anchors still had the authority they once did, they would not be able construct a satisfying story around the onslaught of neverending news. In an always-on, post-narrative age, 24-hour cable and Internet news and Twitter feeds offer a steady stream of opportunities for panic and misinformation. One news anchor actually declared "justice won" as she was at last permitted to cut to commercial.
