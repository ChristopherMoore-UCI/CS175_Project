For our young adults with the highest needs, more schools should incorporate an early warning system to identify students whose attendance, behavior and course performance suggest that they need extra support to stay in school. Young people have many reasons for leaving school, not all of them related to boredom or lack of motivation. For the first time in our nation's history, 80% of young Americans graduated from high school on time, according to the 2014 Building a GradNation. Many leave because of complex and challenging life circumstances that, without proper adult support, make leaving school look like the only option. In the wake of leaving school without graduating, many showed tremendous optimism and a drive to achieve adult success.
