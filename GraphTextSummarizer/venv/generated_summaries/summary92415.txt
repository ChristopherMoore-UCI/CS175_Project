Both Port Said and Cairo are included in the first round of voting. -- Egypt will hold parliamentary elections in several stages beginning April 27, a member of President Mohamed Morsy's presidential team announced Thursday. These will be the first elections since Egypt's highest court dissolved the lower house of parliament last June, and it will be the first full parliament in Morsy's presidency. Several stages of elections also means the Muslim Brotherhood, the group that backs Morsy, has more time to rebuild its waning support. More stages raises the possibility of more politically charged violence, particularly in the province of Port Said.
