"By requesting an Interpol Red Notice, Kenya has activated a global 'tripwire' for this fugitive," said Interpol Secretary General Ronald K. Noble. -- Interpol said Thursday it issued a "red notice" for Samantha Lewthwaite, the so-called "White Widow," at the request of Kenyan authorities, but the international police agency added that the notice dealt with a 2011 incident. Known as the "White Widow," Lewthwaite, 29, has been wanted by international counterterrorism officials since authorities found bomb-making materials in her Mombasa, Kenya, apartment in 2011. Red notices issued by Interpol alert law enforcement around the world that a person is wanted, but they are not international arrest warrants. Reports that a white woman was among the terrorists who stormed a mall in Nairobi last weekend have prompted a slew of media speculation about Lewthwaite, a British woman whose husband was one of the suicide bombers in the 2005 London terror attacks.
