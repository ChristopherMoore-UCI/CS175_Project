Family caregivers such as  Alice's family members and professional caregivers like Elena, who joins Alice's care circle later in the film, are critical to our ability to live and age the way we desire, connected to our families and communities until the end. And, in the film, family members grow to become a crucial, if imperfect, circle of care. As a result, so many of us are struggling: we are overwhelmed family caregivers, we often cannot afford the long-term care option we need -- if we can even find it -- let alone enjoy the time we have together. Most families don't have a care plan in place, and more importantly, we as a nation don't have a plan either. And we see what happens when care becomes -- or doesn't become -- a central feature of these relationships.
