In the weeks before the shooting, Aaron Ybarra, 26, kept a journal in which he allegedly expressed "admiration for the perpetrators of other incidents of mass violence -- at Columbine High School and at Virginia Tech University," King County Prosecuting Attorney Dan Satterberg said. Satterberg said the entries also indicate Ybarra had considered shooting people at other campuses in Washington state but chose SPU shortly before the incident. Ybarra is scheduled to be arraigned June 23, Satterberg said. Counselors and friendly friends even showed Ybarra around the campus in the days before the shooting, and he allegedly carried out the minute-long shooting just before the academic year ended, Satterberg said. Ybarra allegedly fired only two shots -- killing one student and wounding two others -- before student security guard Jon Meis pepper-sprayed Ybarra's eyes and took away the shotgun, Satterberg said.
