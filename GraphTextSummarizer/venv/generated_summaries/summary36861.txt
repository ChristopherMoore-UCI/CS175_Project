Police at Middle Georgia State College arrested and charged Robert Kane Rolison, 17, with one count of murder in the disappearance and death of Jmaal Malik Keyes, who was last seen on April 25 and reported missing on April 29. Campus Police Chief Shawn Douglas said Friday that authorities were searching for the body of Keyes, a 19-year-old freshman from Atlanta. Rolison is from Hawkinsville, Georgia, and police describe him as a dual-enrolled high school/Middle Georgia State student. Rolison and Keyes knew each other, and Rolison gave Keyes a ride to a convenience store the day Keyes went missing, Douglas said. -- Authorities say they have made an arrest in the case of a Georgia college student missing since last month.
