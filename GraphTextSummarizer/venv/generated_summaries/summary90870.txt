A national effort to prevent the 2009 H1N1 pandemic flu has contributed to a dramatic increase in the number of pregnant women who receive flu vaccines, according to the CDC. An emergency flight took her to Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St. Louis on January 14 where she remains on a ventilator, reported CNN affiliate KSDK. "Pregnant women are five times more likely to end up in the ICU or have severe complications related to the flu than non-pregnant women who get infected with the flu," she said. Life-threatening developments like Creekmore's in flu patients are generally rare but not unheard of, Gray-Swain said. If there is money left over from the campaign after he pays his wife's medical bills, Chris Creekmore wants to use the extra funds to help his sister's child, who has a medical condition, and to help support free flu vaccination clinics.
