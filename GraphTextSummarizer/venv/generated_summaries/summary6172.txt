-- The Transportation Security Administration on Wednesday abandoned plans to allow small knives and certain other banned items back on passenger flights, surrendering to fierce criticism from airlines, unions and Congress. "The result is better security policy and the assurance that our nation's aviation security system continues to be vigilant for knives that could be used in a terrorist attack or criminal act against passengers or crew," the group that represents 90,000 flight attendants said. Some Pistole supporters, including former TSA chief Kip Hawley, argued the knife ban actually endangers passengers by re-focusing the attention of airport screeners away from bigger threats. The TSA first announced the plan to allow small knives and sporting equipment in March, saying doing so would permit airport screeners extra time to focus on more dangerous objects like bombs and related components. Aviation safety experts said small knives and sports equipment present little threat to aircraft, largely because of the reinforced cockpit doors.
