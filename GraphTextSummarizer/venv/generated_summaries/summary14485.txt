Police said the suspects were targeting a ceremony on Anzac Day (Australia and New Zealand Army Corps Day), which is April 25 and this year is the centennial of the Gallipoli Campaign in World War I. Abbott avoided the term ISIS -- or Islamic State -- to call out those who authorities believed influenced the suspects. Five young men were arrested Saturday in Melbourne, Australia, in what police called a major counterterrorism operation. The suspects planned to attack during a major national commemoration in a week, Prime Minister Tony Abbott said Saturday. Two of the teens, 18 and 19, have been released "pending further inquiries," Australia's Federal Police said. "The act that we believe was in preparation involved attacks against police officers," he said.
