No doubt, tax compliance might improve, by means of shame if nothing else, and perhaps some entrepreneurs would even find a way to make some money by "whistleblowing" on tax crimes and misdemeanors they unearthed from the massive data dump. Another study shows that in 2014, 95% of Americans paid an effective income tax rate under 10%; the top 1% of income earners reached an average of 24.6%, still significantly below the average tax rate for all taxpaying Finns. It turns out that all tax returns of every Finn are made public this month, which leads to a "media frenzy of gossip, boasting and finger-pointing about who has paid their fair share in income tax," according to an article on Foreignpolicy.com. So what happened to tax policy, which might be thought to play a starring role as both cause and effect of the drama? So what would happen if Americans had a "Tax Day" like Finland, and tax returns of every citizen were all released in one fell swoop to unleash a media frenzy?
