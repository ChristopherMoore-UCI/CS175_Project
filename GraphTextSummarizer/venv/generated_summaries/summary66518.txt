In many ways I'd say there are greater demands on Indian actors than there are on Hollywood. So do you think Hollywood actors could learn from the Bollywood actors? Bachchan: I don't know that we are worthy enough for learning something from us, but I do know that actors in India are very capable, very talented, and can be compared to the best anywhere in the world. I just enjoy working in films. Indian actors, because of the format of our stories, need to be good actors, and be able to perform emotional sequences, do a bit of comedy, dance and singing, action, because all of this forms just one film.
