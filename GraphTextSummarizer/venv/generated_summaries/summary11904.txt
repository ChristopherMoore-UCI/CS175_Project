Over the years I have spent my fair share of time around people fighting for LGBT rights and I can tell you the mocking of transgender people is not something that is exclusively heterosexual or conservative. According to a recent Williams Institute study, 50% of respondents who are openly transgender attempted suicide. But there are many reminders of the work that still needs to be done -- for example the disproportionate murder rate for transgender women and the fact that a person can still be fired or lose a home for being transgender. Especially now, as details regarding the fatal car accident Jenner was involved in during the weekend come to light. At this point we have read the stories with quotes from unnamed sources and seen the pictures with Jenner having longer hair and makeup.
