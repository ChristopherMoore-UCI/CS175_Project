In a rare act, the United States Congress passed a private bill last week granting Chukwueke permanent residency after years of his living in Michigan on an expired visa. If Obama signs the bill, the State Department will reduce by one the number of immigrant visas available to Nigerians. His journey started in Nigeria, a taunted teenager with large tumors on his face, driven into deep despair. Eleven years later, Victor Chukwueke has undergone numerous surgeries and is a step closer to achieving his dream of becoming a doctor. Nuns from the Daughters of Mary Mother of Mercy rescued him from the orphanage more than a decade ago and arranged for a Michigan doctor to perform surgery on him.
