"Salvador remains clinically stable, nevertheless we have had certain problems because the excess accumulation of water on his brain has grown," Ernesto Martinez Duhart, who operated on Cabanas, told reporters. -- Salvador Cabanas remains in a critical condition in hospital as doctors admit they are having difficulty treating the Paraguay international due to increased swelling on his brain. Around 10,000 Paraguayan fans gathered at the the Estadio Defensores del Chaco, the country's national stadium in Asuncion, to hold a vigil for Cabanas on Tuesday evening. " Cabanas is one of Paraguay's top players and was part of their World Cup squad in Germany four years ago. Cabanas was transported to an intensive care unit at a local hospital and was rushed into theatre where doctors made an attempt to remove the bullet lodged in his skull before deciding it would be too dangerous.
