Abdolmalek Rigi, who headed Jundallah (Soldiers of God), was hanged after being convicted of committing 79 crimes, including armed robbery, planting bombs and attacks against police and military forces, Press TV reported. Iran said Jundallah was behind a suicide bombing in the province that killed more than 40 people -- including several members of Iran's Revolutionary Guards -- in October. Iran has blamed Jundallah for carrying out deadly bombings, abductions and targeted killings in the southeastern Sistan-Balochistan province, which borders Pakistan. And in 2007, a car bomb that struck a military bus in the province's capital, Zahedan, was also the work of Jundallah, Iran said. The bomb went off as soon as the bus, which belonged to the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, arrived to pick up military personnel at a barracks.
