According to some texts, the walls were built by King Thutmose IV (1400-1390 BCE) because of a dream he had during a hunting trip, the council's secretary general, Zahi Hawass, said Tuesday. Newly discovered walls on the Giza plateau were part of an enclosure to protect the Sphinx from wind-borne sand, Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities says. For the favor, the Sphinx promised to make Thutmose IV king of Egypt. "In the king's dream the Sphinx asked the king to move the sand away from his body because it choked him," Hawass said in a written statement. Khafre's burial complex boasted an unprecedented profusion of statues, among them the Sphinx, according to National Geographic.
