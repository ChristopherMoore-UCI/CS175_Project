The Gulf cartel and Zetas cartel used to work together, but split more than a year ago and are now fighting for control of lucrative smuggling routes into the United States. The state of Tamaulipas, where Reynosa and San Fernando are located, is the site of a bloody battle between rival drug cartels. San Fernando is also where the bodies of 72 migrants were found last year. The hostages were found Monday inside a house in the city of Reynosa, across the border from McAllen, Texas. The city is about 90 miles north of the town of San Fernando, where authorities recently uncovered 177 bodies from mass graves.
