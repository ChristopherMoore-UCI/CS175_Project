It was a meltdown at Chernobyl nuclear plant in the former Soviet Union. Propelled 50 years ago into space on a Soviet rocket, Yuri Gagarin made the first ever orbit of the Earth. CHANCE: Gagarin didn't live to witness the hundreds who've journeyed to space since his first flight. This year's champion took home the title -- and broke two U.S. records along the way -- last month in New York. Well, this is just a replica of the actual Vostok capsule in which Yuri Gagarin made that first historic flight.
