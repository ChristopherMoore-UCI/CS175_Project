The owner of Yellow Scuba, who gave his name as Putu, spoke to CNN three days after five tourists and two dive instructors, all Japanese women, failed to return to the surface after a dive near the islands of Nusa Lembongan and Nusa Penida, southeast of Bali on Friday. " The area in which the women were diving is a noted beauty spot, "but it's also very dangerous," said Bali Governor I Made Mangku Pastika, citing "unpredictable natural aspects. The period from October to April is monsoon season in Bali, which sees strong winds and bursts of heavy rain. " Heavy rains occurred during the dive that saw the divers go missing, and also on Saturday, hampering rescue efforts. -- The owner of the dive company on the Indonesian island of Bali helping to search for seven missing divers has said he has "no clue what happened."
