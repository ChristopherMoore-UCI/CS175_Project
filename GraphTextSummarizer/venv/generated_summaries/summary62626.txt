Husband walks streets in search of kidney donor Attacked from within Like many SEALs, Legg is a little "twisted," Suzanne says. In addition to leukemia, doctors discovered Legg had the Philadelphia Chromosome, an abnormality in his genes that caused cancerous cells to duplicate 80 times faster than in other patients. Most lung transplant patients die from complications within five years, a statistic that's always in the back of Suzanne's mind. Working with Team in Training, a fundraising program with the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, Legg has collected more than $39,000 this year for cancer research. But when his physical strength deteriorated in a fight against cancer, Legg had to rely on his mental fortitude to carry him through four years of excruciating pain, a bone marrow transplant and two collapsed lungs.
