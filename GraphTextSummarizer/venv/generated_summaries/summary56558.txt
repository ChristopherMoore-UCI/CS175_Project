" Ashton also had her own idea for what Page 3 could feature in the future: "I'd love to see a celebration of women -- The Sun's in a really unique position here where they could turn things around after 45 years of giving us sexist images. The tradition lives on at The Sun's Page 3 website, and the Daily Star, another British tabloid, was still featuring naked models on page 3 as of Tuesday. The topless pics were credited by some for giving a boost to The Sun's circulation figures, as well as launching the careers of a number of glamor models over the years, including Melinda Messenger, Samantha Fox and Katie Price. The Sun, Britain's best-selling newspaper, may finally be ditching its topless Page 3 models after all these years. But Murdoch had come under increasing pressure since 2012, when the No More Page 3 campaign -- whose slogan is "Boobs aren't News" -- demanded that The Sun's editors kill the page.
