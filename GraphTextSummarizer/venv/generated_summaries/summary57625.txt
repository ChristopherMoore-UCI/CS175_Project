But I definitely want to be involved with tennis, help develop tennis in Brazil and do more work for my institute, the Instituto Guga Kuerten. I arrived in Paris, and like every year I immediately went to Roland Garros and practiced on center court. Tennis great Gustavo Kuerten will retire after his appearance at this year's French Open. Of course you want to win, but I would rather have won even more Roland Garros than these other Grand Slams. I come from an island, a small city in the south of Brazil and people are used to seeing me there.
