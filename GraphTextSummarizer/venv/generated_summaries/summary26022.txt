-- Chelsea and England defender Ashley Cole has apologized to London police for a foul-mouthed tirade that led to him being arrested for drunk and disorderly conduct in the early hours of Thursday morning. Cole, who previously played for Arsenal before joining Chelsea in 2006, is married to the Girls Aloud singer and reality TV judge Cheryl Cole, who is currently on a charity climb on Tanzania's Mount Kilimanjaro. The 28-year-old was arrested in Brompton Road in the upmarket west London area of South Kensington, close to Chelsea's Stamford Bridge ground, at about 2.15am on Thursday morning after emerging from the Collection nightclub. Cole is likely to be fined by Chelsea. Before his arrest, Cole had joined Chelsea's first-team squad and more than 300 charity workers, celebrities and supporters for the second annual Chelsea FC and Armani charity fundraiser.
