To some degree, it has been like Eden itself, a shelter from the American storm: leafy mountains, red barns and white clapboard houses, quiet dirt roads with covered bridges, village greens, lots of fresh organic food, ex-hippies galore and the open waters of Lake Champlain, which treads a narrow path over 100 miles between the Green Mountains to the east and the Adirondacks to the west. Rumor has it that the number of cows in Vermont exceeds the number of people. The lovely town of Brattleboro, once the home of Rudyard Kipling, was deep under water, and people are still trying desperately to clear away the mess. I sometimes have to head to the nearby college where I teach -- a three-mile journey -- on cross-country skis. -- I've spent most of my adult life -- over three decades -- in Vermont.
