Sen. Marco Rubio had only kind words for potential Republican presidential rivals Jeb Bush and Mitt Romney on Wednesday, but he argued if he runs he'll have better credentials to offer than the two former governors. "The next President of the United States needs to be someone who has a clear vision of American's role in the world." "For governors that's going to be a challenge, at least initially," Rubio added, "since they don't deal with foreign policy on a daily basis." As a member of the Senate Foreign Relations and Intelligence Committees, Rubio has been an outspoken critic of Obama's foreign policy, and most recently took the lead in opposing the President's move to thaw diplomatic relations with Cuba. And with the GOP primary field shaping up to include potentially a dozen prominent Republicans, Rubio's foreign policy experience could potentially offer him a needed boost to break away from the pack. But on Wednesday he refrained from taking any hits at his potential opponents, calling Bush "a very credible candidate" and defending Romney against critics who say he ran a gaffe-prone and lackluster campaign in 2012.
