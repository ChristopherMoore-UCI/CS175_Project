The effort to formally allow human remains to be buried in New York pet cemeteries began in 2011 after NYPD officer Thomas Ryan wanted to be buried with his deceased dogs in Hartsdale Pet Cemetery in upstate Hartsdale, New York. New York is one of a handful of states that has made formal regulations regarding human remains in pet cemeteries. Virginia currently is proposing a similar regulation allowing pet cemeteries to be added to existing human cemeteries. Additionally, Pennsylvania is one of few states that allow human bodies to be buried on pet cemeteries without having to be cremated, according to Lemasters. Levy, 65, never thought she would be able to be buried in a pet cemetery but a new regulation enacted by the New York Department of State officially permits pet cemeteries to inter the cremated remains, or "cremains," of pet owners along with their pets.
