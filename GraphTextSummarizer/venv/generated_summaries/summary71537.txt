"Won't be sharing my Facebook Year in Review, which 'highlights' a post on a friend's death in May despite words like 'killed' and 'sad day,' " wrote Time magazine's Andrew Katz. "We can do better -- I'm very grateful he took the time in his grief to write the blog post." After his first post gained attention -- and invited a lot of unpleasant commentary -- Meyer, in turn, apologized to the company in a compassionate follow-up. In December, Facebook routinely lets users revisit the year by highlighting some their most popular posts and photos in an online scrapbook assembled in part from "likes" and comments. Facebook, which has created an "Empathy Team" to help its employees think of users as, well, people, apologized to Meyer. My year looked like the now-absent face of my little girl," Meyer wrote in a Christmas Eve post on his blog.
