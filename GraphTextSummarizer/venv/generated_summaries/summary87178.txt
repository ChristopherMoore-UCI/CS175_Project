Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who was supposed to attend the Friends of Syria meeting in Morocco along with more than 100 delegations from the United States, the European Union, Arab nations and representatives of the Syrian opposition, canceled her trip due to a stomach flu that hit her and a number of her staff. The intent is to "hear from them ... about how they see things going forward both in terms of their own internal organization about their connectivity with Syrians inside Syria, about their transitional planning, about the needs that they see for external support, how they would have us best direct the non lethal support and humanitarian support that we are providing," State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said on Monday. "We've made a decision that the Syrian Opposition Coalition is now inclusive enough, is reflective and representative enough of the Syrian population that we consider them the legitimate representative of the Syrian people in opposition to the Assad regime," Obama told ABC's Barbara Walters. Moscow has been highly critical of actions by the Syrian armed opposition, even while expressing support for a political solution. In order to do that, the United States would have to determine that the opposition controls a majority of Syrian territory and has taken over the country's treaty obligations from al-Assad's government, neither of which has happened.
