The art of football Many members of football's elite are collectors of art -- David Beckham, Thierry Henry, Roman Abramovich and Fabio Capello, to name a few -- and the "beautiful game" serves as inspiration to a host of artists across the globe. The collection also demonstrates football art can provide a dialogue for important social issues. Manal Al Dowayan's "The Choice IV" shows a Saudi woman holding a football aloft, challenging the limits that religion and tradition can place on women. As the 1in11 auction shows, art really does have a place in football -- whether you're a professional, an artist or a spectator.
