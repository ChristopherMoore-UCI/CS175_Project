"There is no doubt that Korea should be ready to organize a good World Cup," Blatter told reporters at a joint press conference with South Korean president Lee Myung-Bak in the capital Seoul, after being awarded the country's Order of Merit for Sports. " South Korea were joint hosts of the 2002 World Cup with Japan, and the country's team became the first from Asia to reach the semifinals of the tournament that year. At the 2010 World Cup in South Africa they reached the last 16 for the first time away from home, while North Korea took part in the event again after a 44-year absence. -- FIFA president Sepp Blatter praised South Korea's bid to host the 2022 World Cup on Monday and said that the sport had the power to unite the divided northern and southern halves of the country. President Lee agreed with Blatter and said he believed football could bridge the gap between the North and South of the penninsula, which have been separated by a fortified border since conflict ended in a truce in the 1950's.
