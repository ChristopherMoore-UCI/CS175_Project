-- A company that Chinese authorities say is controlled by dissident artist Ai Weiwei challenged tax evasion allegations Thursday. " Pu said that if the evidence is valid, he will advise Ai's company, which includes a studio, to pay the back taxes of 5 million RMB (US $770,000) and the punishment fee of 7 million RMB (US $1 million), which is in accordance with Chinese regulations. Ai also has accused the Chinese government of trying to silence dissidents. Ai, considered China's most famous artist, was originally detained in April on grounds of tax evasion. Also Thursday, Ai confirmed he had received an invitation from the Berlin University of the Arts to accept a professorship there.
