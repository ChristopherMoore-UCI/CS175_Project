The plotting is as remorseless as Cogan's logic, but the movie has an unusual and distinctive structure, one that comes straight from Higgins, the Boston lawyer best known for "The Friends of Eddie Coyle" (filmed with Robert Mitchum the year before "Cogan's Trade" was published). Adapting and updating George V. Higgin's 1974 crime novel "Cogan's Trade" and resuming his collaboration with "The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford" producer/star Brad Pitt, Dominik has crafted a poison pen letter to late capitalism in general and the United States in particular. Higgins let his stories seep out from eavesdropped conversations, almost between the lines, putting the reader in the position of a juror trying to untangle a case from dozens of competing testimonies. Cogan is the consummate professional, the hero by default in a movie without heroics, a savagely cynical satire on a bankrupt system in terminal decline. Brad Pitt is Cogan, one of those guys you go to with a job you don't want to spell out.
