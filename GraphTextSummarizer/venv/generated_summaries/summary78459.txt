"If we look at the corporate world, it really is about: Can the CEO execute the job at the level it needs to be done?" says Susan Battley, founder and CEO of Battley Performance Consulting. But George Pataki, former governor of New York, says making the switch from public figure to John Q. Public wasn't difficult for him. "Effective leadership is all about being able to execute brilliantly," says Battley. He embraced what he calls a sense of normalcy after he left office, going to movies and basketball games. A year or two after he left office, Pataki went to Madison Square Garden with a group of friends to see the Knicks play.
