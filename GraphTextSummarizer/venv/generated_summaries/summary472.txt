The Real Madrid superstar was told he is "cocky" and "has a screw loose" by veteran Uruguayan striker Walter Pandiani, who clashed with Ronaldo during lowly Osasuna's shock win over the Spanish giants on Sunday. Madrid is paying for Cristiano's cocky attitude." Pandiani, who has spent most of the past decade with Spanish clubs but like Ronaldo also played in England, said the Portugal captain should take lessons from Barcelona's two-time world player of the year Lionel Messi. The 34-year-old Pandiani, nicknamed "the Rifle," spoke out at a press conference after becoming angry when Ronaldo reportedly asked him how much he earned during Real's defeat -- which left Jose Mourinho's team seven points behind La Liga leaders Barcelona. -- He's the most expensive player in the world, and one of the best paid, but Cristiano Ronaldo was given a very public reminder on the need to be humble on Wednesday. Ronaldo enjoyed a trophy-laden stint with Manchester United, winning the European Champions League and three English titles plus three cups along with several top individual awards, but the 25-year-old has yet to earn any silverware since joining Real in a record $130 million deal in mid-2009.
