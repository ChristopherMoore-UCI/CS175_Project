Passenger killed in vintage plane crash CNN's Tom Watkins, Alina Machado, Mike M. Ahlers and Brian Rokus contributed to this report. -- The body of a man found Saturday in a mangrove area near Miami may be that of a 42-year-old passenger who fell Thursday from a small plane, police said. "Even though we presume that the body found is that of Gerardo Nales, investigators are pending 'official identification' from the Medical Examiner's Office," said Miami-Dade Police Department spokesman Detective Alvaro Zabaleta, in a statement. " Nales, the only other person aboard, "opened the back door and he just fell down the plane," the pilot said, according to a recording of his conversation with air traffic controllers. The pilot said he was flying Thursday afternoon at an altitude of 1,800 feet about two miles from shore when the incident occurred.
