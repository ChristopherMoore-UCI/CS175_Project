Actress Patricia Modell, who was married to former Cleveland Browns/Baltimore Ravens owner Art Modell, died Wednesday, the Ravens organization announced. At one point, the Ravens said, Modell had appeared in more television shows than any other woman in U.S. history. Art Modell has been connected with the NFL since 1961, including 43 years of full ownership of the Browns and the Ravens. Modell was a major contributor in Baltimore to the St. Vincent's Center and the Baltimore Museum of Art. The Modells contributed $3.5 million to the Lyric Opera House, which was recently renamed the Patricia and Arthur Modell Performing Arts Center at The Lyric.
