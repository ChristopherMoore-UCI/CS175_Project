Through her maternal line, the girl in the cave seems to have been related to modern Native Americans as well as their ancestors, Bolnick said. "What this study is presenting for the first time is the evidence that Paleoamericans with those distinctive features can also be directly tied to the same Beringian source population as contemporary Native Americans," Bolnick said. Some South American populations today have this genetic signature: 29% of indigenous people of Chile and Argentina have it; so do 11% of Native Americans, said Deborah Bolnick, assistant professor of anthropology at the University of Texas at Austin. Genetic analysis of her remains suggests that Naia is related to modern Native Americans. Naia's physical features are very different from that of modern day Native Americans.
