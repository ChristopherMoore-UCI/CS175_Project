John Brennan, assistant to the president for counterterrorism and homeland security, told CNN that the Pakistani Taliban -- also known as Tehrik-e-Taliban, or TTP -- is "closely allied with al Qaeda." Shahzad was arrested while trying to fly out of New York on May 3, two days after federal authorities say he left a vehicle filled with explosive materials in Manhattan's Times Square. -- Pakistani officials have detained a 10th person in connection with the investigation into the failed May 1 car bombing of New York's Times Square, a Pakistani intelligence source told CNN Tuesday. The two men met frequently last year, when Shahzad returned to Pakistan, the source said. Shahzad had traveled to Pakistan several times in recent years, Brennan said. Top advisers to President Barack Obama said early this month that Shahzad worked with the Taliban movement in Pakistan.
