Americans are going to need savings to pay for emergency expenses or to make a down payment on a house. Every child would be able to start saving on Day One, gaining valuable financial education and building savings for college or a down payment on a home as they grow up. It may sound like Scrooge to argue for saving during the holidays, but saving is essential if American families and the economy ever are to recover from the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. A recent survey by the TNS group, with assistance from Harvard Business School and Dartmouth College, found that almost half the respondents couldn't come up with $2,000 for an emergency in a month from savings, family or borrowing. The past year has been a good one for savings, with the personal savings rate rising from near zero earlier in the decade to nearly 4Â½ percent in October.
