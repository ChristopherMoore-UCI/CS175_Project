Of those picked up off the Italian islands of Sicily and Calabria in the past four days, a large number were women and children, including newborns and unaccompanied minors, UNHCR spokeswoman Melissa Fleming said in a prepared statement Friday. The UNHCR has urged countries to work together to rescue people at sea at the same time as looking for legal migration channels that will prevent people from risking their lives at sea. "The challenges of protecting refugees traveling irregularly by sea in search of safety, often together with people moving for other reasons, are complex." The Italian government set up a rescue operation after that tragedy, the UNHCR said, which has saved more than 20,000 people at sea. About 18,000 people have arrived by sea in Italy so far this year, while in 2013, the number of arrivals was near 43,000, the UNHCR said.
