Ours is supposed to be a progressive rate system, which means as income gets higher, so do tax rates. That explains why those in higher income brackets seek out tax deductions as a way to save money on their taxes. While our income tax has always had progressive rates, for most of the 20th century a lower rate applied to certain nonwage income. Most flat tax proponents, however, want a flat tax, but they want to exempt income from stock completely. Most taxpayers do not itemize, so this change would only affect about one-third of taxpayers -- and their accountants and tax lawyers.
