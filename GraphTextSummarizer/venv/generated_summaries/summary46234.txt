According to a CNN/Opinion Research Corporation survey released Friday, most Americans think that the government spends a lot more money than it actually does on such unpopular programs as foreign aid and public broadcasting. Cutting pensions and benefits for government workers is popular, but once again most Americans overestimate how much that costs the government. "The result: cutting unpopular programs would probably not cut the deficit very much, and cutting the deficit would probably require cuts in programs that Americans like." "The public has a better idea of how much the government spends on programs like Social Security and Medicare, but there is a related problem -- cutting them has little public support," says CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. When we ask Americans to guess how much Social Security cost the government in 2010, the median estimate was 20 percent.
