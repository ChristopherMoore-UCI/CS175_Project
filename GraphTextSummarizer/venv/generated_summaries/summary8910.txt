British newspaper The Times reported that it cost Bahrain race organizers $40 million to secure a place in this year's calendar, plus another $20 million to ensure it was the first of the season. The Crown Prince told the country's Information Affairs Authority Twitter site: "We felt it was important for the country to focus on immediate issues of national interest. The Bahrain government confirmed the race, scheduled for March 13, had been called off on Monday afternoon after days of speculation. "Bahrain's priority is on overcoming tragedy, healing divisions and rediscovering the fabric that draws this country together to remind the world of the very best that Bahrain is capable of as a nation once again united. "At the present time the country's entire attention is focused on building a new national dialogue for Bahrain.
