Employees under the age of 29, also known as Generation Y, expect their employers to provide more benefits and other perks than their older counterparts, according to a new survey from CareerBuilder.com and Harris Interactive. Eighty-seven percent of hiring managers and HR professionals say Gen Y exhibits a sense of entitlement that older generations don't. "I think if other generations had such technologies as cell phones and BlackBerrys, they would work toward getting them financed through work as well." Bailin's assessment emphasizes just how much her generation has incorporated technology into daily life. "As companies' cultures evolve with each generation, you see all workers benefiting from a variety of viewpoints and work styles," says Rosemary Haefner, vice president of human resources for CareerBuilder.com.
