Surrounded by models of the different shuttles and the International Space Station, people exchanged stories about shuttle launches, including some about seeing one at the Kennedy Space Center. Among them was Reagan Diesing, born in 2002, 21 years after the first shuttle launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida. With a reported 70 percent chance the shuttle would not launch on Friday, people were happy that the countdown passed the five-minute mark. Air was sucked from the room, people fretted that they might not witness the historic moment Friday. -- Crowds filled the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington on Friday, as they regularly do during the summer months.
