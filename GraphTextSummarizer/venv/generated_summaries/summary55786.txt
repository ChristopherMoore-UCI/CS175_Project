What turns this from a good story into a great one is that Rodriguez -- recently dubbed the entertainment industry's "Next Big Thing" by The Hollywood Reporter -- You know, I have many family members that have fed many of their families on doing that job, but there are other stories that need to be told. True, given Hollywood's antiquated predilection toward telling stories in black and white -- to the exclusion of Hispanics, Asians and others who don't fit into that narrow color scheme -- not enough of the talented Latina actresses who came before got the recognition they deserved or roles that reflected reality. They don't teach that sort of thing in acting school. When she was growing up in Chicago, that's what Gina Rodriguez wanted to be.
