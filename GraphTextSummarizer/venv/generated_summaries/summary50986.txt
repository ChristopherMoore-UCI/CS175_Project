Military leaders said they have no desire to "stay in power" and asked political parties to send ideas on what to do next by Sunday, the spokesman said. In the latest coup, soldiers arrested the acting president and prime minister, a military spokesman said Friday, as gunfire and explosions rocked the capital of Bissau. This group says the president and the prime minister signed the deal and accuses the African Union, whose rotating presidency is currently held by Angola, of supporting intervention by Angolan forces. A number of Angolan troops are in the country to help reform the country's armed forces, Angola said. Guinea-Bissau's history has been marked by several military coups and these conflicts have ravaged its infrastructure and economy, leaving it among the poorest in the world.
