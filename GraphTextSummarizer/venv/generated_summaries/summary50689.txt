-- Oscar-winning actor Adrien Brody wants a federal judge to stop DVD sales of a horror movie he filmed two years ago because he's still owed $640,000 by the producers. A lawyer for Hannibal Pictures, one of the defendants, said the DVD has been in rental stores since September 7, something he said Brody's lawyer should already know. Barab said Brody's lawyer has been "trying to bully people into paying" since March. Brody's agreement specified that the payment would come from the sale of the Italian distribution rights, Barab said. "Giallo," filmed in Italy, never made it to the theaters, but DVD sales begin Tuesday, according to the lawsuit Brody filed last week.
