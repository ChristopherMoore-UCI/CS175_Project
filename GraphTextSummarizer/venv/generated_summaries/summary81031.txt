-- New York police Thursday were investigating a sucker-punch assault on a 23-year-old man for a possible connection to a series of attacks known as the "knockout game." Possible 'knockout' game victim: 'The whole group of kids laughed' Authorities have reported similar incidents in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Illinois, Missouri and Washington. Hartman said police believe the attacks were copycat crimes spurred by media attention. "We have no reason to believe this is a hate crime," said Officer David Hartman, a New Haven police spokesman. At least eight suspected "knockout" attacks have been reported since October in New York, but police have said they see no evidence of a trend.
