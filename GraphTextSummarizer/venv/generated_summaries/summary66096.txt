At an investiture ceremony at the Elysee Palace in Paris, Hollande said he wants to balance the need to reduce the debts of European governments with efforts to stimulate growth. "I said that my wish is that growth is not an empty phrase, that it is something which, in reality, is happening," Francois Hollande told reporters in a joint news conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin. France's first Socialist president since Fran√ßois Mitterrand left office in 1995 won in an election this month against incumbent Nicolas Sarkozy. With Sarkozy, the United States enjoyed support for its positions on Syria, Iran and Afghanistan. Hollande made his way up the carpet to be met by Sarkozy.
