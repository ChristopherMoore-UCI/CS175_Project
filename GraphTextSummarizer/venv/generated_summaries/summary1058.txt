Over the last 10 years, an average of fewer than three boys a year have died from on-field injuries playing high school football, according to the National Center for Catastrophic Sport Injury Research at the University of North Carolina. Deantre Turman's death came Friday after he made a tackle during a pre-season game, said Mike Alsip, a forensic investigator for the Fulton County Medical Examiner's Office. His coach, Glenn Ford, told the station that Turman -- a cornerback known to friends as "Tre Tre" -- went immediately limp and unresponsive after the play. The accident happened at a school in the Atlanta suburb of College Park, Georgia, according to CNN affiliate WSB. Tarsha Keller, the woman who raised Turman since his mother died when he was just 4 years old, told WSB that the teen died doing what he loved.
