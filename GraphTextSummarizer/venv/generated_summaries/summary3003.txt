Friday night my dad came down from Lake Worth to watch Her Name Was Steven -- the CNN documentary about him -- with our family and some friends. Like I said in the documentary, the biggest negative change that impacted our family was dad losing his job. Now I'm in the 10th grade at high school with about 3000 students, so it's a bit different. When I started high school, the story of my dad had kind of settled down. The next day my dad showed me some of the comments on the CNN web site about the essay I wrote about him in 8th grade for a school project.
