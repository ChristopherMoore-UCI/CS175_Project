Some music lovers didn't even know Beck had a new album out when he won the Grammy for album of the year for "Morning Phase" on Sunday. After rapper Kanye West looked to be about to crash the stage during Beck's acceptance speech and then said the musician "needs to respect artistry, and he should've given his award to Beyonce," there was a rush to defend Beck.

"You disrespect your own remarkable talents and more importantly you disrespect the talent, hard work and tenacity of all artists when you go so rudely and savagely after such an accomplished and humble artist like Beck," Manson wrote.
