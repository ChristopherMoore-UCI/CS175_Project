He said the state received about $1.6 billion in stimulus funds, about a quarter of which he said is being spent on Alaska military installations. State economist Neal Fried says Alaska is often isolated from national economic trends because its economy is so different: manufacturing is for the most part limited to seafood processing, and the economy is built mostly around the energy sector and federal spending on the military and other government installations. The pain is hardest in the rural, remote communities where energy and food costs are way above the national average because of transportation costs. The job market is so tight that the state now posts a caution on its Division of Employment Security Web site suggesting people not move to Alaska unless they already have work lined up. Tax cuts aimed at job creation is one wish, a faster decision on proposals for new exploration leases on the outercontinental shelf is another.
