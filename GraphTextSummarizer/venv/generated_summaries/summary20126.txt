"They represent the true spirits of our country, going above and beyond for their communities, our nation and their fellow Americans." Three other people were honored this year: Jesse Shaffer III and Jesse Shaffer IV refused to give up in August of last year as floodwater rose and torrential rain pelted their Louisiana neighborhood, even though local officials had called off rescue efforts. "If more people cared about other people and they did things that were actually nice without expecting to get anything out of it, things would work out a lot nicer," Wemhoff said. "We'd have a lot less crime and a lot less BS, excuse my language, and more people helping people." The father-and-son team used their boat to rescue 120 people during Hurricane Isaac, according to award organizers, including a family of five that was clinging to the roof of a trailer. He "has gone above and beyond to improve the lives of the homeless in Southern California, and by example throughout the United States," award organizers said.
