On Thursday, the newcomer was announced as a contender for the Oscar for best actor in a supporting role, a category that includes stars like Jared Leto ("Dallas Buyers Club"), Jonah Hill ("Wolf of Wall Street") and Bradley Cooper ("American Hustle"). "I was at my friend's house in Minneapolis, just hanging out, and the local channel said that there was a casting call for a Tom Hanks film, (needing) Somali actors," he's told CNN's Christiane Amanpour. Just a few months ago, he was known only as one of Tom Hanks' co-stars in the film based on the Somali hijacking of the Maersk Alabama in 2009, but today, he's known far and wide as something else. Undeterred, Abdi went to the casting call at a Minneapolis community center and wound up landing the role of Somali leader Muse. My performance is a testament to the vision of our incredible director Paul Greengrass, and our other Captain -- the generous, amazing, and inspiring Tom Hanks."
