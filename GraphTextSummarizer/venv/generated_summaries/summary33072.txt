U.S. sources confirmed European newspaper accounts that Kalymon is under investigation by a unit of the German police, which could eventually lead to him being taken into German custody. Kalymon is one of only four remaining targets of Justice Department Nazi hunters. Kalymon, a resident of Michigan,  was ordered removed by a Detroit judge in January, 2011. A U.S. government source said the biggest problem the United States faces is finding a European country willing to take Kalymon. The court found that as a member of the Ukrainian Auxiliary Police in German-occupied Lviv, Ukraine, he had rounded up and shot Jews.
