Essentially, you build an app in a single day using languages including javascript and HTML, and you get to think like a developer, think like a computer and break down problems. Technology is transforming every single industry all our lives are being rapidly affected by the pace of technological change -- it's the languages of billions now. If you're leading a business at the moment, the one thing that is erratically changing your business right now is technology: in terms of skills, in terms of your consumers, in terms of the marketplace that you exist in. We all should be understanding and feel confident of those technologies, whether you want to become a programmer and developer or you simply want to lead a business that's being transformed by technology. Taking someone from zero skills, zero knowledge and zero confidence to these words that we use all the time -- digital enlightenment.
