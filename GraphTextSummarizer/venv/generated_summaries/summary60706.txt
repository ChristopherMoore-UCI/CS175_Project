But what could have been a horrifying tragedy turned into a celebration Wednesday when Montessori school teacher Cristina Torre -- daughter of the former New York Yankees manager Joe Torre -- caught the 1-year-old after he bounced off an awning. Joe Torre: Baseball champ and domestic abuse survivor CNN's Chris Boyette, Leigh Remizowski and Erinn Cawthon and CNN Sports' Joseph S. Miller contributed to this report. They were awaiting arraignment Thursday on child endangerment charges. Torre's dad released a statement Wednesday night saying, "I am very proud of my daughter Cristina's actions today during an incident in Brooklyn involving a small child. Their 1-year-old son, whose name has not been released, was discharged from Lutheran Medical Center in Brooklyn hours after the incident, a hospital spokeswoman said Thursday.
