"One of the most important things about roller derby is your derby name," explains Shawn Graaff, who founded Cape Town Rollergirls in 2010. Roller derby is a sport that requires strategy, team spirit and lots of body checking. Looking ahead, the Cape Town league is gearing up to host an officiating director from the international governing body of women's roller derby. The Cape Town Rollergirls league is made up of three teams -- the Rev'ettes, the Storm Riders and the Iron Meisies -- boasting a variety of female players, from working mothers and students to locals and ex-pats. " "TazMEANian Devil" is a proud member of the Rev'ettes, one of the three roller derby teams that take part in the women-only Cape Town Rollergirls league.
