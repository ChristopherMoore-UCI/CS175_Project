The lawsuit against Southwest Airlines, filed in Queens, New York, alleges that due to the airline's "negligence" Young, 48, "sustained serious, severe and permanent injuries to her limbs and body, still suffers and will continue to suffer for some time, great physical and mental pain and serious bodily injury. Under a normal landing in a big jet, the main landing gear under each wing would touch the runway first and simultaneously -- absorbing the main stress of landing -- and the nose gear then lowered gradually as the plane decelerates down the runway. "They are responsible for landing the plane properly ... to have the nose pointed upward so the main landing gear touches down first," Rubenstein told CNN Saturday. According to the city's port authority, 10 people suffered minor injuries as a result of the July 22 landing. Initially, the Federal Aviation Administration said the crew reported a possible nose gear problem before landing, but later amended that to say that after it reviewed air controller tapes, no issues were noted ahead of time.
