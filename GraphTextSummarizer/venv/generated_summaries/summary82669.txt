The 18 operators of a high-end escort service allegedly banking on Super Bowl week to deliver "party packs" of cocaine and prostitutes have been charged with drug and sex trafficking, New York authorities said Thursday. The nearly year-long undercover investigation discovered that in addition to selling the "party packs," the ring allegedly laundered the illegal proceeds through front businesses that included a clothing wholesaler, a wig wholesaler, a limousine service and a beauty supply wholesaler, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a statement. The ring targeted wealthy customers in New York for large events, authorities said. " The enterprise allegedly generated millions of dollars in illegal proceeds and planned to target high-end clientele coming to the New York area for the Super Bowl this weekend.
