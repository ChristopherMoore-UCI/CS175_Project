-- Gov. David Paterson of New York has told state agencies to recognize same-sex marriages performed in states and countries where they are legal, his spokeswoman said Wednesday. The memo informed state agencies that failing to recognize gay marriages would violate the New York's human rights law, Duggan said. Court officials in California counties may begin issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples on June 17, state officials said Wednesday. The governor's legal counsel told state agencies in a May 14 memo to revise policies and regulations to recognize same-sex marriages performed in California and Massachusetts as well as Canada and other countries that allow gays and lesbians to marry, said Erin Duggan, the governor's spokeswoman. Massachusetts legalized same-sex marriages in 2004, and gay couples need not be state residents there to wed.
