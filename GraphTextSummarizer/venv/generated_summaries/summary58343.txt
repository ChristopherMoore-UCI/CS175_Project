The military and police have detained large numbers of Brotherhood officials and supporters since the ouster of former President Mohamed Morsy in July. Hundreds of people have been killed in clashes between security forces and supporters of Morsy and the Brotherhood, many of them when the military used force to clear two pro-Morsy sit-in sites in Cairo in August. Egypt's general prosecutor had issued an arrest warrant for el-Erian, the former leader of the majority party in Egypt's upper house of Parliament, accusing him and other party members of "inciting violence" and "aiding criminal acts," the interior ministry said. Before his arrest, he was one of the most senior Muslim Brotherhood leaders still at large. The military's overthrow of the democratically elected Morsy, amid widespread demonstrations calling for his resignation, has plunged Egypt deeper into turmoil.
