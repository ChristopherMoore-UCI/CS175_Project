-- The publisher of a firsthand account of the raid that killed al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden said Tuesday it was moving up its release date by one week to September 4. The serviceman was on the Bin Laden raid, according to Pentagon officials. Owen said in a statement Tuesday that he had a "strict desire not to disclose confidential or sensitive information that would compromise national security in any way." Officials only recently became aware the former SEAL was writing a book, but were told it encompasses more than just the raid and includes vignettes from training and other missions. Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said officials are reviewing the publication.
