In response to Russia's invasion and annexation of parts of Ukraine, President Obama this week announced new sanctions against 11 Russian and Ukrainian officials. There are no more than 20 instances of attempted aggression, invasion and annexation since the end of World War II. The international response so far is to deny visas to a small group of Russian officials and deny them access to whatever property they have stashed abroad. Further, forceful international reaction to banditry like that of Russian President Vladimir Putin provides the opportunity to reinforce the new norm and the strength of feeling followed by the commitment to enforce it. We are ignoring the lessons of history that demonstrate how unusual and unacceptable invasion and annexation are in the post-World War II era.
