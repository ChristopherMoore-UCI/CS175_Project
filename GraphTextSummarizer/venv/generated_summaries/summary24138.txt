As the chances for passing immigration reform diminish, and the possibilities of achieving progress on climate change are nil, tax reform might be one of the few areas where progress is possible. Most fiscal conservatives understand that serious deficit reduction is only possible through a combination of tax hikes and spending cuts. But in fact there is reason to believe that tax reform might have a chance to pass. Although achieving tax reform is extraordinarily difficult, Democrats and Republicans could walk away from a deal looking as if they were finally willing to take on the status quo in Washington and to defy the powerful interest groups who lurk on K Street. Both parties also stand to benefit from tax reform because it remains one of the best ways to raise revenue without raising taxes.
