South Korean intelligence officials said that members of the North's ruling party were shot by firing squad for viewing a South Korean soap opera. But in his televised speech, for the first time ever, the communist leader said he'd talk with Park, South Korean news agency Yonhap reported. North Korean soldiers opening fire on these balloons last year struck South Korean territory. The South imposed an economic sanctions package on the North in 2010 over the attack on a South Korean navy ship that killed 46 sailors. "The South and the North will have to meet each other and discuss ways toward peaceful reunification," Ryoo later told journalists.
