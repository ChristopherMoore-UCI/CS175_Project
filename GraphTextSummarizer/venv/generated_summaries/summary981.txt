On Monday, the South Korean coast guard released new footage of the captain and other crew members leaving the ship -- images that to me are equally disturbing. In some countries, including South Korea, abandoning ship is a maritime crime. Of the many shocking and wrenching images that have come from the sinking of the Sewol ferry, one that stands out for me depicts the vessel's captain -- head bowed and covered by a hood -- standing on dry land admitting he had abandoned ship. Yes, the captain and 14 other Sewol crew members have been arrested amid ongoing investigations. None of the crew, including the captain, identified themselves to rescuers as crew members, the first coast guard responders said in a press conference on Monday.
