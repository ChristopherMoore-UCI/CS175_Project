President Barack Obama has signed a covert directive authorizing U.S. support for Syrian rebels battling President Bashar al-Assad's forces, U.S. officials told CNN on Wednesday. Restore order to Syria U.S. officials have told CNN that Washington is cooperating with countries that are arming the rebels, including Saudi Arabia and Qatar, to help find groups worthy of aid. The Obama administration has resisted arming the opposition, in part, because U.S. officials don't know enough about the rebels. The Obama administration has ruled out arming the rebels for now, providing only nonlethal assistance, such as communications equipment. During the war in Libya, Obama signed a similar directive authorizing covert assistance for rebels in the battle against Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.
