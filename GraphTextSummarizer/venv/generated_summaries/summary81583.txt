Striker Javier Hernandez, another halftime replacement, wrapped up the victory with his ninth goal this season to put United two points clear of City -- who on Sunday travel to a Chelsea team under the guidance of new manager Rafael Benitez. The match marked Darren Fletcher's first Premier League start in more than a year following a chronic bowel complaint which threatened to end his career, and the Scotland midfielder capped it by heading United in front following Jonny Evans' equalizer. "Anderson changed the game," said manager Ferguson said of the Brazilian midfielder, who has started only five matches in all competitions this season. United went behind for the 13th time in 20 games this season, and the fifth in a row, as forward Jamie Mackie scored for QPR in the 52nd minute from Kieron Dyer's low cross.
