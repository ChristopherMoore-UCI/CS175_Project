Forced citations are actually a big part of Tumblr's design, as founder David Karp explained last weekend at the Mashable Connect conference in Orlando, Florida. If your friend gave credit to a tipster whom you don't know, no need to do serial citations ("AMAZING PUPPY VIDEO via @myfriend via @herfriend via @anotherrando.") Look, one of the Web's greatest powers is its sheer volume, the seemingly infinite library of well-argued political views, vivid picture galleries, real-time citizen journalism and "Tron" fan trailers. So when someone lifts our content without credit -- even just a link or gem we found in the morass of the interwebs -- we are rightfully angered. Finding (or coming up with) cool or hilarious stuff and sharing it with others is a skill, one that should be appropriately lauded with that sweet ego-building nectar we call credit.
