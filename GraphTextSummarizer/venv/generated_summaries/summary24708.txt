A visitor to East Potomac Park found the cache of cards in a grassy area and notified police, who combed through crime reports but have thus far struck out on identifying the owner. "That Fred Lynn card is pretty cool," Breul said, referring to the outfielder who starred for the Sox in the '70s. "We don't know if it fell off the back of a car," Lt. Nicholas Breul said Wednesday, indicating it's his guess that they were stolen. Since June 24, the Metropolitan Police Department has been trying to find the rightful owner of well more than 500 cards, each carefully placed in a plastic protective sleeve. Players include Reggie Smith, Gary Carter and Toby Harrah.
