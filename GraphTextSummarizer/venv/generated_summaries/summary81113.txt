"I don't believe that Robel Phillipos has ever been more angry at a person than he was at Dzhokhar Tsarnaev when Robel found out that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev did what he did in this case," Church said after the verdict. Robel Phillipos, a friend of Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's, was convicted Tuesday on two counts of lying to federal agents investigating the 2013 bombing, according to the U.S. attorney's office. According to court documents, Phillipos hadn't seen or talked to Dzhokhar Tsarnaev for at least two months before the bombing. Prosecutors said Phillipos repeatedly lied to investigators when he denied that he entered Tsarnaev's dormitory room and saw Kadyrbayev remove a backpack containing fireworks on the evening of April 18, 2013. On April 18, Phillipos went with Tazhayakov to Tsarnaev's dormitory room, where he and Tazhayakov watched as Kadyrbayev searched through Tsarnaev's belongings and found a backpack containing fireworks.
