Pressure has grown on FIFA since this year's World Cup in South Africa after Frank Lampard's disallowed goal for England in the second-round match against Germany. -- FIFA opened the door to the introduction of goal-line technology at the 2014 World Cup, but has put in place a rigorous testing program for companies hoping to win the contract. Ironically, this time midfielder Lampard benefited from the status quo as he was awarded a crucial goal despite TV replays showing Tottenham goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes had prevented it crossing the line after his fumble. There have been renewed calls for action after last weekend's English Premier League match between Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur. British company Hawkeye, whose products are used in international cricket, is expected to be one of the companies to take part in the process.
