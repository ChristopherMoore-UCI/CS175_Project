That appeals panel concluded that "California's prohibition of the slaughter of nonambulatory animals does not duplicate federal procedures; it withdraws from slaughter animals that are unable to walk to their death. State lawyer Susan Smith said California could exclude certain animals covered under federal regulations, thereby making state regulation permissible. The industry says federal inspection is preferred, since pre-slaughter inspections of sick animals are required. At issue is whether federal regulations dealing with inspection of domesticated animals about to be killed, processed and sold for human consumption preempt -- or nullify -- California Penal Code 599f. The long-standing Federal Meat Inspection Act also requires animals lying down to be removed but gives discretion to federal inspectors to determine whether the livestock can recover sufficiently and become fit for slaughter and human consumption.
