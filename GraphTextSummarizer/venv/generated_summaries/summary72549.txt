Rafael Nadal beat Novak Djokovic in a one-sided Monte Carlo Masters final Sunday to claim his eighth straight title in the principality. But he had not won on the ATP Tour since claiming the French Open at Roland Garros last June as Djokovic has dominated. Djokovic, who was playing this week after learning of the death of his grandfather in Serbia, took the first game to love but struggled to maintain that level. "I'm still very happy to reach the finals for the second time," he added, referring to his 2009 loss to Nadal in Monte Carlo. " Nadal has made the title his own at the distinctive clay court tournament overlooking the Mediterranean and was clinching his 20th in a Masters 1000 tournament, the first man to reach that landmark.
