Dortmund had the better of the match from the start, inflicting Bremen's first defeat under new coach Robin Dutt. Monaco were taken over by Russian billionaire Dmitriy Rybolovlev and his cash injection saw them promoted from Ligue 2 to become one of the favorites for the title this term after bringing in a clutch of star players, including Falcao from Atletico Madrid. Last season's Champions League finalists made it three wins from three games thanks to a goal from prolific Poland striker Robert Lewandowski. Emmanuel Riviere, scorer of four goals in those games, and big money signing Radamel Falcao drew blank, but the former did go close twice against his old side in the first half. Lacking atmosphere, Monaco's players could find no inspiration after 2-0 wins over Bordeaux and a 4-1 thumping of Montpellier in their opening matches.
