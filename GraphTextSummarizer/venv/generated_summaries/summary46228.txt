-- Joran van der Sloot, the Dutch man once considered a suspect in the 2005 disappearance of Alabama teenager Natalee Holloway, is the suspect in the killing of a woman in Peru, Peruvian police officials said Wednesday. In 2005, van der Sloot was arrested in Aruba along with two other men, brothers Deepak and Satish Kalpoe, in connection with the disappearance of Natalee Holloway. Interpol has alerted its office in Chile and other bordering countries of the case and placed them on alert in case van der Sloot tries to leave that country, Peruvian Interpol Interim Director Gerson Ortiz told CNN. Similar to the Holloway case, van der Sloot and Flores allegedly met at a night spot, in this case, a casino. In it, van der Sloot tells a man he considered to be his friend that he had sex with Holloway on the beach after leaving the nightclub, then she "started shaking" and lost consciousness.
