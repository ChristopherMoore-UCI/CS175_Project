"Koch supports small businesses all over the country through our relationships with our vendors and suppliers and we support wholeheartedly the fundamental mission of NFIB --principled entrepreneurship," he said. Lisa Gilbert of the government watchdog group Public Citizen said the NFIB is "taking the name of small business in vain. They also opposed increasing income tax rates on people making $250,000 or more, even though the vast majority of small businesses aren't affected by the rate hike. " "The idea that Koch brothers money in some way is going to help small businesses is laughable," Gilbert said. Of the five men that sit on the group's board, four are current or former employees of Koch companies and one is a friend of Charles Koch's.
