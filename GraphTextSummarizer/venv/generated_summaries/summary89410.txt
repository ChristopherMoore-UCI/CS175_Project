Sarah wasn't able to qualify for adult lungs because she was too young; the agency that oversees transplants, the Organ Procurement and Transplant Network, had a policy that children only 12 or older could be prioritized for adult organs. The organ network approved a change to their policy to allow lung transplant programs to request additional priority for younger transplant candidates. She remained on the bypass machine -- "her doctors prepared us for the probability that Sarah would die, either before a second surgery could take place or on the operating table," her family said -- until June 15, when new lungs became available and a second transplant took place. The family petitioned Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius to change the rules so Sarah could qualify for adult lungs. -- Sarah Murnaghan, the 10-year-old girl whose quest for a lung transplant prompted a change in national policy, is up and walking.
