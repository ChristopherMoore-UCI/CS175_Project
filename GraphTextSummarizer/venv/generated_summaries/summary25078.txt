The win continues Italy's remarkable record in major tournaments against Germany, who have failed to beat the Italians in eight attempts. Italy left two strikers forward and the tactic paid off as Riccardo Montolivo swept a long ball over the head of Philipp Lahm, allowing Balotelli to chest the ball down and run clear before smashing an unstoppable shot beyond a stunned Manuel Neuer. Balotelli curled a shot across the face of goal before limping off with cramp and Claudio Marchisio twice drilled wide from inviting positions as Italy failed to kill off the German threat. -- Mario Balotelli's first-half double saw Italy through to the final of Euro 2012 as they stunned Germany in Warsaw. Germany stood off Pirlo, allowing the Italy playmaker to sweep a pass out to Giorgio Chiellini who fed Antonio Cassano.
