The squirrel comedy, which earned a solid "B" rating from CinemaScore audiences, managed to outperform its modest expectations. With families looking for holiday entertainment, The Nut Job should swap places with Lone Survivor by the end of Monday. The increasingly ubiquitous Hart, who recently told EW that Ride Along is "my baby," scored big with a $41.2 million opening weekend for the buddy-cop comedy. Director Peter Berg, whose Battleship bombed so badly, made Lone Survivor for $40 million and now can boast about a $74 million domestic total. (If you're still not sold on the Hart/Cube pairing, whose chemistry lifted the film to an "A" approval rating with CinemaScore audiences, let this stupendous spot on Conan give you a taste of their chemistry.)
