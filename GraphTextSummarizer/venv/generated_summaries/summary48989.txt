-- Amanda Sedgmer, mother of five and daughter of coal country, believes that in this presidential election, her way of life is at stake. Environmentalists believe the EPA rule and the increasing closures of coal plants are breakthroughs that are overdue and will do dramatic good. Romney hopes all this concern helps him in the Buckeye swing state and in other coal communities. Les Brown, the president of the Earth Policy Institute, points to studies that coal emissions, including mercury and other pollutants, cause more than 10,000 deaths a year. But those in coal country give much higher estimates.
