His 1977 Toyota Dolphin camper, which Spieker rescued from a salvage yard, had carried him, his wife, Katie, and 4-month-old son, Jacob, from Florida to Colorado earlier this summer, a cross-country sojourn in search of work. -- John Spieker stood on the back porch of his newly rented Bailey, Colorado, home, thankful for his Good Samaritan landlord and worried that his previous home, parked in the driveway, wouldn't get him to work the next day. The home's owner is working a temporary contract construction job on the other side of Colorado, Spieker said, enabling the deal. Life got a bit easier on July 20, when Spieker landed work at an auto parts store. With Florida's unemployment rate at 10.6 percent in June, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, he investigated where prospects might be better, settling on Colorado (7.6 unemployment), and if things didn't work out there, North Dakota (the nation's lowest unemployment at 4.2 percent).
