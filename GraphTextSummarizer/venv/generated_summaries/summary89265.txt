Bryan Jones pleaded no contest in October 2012 to a charge of felony hazing resulting in death. -- Moments after a Florida A&M drum major's parents asked that their son's death due to hazing not be in vain, a Florida judge doled out punishment Friday to his roommate for his role in the death -- a sentence that doesn't include time in prison. He pleaded nolo contendere, or no contest, to a felony charge of hazing resulting in death and first-degree hazing, which is a misdemeanor. But minutes earlier, both Pam and Robert Champion Sr. elaborated on their feelings after their son was beaten on a bus after a November 2011 football game in Orlando, Florida, as part of a band hazing ritual. Rikki Wills is subject to a year of community control -- a form of house arrest -- and five years of probation, Ninth Judicial Circuit Court Judge Donald Myers, Jr., ruled.
