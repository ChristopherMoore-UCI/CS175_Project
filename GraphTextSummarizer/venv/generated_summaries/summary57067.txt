-- At least 76 people died in Norway in a terror attack July 22 that started with a bomb blast in the capital Oslo and continued with an hour-long gun rampage at a camp for Labour Party teens and young adults on nearby Utoya Island. NEW DEVELOPMENTS --Anders Breivik was " a little bit surprised" that his attacks succeeded, his lawyer Geir Lippestad says Tuesday, adding that Breivik had not expected to get to Utoya Island. --Police say they are investigating Breivik claims that two other terror cells assisted him in the attack. --A 1,518-page manifesto bearing Breivik's name circulates online, containing rants about the rising number of Muslims in Europe, describing detailed plans for getting weapons, explosives and fake uniforms, and saying how to avoid detection by police while preparing the attack. He says Breivik "may be" insane, but that it is too early to say if he will mount an insanity defense.
