French hostage Herve Gourdel was abducted and beheaded, a killing shown on video, French President Francois Hollande told the United Nations General Assembly on Wednesday. " "It is with a lot of sorrow and sadness that the Algerian government has learned about the horrible assassination of French national Pierre Herv√© Gourdel, an odious and despicable act committed by a group of criminals," officials said, according to the state-run Algerie Presse Service news agency. ISIS execution videos strikingly similar Titled "A message of blood for the French government," the video surfaced as French Prime Minister Manuel Valls addressed the French National Assembly, the country's lower house of parliament, about the fight against ISIS. It shows armed men who claim to belong to Islamist militant group Jund al-Khilafa -- or Soldiers of the Caliphate -- in Algeria. Gourdel was kidnapped over the weekend in Algeria's Tizi Ouzou region east of Algiers, the French Foreign Ministry said.
