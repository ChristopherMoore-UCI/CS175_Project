The woman filed her complaint in Ibiza in August 2008, but a local judge shelved it last year, citing a lack of evidence that a crime had been committed, according to court documents. She awoke on a yacht to find she was being sexually assaulted by a man she identified as Prince Alwaleed, according to court documents. According to court documents obtained by CNN, the victim argued in her appeal that the real reason the lower court tossed out the case was that the alleged perpetrator was a powerful member of the Saudi royal family. -- A Spanish court has reopened an investigation into an allegation that one of the world's richest men, Saudi Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal, raped a young woman on a yacht on the island of Ibiza in 2008. A second document shows that the lower court has complied with the latest ruling, labeling Prince Alwaleed as a person an "imputado," or someone "under official investigation," and is seeking a statement from him.
