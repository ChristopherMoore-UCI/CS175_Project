Goals from Garra Dembele and Barcelona star Seydou Keita with the winner secured the runners-up spot from the group behind Ghana, who were held 1-1 by Guinea in a match played at the same time in Franceville. It earned Mali, reaching this stage for the first time in eight years, a match against their coach Alain Giresse's former team, co-hosts Gabon. Mali substitute Ousmane Coulibaly hit the crossbar with an effort before Tidiane Cheick Diabete set up Keita to net from close range with 15 minutes left. But Abdoul Razzagui Camara drew Guinea deservedly level in first half stoppage time. Guinea were reduced to 10 men in the second half after Bah Dioulde was sent off after being booked for a second time on 70 minutes.
