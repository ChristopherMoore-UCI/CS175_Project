The generation I speak of is defined by people who use social media to incessantly share information about their favorite topic: themselves. Well, the new craze of "funeral selfies" is a clue: People snap a self-portrait in front of the body at a wake and share it on social media. And, of course, Facebook, the granddaddy of social media, is a great way to share every mundane event in your life. Sharing our thoughts and experiences on social media is now part of our DNA, a reflex action without a second thought. It can be as simple as taking a selfie as you walk past a soup kitchenâ€”or better yet, help out in one-- and sharing it on social media.
