-- A top African-American lawmaker urged President Barack Obama on Thursday to focus more attention on the plight of unemployed black Americans, warning that there is growing frustration with the administration among some of its staunchest backers. During her interview with CNN on Thursday, Waters pushed the president to take what she characterized as a tougher stance against conservative tea party activists. " Voices in the crowd could be heard imploring Waters to press Obama on issues like unemployment. An increasing number of progressives have complained that Obama was too willing to compromise with conservatives in recent debt ceiling and related budget negotiations. Earlier this week, Waters questioned Obama's failure to visit any predominantly African-American communities during his Midwest bus tour.
