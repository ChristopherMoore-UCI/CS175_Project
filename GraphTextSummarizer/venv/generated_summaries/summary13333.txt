"If other people post quotes and photos claiming to be me or my family, please, do not send them personal information or click links, even for charity. "Thank you to the incomparable @dr_woo_ssc for so beautifully bringing my reminders to life," she wrote, thanking tattoo artist Dr. Woo of Mike Mahoney's Shamrock Social Club in Hollywood. Shortly after her father's suicide in August, Zelda Williams abandoned her Twitter and Instagram accounts after saying that some people had sent her messages blaming her for her father's death and sending her PhotoShopped images of her father's dead body. "As for this Instagram, I don't know in what capacity I'll continue using it in the future, but I'm leaving it up regardless so that fake accounts hoping to use my name or misuse my family's photos will get no traction. "For poppo," wrote Zelda Williams on her Instagram account Wednesday, posting the picture of a tattoo on what appears to be her right hand, above a tattoo of Robin's birthday, "7.21.51," written on her wrist.
