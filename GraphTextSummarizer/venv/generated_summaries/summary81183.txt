" CNN's Open Court presenter and former Wimbledon champion Pat Cash disagrees with Borg, and thinks Nadal will retain his crown. Borg, who won 15 majors between 1974 and 1981, is confident the six-time champion can overcome holder Rafael Nadal, in-form Serb Novak Djokovic and fourth seed Andy Murray at the All England Club tournament. " Although Borg tipped the 29-year-old Federer to shine, the former world number one would not be surprised if top seed Nadal, Australian Open winner Djokovic or home-crowd favorite Murray clinched the title. The Swede cited Federer's form during the recent French Open at Roland Garros, where the Swiss lost to the Spaniard Nadal in the final, as the reason behind his prediction. Nadal equaled Borg's record of six French Open triumphs with his victory over 16-time major champion Federer earlier this month, and the 55-year-old said he has enjoyed watching the pair's rivalry develop over the last few years.
