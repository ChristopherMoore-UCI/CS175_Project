During their first visit, some children said they heard club members asking why African-American children were there. After news reports of the incident, the office of Sen. Arlen Specter (D-Pennsylvania) said Specter sent a letter to the club president asking him to reinstate the contract with Creative Steps, saying, "I think that you would agree that there is no place for racism in America today. He said he underestimated the amount of children who would participate, and the club's capacity to take on the groups was not up to the task. "There were a lot of children in the pool and not enough lifeguards," he said. He also said invitations to two other day care centers, neither of which contained minority children, had previously been withdrawn.
