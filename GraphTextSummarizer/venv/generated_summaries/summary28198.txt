If teens are swimming in a natural body of water like a lake or river, they should use the rule "feet first, first time" to prevent spinal injuries. "The first thing to remember is that drowning doesn't just happen," says Alison Osinski, water safety expert and president of Aquatic Consulting Services. But the recent death of a 13-year-old at a pool in Florida has experts concerned about water safety for pre-teens and adolescents. Diving into shallow water could result in paralysis from a spinal injury. Following the rules of a pool is also key: no running, no horseplay, no diving into shallow water.
