"Because of the polarization of information sources, news manipulation, propaganda, technical constraints and the extreme violence to which journalists and citizen journalists are exposed, anyone trying to gather or disseminate news and information in Syria needs a real sense of vocation," the Reporters Without Borders report said. " After Syria, the report said, Somalia was the next most dangerous place for journalists, with 18 killed in 2012, followed by Pakistan, the world's deadliest country for the media from 2009 to 2011, with 10 deaths of media personnel. This year has been the deadliest for journalists in the field since monitoring began 17 years ago, according to an annual report released Wednesday by Reporters Without Borders. "The reason for the unprecedented number of journalists killed in 2012 is mainly the war in Syria, the chaos in Somalia and Taliban violence in Pakistan," said Christophe Deloire, secretary-general of the nonprofit group. "The impunity enjoyed by those responsible for violations of human rights, in particular, the right to freedom of information, encourages the continuation of these violations."
