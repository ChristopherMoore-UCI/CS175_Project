In fact, many studies conclude that mass incarceration is crimogenic, i.e., locking up people for minor offenses increases crime because they become hardened behind bars. But we cannot keep going down the road of locking up more people for longer amounts of time. Here's one stark way to understand our new normal of mass incarceration: If we wanted to return to 1970s level of incarceration, we'd have to release four out of five people behind bars today. This comes at a time when soaring costs of prisons are wreaking havoc on federal, state and local budgets, as schools, libraries, parks and social programs are slashed. Why is the left so rarely concerned about the warehoused young lives and the destruction of inner city families from our culture of mass incarceration?
