The discovery of millions of extra ballots proves that President Robert Mugabe intends to rig next week's elections in his favor, Zimbabwe's main opposition party said Sunday. Last week, New York-based Human Rights Watch raised doubts about the elections, saying it was likely to be "deeply flawed." "As the elections near, all indications are that once again the people of Zimbabwe will not be able to freely exercise their civil and political rights and vote for the candidates of their choice," the nongovernmental organization said in a 48-page report. But his odds of winning this time may be handicapped by Zimbabwe's dire economic situation. Watch Mugabe threaten to expel companies under British rule. Mugabe survived a hotly contested presidential challenge from MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai in 2002 amid widespread accusations of vote rigging.
