In addition to Fey and Gervais, "Muppets Most Wanted" also has appearances from Tom Hiddleston, Salma Hayek, Stanley Tucci and Lady Gaga. The only people noticeably missing from the account are the Muppets' human co-stars in "Muppets Most Wanted," like Tina Fey, Ty Burrell and Ricky Gervais. The feed was launched just over a month ago as part of a promotional push for their upcoming movie, "Muppets Most Wanted." Directed by James Bobin, who also helmed the first film, "Muppets Most Wanted" takes the fan-favorite characters to Europe, where they find themselves entangled in a jewel heist led by a Kermit the Frog doppelganger. As with the first "Muppets" film, which also starred Amy Adams, Chris Cooper and Rashida Jones, the "Muppets" sequel has plenty of human star power.
