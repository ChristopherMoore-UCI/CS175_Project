Over the past few years a number of news photographers have quite rightly been fired for altering images with the help of Photoshop. But every time I see one of these "news images" -- subtly altered to resemble images taken on vintage film stock or using expensive lenses and filters -- I feel cheated. Hipstamatic, Instagram and other apps produce images that are equally unethical or perhaps even more so. With an app typically costing no more than $1.99, everyone is becoming a news photographer -- creating dramatic, emotive images with subdued tones, vignetted edges and selective focus. Surely as a news photographer I should welcome the publication of news pictures of any kind, however they are taken.
