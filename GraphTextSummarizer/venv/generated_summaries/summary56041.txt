Australia's Queensland coast continued to be lashed by heavy rain and winds exceeding 250 kilometers per hour (155 mph) Friday, despite Tropical Cyclone Marcia being downgraded to a Category 4 storm. " Seven News reporter Tom Hartley posted a video that showed winds whipping through palm trees as heavy rains pelted Rosslyn Bay. Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk warned the storm remained "very serious" and urged the public in affected areas to remain indoors amid the threat of flooding and high winds, which have brought down trees and caused some damage to homes. Along the coast, the storm brought higher than normal tides and dangerous surf conditions. Queensland's Bureau of Meteorology said the Yeppoon area, where some 800 people were forced into temporary shelters, had seen the most "destructive winds" after the storm made landfall at around 8 a.m. Friday (5 p.m. ET Thursday).
