-- Ivory Coast striker Didier Drogba confirmed his switch to China's Shanghai Shenhua on Wednesday, a move which will reunite him with former Chelsea teammate Nicolas Anelka. Former Argentina coach Sergio Batista is now in charge of the team, and he is looking forward to working with former Marseille star Drogba. Drogba scored 157 goals for Chelsea in his eight seasons at the club, winning three English Premier League titles, four FA Cups and two League Cups as well as the London club's long-awaited first European crown. " Drogba and Anelka are two of a number of soccer stars to have joined China's premier football competition. But Shenhua owner Zhu is confident Drogba can have a positive impact on results as he seeks his first title since taking over in 2007 -- and the club's first since 2003.
