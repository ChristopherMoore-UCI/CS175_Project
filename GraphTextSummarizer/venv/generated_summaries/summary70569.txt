-- Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes "amicably settled" their divorce just two weeks after Holmes filed for it, an attorney told CNN Monday. "With respect to Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes divorce, the church has no comment," spokeswoman Karin Pouw said. That statement, prepared jointly by Cruise, 50, and Holmes, 33, was sent to CNN by Cruise publicist Amanda Lundberg. "We are thrilled for Katie and her family and are excited to watch as she embarks on the next chapter of her life," said Holmes' attorney Jonathan Wolfe. In the June 28 divorce filing, Holmes sought sole custody of 6-year-old Suri.
