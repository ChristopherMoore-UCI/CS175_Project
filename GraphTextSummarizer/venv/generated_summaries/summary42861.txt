Mes Aynak is the missing link that shows Afghanistan's interconnectivity throughout Asia on the Silk Road. In my opinion, they want Mes Aynak to set a precedent -- to be a model for resource extraction of the one trillion dollars plus of valuable minerals like oil, copper, lithium and iron buried underneath Afghanistan. So, even worse than the senseless destruction of Mes Aynak, is the thought that this kind of cheap destructive process will be replicated all across Afghanistan. Specialists on site are working with extremely limited funding and the crudest of tools. On every potential mine lies an ancient site like Mes Aynak.
