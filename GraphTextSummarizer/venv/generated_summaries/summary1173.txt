Nancy Koenigsberg, the legal director of Disability Rights New Mexico, in Albuquerque, New Mexico, one of many patient advocacy groups that argued for stricter oversight of ECT devices in the lead-up to last week's meeting, says her organization was "pleased" with the outcome. On Friday, a majority of experts on the panel expressed support for classifying ECT devices as high risk for the treatment of depression and several other conditions. The devices, which induce a seizure by delivering an electrical current to a patient's brain, are used to treat intractable cases of depression, as well as bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and other mental disorders. If the FDA follows the panel's advice, as it usually does, the makers of ECT devices may need to provide the agency with additional safety and efficacy evidence, like that required for prescription drugs. Just two small companies in the U.S. make ECT devices, and some experts worry that neither will have the resources to conduct the studies that the FDA may require, which could ultimately restrict access to the treatment.
