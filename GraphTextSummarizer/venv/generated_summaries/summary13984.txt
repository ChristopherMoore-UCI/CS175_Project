Altez said van der Sloot will use every possible law that is available to him, and that if he exhausts Peruvian courts, they will reach out to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights in Costa Rica. After killing Flores, police say, van der Sloot took money and bank cards from her wallet and fled to Chile, where he was arrested on June 3. -- Joran van der Sloot, whose claim of unlawful incarceration was denied last week, will immediately appeal and fight all the way to the Peruvian Supreme Court and international courts, if necessary, his attorney told CNN Monday. In an attempt to nullify a confession he gave police, van der Sloot claimed his civil rights were violated following his arrest. Van der Sloot is also a suspect in the disappearance of Alabama teen Natalee Holloway in Aruba in 2005, though he has not been charged in that crime.
