Make a plan for Santa and his presents That can be hard to do via airplane, because anything that Santa brings on Christmas Day must be lugged back whenever you depart. Some holiday packages even include a small Christmas tree in the suite, so children can still find Santa's presents under a tree by the fireplace. Many of them aren't traveling to anyone's home, say American Express travel agents. Other holiday touches include carolers greeting guests at the entrance, Saturday lunches with Santa and sleigh rides that end up by the firepit with s'mores.
