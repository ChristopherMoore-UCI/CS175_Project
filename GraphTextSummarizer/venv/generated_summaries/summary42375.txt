The big story of the GOP presidential race these days is how Gov. Rick Perry has suddenly burst into the sky as a new star. A CNN poll taken over the weekend showed Perry building a 12-point lead over Romney among Republican voters, 30-18 with Sarah Palin third and Ron Paul slipping to fourth. Perry jumps in and turns the race upside down. Ironically, if Perry does flame out, he will have done Mitt Romney an enormous favor. Romney looks more the manager, Perry the leader.
