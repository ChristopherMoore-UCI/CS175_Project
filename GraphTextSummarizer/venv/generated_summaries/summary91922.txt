-- Firefighters continued their efforts Saturday to corral more of a perilous Colorado blaze, following a week in which its flames have moved through forests and neighborhoods, forcing thousands of evacuations and leaving a trail of destruction. "It will be some time before this fire is out, but our challenge now is to make sure we do everything to contain the damage," said Tom Vilsack, secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which includes the U.S. Forest Service, in Fort Collins. Even then, fire authorities had been optimistic they would do more to control the blaze on Saturday, when it was 20% contained. Going forward, it doesn't appear there will be much cooling or calming around Fort Collins and surrounding areas that would help those efforts. "This containment is expected to increase today," read an update on InciWeb, the U.S. multiagency Incident Fire Response website.
