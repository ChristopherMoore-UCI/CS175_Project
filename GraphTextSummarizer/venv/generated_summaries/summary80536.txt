Some officials say one issue the Brown shooting has exposed is one faced by a number of small police departments -- less-experienced, lower-paid officers. The conversations are part of a broader behind-the-scenes debate about how to tackle poor police relations within black communities in the St. Louis region. Brown's father calls for calm Gov. Jay Nixon took authority from the Ferguson Police Department and gave it to state authorities in the days following Brown's shooting. Criticism of the police chief has come from many directions -- Brown's family and friends, demonstrators, the U.S. Justice Department and members of the media -- over how his department handled the aftermath of Brown's shooting. Ferguson Police and St. Louis County law enforcement were widely criticized for being too heavy-handed in dealing with protesters and in how they interacted with media.
