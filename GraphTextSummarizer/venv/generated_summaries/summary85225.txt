While international journalists including me were ferried by government minders to a pro-Gadhafi rally at Green Square on Friday afternoon, multiple sources tell CNN that several Tripoli neighborhoods were wracked by running battles between protesters and security forces. "Almost immediately Gadhafi forces fired at them with live rounds. And according to several eyewitness accounts, major demonstrations were held against Libya's strongman as recently as last week. The government has repeatedly denied any anti-Gadhafi protests in Tripoli in recent weeks, including on Friday. On an almost hourly basis, regime officials and government minders tell foreign journalists that Tripoli is a stronghold of Gadhafi and that dissent has vanished in recent months.
