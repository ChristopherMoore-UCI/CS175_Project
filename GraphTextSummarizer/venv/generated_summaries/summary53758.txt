The wait began with a video showing two Japanese hostages, Goto and aspiring security contractor Haruna Yukawa. The Jordanians didn't, so governments and relatives were still waiting Friday to see whether ISIS followed through on its threat to kill al-Kassasbeh, followed by the beheading of a Japanese journalist, Kenji Goto. "What it shows is that they are reacting tactically," said CNN military analyst Ret. Coalition warplanes and drones continue flying over ISIS strongholds in northern Syria, looking for any signs of unusual activity -- perhaps a convoy moving toward the border with Turkey. Thursday's deadline was the third that ISIS set in less than a week.
