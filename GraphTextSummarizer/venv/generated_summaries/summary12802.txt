A witness to the shooting of Madison told CNN in 2006 that New Orleans police lined up "like at a firing range" and fatally shot the man in the back as he fled from them in the days after Hurricane Katrina swept ashore. A police department press release from October 4, 2005, said Madison, described as an unidentified gunman, was "confronted by a New Orleans Police officer. Announcement of the charges stemming from a federal civil rights investigation was made by Attorney General Eric Holder in New Orleans. Initial police accounts said that Madison, 40, reached for his waistband and turned on police, but Gaston said Madison did not appear to have a weapon and that he was running away from police "hands out, full speed" when he was shot. Holder promised the Justice Department will help restore the troubled New Orleans police department.
