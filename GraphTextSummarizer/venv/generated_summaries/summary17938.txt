-- Eleven people were killed and 29 injured during a stampede at an election rally for Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan, officials said. The stampede happened during a rally at Port Harcourt stadium in the country's southern delta, Rivers state spokesman Rita Inoma-Abbey told CNN. At another stop in Kano, supporters walked out before his speech, and in Ogun state he was criticized for calling opposition candidates "rascals." The stampede follows what has been an imperfect start to Jonathan's campaign. At his first campaign stop in Nassarawa state, youths defaced his posters, burned tires, and two people were killed in the confusion.
