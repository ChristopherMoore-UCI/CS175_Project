NBC has announced that the 26-year-old will portray Peter Pan in the network's upcoming musical, "Peter Pan Live!" Based on the 1954 Broadway musical, "Peter Pan Live!" will be executive produced by Craig Zadan and Neil Meron. "Peter Pan Live!" airs on NBC on December 4. And besides, what could go wrong in a live televised production with simultaneous flying, sword fighting and singing?" That sense of humor will likely be welcomed when "Peter Pan Live!" bows in December. "I have wanted to play Peter Pan since I was about three years old, so this is a dream come true," Williams said in a statement.
