Her cause of death was listed last month as "deferred," officials said. Authorities, however, said they're still reviewing additional medical information that will be used in their final ruling on her cause of death, and Houston's toxicology report should be complete "on or around March 23rd," the sources told CNN. Houston, 48, died February 11 in her room at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Beverly Hills, California, the day before the music industry gathered for the annual Grammy Awards in Los Angeles. A Los Angeles County coroner official last month downplayed the suspicion that drugs had played a major role in her death. She was taken twice to a Los Angeles hospital briefly after her mother's death, a source close to the family said last month.
