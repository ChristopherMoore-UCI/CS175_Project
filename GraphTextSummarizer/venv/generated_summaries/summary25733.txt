" The boys from Chicago's South Side also sent hearty congratulations from outside the Windy City, including ex-Chicago White Sox great and baseball Hall of Famer Frank Thomas and filmmaker Spike Lee. Chicago sealed its spot in the title game after topping Las Vegas in the U.S. title game on Saturday. The Jackie Robinson squad entered its own contest Saturday as the underdog -- its foe, Las Vegas, had beaten every team it faced -- including Chicago, which it crushed by a 13-2 score. Both of Chicago's professional baseball teams tweeted in support of the JRW team, as did the Chicago Bulls and Mayor Rahm Emanuel. "We're the best team in the nation and the second best team in the world -- you can't have anything better than that," Chicago pitcher and infielder Marquis Jackson told ESPN.
