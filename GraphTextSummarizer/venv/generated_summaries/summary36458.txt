Gurley Brown's 1962 book "Sex and the Single Girl" encouraged young women to enjoy being single, find fulfillment in work and non-marital relationships with men, and take pleasure in sex, Hearst said. Dr. Ruth: Brown told women the truth about sex Two years after publishing "Sex and the Single Girl," Gurley Brown followed it up with the 1964 bestseller "Sex and the Office." Gurley Brown was born in Arkansas in 1922 to schoolteacher parents and moved with her mother and sister to Los Angeles after her father's death. Together with her husband, David, who died in 2010, Gurley Brown began pitching more books and new magazines targeted at single women. It was Gurley Brown who invented today's notion of a modern woman -- one who could have both a successful career and an exciting, satisfying sex life, said Bonnie Fuller, the influential magazine editor who took over at Cosmopolitan when Gurley Brown stepped down in 1997. "Helen was one of the world's most recognized magazine editors and book authors, and a true pioneer for women in journalism -- and beyond," Hearst Chief Executive Frank Bennack said.
