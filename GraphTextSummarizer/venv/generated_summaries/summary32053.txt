Retired NFL star Keyshawn Johnson went to Bieber's home Monday to counsel him about the dangers of going too fast on the residential streets, but Bieber wouldn't speak to him, Johnson's rep said. Although his rep said Johnson did not report Bieber's speeding to law enforcement, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department spokesman told CNN that two neighbors did call the local sheriff's station to complain. Deputies visited Bieber's home in the Oaks, but Bieber refused to talk to them, too, sheriff's department spokesman Steve Whitmore said.
