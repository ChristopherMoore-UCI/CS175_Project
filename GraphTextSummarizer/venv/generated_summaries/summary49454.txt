"Girl if ur worried abt where tongues have been good thing ur ex boo is ur EX BOO cause we ALL know where THAT (tongue) been," Cyrus posted on March 6. Cyrus has heard about Perry's quip and gave her response on Twitter, coyly mentioning Perry's rumored ex-boyfriend, John Mayer. Miley Cyrus and Katy Perry have gotten into a mini war of words over their shared smooch at Cyrus' concert in February. At the time, it seemed the two pop stars were playing off Perry's hit, "I Kissed a Girl," as Cyrus said after the kiss was over, "I just kissed a girl, and I really liked it a lot." But according to Perry, Cyrus wanted more than Perry was willing to give.
