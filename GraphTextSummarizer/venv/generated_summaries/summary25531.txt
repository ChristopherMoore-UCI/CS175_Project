Five people died in the accident in Corona, California, including a man on the ground who was killed when one plane's engine crashed through the roof of a car dealership where he worked, said National Transportation Safety Board investigator Wayne Pollack. Investigators on Monday walk past the tail section of a plane lying in a car dealership. The NTSB, assisted by FBI evidence experts, completed the cleanup of wreckage and body parts that were spread over a commercial area of car dealerships, restaurants and other businesses near the Riverside Freeway Monday afternoon. The two men in the Cessna 150 were ejected after the plane was struck broadside by the Cessna 172, Pollack said. The FBI helped the NTSB mark where each piece was found, although the investigation does not involve any criminal aspect, Pollack said.
