It is accessible along a dirt and sand path that crosses smaller dunes on one end. The eastern mountains don't face the entire expanse of dunes, so the wind cuts the Sossusvlei valley into a "U" shape. It is a broad basin of parched ground surrounded by dunes. Ahead of us, waves of dunes twist across the basin. We have to stop to safely gaze across the barren valley at the silhouetted outlines of more towering dunes, set against the now dark but slowly lightening sky.
