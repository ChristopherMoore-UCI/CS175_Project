Thousands of flights into and out of Chicago's two airports have been delayed or canceled since a fire damaged a key Chicago air traffic control center Friday, creating flight problems that rippled across the nation. Long lines of stranded passengers have been clogging Chicago airports all weekend. Other control centers have handled many of the Chicago flights while repairs are made. After the fire, air traffic controllers initially had to transfer flight data manually rather than by computer, said Doug Church, spokesman for the National Air Traffic Controllers Association. CNN aviation analyst Mary Schiavo said the FAA has to take a second look at who has access to critical facilities.
