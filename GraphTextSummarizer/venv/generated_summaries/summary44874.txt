Israel has decided to freeze the transfer of more than $127 million in tax revenues collected on behalf of the Palestinians in the wake of their bid to join the International Criminal Court, Israel's newspaper Haaretz reported Saturday. CNN's Irene Nasser reported from Jerusalem, and Michael Martinez wrote and reported from Los Angeles. That move came a day after the U.N. Security Council rejected a resolution calling for Palestinian statehood by 2017, and for Israel to withdraw from the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The State Department said "direct negotiations are ultimately the only realistic path" for peace between Israel and the Palestinians. The bid sets the stage for the Palestinian Authority to possibly pursue war crime complaints against Israel.
