Federal Prosecutor Gerardo Pollicita filed a 61-page report essentially endorsing what prosecutor Alberto Nisman claimed before he died in January: that evidence shows Fernandez and other top officials tried to cover up Iran's alleged involvement in the bombing that killed 85 people at a Jewish center in Buenos Aires. An Argentine prosecutor said Friday there is enough evidence to continue an investigation into whether President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner hid Iran's alleged role in a deadly 1994 bombing, a probe that paused after a different prosecutor died mysteriously last month. Fernandez said a few days later that she didn't believe Nisman killed himself, alleging that some members of the country's intelligence agency fed Nisman false information about a cover-up and were responsible for his death. About 10 years ago, Nisman was appointed as special prosecutor to investigate the bombing by then-President Nestor Kirchner, Fernandez's late husband. Nisman, a special prosecutor investigating the 1994 bombing of the Argentine Israelite Mutual Association, alleged last month that Iran was behind the attack, and that Fernandez, to help sweeten a trade deal, covered up Tehran's involvement.
