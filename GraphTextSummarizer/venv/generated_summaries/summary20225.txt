-- U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's admiration for Myanmar democracy activist and former political prisoner Aung San Suu Kyi was hard to miss during her visit to Suu Kyi's home in Yangon. Suu Kyi, the country's leading activist for democratic reform, was instrumental in helping to gauge the U.S. diplomatic approach, Clinton said. But the military ties with North Korea have to go if Myanmar -- called Burma by opponents of the regime and by U.S. officials -- wants deeper political and economic cooperation with Washington and with nearby democracies, such as "South Korea, which has a great deal to offer in terms of development assistance," Clinton said. "She is someone who we talk to and rely on about policy advice, and certainly we were very gratified that she encouraged us to engage, encouraged my trip." Suu Kyi, who plans to run for parliament, expressed her hopes for more solid democratic reforms thanks to U.S. efforts. "I felt like I had known her for years," Clinton told CNN's Jill Dougherty on her second day of meeting with Suu Kyi, "because of all of the information I had about her and the interactions that friends of mine had about her that carried messages back and forth.
