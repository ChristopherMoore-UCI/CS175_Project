"U.S. News strives to provide students and their families with the most comprehensive data available," Bob Morse, director of data research, said in a statement. This year's methodology put more emphasis on student outcomes and less on where students ranked in their high school classes. In the category of least debt, Princeton once again earned roaring rights, with just 24% of students in debt, and an average among them of $5,096. In all, 93% of its graduating students were in debt -- with an average of $43,727, according to U.S. News. Also this year, the difference between predicted and actual graduation rates was applied for the first time to Regional Universities and Regional Colleges.
