CNN vote count: Budget deal nearing Senate approval, but not there yet Final congressional approval of the elusive budget agreement would mark a rare win for bipartisanship and a step up for a Congress infected with political dysfunction and held in low public esteem with midterm elections less than a year off. Some Senate Republicans said before Tuesday's vote that the most important thing for now was to lower the budget deficit, even if only by a small percentage, and prevent further government shutdowns like the 16-day stoppage in October that proved politically damaging to the GOP. GOP concerns The politics of the issue were clear in Tuesday's vote breakdown. But after reading details of the agreement, many Senate Republicans -- including several in leadership positions -- came out against the bill. -- A federal budget compromise that already passed the House cleared a key procedural hurdle on Tuesday in the Senate, increasing the likelihood it will win final Congressional approval this week.
