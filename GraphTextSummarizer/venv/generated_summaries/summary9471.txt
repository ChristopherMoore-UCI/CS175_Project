Domestic weekend box office estimates from Exhibitor Relations Co. (final numbers available Monday afternoon): 1. "Ouija" had no problem defeating the weekend's other new wide release, "John Wick." After a stretch in which critical acclaim and box office success went hand in hand -- think "Fury," "Gone Girl" and "The Equalizer" -- this weekend brought a reminder that audiences often ignore movie reviews. The fright flick not only debuted at No. 1 on the weekend before Halloween, it also became the first movie based on a board game to top the weekend box office. Success in limited release doesn't always continue when a movie opens wider, but that's what happened here: After two weekends in a handful of theaters, the indie comedy co-starring Melissa McCarthy and Naomi Watts expanded nationwide and pulled in $8.1 million, nearly cracking the top five.
