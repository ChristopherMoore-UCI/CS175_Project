-- An October three-vehicle collision that left eight people dead in eastern Tennessee was caused by a blown front tire on a church bus, investigators said Monday. There was no evidence of any pre-existing condition to the tire," Col. Tracy Trott of the Tennessee Highway Patrol said. The bus was traveling east on Interstate 40 in Jefferson County, Tennessee, when the tire blew, causing the driver to lose control. The group was called "Young at Heart," pastor Rick Cruz said at the time. The bus, which was owned by Front Street Baptist Church in Statesville, North Carolina, was carrying 18 passengers, five of whom were ejected and killed.
