Graham appeared in the U.S. District Court of Montana in Missoula, Montana, on Wednesday for her detention hearing on a charge that she pushed her husband, Cody L. Johnson, off a cliff in July on a hiking trail in Glacier National Park. "Because the government concedes that Graham does not pose a risk of flight, and has not met its burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the safety of the community, the court concludes that Graham must be released," reads the order from Judge Jeremiah Lynch. The affidavit also states that Graham texted a friend the same night her husband died, saying in the message that she was going to talk to Johnson about having "second thoughts. The affidavit supporting Graham's murder charge states that she told police she decided to travel with Johnson to the hiking trail the evening of July 7 and an argument ensued. The case is being heard in federal court because the park is under federal jurisdiction.
