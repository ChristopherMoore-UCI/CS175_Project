Authorities allege Gibbs kept finger bones, leg bones and a tooth from Afghan corpses. -- A hearing for a soldier accused of killing Afghan civilians for amusement enters a second day Tuesday at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington state. He is accused of killing Afghan civilian Gul Mudin in January with a grenade and rifle; killing civilian Mullah Adahdad in May in a similar manner; and shooting to death Marach Agha in February. In all, officials charged 12 U.S. soldiers in what they called a conspiracy to murder Afghan civilians and cover it up, along with charges they mutilated corpses and kept grisly souvenirs. Also on Monday, Benjamin Stevenson, special agent for the U.S. Army's Criminal Investigation Command, testified by phone from Afghanistan about visiting Bagram Air Base in May and finding human remains.
