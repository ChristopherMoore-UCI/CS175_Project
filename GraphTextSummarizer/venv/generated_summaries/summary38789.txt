A jury in Jacksonville on Saturday found Michael Dunn guilty of attempted second-degree murder for opening fire on three other teens in the same SUV as Jordan Davis -- but deadlocked on the murder charge against him in Davis' death. " Echoes of Trayvon Martin and George Zimmerman Some people were quick to compare Dunn to Zimmerman, who ultimately was acquitted of murder for the shooting of Martin. Dunn says Davis threatened him, and he decided to take matters into his own hands upon seeing what he thought was the barrel of a gun sticking out of the Durango. "It's sad for Mr. Dunn that he will live the rest of his life in that sense of torment, and I will pray for him," McBath said. A jury on Saturday night convicted Dunn of three charges of attempted murder for shooting at the other three teenagers in the SUV and one count of shooting into the vehicle on November 23, 2012.
