Now, four days after Yoav Hattab, 21, Yohan Cohen, 22,  Philippe Braham, 45, and Fran√ßois-Michel Saada, 63, were shot dead at the Hyper Cacher kosher supermarket -- the final, tragic chapter to the Charlie Hebdo terror attacks in the French capital that shocked the world -- their devastated families have laid them to rest at the Givat Shaul cemetery in Jerusalem. Sephardi Chief Rabbi Yitzhak Yosef led the state ceremony with a reading from the Book of Psalms, before the rending of garments, a symbolic act at Jewish funerals where mourners cut their own clothes. They were joined by hundreds of other people, many of whom traveled from France to mourn the deadliest attack on that country's Jewish community since 2012. They prayed for the best but feared for the worst when a gunman stormed into a Jewish store in east Paris and unleashed terror just hours before Shabbat on Friday. Hattab's father -- the chief rabbi of Tunis, Tunisia -- lit a candle with Joel Mergui, the Jewish Central Consistory president.
