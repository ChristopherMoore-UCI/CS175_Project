The "Deep Flight" winged submersibles are experimental prototypes designed to dive to depths of up to 37,000 ft -- almost four times as deep as a giant squid dives -- descending at 400 ft/minute. "The thing is a space ship, I don't like the term toy," said Hawkes of the subs which his company is also positioning as a cheaper alternative to research craft for science, industry and exploration. Venture capitalist Tom Perkins has ordered one of Hawkes' first commercially-available models, "Deep Flight Superfalcon" for his yacht "Maltese Falcon." They are the brainchild of submarine designer Graham Hawkes who is in the process of building commercial models that can reach those depths. The late billionaire balloonist and adventurer, Steve Fossett, commissioned one of Hawkes' experimental prototypes, "Deep Flight Challenger," which can dive to 37,000 ft.
