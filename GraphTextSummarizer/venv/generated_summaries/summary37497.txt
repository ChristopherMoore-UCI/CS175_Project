According to court documents posted online by the Guardian newspaper, freelance journalist Tom Rowlands -- who had worked for fellow News International titles the Times and Sunday Times -- was given Â£25,000 damages after News of the World hacked his voice mail to get information it then used in stories it published itself. Senior executives and editors for News International and other media organizations, both current and former, have testified before the Leveson Inquiry, a wide-ranging government-backed investigation of British press ethics and practices, as have many of the alleged victims of phone hacking and other abuses by the press. A number of people have brought civil cases against News International over alleged phone hacking by its employees. " James Murdoch, chief executive of News International and the son of media mogul Rupert Murdoch, has insisted that the practice of phone hacking was not widespread. News International, in its statement, said that News Group Newspapers, its subsidiary that was the publisher of News of the World, "agreed (to) settlements in respect of a number of claims against the company."
