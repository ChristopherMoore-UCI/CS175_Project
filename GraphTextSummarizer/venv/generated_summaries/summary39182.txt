As of late Thursday morning, police hadn't discovered any more remains or significant clues, Smith said. The coroner's cadaver dog, who Smith said became exhausted at times Wednesday, was back on the trail after sunrise Thursday, sniffing for more remains of the victim. Investigators "have every reason to believe" the hands, feet and head belonged to the same person, Smith said. In what police described as their biggest search in recent memory, 120 investigators scoured a seven-acre parcel of a park looking for clues in the dismemberment, which authorities believe occurred elsewhere, Smith said. Authorities plan to conclude their three-day hillside search Thursday afternoon and reopen the park to the public Friday, Smith said.
