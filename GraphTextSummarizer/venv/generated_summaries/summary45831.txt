Jamie Roberts with two tries, Scott Williams, George North, Sam Warburton, Lloyd Burns, Leigh Halfpenny, Lloyd Williams and Jonathan Davies crossed in the rout. Four minutes later left-wing Keith Earls marked his birthday by finishing a sweeping move with a try in the far corner after good work by center Gordon D'Arcy and blindside flanker Stephen Ferris. Before the match Italy coach Nick Mallett had claimed his team boasted a better front row and would prove it. Ronan O'Gara, who landed six out of seven placekicks for a match haul of 16 points before being replaced by rival fly-half Jonathan Sexton, a less reliable goalkicker, duly landed the conversion. Captain Brian O'Driscoll scored in the 47th minute after taking a well-timed pass from Tommy Bowe.
