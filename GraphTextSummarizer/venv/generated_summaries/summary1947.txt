The European Player of the Year fired a spectacular 35-yard strike into the top corner as United remained on course to become the first team to retain the Champions League -- and will now face Premier League rivals Arsenal for a place in the final in Rome.

"We were very solid at the back tonight and that stability helped us," United manager Sir Alex Ferguson told Sky Sports.
