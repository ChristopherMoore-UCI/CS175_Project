One of the big draws at this year's show and on display will be the Lockheed Martin F35 -- the only game in town, says Jennings, when it comes to the next generation of fighter jet. It is expected to announce who will supply its new fleet of multi-role fighter jets in the next few months and the battle between companies for the estimated $20 billion contract has raged for years. Between 2006 and 2010, six of the ten largest importers of weapons came from the Asia Pacific region, according to a report from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), and companies from the west will be hoping that trend continues. It faces the same problems as many other export industries, that of slow growth and the need to find new markets. The main players in the civil aviation industry will be in town, with announcements on new sales from the big plane makers expected, plus Indonesia's flagship carrier Garuda rumored to be set to announce new additions to its fleet.
