Actor George Clooney met with Vice President Joe Biden on Monday to discuss bringing peace to Darfur. His battle to bring peace to Darfur brought him to the White House on Monday, where he met with President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden. "Vice President Biden has been incredibly vocal on the issue." Clooney, a longtime Darfur activist and a Messenger of Peace for the United Nations, was in Darfur last week with journalists Nicholas Kristof of the New York Times and Ann Curry of NBC. Sudanese authorities armed and cooperated with Arab militias that went from village to village in Darfur, killing, torturing and raping residents there, according to the United Nations, Western governments and human rights organizations. "This isn't about needing American dollars," Clooney said of the push for peace in Darfur.
