"There are many Haitians living here in Elias Pina and many don't know anything about their families," the Rev. Mike Seis of the Green Bay Diocesan Mission in Elias Pina wrote in a letter recently. As a result, U.N. aid distribution is being shifted to a different road that goes through the Dominican border city of Jimani, instead of the main highway that leads through the Dominican city of Elias Pina. Vehicles crossing from the Dominican Republic into Haiti included large trucks carrying supplies and vans and public buses that seemed to be local, the crew reported. This weekend all of the Catholic parishes in the Dominican Republic from the 11 dioceses in the country will be sending their Sunday collections to Catholic Charities of Haiti. [in the Dominican Republic] are overwhelmed and have begun to refer patients to hospitals in other cities," OCHA reported, citing the Office of the Resident Coordinator in the Dominican Republic.
