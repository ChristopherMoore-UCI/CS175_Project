Lorenzana and his three sons were labeled "Specially Designated Narcotics Traffickers" by the U.S. Treasury Department last year, a distinction that froze any U.S. assets and prohibits anyone from doing financial transactions with them. "This arrest shows that no one is above the law," Guatemalan Interior Minister Carlos Menocal said, the state-run AGN news agency reported. Waldemar Lorenzana Lima, described as one of the most wanted in the United States, was captured Tuesday by Guatemalan National Police in the central town of Jicaro, Attorney General Claudia Paz said. The U.S. government was offering a reward of up to $500,000 for information regarding Lorenzana. Lorenzana used Guatemala as a trans-shipment point for the drugs from Colombia, and he would then transfer them to Mexico's Sinaloa cartel, which would take the contraband north.
