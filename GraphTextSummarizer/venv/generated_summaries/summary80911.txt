-- With an awesome four-goal display from striker Robert Lewandowski in the first leg of their semifinal last year, Borussia Dortmund all but knocked Real Madrid out of the Champions League. Following a spell where Dortmund managed to contain Real Madrid -- Weidenfeller did, though, keep out Ronaldo's free kick -- Klopp called Real Madrid the "overwhelming" favorite with his team missing among others the suspended Lewandowski, Neven Subotic, Ilkay Gundogan and Jakub Blaszczykowski -- and it didn't take long for the home team to prove him right. And two men jeered by their own supporters last weekend played a key role, Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale. Klopp got a response early in the second half but Dortmund fans must have been ruing the absence of Lewandowski even more.
