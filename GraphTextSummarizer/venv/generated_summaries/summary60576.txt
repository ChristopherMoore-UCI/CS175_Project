When Ken told me he was dating Mary, I was angry I'd let this happen to me again. I lost Brian to his ex-girlfriend (although, in that case, I think they belonged together anyway). While the first love arrived in Europe, I even warned him what may happen. What would happen if my house caught on fire? Since then, I've been the second choice for several more men.
