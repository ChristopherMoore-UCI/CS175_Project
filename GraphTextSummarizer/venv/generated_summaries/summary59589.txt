Sexual harassment in India: 'The story you never wanted to hear' "This is a side of India that is a reality to most young women who reside here -- or for that matter travel here," said Meera Vijayann, 27, from Bangalore in India. Keeping chivalry alive: Men respond to India rape crisis Cross' story, which is now the most-viewed iReport of all time, spawned thousands of impassioned comments and responses, many from women who live in India or who had traveled there and who wished to share their own experiences. I believe the poor treatment of women and their sexual objectification is endemic in Indian society today. I think sexual harassment is a global problem, and it's something women have to live with every day of their lives.
