According to Nancy Schoenberger, co-author of the book "Furious Love: Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton, The Marriage of the Century," Taylor developed her taste for jewels from a young age. For example, the 50-carat pearl known as La Peregrina, given to her in 1969 by actor Richard Burton and once part of the crown jewels of Spain, went for $11.8 million, which Christie's said was the highest recorded price ever of pearl jewelry sold at auction. Keith Penton, head of the jewelry department at Christie's, said then that Taylor's taste in jewels was "extraordinarily refined. A diamond tiara given to Taylor by her husband, Mike Todd, estimated at $80,000 pre-auction brought in a surprising $4.2 million. Schoenberger believes that when Burton bought Taylor the 33.19-carat Krupp Diamond ring in 1968 -- possibly the star piece in the exhibition at Christie's, estimated to fetch between $2.5 million and $3.5 million -- he was trying to out-do Mike Todd, who had died unexpectedly just over a year into his marriage with Taylor.
