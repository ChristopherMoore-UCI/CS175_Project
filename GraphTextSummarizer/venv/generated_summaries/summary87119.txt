Bigend (pronounced Bayh-jhan) is the morally ambiguous mastermind behind a global marketing operation, the Google of trend forecasting. Instead of an imagined future, in "Zero History" Gibson examines the present-day impact of new technologies, the current tension between the cutting edge and the mainstream and how all of it is branded, marketed and manipulated for profit. Gibson: I've already entered my pre-book stage, in which I quit reading fiction. "Zero History" is the final chapter in a trilogy that Gibson began with "Pattern Recognition" in 2003 and continued in 2007's "Spook Country." Out of this world heist leads to 'Sex on the Moon' William Gibson is the award-winning author of nine previous best-selling novels.
