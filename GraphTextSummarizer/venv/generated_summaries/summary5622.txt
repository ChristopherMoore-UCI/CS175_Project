The first of three surgeries needed to construct the right ear of 9-year-old Aidan Sullivan came one step closer over the weekend after a New York charity donated $7,000 to replace money stolen from child's fund-raiser. Aidan's parents, Tim and Colleen Sullivan, received a call from The Vincent Crotty Memorial Fund of Suffern, New York, on Saturday to tell them it would contribute $7,000 toward the cost of the boy's upcoming surgery. Danbury, Connecticut, police Lt. Tom Michael said $7,000 in cash and $1,000 in checks were missing after a November 20 event sponsored by the Ancient Order of Hibernians, an Irish Catholic fraternal organization. The money replaces cash reported stolen after a fund-raiser in Connecticut last weekend. Crotty founded his charity after the March death of his 18-year-old son and his son's best friend, Chris Konkowski, in a car accident while driving to baseball practice.
