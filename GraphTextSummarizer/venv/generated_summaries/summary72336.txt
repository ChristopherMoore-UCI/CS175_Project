" Sun, who said he is Tequila's former boyfriend, accused her of making "several threats to my girlfriend (21-year-old Shyla Jennings) that if police were in any ways notified of her crimes, that either she or I would be killed. -- A Los Angeles photographer claims singer and former Playboy model Tila Tequila kidnapped his girlfriend and threatened to kill him a week ago, according to a court filing made public Wednesday. Tequila's lawyer said Sun "is a former paparazzi who was terminated from his role on Tila's website and is now desperate to get back at her." Tequila "drove to my home address with four armed men with guns threatening to kill me and threatening my father," Sun said. Garry Sun filed an application for a temporary restraining order against Tequila, who stands less than 5 feet and weighs just 90 pounds.
