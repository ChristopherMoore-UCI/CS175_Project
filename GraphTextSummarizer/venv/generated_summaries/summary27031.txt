The most anticipated new TV series of 2011 really kicked off on Sunday as the four "X Factor" judges -- Simon Cowell, singer Cheryl Cole, record-label exec L.A. Reid, and, yes, Paula Abdul -- gathered to audition wannabe superstars in downtown Los Angeles. After she performed a Jessie J-esque rap original called "Cluck Cluck," the instant crowd favorite got a no vote from Cowell and yeses from Abdul and Cole, leaving her fate in Reid's hands. Before the judges stepped onto the stage of the Galen Center on the campus of the University of Southern California, the show's hosts, former Pussycat Doll Nicole Scherzinger and British TV personality Steve Jones, introduced themselves to the audience. In all, Abdul and Cole were certainly the kinder mentors, while it's looking like it could be a battle between Cowell and Reid for the title of "X Factor's" harshest judge.
