-- A Rhode Island-based video game company founded by former Major League Baseball pitcher Curt Schilling filed for bankruptcy on Thursday, according to court documents. The FBI, the U.S. Attorney's office of the District of Rhode Island, the state attorney's office and the Rhode Island State Police have opened an investigation into the circumstances of all financial transactions at 38 Studios, according to Col. Steven G. O'Donnell, superintendent of the Rhode Island State Police. Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee said in a press conference that he had no prior knowledge of the filing, but that he was not completely surprised. "After ongoing negotiations with the State of Rhode Island and potential investors and other interested parties, the company has been unable to find a solution to the current stalemate." Rhode Island has the second-highest unemployment rate in the country, at 11.2%.
