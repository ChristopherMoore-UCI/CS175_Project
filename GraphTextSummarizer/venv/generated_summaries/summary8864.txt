Authorities have said that on the night of August 15, 2010, Duley suffocated 2-year-old Devean Duley and 1-year-old Ja'Van Duley by putting her hand over their mouths in a room at the Trumps Inn just outside Orangeburg. Even with a less stringent sentence, Duley would get no credit for good behavior or a chance at early release on parole. " "I know what happened is ... unusual and it's not my character," a tearful Shaquan Duley said in an Orangeburg court after entering her plea. "I wanted to make sure Shaquan Duley was held accountable for the horrific death of these two boys and that she pled to murder as she was charged," Pascoe said. Duley is expected to be sentenced during the week of March 26, according to Pascoe.
