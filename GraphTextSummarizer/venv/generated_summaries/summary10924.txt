"Cod fishing in New England is like cowboys out West," said Frady, stressing New England's historical ties to the bottom-dwelling ground fish. But next year is the big one -- Gulf of Maine cod fishing could face more than an 80% reduction from prior years' catches. " Cod also swim alongside other fish, which means the proposed reductions would impact other industry staples such as flounder and haddock, even though those populations are considered to be far healthier. They move," said Giacalone, emphasizing the difficulty of counting unseen fish in a region the size of Indiana that nearly spans the length of New England. "The only real solution is more fish," said Frady of NOAA.
