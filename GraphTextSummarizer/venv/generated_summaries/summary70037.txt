More than 60 percent of our presidents were never heard on radio; Warren G. Harding, who entered office in 1921, was the first to speak on commercial radio. For all the media manipulation that goes on in the television age, consider the mischief that could be done in the era when presidents and candidates went largely unheard and, before that, unseen. Pamphlets, handbills, seventh-hand retellings of speeches the teller may or may not have actually heard ... the first (and second and third and beyond) generations of Americans elected as president men who, if they had passed them on the street, they might not have recognized. Before McKinley, presidents appeared to the public only in still photographs. In that era, voters could view their presidents and would-be presidents through reproductions of oil paintings of heroic-looking figures (put forth by the men themselves) or crude and insulting cartoons (put forth by their opponents).
