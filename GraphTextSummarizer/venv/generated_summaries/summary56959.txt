An unprecedented summit Helping parents have the "tech talk" with their children was a huge motivation behind a recent summit of parents, teachers, administrators and students in New Rochelle, a community about 30 minutes outside New York City. "We're giving children access to smartphones, tablets, and all sorts of digital devices so young," said Graber, who is co-founder of CyberWise.org, a digital literacy site for parents, educators, and tweens and teens. Christine Coleman, director of technology for the city school district of New Rochelle, said the event was designed to help parents teach children how to make good choices on social media and to really think about what they're doing before they do it. " Graber said what she hears from the sixth graders she teaches is that despite what parents might think, children want them to take an interest in their online lives. They're uncomfortable to have, and ... with social media, parents are uncomfortable because they're not knowledgeable about it but if we use our children to teach us ... and explain it to us, it begins a different type of conversation."
