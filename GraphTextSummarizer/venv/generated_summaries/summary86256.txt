" "They have definitively shown that blasts and shaking of the head gives you the same pathology seen in sports concussions," said Dr. Jack Tsao, a Navy commander, neurologist and director of traumatic brain injury programs for the U.S. Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery. The same group of researchers at the Boston University School of Medicine who examined Duerson's brain excised thin slivers of brain tissue from four U.S. veterans who died suddenly. "It's a little like trying to figure out the plot of a film by looking at the last frame," said Dr. Lee Goldstein, associate professor at Boston University School of Medicine and Boston University College of Engineering. The suggestion made by the research is that a common thread binds those exposed to traumatic brain injury, whether it occurs on the football field or in the war theater. The research also raises questions about a potential subgroup of veterans returning from the war with a diagnosis of traumatic brain injury.
