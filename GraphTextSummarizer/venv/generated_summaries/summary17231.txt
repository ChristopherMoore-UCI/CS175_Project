Among the changes, according to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation: the revised three-drug method, which includes new directives on how to prepare and administer the mixture; a new selection process and training program for members of the "lethal injection team," which consists of groups including the security sub-team, the intravenous sub-team and the infusion sub-team. -- A federal judge on Friday denied a stay of execution for a California man who raped and murdered a 15-year-old, but gave him a choice of whether to die by single injection or the state's recently revised three-drug method. He could also become the first inmate to be put to death in California's new lethal injection chamber, which was modified to meet requirements to come out of the review. Lawyers for the state argued that the defense failed to show the new regulations created "a demonstrated risk of severe pain," as required by the most recent U.S. Supreme Court decision to test lethal injection protocol, Baze v. Rees.
