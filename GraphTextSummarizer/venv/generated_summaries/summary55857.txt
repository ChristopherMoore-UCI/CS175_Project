Michigan Governor Rick Snyder said "figures clearly show how crucial it is to reinvent Michigan." "We cannot cling to the old ways of doing business," Snyder said in a statement Tuesday. "Michigan will not succeed if Detroit and other major cities don't succeed. "I don't believe it will stand up" to the city's planned challenge, said Mayor Dave Bing, saying the census has a history of undercounting residents in large cities. "Losing our best and brightest young adults to other states, or failing to rejuvenate our urban areas, are not acceptable options," Snyder continued. Detroit City Council President Charles Pugh told CNN affiliate WIDV the census figure is about 100,000 short.
