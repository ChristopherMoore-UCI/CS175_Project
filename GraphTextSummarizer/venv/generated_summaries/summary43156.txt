Facebook is poised to release new features at a news conference on Wednesday that will allow users to automatically publish information from other websites and apps to their Timeline profiles, according to a person familiar with the project. That's the position Pandora has taken toward a new Facebook feature that lets users automatically publish information to their profiles about songs they listen to, videos they watch and articles they read. A spokeswoman for Flipboard, an app that creates personalized magazines from social network feeds, has said the company doesn't plan to send information to Facebook about every article users read and will instead let users selectively post with a share button. At a news conference in September, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said people would benefit from publishing more data and letting computer algorithms sort out what's important. Facebook lets users manage which apps can publish to their profiles using a page called the Activity Log.
