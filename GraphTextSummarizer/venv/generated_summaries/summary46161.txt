The incident comes amid a contentious national debate about illegal immigration, just days after a strict new immigration law was scheduled to go into effect in Arizona. The most controversial provisions of the law have been stayed by a judge, but supporters of the law said a failure by Washington to crack down on illegal immigration forced Arizona to act. "This administration has fundamentally reformed immigration enforcement," said spokesman Matt Chandler, "identifying and removing criminal aliens who pose a threat to public safety." Sister Denise Mosier was killed instantly, and the other two remained hospitalized Tuesday. " Corey Stewart, chairman of the Prince William County Board of Supervisors, said he was furious with how immigration officials have handled the case.
