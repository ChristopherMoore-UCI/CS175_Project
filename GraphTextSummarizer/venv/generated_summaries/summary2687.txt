Manchester City came from two goals down to beat Bayern Munich 3-2 in the Champions League Group D match at the Allianz Arena on Tuesday night. Snow joke Turkey and snow are a perfect combination for many people around the world at this time of year, but it certainly wasn't the case for Galatasaray and Juventus on Tuesday night. The resulting spot kick was tucked away without fuss by Aleksander Kolarov who sent keeper Manuel Neuer the wrong way. Group C winners, Paris Saint Germain suffered their first loss in this year's Champions League campaign going down down 2-1 to Benfica at the Stadium of Light. Three minutes later, Milner capped a memorable night for City and himself with a low, side-foot drive past the despairing hands of Neuer.
