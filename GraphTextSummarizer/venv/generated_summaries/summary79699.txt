The company's lawyers filed a lawsuit last week asserting their "fair use" of the tune, but Wednesday its founders posted a letter addressed to Beastie Boys Mike Diamond and Adam Horovitz. " "Over the past week, parents have sent us pictures and videos of their kids singing with pride, building their own Rube Goldberg machines in their living rooms and declaring an interest in engineering," Sterling wrote Wednesday. "It's been incredible to watch." Sterling, a Stanford-educated engineer, has said her ultimate goal is to bridge the gap of gender disparity in engineering; according to the Association for Women in Science, women account for 24% of the science, technology, engineering and math work force. GoldieBlox had used a parody version of the decidedly misogynistic Beastie Boys song "Girls" in a video featuring a trio of inventive girls who trade their tiaras for a toolbox. "We don't want to fight with you," founder Debbie Sterling wrote.
