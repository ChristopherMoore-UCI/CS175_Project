Leroy T. McKelvey, 59, allegedly used the gun on three men in an upperdeck scuffle at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, during a Sunday match-up between the New York Jets and Dallas Cowboys, according to New Jersey Police Sgt. In spite of heightened security due to a terror threat on the 10th anniversary of the September 11th, 2001, terrorist attacks, a South Carolina man was apparently able to sneak a stun gun into a professional football game and fired it into the crowd, police said Tuesday. When asked about the security breach, National Football League spokesman Brian McCarthy said the league is "always refining and improving our security procedures. A video posted on YouTube apparently captures the immediate aftermath of the alleged attack, showing several Cowboys fans surrounding at least one person who is laying near the base of one of the stadium's seats. McKelvey was charged with three counts of aggravated assault, possession of a stun gun and possession of a weapon for unlawful purposes.
