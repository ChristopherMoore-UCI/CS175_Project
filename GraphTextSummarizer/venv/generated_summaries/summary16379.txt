The hurricane center warned that Irene could dump heavy rain on the Dominican Republic and neighboring Haiti, where previous storms have caused deadly mudslides down deforested hillsides. The Christian aid group World Vision is prepositioning supplies and mobilizing its staff to fan out across camps in Haiti Monday, to help residents prepare for Irene. -- Authorities posted tropical storm warnings for parts of the Bahamas and hurricane warnings for Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic on Sunday, as Tropical Storm Irene picked up steam near the Caribbean islands. Tropical storm warnings covered the U.S. and British Virgin Islands, the northern coast of the Dominican Republic and Haiti. Heavy rain has the potential to worsen sanitation conditions in camps, which, with cholera still so prevalent in Haiti, is a major concern."
