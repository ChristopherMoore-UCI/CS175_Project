-- World number one Rafael Nadal battled back from a set down to finally topple American Andy Roddick in an epic clash at the ATP World Tour finals. After a near five week break from the game due to injury, Nadal was rusty during the opening set and lost his opening service game as Roddick opened up a 3-0 lead. Nadal struggled to recover from his slovenly start and Roddick held his serve to close out the first set 6-3 in just 49 minutes. After that both players held firm on serve before Nadal took the tie break and his first set at the O2 Arena in London. The second set saw Nadal broken again early on but the Spaniard finally made inroads into Roddick's booming serve to square the set at 2-2.
