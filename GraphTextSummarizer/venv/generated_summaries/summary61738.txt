In a statement read on air, the government announced that "the purchase of coffee and cocoa from producers and producer groups is done exclusively by the State on the entire national territory." -- Ivory Coast President Laurent Gbagbo, who is fighting to keep a political title the United Nations says isn't his, on Monday nationalized the nation's two main cash crops, coffee and cocoa, according to state-run television. "Approved exporters get their cocoa beans and green coffee from the State or any legal person mandated by the State." Coffee and cocoa experts have provided the embattled leader with a lucrative revenue source to pay loyal civil servants and military officers. Gbagbo, the incumbent, has refused to give up power since an electoral commission declared challenger Alassane Ouattara the winner of the November presidential election.
