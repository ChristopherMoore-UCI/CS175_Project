-- Hotels have reached new heights of "hos-pet-ality," offering perks like gourmet treats, designer dog beds, scratching posts, chew toys and pet massage. Dine at Pasta Moon, where pooches chomp on homemade dog treats while two-footers sup on farm-fresh California-Italian cuisine. And for accommodations, consider the Boston Harbor Hotel, which provides dog beds, food dishes and pet-walking services, as well as offering a $75 Luxe Pups Package including a wash, cut, blow dry and "pet-i-cure" as well as a doggie gift bag. Take this self-guided tour at your own pace, and plan to take a pit stop in one of the Boston Common's leash-free areas for dogs. Then grab a nightcap in a comfy chair beside a fire pit and take in the ocean sunset at the Moss Beach Distillery's Seal Cove Patio, which features a doggie menu of grilled hot dogs, mini burger patties and skirt steak.
