-- Millions of people suddenly lost power Sunday night around the island of Cuba -- including all of Havana. The streets of Havana lost electricity around 8 p.m. Residents elsewhere around the Caribbean nation -- including in Ciego de Avila to the east of Havana, and west to Pinar del Rio -- also told CNN they didn't have any power, except for a few pockets of light. "Western Cuba is without power," a pro-government blogger known as Yohandry Fontana tweeted. More than 2 million residents of the capital were in the dark late Sunday, except for those at hospitals and elsewhere with generators, according to a government spokesman, who was not identified per government policy. There was no official explanation for Sunday's outage, according to the government spokesman and state media reports.
