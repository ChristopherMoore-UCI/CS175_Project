An altercation at a Texas community college Wednesday afternoon escalated to gunshots and a campus lockdown but no injuries were reported and a suspect was captured, according to officials at Victoria College in Victoria, Texas. The sparsely populated campus was put on lockdown with students and personnel altered by e-mail and texts, but Butler said a suspect was "pretty quickly apprehended ... about 10 minutes after he fired the shots, actually." College President Tom Butler told CNN that students were playing basketball in the college sports center when the incident occurred. The suspect's name was not released pending booking at the Victoria County jail. "It was not an official game," Butler said.
