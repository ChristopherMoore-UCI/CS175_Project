Reed, who starred for America during its recent Ryder Cup defeat to Europe, was caught on camera swearing and using a term which could be deemed homophobic. After making a bogey on the 10th hole at the Sheshan International, Reed was heard to say: "Nice f****** three-putt you f****** f****t." Reed, who finished the opening round five shots behind leader Graeme McDowell -- his playing partner -- was quick to apologize on Twitter, but could now face sanctions. The 2010 U.S. Open champion leads by two shots from a clutch of players on three-under, including Rickie Fowler and reigning U.S. Open champion Martin Kaymer, from Germany. He also caused controversy during his first appearance for the United States in its biennial team battle against Europe at the Ryder Cup, held in Scotland back in September. -- Golf can be a frustrating game -- just ask Patrick Reed.
