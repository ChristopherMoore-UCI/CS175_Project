Since then, Kayalar has made another attempt to obtain money from the couple, according to court documents, and Gerber stalled, saying he needed more time to get the money. When the former nanny -- who was not identified in court documents -- saw Gerber with Kayalar, she "became extremely upset and began to cry," the court documents said. -- A German man is facing federal charges in the United States on suspicion of trying to extort money from supermodel Cindy Crawford and her husband, using a photograph of the couple's then-7-year-old daughter, court documents said. In November, Kayalar began calling the couple from Germany, however, saying he had no choice but to demand more money since they had "gotten him deported," court documents said. But two days later, Gerber called police again, saying Kayalar called and demanded more money, saying he still had a copy of the photograph.
