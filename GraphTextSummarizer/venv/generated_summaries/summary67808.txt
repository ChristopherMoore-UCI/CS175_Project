Crafting the inside of a building is hard enough, without also having to meet religious requirements, and Fadillioglu consulted Islamic authorities throughout the construction of the spectacular Sakirin Mosque -- co-created by architect HÃ¼srev Tayla -- and opened in 2009. When the time came for Fadillioglu to craft the inside of Sakirin Mosque, she purposely placed the women's section in one of the most beautiful parts of the light-flooded dome. And while she always admired the craftsmanship of the metropolis's Ottoman era mosques, Fadillioglu had also become fed up with cramped and dark "bad copies. "Up until recently, modern architects didn't design mosques -- it was always religious architects. "Beneath the big dome you feel humility," said Fadillioglu of the Sakirin Mosque, commissioned by a wealthy Turkish family and built in one of Istanbul's oldest cemeteries.
