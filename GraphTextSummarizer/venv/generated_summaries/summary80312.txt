Christie urged Obama to demand Cuba hand over Joanne Chesimard, an American fugitive who escaped from prison after she was convicted of killing a New Jersey state trooper. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie -- a potential 2016 Republican presidential candidate -- finally broke his silence on President Barack Obama's decision to normalize relations with Cuba in a letter to the President issued on Sunday. " Christie added that he was "very disappointed" that Chesimard's return was not already one of the conditions of normalizing relations in Obama's deal with Cuban President Raul Castro. Christie also joined the chorus of Republicans who oppose Obama's decision to re-establish ties with Cuba without substantial political reforms. "Despite my profound disagreement with this decision, I believe there is an opportunity for Cuba and its government to show the American people it is serious about change," Christie wrote to Obama, according to a copy of the letter Christie's office provided.
