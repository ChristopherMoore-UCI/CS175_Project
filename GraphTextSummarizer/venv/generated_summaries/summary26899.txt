"The headline is the Middle East is reinfected," said Dr. Bruce Aylward, the World Health Organization's assistant director-general for polio, emergencies and country collaboration. "We will expect to see more cases, certainly in Syria if not in surrounding countries," Sonia Bari, a spokeswoman for polio eradication for WHO, said in a telephone interview. Aylward said he met last week with Syria's minister of health and was impressed by the response. But Aylward said health officials have a good chance of halting its spread in Syria, where 1.6 million children are to be vaccinated against not only polio, but against measles, mumps and rubella. The announcement, by WHO and UNICEF, comes a week after an outbreak of polio was confirmed in Syria for the first time since 1999.
