Consulting with Nixon Library archivist Ryan Pettigrew, we discovered that this collection contained originals rather than copies. The inner demons that drove Nixon Congress was concerned that Nixon would destroy papers relevant to the Watergate investigation, so it passed the Presidential Records and Materials Preservation Act of 1974 ("PRMPA"), 44 U.S.C. Â§ 2111 (1988). -- "Our Nixon" is mostly comprised of Super 8 home movies made by three of President Nixon's closest aides: H.R. "Bob" Haldeman, John Ehrlichman, and Dwight Chapin. The PRMPA authorized the administrator of General Services to take possession of and provide access to Nixon's presidential papers, including the secret White House tapes. In response to the litigation over Nixon's presidential papers, Congress passed the Presidential Records Act of 1978 ("PRA"), 44 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 2201-07, which took effect on January 20, 1980.
