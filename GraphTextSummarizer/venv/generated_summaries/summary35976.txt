Real Madrid coped slightly better in the second half, although Dortmund midfielder Henrik Mkhitaryan hit the post after rounding Casillas. Beaten in injury time last week to give PSG the two-goal advantage, Chelsea keeper Petr Cech preserved his team's passage Tuesday by pushing away Marquinhos' effort in added time. Dortmund -- which ousted Real Madrid in last season's competition -- also got help from the Madrid back four. Chelsea will be joined in the semis by Mourinho's previous club Real Madrid, which survived -- barely -- without Cristiano Ronaldo against 2013 finalist Borussia Dortmund. Dortmund, meanwhile, has history in engineering miracles in the Champions League quarterfinals against Spanish opposition, scoring twice in injury time last year to overcome Malaga 3-2 on aggregate.
