Attorneys for Knox and Sollecito this week have worked to cast doubt on DNA evidence found on the knife and Kercher's bra clasp. Sara Gino, another defense witness, testified Wednesday that Sollecito's genetic material could have gotten onto the bloodied bra if it was on Knox's clothes when they were washed with Kercher's before the killing. Knox and Sollecito were found guilty of the killing two years after Kercher's semi-naked body was found in the house they shared in Perugia. DNA on the knife used to kill Kercher could not have been from blood, a forensic expert testifying for Knox's defense told the court Wednesday. -- The father of American student Amanda Knox says prosecutors have "no case left," after an Italian judge rejected a request for new DNA testing of evidence.
