Your immigration stories Last year, roughly 10% of people caught by Border Patrol agents were minors, according to a Border Patrol official.

Cabrera says these crossings began to spike two years ago after the Obama administration announced it would stop deporting young illegal immigrants who entered the United States as children if they met certain requirements. But they "wouldn't come if their undocumented parents didn't find it so easy to work in a country that loves cheap labor -- but treats cheap laborers like a disposable commodity. " Senior administration officials said they had prepared for a greater influx of children across the Southwest border, but the numbers were much larger than anticipated in past weeks.
