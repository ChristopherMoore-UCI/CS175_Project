He faces six counts of first-degree murder in the deaths of Cecil Dotson, his 30-year-old brother; Hollis Seals, 33; Shindri Roberson, 20; Marissa Rene Williams, 26; and two children, said Memphis Director of Police Larry A. Godwin at a news conference Saturday. Dotson will also be charged with the attempted murder of three other children -- ages 7, 4 and 10 months -- who received stab wounds and blunt force trauma, Godwin said. The March 2 killings followed an argument between Jessie and Cecil Dotson, Godwin said. Dotson's brother Cecil was the father of all the children, The Associated Press reported. Jessie L. Dotson, who was recently released after serving 14 years in prison for murder, was captured Friday night.
