-- Pole vault legend Yelena Isinbayeva has announced that she is taking a break from athletics following her poor performance at last month's world indoor championships in Qatar. "After more than eight years of hard training and competing at the highest levels, indoors and outdoors each year, I need to step back in order for my body to properly recover." The 27-year-old Russian failed to register a height in last year's worlds in Berlin and she followed that up with a fourth-placed finish in Doha, prompting her to make her decision. "Nothing has changed with my long-term goals which include the 2011 and 2013 world championships and the Olympic gold in London 2012." In a statement on her official Web site, the reigning Olympic champion revealed that she believes her body is telling her to rest.
