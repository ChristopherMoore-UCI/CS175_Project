The document was in effect when the decision to remove Coleman from life support was made last Friday, the hospital said. "Mr. Coleman had completed an Advanced Health Care Directive that granted Shannon Price permission to make medical decisions on his behalf if he was unable to do so," said the statement, which Price authorized. "There was a touch of magic and a different stroke in Gary Coleman," said TV legend Norman Lear, who produced the show. -- The hospital where actor Gary Coleman died said Thursday it confirmed his former wife had legal authority to authorize his doctor to disconnect his life support last week. Coleman, 42, and Price, 24, were living together in Santaquin, Utah, when he suffered a fatal fall last week.
