There were more guest workers during World War I. But the concept really became popular during World War II and the Cold War. It's time for Congress to create a new guest worker program for the agriculture industry where employees can have decent wages, access to health clinics, livable housing, workers comp in case of injury, and legal protection so that they aren't exploited. The first U.S. president to push for guest workers was Abraham Lincoln. Many in organized labor hate the concept of guest workers because their leaders are busy peddling the fantasy that the hard and dirty jobs in question are sought after by union members. But, regardless of how it looks, it's a long shot that Congress will pass immigration reform this year.
