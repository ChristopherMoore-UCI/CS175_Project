The act bans insider trading by members of Congress and many executive branch employees. It makes it clear that members of Congress, their aides and many members of the executive branch cannot use inside information they learn on the job to trade stocks or other securities. Originally, the bill's restrictions applied just to members of Congress and their staffs, but Republicans expanded it to cover many executive agency employees. The new law also limits members of Congress and executive employees to participating only in those initial public stock offerings that are available to the general public. The spotlight on Congress' recent string of bipartisan action continues Thursday, when Obama is scheduled to sign a bill making it easier for small businesses to gain access to capital and make public offerings.
