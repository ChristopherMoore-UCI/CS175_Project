Sanha became president in September 2009, months after the assassination of President Joao Bernardo Vieira. No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, and authorities did not have a motive, said Interior Minister Fernando Gomes. The elections were triggered by the January death of President Malam Bacai Sanha at age 64 after a long illness. Djalo served as the country's intelligence chief during a time when many key political figures were assassinated, including a high-ranking parliamentarian and an independent presidential candidate. Guinea-Bissau's history has been marked by military coups and attempted coups since the nation of 1.6 million gained independence from Portugal in 1974.
