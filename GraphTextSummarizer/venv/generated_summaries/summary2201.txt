The border between India and Pakistan is disputed in the Kashmir region, where India accuses Pakistan of fueling an insurgency. "The two militants who were killed were in communication with their handlers outside India," said a statement issued by Home Minister P. Chidambaram. Saturday's skirmish came a day after a long gunfight ended between Indian security forces and militants in Srinagar, the summer capital of India's Jammu and Kashmir state. Chidambaram's comment echoed India's allegations that the terrorists who laid siege to Mumbai were in touch with their leaders in Pakistan by phone. Two unexploded rockets were traced after midnight near an Indian outpost along the border dividing the Punjab region between the two countries, said K. Srinivasan, a deputy inspector-general of India's Border Security Force.
