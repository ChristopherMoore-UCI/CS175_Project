Ecock said that when biologists from Riverhead Foundation for Marine Research on Long Island arrived at mid-afternoon, they determined the mammal was a male Fin whale, the second largest species of whale. -- A 60-foot-long whale that was discovered still breathing on a New York beach Wednesday morning is likely to die overnight, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The whale was found half in the water and half in the sand, according to New York Police Department Officer James Duffy. "We thought it was dead when we arrived, but then it started moving," Nick Ecock of Point Breeze Volunteer Fire Department told CNN Wednesday. Late Wednesday, the whale was still alive but it was "emaciated and in poor physical condition so there is nothing that can be done to save the whale," NOAA spokesperson Allison McHale told CNN.
