As fetuses at six months, "we actually have more brain cells than we will ever have in our lives," Dr. Gregory Jicha says. "[After] six months in the womb, nerve cells start dying." As an associate professor of neurology, Jicha works at the Sanders-Brown Center on Aging in Lexington, Kentucky. The mind uses nutrients as building blocks to form new connections, Jicha explains. Whether it's for work or pleasure, Jicha says new experiences are an important part of keeping the mind healthy. The good news is that it's not all bad news, says Dr. Suzanna Penningroth, a gerontologist from the University of Wyoming.
