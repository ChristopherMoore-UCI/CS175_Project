-- The use of U.S. strike aircraft in Libya is set to expire Monday as uncertainty lingers about whether Western allies will arm opposition members trying to oust Libyan ruler Moammar Gadhafi. Over the weekend, opposition spokesmen said 13 rebels were killed when NATO airstrikes hit several vehicles. Meanwhile, a trip to Europe by Libyan Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelati Obeidi indicated Gadhafi's regime might be willing to take diplomatic steps. The ship is destined for the Turkish port of Cesme, where the patients will receive medical attention, opposition officials said. " U.S. and British officials have said they have not decided whether to arm rebel fighters.
