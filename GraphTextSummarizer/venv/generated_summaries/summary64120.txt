A fact-finding investigation is under way, and further action against Navy crew members is possible, a Navy official said. The crew neither maintained inspection records nor conducted the required inspection of chemical levels associated with the cooling system of the ship's nuclear reactor, Navy officials said. The Navy said Friday that one officer and two enlisted crew members have been temporarily reassigned to Submarine Squadron 11. Those six -- one officer and five enlisted personnel -- received a "nonjudicial punishment" after other Navy personnel discovered their actions, the officials said. Six personnel have been punished for forging inspection records for the cooling system, the Navy officials said Monday.
