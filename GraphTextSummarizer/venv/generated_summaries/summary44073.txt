Alan Mutter, an expert on the economics of the newspaper industry, recently reported that newspaper advertising was down about 10 percent year-over-year for the first quarter of the year. PricewaterhouseCoopers' annual report on media trends reported that web advertising totaled $24.2 billion last year. Newspaper companies are a dying breed, and one consistent scapegoat for their demise is the rise of blogs and online news sites. We don't have a news problem, because there's enough news under the sun for newspapers and blogs to cover it all. The expansion of advertising on the web is both good news and bad news for newspapers.
