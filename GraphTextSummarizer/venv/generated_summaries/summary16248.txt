The new, three-hour course, offered by the Royal Institute of British Architects in conjunction with the Bat Conservation Trust, is intended to educate architects about bats, teaching participants the ideal size, access points, temperature, materials and location for bat roosts. Those who interfere with a roost risk a fine of $7,800 per bat, and up to six months in prison -- although Gunnell says no one has been sent to prison yet. "If you have bats roosting in your building, you can't disturb them in any way without getting a special license," says Kelly Gunnell, Built Environment Officer with the Bat Conservation Trust, a charitable organization in London, England. "It's very preliminary, but there seems to be evidence that when you put solar panels on your roof, it can increase the internal roof void temperature, which can be disturbing to bats," says Gunnell. -- A group of architects gathered in Oxford, England last month with an unusual brief -- to design the ultimate dream home for bats.
