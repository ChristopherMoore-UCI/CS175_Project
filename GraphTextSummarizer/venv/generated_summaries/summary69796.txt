Social media entwined in radio prank, suicide story "We as a family are deeply saddened by the loss of our beloved Jacintha," said the statement, released by police. "Their Royal Highnesses were looked after so wonderfully well at all times by everybody at King Edward VII Hospital, and their thoughts and prayers are with Jacintha Saldanha's family, friends and colleagues at this very sad time. Holleran said he'd spoken with Greig and Christian on Saturday morning, and they were "deeply shattered" and "our concern is for their welfare." On the contrary, we offered our full and heartfelt support to the nurses involved and hospital staff at all times." The hospital named her as Jacintha Saldanha and said she had worked there for more than four years as an "excellent nurse," well-respected by co-workers.
