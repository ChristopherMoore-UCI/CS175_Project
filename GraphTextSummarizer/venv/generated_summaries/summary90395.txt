In the 90-minute confession tape, the defendant was interviewed by Texas Ranger Danny Briley. The man accused of killing Chris Kyle, subject of the hit film "American Sniper," and Kyle's friend said he didn't have a choice. Routh's trial comes just weeks after the release of the film about Kyle, a former Navy SEAL who claimed to be the deadliest sniper in U.S. history with 160 confirmed kills in Iraq. Correction: Earlier versions of this report incorrectly described the military background of Chad Littlefield, who was killed with Chris Kyle. Kyle and Littlefield took Routh, a veteran with mental problems, to the firing range as a kind of therapy.
