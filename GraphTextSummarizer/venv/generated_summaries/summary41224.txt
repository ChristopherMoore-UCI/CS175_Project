A family outing turned nightmare The boy and his family had gone Friday to Mount Baldy Beach at Indiana Dunes National Park, in the northwestern corner of the state. "There was lots and lots of guys hand digging, trying to expose him making sure nobody was going to hurt him or anything with any equipment," one of the rescuers, Rich Elm, told CNN affiliate WNDU. "We were really losing hope fast, and we tried to just stay focused," Michigan City firefighter Brad Kreighbaum told CNN affiliate WSBT. At present, doctors are trying to clear sand from his lungs.
