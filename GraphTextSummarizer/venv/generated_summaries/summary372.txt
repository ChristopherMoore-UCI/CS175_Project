In the case of "Havana Nights," about halfway through the movie, scenes of the couple rehearsing their moves on a rooftop and at the beach are backed by Wyclef Jean and Claudette Ortiz's "Dance Like This." In 2004, "Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights" was released. Before you skip down to the comments section and unleash fury, I am aware that "Havana Nights" isn't nearly as good as "Dirty Dancing." "Friends With Benefits," starring Mila Kunis and Justin Timberlake, hit theaters just six months after Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher's "No Strings Attached." Maybe people felt protective of "Dirty Dancing," and chose to rebel against a film that dared to mooch off its name.
