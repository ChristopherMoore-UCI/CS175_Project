Opinion: Don't fall at the finish line in the race to eradicate polio Thanks to a worldwide effort of governments and the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, including the United Nations, the number of polio cases has dropped from 350,000 a year in 1988 to just 223 last year, and the number of countries where polio is transmitted has dropped from 125 to 3, according to the eradication initiative. This contagious disease can be imported, paralyzing children in countries that thought they were done with polio. At the U.N., money backs up vow to eradicate polio by 2015 Nigeria is the only polio endemic country in Africa and one of only three remaining countries (the others are Afghanistan and Pakistan) that have not been able to stop the transmission of the disease, according to the World Health Organization. I look forward to the day Nigeria overcomes the devastation of polio and joins the list of polio-free countries. In Nigeria, the government, partners, and survivors are working hard, and polio cases are down right now compared to this time last year.
