-- A brazen daylight shooting in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, on Monday afternoon left four people dead and injured two others, including a 5-year-old boy, a Juarez municipal police spokesman told CNN. Witnesses said an armed man approached their vehicle while it was stopped and opened fire, according to journalist Arturo Chacon. Journalist Arturo Chacon contributed to this report Among the dead was a 10-year-old who was nearly decapitated by projectiles from the high-caliber weapon used in the attack, spokesman Adrian Sanchez said. The car's side windows were broken and large bullet holes peppered the body of the car.
