"We think there will be a range of products and services available based on quality," said Cullen Childress, senior director of product management for Polycom. If Cisco teams up with service providers, such as Comcast or Verizon Communications, it may offer the device for a subsidized price and make up the difference on monthly service fees. Instead, it will likely be delivered over a dedicated sliver of bandwidth from a broadband provider that will guarantee a certain quality of service. What this means is that Cisco will likely offer consumers a high-end service, which would appeal to people who are willing to pay top dollar for better quality. Even though Cisco isn't officially commenting on its upcoming news, the company would likely argue that the price difference between what it plans to offer and what Skype offers comes down to quality.
