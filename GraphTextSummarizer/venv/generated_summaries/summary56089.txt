U.S. Sen. John McCain says this summer's ouster of former Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy was "a coup," a description that goes against the statements so far from the Obama administration. The conflict erupted when Egypt's top general overthrew Morsy, who became Egypt's first democratically elected president in June 2012, after popular protests forced the resignation of Hosni Mubarak, who had ruled the country for 30 years. McCain also referred to the ouster as a "coup" in July, but he chose to reiterate that description on Egyptian soil at a time when the country is roiling with unrest and violence in the ouster's aftermath. In the past 30 years, only Israel has received more U.S. aid than Egypt. The White House has avoided using that term for the Egyptian military's ouster of Morsy.
