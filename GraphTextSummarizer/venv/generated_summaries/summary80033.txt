Two people, including the man who lost his hands, were taken to a hospital, and three others were treated at the site in the Hyde Park neighborhood for unspecified injuries, Boston police said. A man lost both of his hands and four other people were injured in an explosion Friday morning at a southern Boston apartment building, Boston police said. However, Boston Police Commissioner Edward Davis told The Boston Globe that the man who lost his hands had been mixing chemicals in his basement apartment, and that the chemicals exploded. But the site, which had been cordoned off during the initial probe, was deemed safe by Friday afternoon, Coakley said. Davis said the man mixing the chemicals might have been experimenting with fireworks, and investigators didn't immediately know why the chemicals exploded, according to the Globe.
