"Braley has an advantage among urban and suburban voters, but Ernst appears to be winning rural voters handily -- a key strength in a state like Iowa," said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. -- Republican Joni Ernst has a small lead over Democrat Bruce Braley in Iowa's Senate race, a new CNN/ORC International poll shows. Iowa is one of several states that President Barack Obama won at least once -- Colorado, North Carolina and New Hampshire are the others -- where Republicans are hoping to grab Senate seats previously held by Democrats. Ernst had 49% support, topping Braley's 47%, in the survey of 647 likely voters, which was conducted Oct. 27-30 and has a margin of error of plus or minus four percentage points. It's just the latest poll to show a deadlocked race in Iowa, where the two candidates are battling for the seat of retiring Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin.
