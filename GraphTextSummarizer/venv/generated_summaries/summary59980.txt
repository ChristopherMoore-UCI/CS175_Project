But science fiction has a proven ability to inspire scientists and start technological innovation," Cramer explains. According to Kathryn Cramer, a sci-fi author and editor of Hieroglyph -- an anthology project that will compile conversations of scientists and authors at ASU for publication by HarperCollins -- the center will help inform a more realistic and artistically rich genre of sci-fi. Some writers may already undertake such processes by themselves but by formalizing this relationship, Cramer believes a more fluent and rewarding conversation between science and sci-fi will arise. "For authors, having the contact with [scientists] allows for further refinement of their ideas into something that is potentially more workable," says Cramer. Like Hjelmstad, Brown and Finn before her however, Cramer tempers expectations by stating that the practical implementation of these ideas will likely have to wait.
