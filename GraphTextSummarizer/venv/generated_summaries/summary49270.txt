-- A gunman carrying a variant of an AK-47 rifle opened fire on uniformed Nevada National Guard members having breakfast at a Carson City, Nevada, restaurant, killing two of them and injuring three, officials said Tuesday. "To say that he was targeting before he came into the restaurant those military persons, we have not been able to establish," said Carson City Sheriff Ken Furlong. He was at the family business Monday night and spent the night in Carson City, officials said. "There was no indication he knew anyone in the restaurant," said Michael West, supervisory special agent with the FBI. Chuck Allen with the Nevada Highway Patrol said officials were taking precautions in case military personnel were being targeted.
