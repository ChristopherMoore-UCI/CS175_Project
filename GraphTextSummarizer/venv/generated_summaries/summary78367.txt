-- Buses that carry women only are experiencing a smooth ride with passengers in Mexico's capital. Juan Flores, who has driven buses in Mexico City for 15 years and now steers one for women only, said he even notices a difference. Fans of the new service call their daily commutes more pleasant now that bus rides steer clear of too-close-for-comfort contact with men. A woman rides on a bus exclusively for female passengers last month in Mexico City. Last year, the government received seven complaints of sexual abuse aboard the city's buses, which provide 200 million rides each year, officials said.
