-- Groups representing federal air marshals and flight attendants -- outraged over the Transportation Security Administration's decision to allow small pocketknives back into aircraft cabins -- say they will ask the TSA to reconsider the policy. On Tuesday, TSA Administrator John Pistole announced that small pocketknives and an array of sporting equipment -- which were banned from aircraft cabins in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks -- will be allowed in U.S. planes beginning April 25. Pistole said the TSA sought to distinguish small pocketknives, such as those equipped with corkscrews, from sturdier knives used primarily as weapons. "Our best working hypothesis is that a number of the hijackers were carrying -- permissible under the regulations in place at the time -- permissible utility knives or pocket knives," a commission staff member said at a January 2004 hearing of the 9/11 Commission. Opinion: Is TSA serious about letting people carry knives?
