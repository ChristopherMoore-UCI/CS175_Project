The Mountain Winery relies on Santa Clara County sheriff's deputies to patrol its parking lot and concessions area during concerts, Sung said, but provides its own security for the stage and audience area. "Upon arriving, deputies found a doctor and an EMT on the scene, performing CPR on the victim," said Rick Sung, public information officer for the Santa Clara County Sheriff's Office. The Swell Season, a pop/rock duo, has reflected on the incident on its web site and social networking sites. Pickels' death was ruled a suicide by Santa Clara County's coroner Friday, Sung said. The suicide victim, Michael Edward Pickels, 32, had attended the concert with a friend, Sung said.
