John McCain was one of the Republicans who supported GSE reform, but he and the others faced an insurmountable defensive phalanx in Congress -- the result of a strong lobbying and political support program engineered and operated over many years by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are called government sponsored enterprises (GSEs) because they have government charters and perform a government mission: providing liquidity to the mortgage market and assisting in the financing of affordable housing. They hired some former congressional staff members as lobbyists and engaged lobbying firms that had strong relationships with members of Congress, including lobbyists who are active in both of this year's presidential campaigns They got people who were homebuilders, Realtors and members of the securities industry -- all groups that profited from Fannie and Freddie's activities -- to hold fundraising events for key members of Congress of both parties; they staged ribbon-cuttings and other events in the congressional districts of their supporters in order to provide them with favorable publicity; they established charitable arms that contributed to community groups who in turn supported them when some in Congress sought tougher regulation. In announcing the takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson noted that the "flawed business model" of these companies was in part responsible for their failure. It is thus no surprise that Sen. Schumer was quoted as follows right after the Paulson plan was announced: "This plan will be met with broad acceptance in Congress because it doesn't prejudge the ultimate fate of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.''
