Hundreds of people gathered Saturday to show their support for law enforcement following nationwide protests of controversial police incidents in Ferguson, Missouri; New York City and other areas. Terrance Gainer, former sergeant at arms for the U.S. Senate, told the crowd that "of 40 million encounters police will have with the public, 98.5 percent" of them are "good and great," and said cops should empathize with minority groups, who sometimes complain about their treatment at the hands of police.
