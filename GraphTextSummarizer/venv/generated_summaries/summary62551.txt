Even with all the rhetoric coming out of Congress today about Republicans who desire to control spending, a close look at the plans of individuals such as Congressman Paul Ryan shows that deficits would remain alive and well if their policies went into effect. Belying the notion that they are not part of life inside the Beltway, Republicans have also been implicated in many scandals involving the abuse of power, such as all the politicians who fell as a result of their connection to the lobbyist Jack Abramoff in 2006, making it difficult for many Americans to hear Republicans blast away at the very Washington in which its members thrive. The party of morality: This remains a chestnut for many Republicans who want to appeal to notions of social and cultural conservatism. When Republicans are presidents, spending has continued to rise and deficits have gone up. During this time, Republicans have formed close connections with the K Street lobbying community and become accustomed to the benefits of pork barrel spending.
