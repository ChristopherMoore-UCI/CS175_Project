Choi told CNN he received the news through a phone call from his Army National Guard battalion commander. He admitted his sexual orientation publicly for the first time last year on MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show," prompting the Army to initiate proceedings to discharge him. -- One of the most outspoken gay critics of the military's "don't ask, don't tell" policy said Thursday that he has been discharged from the Army. His discharge, however, actually became effective on June 29, according to Eric Durr, a National Guard spokesman. Choi, who lives in New York City, founded KnightsOut.org, an advocacy and education organization of West Point graduates who are gay, lesbian, transgender or bisexual.
