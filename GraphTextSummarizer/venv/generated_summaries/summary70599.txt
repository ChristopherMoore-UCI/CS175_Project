She said the new requirement will "help promote integration, remove cultural barriers, and protect public services." -- All non-European immigrants to the United Kingdom must pass a basic English language test before being granted a visa under new rules announced by the government Wednesday. "Today's announcement is one of a wide range of measures the new government is taking to ensure that immigration is properly controlled for the benefit of the U.K., alongside a limit on work visas and an effective system for regulating the students who come here," May said. "I believe being able to speak English should be a prerequisite for anyone who wants to settle here," Home Secretary Theresa May said. Anyone wishing to come to the United Kingdom as a partner must demonstrate a basic command of conversational English by proving they have passed the test at an approved testing center, the Home Office said.
