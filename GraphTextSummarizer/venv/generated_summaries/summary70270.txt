"We had a hard day today," Joe Reinarz, an incident commander, told those attending a town hall meeting in Greer, Arizona, on Monday evening. -- One of the worst wildfires in Arizona history grew by 40,000 acres Monday, forcing the evacuation of thousands as crews battled heavy winds in trying to prevent the 30-mile line from advancing further, officials said. In eastern Arizona, southwest winds blew 25 to 28 mph through the region Monday with nighttime gusts forecast to blow as strong as 40 mph. The "Wallow Fire," as the blaze is known, has scorched 233,522 acres as of Monday evening -- up more than 21% from the 192,746 acres reported that morning -- said Terri Wildermuth, a spokeswoman for the Incident Management Team that is overseeing firefighting efforts. Apache County Deputy Chief Sheriff Brannon Eagar on Monday evening urged people in the area, even if they haven't been ordered to evacuate yet, to get ready to leave.
