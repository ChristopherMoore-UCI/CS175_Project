President Barack Obama along with Melinda Gates, co-chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and Education Secretary Arne Duncan will tour TechBoston Academy on Tuesday.

TechBoston Academy opened with 75 students and a $400,000 grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, as well as support from other private and philanthropic organizations.

Another way the corporate partners help students is by opening job-shadow opportunities to them.
