Manchester City and Chelsea, two of the richest clubs in world soccer, were knocked out of the English FA Cup by lower league opposition on a day of shocks and awe. At Stamford Bridge Chelsea, the current Premier League leaders who have looked imperious all season, took an early two goal lead against Bradford City, who play in English football's third tier. On Friday fifth placed Manchester United narrowly avoided losing to Cambridge United, who play in English football's fourth tier. Louis Van Gaal's expensively assembled team could not break down the fourth division team, who featured former Manchester United academy player Luke Chadwick, once a contemporary of David Beckham, Paul Scholes and Ryan Giggs.
