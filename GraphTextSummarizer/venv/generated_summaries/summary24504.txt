Rose Mayr and Elizabeth Nass, both 19, were apparently sitting on a bridge ledge in Ellicott City, Maryland, just after midnight with their backs to the train when it derailed, according to a written statement from Howard County police. Marmie Edwards, spokeswoman for Operation Lifesaver, a nonprofit organization that promotes railroad safety measures, said the number of fatalities in 2012 involving people on tracks was up significantly. Two teenage girls were killed early Tuesday when a train derailed on the bridge they were sitting on, spilling coal and burying the young women, police in Maryland said. Mayr and Nass were high school classmates of David Butko's. According to the Federal Railroad Administration, through the first five months of the year, 178 people have been killed in accidents on or near tracks (not including at a railroad crossing).
