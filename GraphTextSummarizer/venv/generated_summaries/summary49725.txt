Deteriorating security conditions near the Golan Heights headquarters for U.N. peacekeepers in the region has prompted Austria to say it will pull out its 370 troops, more than a third of the force assigned to help keep Israel and Syria at bay. Last month, U.N. officials said Syrian rebels detained four Filipino peacekeepers, and in December, two Austrian peacekeepers were wounded after being caught in crossfire between Syrian government troops and rebels. " U.N. spokeswoman Josephine Guerrero said Filipino and Indian peacekeepers will remain in the region to enforce the peace deal between Israel and Syria reached in 1974, nearly seven years after Israel first captured Quneitra in the Six-Day War. Syrian tanks crossed into a demilitarized zone near the crossing, Israel complained to the United Nations, and two U.N. peacekeepers were wounded when an errant mortar round fell on their border camp. Baalbek's population has grown 50% in recent months because of the influx of Syrian refugees fleeing their country's violence.
