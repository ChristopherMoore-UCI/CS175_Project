" Harvard scholar Henry Louis Gates Jr. was arrested last week at his home after a confrontation with an officer investigating a possible break-in, according to a Cambridge police report. "This isn't taking sides between the police officers and Mr. Gates," said Brian Walsh, spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee. The report said Gates initially refused to show the officer identification but eventually produced a Harvard identification card, prompting Crowley to radio for Harvard police. iReport.com: "Shame" on Gates Gates was arrested for "loud and tumultuous behavior in a public space" and was released from police custody after spending four hours at the police station. Crowley wrote in the Cambridge police report that Gates refused to step outside to speak with him, the police report said.
