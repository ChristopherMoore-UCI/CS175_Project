U.S. oil production since Exxon Valdez I remain guarded about how major oil companies will ultimately transition to being energy companies rather than fossil fuel companies, boosting our economy sustainably rather than pushing it closer to a breaking point. Companies, investors and policymakers must scale up clean energy investments and scale down fossil fuel investments. Companies such as General Motors, Apple and Starbucks are now calling for strong climate and clean-energy policies in Congress. Some are already pulling out of riskier carbon-intensive investments such as coal companies and are setting specific targets for elevating clean energy investments. We don't always have control of our destiny, but in the case of climate change we know exactly what it will take to protect our planet and economy from disaster.
