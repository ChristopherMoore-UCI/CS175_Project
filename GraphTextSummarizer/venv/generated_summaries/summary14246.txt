The quake left 54 people injured, six of them in critical condition and five others with severe injuries, China's state-run news agency Xinhua reported Sunday, citing local authorities. Authorities say they have sent response teams and relief supplies to the affected region. A powerful earthquake struck a remote Tibetan region of southwestern China, reportedly killing at least five people and causing a stampede at a primary school. The magnitude-5.9 quake struck late Saturday afternoon in a mountainous area of Sichuan province at a depth of around 15 kilometers (9 miles), according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Video footage from the region showed panicked people dashing out of buildings as the quake struck.
