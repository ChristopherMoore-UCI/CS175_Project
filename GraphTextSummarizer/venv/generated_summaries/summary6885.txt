In seeking the death penalty, prosecutors cite as an aggravating factor Tsarnaev's "betrayal of the United States." Lawyers for suspected Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokar Tsarnaev have asked a federal court to strike comments he made at a hospital after suffering wounds during a manhunt that paralyzed the city in the days following the 2013 race. Lawyers specifically pointed to the case of Clayton Lockett, a convicted murderer who died in April of an apparent heart attack almost 45 minutes after his execution began at Oklahoma State Penitentiary. They claim that after receiving asylum from the United States, he "enjoyed the freedoms of a United States citizen; and then betrayed his allegiance to the United States" by killing and maiming its people. Tsarnaev is accused of planting the bombs at the finish line of the 2013 race, along with his brother Tamerlan, who was killed during the manhunt.
