"Before the war, Liberia had a couple of very good hotels," says Modad. The country's hotels were also victims; to this day, the skeletons of two of Liberia's biggest hotels -- Ducor Intercontinental and Hotel Africa -- still stand, serving as a grim reminder of the impact the war had on the country. Like many of his countrymen, Amin Modad left Liberia in the late 1990s to seek refuge in the United States during the country's ruinous civil war. He says that high energy costs and skills shortage make hotels a difficult enterprise to venture into. It also destroyed much of Liberia's economy and infrastructure.
