The heir to the British throne spent a night at Camp Bastion, the main British base in Helmand province, before traveling to Lashkar Gah, the capital of the province. Prince Charles met Gen. Stanley McChrystal, the top U.S. general in Afghanistan, as well as Afghan senior government ministers and tribal and religious leaders to gain their perspective about reintroducing stability to the country, the spokesman said. Prince Charles' younger son, Prince Harry, 25, served on the front line in Afghanistan and saw combat. -- Britain's Prince Charles left Afghanistan on Thursday after a previously unannounced two-day visit there, a spokesman said. President Hamid Karzai was on an overseas trip, so the prince was not able to see him, the spokesman said, although he said the two spoke on the phone before Prince Charles traveled there.
