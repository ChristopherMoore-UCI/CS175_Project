The report coincides with other studies showing that while the influx of unauthorized immigrants from Mexico has sharply decreased, unauthorized Mexicans living in the United States are staying put. According to the report, the most marked decline was in the population of unauthorized immigrants who come from Latin American countries other than Mexico. The authors of the report point out, however, that despite the decline, the population of unauthorized immigrants was nearly a third larger in 2009 compared to 2000, and it is three times larger than in 1990. Among the report's other findings was that nearly half of unauthorized immigrants living in the country in 2009 arrived in 2000 or later. This group, which includes illegal immigrants from the Caribbean, Central and South America, saw a decrease of 22 percent in the same 2007-2009 period.
