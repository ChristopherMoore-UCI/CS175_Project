Then a student at Texas Tech University in Lubbock, Mallin was walking to her car, intending to move it to another parking lot, when a man approached her asking about jumper cables, she said. Cole, like Mallin, was a student at Texas Tech. The next day, police investigators showed Mallin pictures of possible suspects. The "Tech rapist" attacked four women other than Mallin -- abducting them in parking lots near campus and driving them to a vacant location, where he would rape them and flee on foot, according to the Innocence Project of Texas. He was arrested and charged with Mallin's rape, declining a plea bargain offer that would have put him on probation.
