The dizzying pace of the seven-day congressional freshman orientation has trappings of the first day of college: There's apartment hunting, a picture day, field trips, an "office fair," assemblies, briefings on how to stay out of trouble, an ID card check-in, welcome meetings with leadership and hugs and kisses from loved ones. In the basement of the Rayburn House Office Building, Capitol Hill techies will be on hand to demonstrate "the newest computer and telecommunications equipment." A race for the high-rise penthouse this is not: The best real estate on Capitol Hill is actually on the lower floors, which shortens travel between to the House floor for votes. The new GOP class will hop on a bus to the National Archives with House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican, for a "private document viewing" of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. The Friday schedule calls for an hour-long bipartisan breakfast panel entitled "If I Knew Then What I Know Now" hosted by longstanding members with wisdom to share, followed by tours of the Capitol's hallowed halls.
