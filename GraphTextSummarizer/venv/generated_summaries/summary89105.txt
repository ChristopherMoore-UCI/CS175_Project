Sarah Bajc has a bag packed, ready to join her partner of two years, a passenger on Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, wherever he is. Wood was one of three Americans on the plane, which went missing on March 8. She and Wood were about to move from Beijing to Kuala Lumpur and were going to get married this year. Wood and Bajc have new jobs in Kuala Lumpur (she will work at a school there), and the movers showed up the day the plane disappeared. She told CNN that people ask her what Wood is like, and she said if you were in his presence, you'd see him as a good, generous and thoughtful man who loves his family and friends.
