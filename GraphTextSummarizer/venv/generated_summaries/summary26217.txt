But for want of a cheap cab ride, former UBS banker Bradley Birkenfeld could end up back in prison after being arrested for driving while intoxicated in New Hampshire. Birkenfeld, who listed a Rye, New Hampshire, address, is scheduled for trial on Nov. 12. The IRS paid him $104 million for providing information as a whistle blower to prosecute banking giant UBS AG, and upended centuries of storied Swiss bank secrecy. Justice Department prosecutors used documents and other information provided by Birkenfeld to prosecute UBS and some of its top bankers for aiding tax evasion by U.S. offshore banking customers. Birkenfeld's probation officer said if he is convicted a judge could order that he be sent back to prison or be subject to additional supervision requirements.
