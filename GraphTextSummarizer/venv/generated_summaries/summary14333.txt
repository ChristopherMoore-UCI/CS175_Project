Prototypical German defenders have names like Guido Buchwald and Jürgen Kohler from the 1990 World Cup squad, who struck fear into most opponents. Then there was the current U.S. coach Jürgen Klinsmann who made his mark in the 1990 World Cup. He was just being German and guess what, he took team America further than most fans predicted. The sport has its own vocabulary and, as is common in the German language, most new terms are created by simply lumping several words together to make a 15 or 20 character monster word that would be an entire sentence in many other languages. If your forwards and strikers have many chances but never seem to put the ball in the net, they will be dismissed as CHANCENTOD (death of chances).
