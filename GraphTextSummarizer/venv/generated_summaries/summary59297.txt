Midfielder Michael Carrick says the absence of Champions League football at Old Trafford will be difficult to swallow. Patrice Evra's fierce effort gave United a shock lead after 57 minutes but goals from Mario Mandzukic, Thomas Muller and Arjen Robben sealed the win. The defeat means United will not compete in Europe's top competition next season and heaps more pressure on manager David Moyes. "It was always going to be tough tonight and we're not in the Champions League next season, not necessarily because of tonight, but because we have been weak and haven't been good enough over the season," he told Sky Sports. Last season, under Alex Ferguson, United won the league title by 11 points -- this year it sits seventh and faces a struggle to even claim a place in the Europa League.
