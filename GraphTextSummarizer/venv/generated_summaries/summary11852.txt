Speaking at CNN's Earth's Frontiers debate in Seoul, Nasheed said he was looking for a greater urgency from countries and business across the world in dealing with the problems caused by climate change. " Zeitz took a stand for businesses taking the initiative in promoting renewable energy by saying that business cannot wait for government action. Business ultimately has caused a lot of the environmental degradation we see around the world, so business is there to also fix it," he said. Rather than a slow decay, Nasheed's own nation is faced with a rapid extinction caused by a rise in sea-levels, according to many climate scientists. Instead of revisiting the divisions that flared between countries at the Copenhagen climate summit in December, Nasheed struck a more inclusive tone on how countries can work together to create a carbon-neutral future.
