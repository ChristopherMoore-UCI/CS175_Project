Since 1864, all states have provided for popular election of electors for president and vice president. According to the U.S. Constitution, voters in each state cast their ballots for the party slate of electors who represent their choice for president and vice president. Aside from this disqualification, any person is qualified to be an elector for president and vice president. On the Monday following the second Wednesday of December, by federal law, each state's electors meet in their respective capitals and cast their votes, one for president and one for vice president. The candidate for president who has attained the majority of electoral votes (270) is then declared the president.
