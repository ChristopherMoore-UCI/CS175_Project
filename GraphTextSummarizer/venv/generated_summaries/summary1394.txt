'Bigger than me' For Albert Frimpong, the team's coach and sole financier, skate soccer is more than just a game -- it's a potential means to get these men off the streets. The film's director, Eddie Edwards, says that his interest in the players is lost on some Ghanians. "Going amongst the cars, it's very dangerous," attests Aminu Yaro, aka Smallee, a polio survivor who moved to the city from Niger. The poorest of them often make a living from begging, weaving through the Ghanaian capital's traffic on homemade skateboards, seeking handouts from passing motorists. "People in traffic sometimes recognize them from TV and think they're making money from their appearances and that they don't deserve to be helped," says Edwards.
