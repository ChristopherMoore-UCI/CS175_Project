In statehouse after statehouse, new laws are being proposed and enacted that require recipients of food stamps, welfare, unemployment and other forms of public assistance to be able to pass a drug test first. When politicians say they want to make public assistance conditional on clean drug tests, they don't mean all public assistance to all people. Drug tests, they say, will motivate welfare recipients to clean up their acts and make themselves more employable all around. Imagine if we instituted a policy nationwide that required anyone receiving taxpayer assistance to have to prove to the government that he or she is not using drugs. The idea, say these policymakers, is to ensure that precious tax dollars won't flow to undeserving free-riders with moral failings.
