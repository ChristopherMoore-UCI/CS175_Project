Both houses of Congress are on track to vote in the coming days on proposals sponsored by the candidates who will face off in a December Senate runoff in Louisiana. "I am so pleased to have been one of the spark plugs to help to get us moving -- not in the next Congress, but in the lame duck session of this Congress," Landrieu said on the Senate floor Thursday. Notre Dame law professor Bruce Huber said the legislation the House and Senate are set to vote on "would override the presidential permit process and simply declare the proposal to be approved as a matter of federal law."
