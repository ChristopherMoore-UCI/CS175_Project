You might think a thriving bird population is the last thing you'd want on a fish farm (Veta la Palma loses 20 percent of fish eggs and baby fish to the birds), but for Medialdea, it's a point of pride and a testament to the company's success. Yet when I tasted it at Veta la Palma, it tasted not at all like fish skin. It's become one of the most important private estates for bird life in Europe. I don't like fish skin -- not seared or crispy. The farm is incredible, with hundreds of miles of flooded canals and thick marshland, teeming with life.
