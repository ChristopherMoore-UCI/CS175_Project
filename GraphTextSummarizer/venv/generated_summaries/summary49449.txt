Natalya Estemirova, of the Russian human rights group Memorial, was kidnapped outside her home in Grozny, Chechnya, Oleg Orlov said, citing eyewitness reports. Estemirova, pictured in 2007, had been openly critical of Chechnya's president, Ramzan Kadyrov. Estemirova, 50, was a leading human rights activist in the North Caucasus area who had been openly criticizing Chechnya's authoritarian president, Ramzan Kadyrov, and his methods. Estemirova studied history at Grozny University, then taught history before turning to journalism and human rights in 1998, Memorial said. " The Committee to Protect Journalists, in a written statement, demanded that the killing be thoroughly investigated immediately. "As she uncovered massive, ongoing human rights violations in Chechnya by the federal and regional authorities, Estemirova was often at odds with Chechen authorities, according to her colleagues," the advocacy group said.
