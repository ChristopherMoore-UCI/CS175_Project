The suspect reportedly made anti-gay remarks and asked them whether they were "gay wrestlers," Kelly said. On May 8, another gay man was assaulted by two men shouting anti-gay slurs as he left a bar in Manhattan's West Village, New York Police said. The suspect's anti-gay remarks were noted before the shooting took place, Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said. There was another attack on gay men on May 5, outside of Madison Square Garden following a New York Knicks game. It is at least the fourth violent attack in two weeks believed to be motivated by anti-gay bias, police said.
