John D. Raymond, 53, is being held on a civil bench warrant and is likely to face charges in district court Tuesday of illegally manufacturing and possessing explosives, said Sgt. A police robot removed a half pound of TATP, or Triacetone Triperoxide, from Raymond's apartment, Reagan said. The TATP in Raymond's apartment was placed in a bomb-proof container and taken to a county-owned gravel yard for detonation. Reagan said Raymond was angry about how his divorce case was being handled. Raymond uses a wheelchair to get around and lived in a ground floor apartment of the 10-unit building.
