The device could save millions of lives and beats almost exactly like the real thing using electronic sensors to regulate heart rate and blood flow. The artificial heart would initially be for patients who had suffered a massive heart attack or who had heart failure, but might eventually be used in patients who are not that sick. The French model is made from natural materials including polymer and pig tissue, which have already been used in heart valves implanted into people. Previous artificial hearts have been unable to automatically vary their pumping speed and must be tweaked externally. Past artificial hearts have only had one pump.
