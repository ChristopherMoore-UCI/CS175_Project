"This is a serious sentence that properly reflects the crimes that Mr. Halderman has now admitted that he committed, and it is a fitting end to the case," said Letterman lawyer Daniel J. Horwitz. "On the morning of September 9, 2009, I gave a sealed envelope to Mr. Letterman's driver as he waited outside of Mr. Letterman's Manhattan home," Halderman said in the statement, called an allocution. "I asked the driver to give the envelope marked 'Privileged and Confidential' to Mr. Letterman. This so-called treatment was just a thinly veiled threat to ruin Mr. Letterman if he did not pay me a lot of money. "I knew throughout this time that I was not engaged in a legitimate business transaction with Mr. Letterman and that what I was doing was against New York law.
