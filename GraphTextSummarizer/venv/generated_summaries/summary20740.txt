So when Gruber describes the deception involved in passing Obamacare, it included at the very least the CBO's acceptance of Gruber's "tortured" manipulations, and at worst the opening of CBO models to be adjusted by a paid agent of the White House's political goals. This position gives the agency an outsized influence on policy, as reporters, commentators, "fact checkers," and many members of Congress (most of whom should know better) treat CBO estimates -- or "scores" -- like trump cards in debates over legislation. In February, four years after Obamacare became law, the CBO updated its projections about the law's effect on the economy, and included the bombshell that it would result in the equivalent of 2.5 million fewer Americans with full-time jobs in 2024. The CBO, for its part, now admits to Congress that Obamacare reduces government revenues. The CBO is more responsible for giving us Obamacare than Jonathan Gruber is, and as culpable as Democrats in Congress or President Obama.
