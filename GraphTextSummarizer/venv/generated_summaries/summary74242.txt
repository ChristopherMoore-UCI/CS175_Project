-- Britain's Prince William and his bride-to-be Kate Middleton, returned to the scene of their early romance Friday, visiting St. Andrews University in Fife, Scotland. Prince William, who is second line to the British throne, studied art history at St. Andrews when he first met Kate in 2001. "Catherine might be a bit emotional today," said CNN royal contributor Mark Saunders. As patron of the university's 600th Anniversary Appeal, Prince William officially launched the event, viewing the surviving Papal Bull -- a series of letters issued by the pope in 1413 -- and unveiling a plaque in front of students and staff. Their first official engagement was said to be deliberately low-key, in order to ease Middleton into royal life.
