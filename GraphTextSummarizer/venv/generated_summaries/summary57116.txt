" "Contrary to its direct assertion that the rule requires airlines to hide the amount of government taxes and fees, the rule does not prevent carriers from disclosing the amount, type, and nature of government taxes and fees that are associated with air travel," DOT General Counsel Robert Rivkin wrote. Before the rule, airlines frequently advertised low base fares on online sites and added taxes and fees later in the shopping process. -- A new rule requiring airlines to include government taxes and fees in their advertised price is continuing to cause turbulence in the travel industry -- and a congressman said Monday he'll introduce a bill to overturn it. "We support this effort to require DOT to return to its previous regulation, which does not artificially distort the base price of an airline ticket, and ensures that customers always know exactly how much they are paying in federal aviation taxes and fees before they decide to purchase," said Steve Lott, vice president of communications for Airlines for America said in an e-mail. But Graves and some airlines said the new rule allows the government to hide government taxes and fees.
