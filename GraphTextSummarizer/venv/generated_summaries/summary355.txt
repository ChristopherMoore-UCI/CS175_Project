A judge sentenced Pistorius to five years in prison on October 21 after finding the double-amputee track star guilty of culpable homicide, or negligent killing, in the death of Reeva Steenkamp. Pistorius acknowledged shooting Steenkamp in February 2013. But critics of the verdict have argued that Masipa didn't correctly apply the intent standard, which is broader in South African law than what it typically means in casual conversation, Phelps said. The process could take six months, CNN legal analyst Kelly Phelps said. Under South African law, Pistorius will have to serve at least one-sixth of his sentence before asking to be placed under correctional supervision.
