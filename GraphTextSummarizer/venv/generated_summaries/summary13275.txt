-- Former presidential assailant John Hinckley Jr. should not be allowed to spend any unsupervised time during visits to his mother's home in Virginia, according to a psychiatrist who first met Hinckley in the 1980s and interviewed him several times in recent months. The psychiatrist said he questioned Hinckley in November about being dishonest about his activities, and that Hinckley minimized it and called it "nitpicking." Hinckley, now 56, was found not guilty by reason of insanity in the March 1981 shooting of President Ronald Reagan, his press secretary James Brady, Secret Service Agent Timothy McCarthy and Washington police Officer Thomas Delahanty. During those visits, he is allowed three hours of unsupervised time twice during his stay, although sometimes Secret Service agents are watching Hinckley without his knowledge. Patterson said he had asked Hinckley about Secret Service reports Hinckley had gone into book stores and looked at shelves of history books which included volumes about presidential assassination. Whenever the subject has come up about Hinckley looking at books on assassination, Levine has said there were many books in the history section and agents don't know if Hinckley was looking at any books in particular.
