Watson Wyatt in its survey of mid- and large-sized companies found that flexible work schedules was the most commonly offered benefit, followed by telecommuting and compressed work weeks. For employees who adopt, they get 16 weeks of leave, of which six are paid if the employee is the primary caregiver, or two otherwise But then an additional four weeks of paid leave is available when the primary parent goes back to work. Plus, they can work from home for some of the week, or they can work compressed weeks so that they can take every fifth or 10th day off and still log their 80 hours. At Ernst &Young's Chicago office, new mothers with at least a year's tenure at the firm get three paid months of leave plus up to 19 weeks of unpaid leave. New fathers get six weeks of paid leave if they are the primary caregiver, two weeks if they are not.
