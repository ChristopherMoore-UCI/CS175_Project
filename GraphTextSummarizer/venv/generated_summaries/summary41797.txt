Isabelle Stapleton is "awake" and "responding," according to Sara Swanson, Benzie County prosecuting attorney, after being in critical care for carbon monoxide poisoning following a grisly incident last week in which her mother allegedly attempted to take both of their lives. -- A 14-year-old autistic Michigan girl whose mother allegedly tried to poison her with carbon monoxide in a murder-suicide attempt is recovering well, authorities said Tuesday. Officers found the vehicle locked with two charcoal grills burning inside, emitting carbon monoxide and using up the oxygen, according to Irwin. On the evening of September 3, Kelli Stapleton and her daughter were transported to hospitals for treatment of carbon monoxide poisoning after police discovered them unconscious inside their family vehicle in a wooded area, according to Sgt. Malcolm Irwin of Michigan State Police.
