Everywhere there are little reminders of the day the earth shook so violently: the trophy cabinet full of toppled sports awards, the covered walkways choked with smashed stone pillars. The first school assembly since the earthquake was charged with emotion and grief. But this one ripped the place apart, leaving mountains of red bricks lying on the desks and huge gaping holes in the ceiling. Most of the classrooms here are full of rubble and lessons are now being conducted in a tent outside, provided by United Nations Children's Fund, or UNICEF. The senior students are already wondering how they will cope when it comes to their important mid-term exams next week.
