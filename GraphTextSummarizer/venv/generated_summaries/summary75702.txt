"Priests allowed prostitutes to use churches," explains Enrico Bruschini, one of Rome's best known art historians. " Art students hoping to become the next Michelangelo agree. But back then artists mostly used prostitutes and lovers as models and muses, often with the complicity of priests who wanted the walls of their churches painted by famous names. "It all started with the rise of art schools in the 19th and 20th centuries" says Fattori. " Bruschini says that the Saint Augustine church, a stone's throw from Piazza Navona, was a famous gathering point in Rome for Renaissance artists looking for "inspiration."
