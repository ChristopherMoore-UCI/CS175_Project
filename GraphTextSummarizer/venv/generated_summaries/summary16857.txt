Beresford-Redman was taken into custody by U.S. marshals in Los Angeles on Tuesday afternoon on a warrant from Mexico, the U.S. attorney's spokesman said. The arrest was delayed when his lawyers in Mexico filed an "amparo" with a federal court in Mexico City, a document arguing there is not probable cause to charge him, a defense lawyer said. Beresford-Redman's lawyer predicted it could take a year before a decision is made by U.S. courts about Mexico's request for extradition. "In a conversation from Cancun on April 4, 2010, Monica Burgos told her sister, Ferreira Burgos, that she had found evidence that [Beresford-Redman] was still in contact with the woman with whom he was having the affair. An "aggravated homicide" warrant, unsealed Tuesday, accused Beresford-Redman of killing his wife, Monica Beresford-Redman, "by asphyxiating her" at a Cancun, Mexico, resort on April 5.
