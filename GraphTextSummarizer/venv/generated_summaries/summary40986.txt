Despite years of political infighting and real estate squabbling that delayed its construction, more than half of the building has now been rented, with a tenant list that includes Conde Nast publishing company and a Chinese real estate investment firm called Vantone Holdings. The One World Trade Center is now 100 stories high, stretching just over 1,244 feet and just 6 feet shy of the Empire State Building (without its antenna), according to Steve Coleman, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The building reached its 100th floor last week and is expected to be completed by next year or sometime in early 2014, Coleman said Tuesday. In its shadow, twin reflecting pools are situated in the footprints of where the Twin Towers once stood. The following 10 floors are to be reserved for air conditioning, heating, and electrical equipment.
