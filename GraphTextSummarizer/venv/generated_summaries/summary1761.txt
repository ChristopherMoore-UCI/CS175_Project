Robert said it was Breeden who introduced Edwin to one of his alleged captors, and he believes his brother's abuse could have started soon after Edwin left home. Edwin said he would often fight back and share his food with the others while he was with Weston, Robert said. In mid-October, Robert received a call from his father, who told him police might have found Edwin locked in a dank Philadelphia basement with three other people. Robert was 15 when his brother, Edwin, left home at age 18. Born prematurely with only one functioning lung, Edwin spent his school years in special education classes, Robert said.
