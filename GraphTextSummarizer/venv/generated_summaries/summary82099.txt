-- A court denied parole for a jailed member of Russian punk rock band Pussy Riot on Friday, state media reported. The Supreme Court of the Mordovia region upheld an earlier decision to deny Nadezhda Tolokonnikova's parole, the official RIA Novosti news agency said. Tolokonnikova was given a 2-year sentence for hooliganism after a trial in August that was criticized by international rights groups. State-run court news agency Rapsi cited an attorney as saying Tolokonnikova would not appeal the court's ruling on parole.
