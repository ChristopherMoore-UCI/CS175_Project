" Sisulu and her husband dedicated their lives to the struggle for freedom in South Africa, and endured banishment, detention and humiliation, said President Jacob Zuma. Sisulu was married to anti-apartheid leader Walter Sisulu for nearly 60 years. Affectionately called "Ma Sisulu," she was also detained numerous times and was held in solitary confinement for seven weeks in 1963, the ruling African National Congress said. "Mama Sisulu has over the decades been a pillar of strength not only for the Sisulu family, but also the entire liberation movement as she reared, counseled, nursed and educated most of the leaders and founders of the democratic South Africa," Zuma said. "South Africa remains eternally grateful and indebted to this stalwart of the liberation and an assuming leader of all races of our people," Zuma said in a statement.
