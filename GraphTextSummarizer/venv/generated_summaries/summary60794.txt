-- Navy Yard gunman Aaron Alexis left a trail of so-called red flags that, in hindsight, seem quite glaring, even if the impetus for this week's deadly rampage remains murky. Alexis told police the car's owner, a construction worker, had disrespected him, leading to an anger-fueled "blackout," according to a police report. Alexis also told authorities, according to the report, that "he does not have a history of mental illness in his family and that he never had any sort of mental episode." His father told Seattle police that Alexis had post-traumatic stress disorder after working as "an active participant in rescue attempts" after the 9/11 attacks, the report said. These individuals had followed him to three hotels in the area, Alexis told police, and spoke to him through the walls and floor and used "some sort of microwave machine" that sent "vibrations through the ceiling, penetrating his body so he cannot fall asleep," according to the August 7 report.
