"Ghana has an almost unique combination of plentiful surf spots, warm water, consistent swell from the south Atlantic and few surfers, making the country one of West Africa's best surfing destinations," says John Callahan, co-founder of surfEXPLORE. In this Islamic country, nonprofit organization Surfing the Nations organized the country's first surf competition in 2005 in the coastal town of Cox's Bazar and local surfer Jafar Alam recently set up the country's first surf school, complete with rental boards donated by professional surfers from around the world. Popular surf spots on this spectacular chunk of coastline include Sur, Ras Al Hadd and Salalah, where Oman's first surf school, Surf School Oman, was set up. The first people to surf the lake were U.S. soldiers who returned to Michigan from Hawaii after World War II with surfboards they'd purchased. The first (and as yet, only) known person to surf in Antarctica was Red Bull athlete Ramon Navarro.
