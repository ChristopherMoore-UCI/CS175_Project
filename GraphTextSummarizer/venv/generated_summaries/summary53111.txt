And a U.N. report says that both sides -- the regime and the rebels -- have committed war crimes in Syria's bloody 2-year-old civil war. It was back in June that officials familiar with the matter told CNN that the United States planned to send small arms, ammunition and, potentially, anti-tank weapons to Syria's rebels. Meanwhile, a Vladimir Putin-penned editorial in The New York Times has at least one White House official saying it's an indication the Russian president is "now fully invested in Syria's chemical disarmament." A senior White House official says it's "all irrelevant," suggesting that Putin is already all in when it comes to forcing Syria to give up its chemical weapons. Relieved of an impending vote on whether to give the president the authorization to attack Syria, Congress is moving on to other matters.
