Why Anonymous wants justice in Missouri rape case After this month's reports, Rice said last week that he'd ask a court to appoint a special prosecutor. " "I know that this case has raised a variety of concerns in northwest Missouri, so please know this: This case will be thoroughly reviewed," Jackson County Prosecutor Jean Peters Baker said. The initial prosecutor, Nodaway County Prosecutor Robert L. Rice, has said he dropped a sexual assault charge against the boy because the girl and her relatives refused to cooperate. CNN does not typically identify alleged victims of sexual assault but has done so in this case because Daisy and her mother, Melinda Coleman, have chosen to go public. Both appeared on CNN's "The Lead with Jake Tapper" on Monday, one day before a planned protest in support of Daisy at the Nodaway County Courthouse.
