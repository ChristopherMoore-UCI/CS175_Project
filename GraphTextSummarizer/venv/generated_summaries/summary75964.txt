Read Boudreau's blog post on background checks for spill workers Robertson had been supervising a crew of cleanup workers, including the alleged victim. In a statement to CNN, BP spokesman Robert Wine said, "BP does conduct full checks on its employees, and under normal business conditions can make it a part of the contract for full backgrounds to be conducted by our long-term contractors. Jeff Reichert, the general counsel for Aerotek, the company that hired Robertson, said his company was only following the contract it had with Miller Environmental Group, which did not require background checks. " Byrd said he told the BP official that "you're going to have every type of person coming in here looking for a job, and you're going to have the criminal element in here, and we're not going to know who we're dealing with if we don't do background checks on these people. Euris Dubois, chief of police in Grand Isle, Louisiana, said he contacted BP and contractors about background checks.
