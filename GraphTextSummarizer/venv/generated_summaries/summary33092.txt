And certainly much of the Putin era has been absorbed with the suppression of opposition political movements, whether in Russia, by keeping rival party leaders from registering for elections, or abroad ,by invading Georgia, Crimea and eastern Ukraine to prevent democratic regimes from succeeding in neighboring states. Rival political party leaders had been sent by Lenin to camps in the 1920s, and opposition political movements, including in Ukraine, had struggled to defeat Bolshevik collectivization in the early 1930s. The fact that Nemtsov's girlfriend was Ukrainian and she was with him when he died was immediately picked up by Russian media. The spokesman for the Investigative Committee, Vladimir Markin, cautioned the press not to jump to conclusions and then proceeded to put up a bewildering array of possible motives that included everything except Kremlin jealousy: He called the act a political provocation perhaps perpetrated by Islamic extremists angered over his stand on the Charlie Hebdo killing; or a "sacral sacrifice" by the opposition itself to destabilize the country; or related to his views on the Ukrainian war;  or a business conflict; or an assault related to his personal life. It goes without saying that the Kremlin also was quick to deny Putin's involvement in Nemtsov's death.
