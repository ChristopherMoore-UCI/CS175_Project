"Every step of the way, defendants were negligent and reckless," the complaint stated, "These breaches of duty proximately caused the destruction of One World Trade Center, Five World Trade Center and Seven World Trade Center on September 11. World Trade Center Properties, or WTCP, first sued United Airlines, American Airlines and other aviation companies in 2004, claiming their negligence resulted in the 9/11 terrorist attacks that destroyed the World Trade Center towers. " According to court documents, WTCP said it has spent more than $8 billion to replace the twin towers, which they have been obligated to continue paying rent on to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. In court, the aviation defendants argued that insurance payments were made to compensate WTCP for economic loss after the destruction of the towers and that the same economic loss is what the WTCP was seeking damages for, thereby making their claims invalid. In the complaint, WTCP claimed that the aircraft lacked proper cockpit doors that would have prevented unauthorized people from entering, as well as an alarm system that would have notified the government of such events.
