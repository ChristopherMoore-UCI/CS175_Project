More-conservative thinkers argue that income inequality is necessary for a capitalist society to thrive -- that income gaps encourage competition, innovation and hard work. Others argue income inequality hampers economic mobility -- meaning it's less likely that that American Dream is actually a reality for people. The epidemiologist Kate Pickett says high income inequality is associated with all sorts of bad things -- from obesity to high incarceration rates and violence. But there still is research to support the idea that very high levels of income inequality tear at the fabric of society, regardless of its overall wealth. Perhaps that's because income inequality is one of those alliterative word pairs everyone's heard by now but few fully understand.
