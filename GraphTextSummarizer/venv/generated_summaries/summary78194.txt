Still, the health department recommended that children younger than 6 and pregnant women stop eating venison shot with lead bullets because those groups are at particular risk for lead poisoning, even at low levels. "There is no cause for alarm, but it is another source of lead in the environment," he said of lead ammunition. We think this absolutely should be left up to hunters." Dr. Joseph Graziano, interim department chair of environmental health sciences at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health, said the public should switch away from lead bullets -- even if the research is still developing. The NSSF and the National Rifle Association say efforts to ban lead ammunition are veiled attempts to take guns away from hunters. Barnes Bullets, which manufactures copper bullets because, the company says, they perform better than lead, is seeing increased interest in its non-lead products, said Jessica Brooks, the Utah company's spokeswoman.
