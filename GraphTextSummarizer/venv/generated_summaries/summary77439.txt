His expertise in the field of green design originated from his early doctoral dissertation from Cambridge University (1971-1974) followed by his ongoing R&D work, which has since led to the publication of a number of his treatises on the topic of ecological design and planning, bioclimatic design and high-rise design. He is best known as the inventor of the Bioclimatic skyscraper (as a genre of low-energy skyscrapers based on bioclimatic design principles), and for his novel ideas on designing the high-rise building type as vertical urban design. Born in Penang, Malaysia in 1948, Yeang was educated there, as well as in the U.S. and the UK, receiving his doctorate in Architecture from Cambridge University, and attending graduate courses at the University of Pennsylvania and Harvard. His publications include: "The Skyscraper: Bioclimatically Considered," "The Green Skyscraper: The Basis for Designing Sustainable, Intensive Buildings," and his latest book "Ecodesign: A manual for Ecological Design." Dr. Ken Yeang is the world's leading architect in ecological and passive low energy design.
