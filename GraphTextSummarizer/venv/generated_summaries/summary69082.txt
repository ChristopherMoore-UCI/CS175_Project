Organizers at the European Space Agency and Russia's Institute of Biomedical Problems hope the project will shed light on the physical and psychological effects of the long isolation that future Mars astronauts will experience. They "landed" on Mars on Saturday, and on Monday, Russia's Alexander Smoleyevsky and Italy's Diego Urbina completed their first walk on the "Martian surface." "This study is not useful only for Mars, but also for life on Earth," Urbina, 27, said in a news release when the mission began last year. Speaking at a press conference at Mission Control on Monday before the walk, Vitaly Davydov, deputy head of the Russian Space Agency, said that the "main task of the project is to determine the list of problems" that real space crews flying to Mars might be encountering. " Two other such walks are scheduled for Friday and February 22, according to Igor Ushakov, director of the Moscow-based Institute for Biomedical Problems, the main organization coordinating the project.
