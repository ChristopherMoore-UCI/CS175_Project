The WTO worked with Beijing to set toilet standards before the 2008 Olympics, a "coming-of-age" event for China, Sim said, adding that China's National Tourism Administration now wants the WTO's World Toilet College involved in training professional cleaners. "A lot of places in China are rare, so beautiful, but tourism agents cannot get people there because there are no proper toilet facilities," Sim said, adding that he's met people who smoke in public toilets just to avoid the smell. According to China Daily, Beijing invested 400 million yuan ($57 million) on public toilets in the four years leading up to the Olympics. -- Public toilets in China's capital are coming under new rules, including "no more than two flies allowed. " Other rules for Beijing's public toilet sanitation and staff include waste collection every half hour and bilingual instructions in English and Chinese, according to state-run China Daily.
