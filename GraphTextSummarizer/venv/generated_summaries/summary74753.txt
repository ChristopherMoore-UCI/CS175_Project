Raised in the Philippines while her father was stationed in Indonesia with the U.S. military, she says she "always felt happiest in Asia." Once in Bali, Lim volunteered to help local midwives deliver babies in various homes. "The situation is bad ... babies are unattended, deliveries have become commercialized, and mothers die from hemorrhage after childbirth because they can't afford proper care," Lim said. "Holding babies until payment is common in Indonesia," said Robin Lim, a midwife who founded birthing clinics in Aceh and the island of Bali. In 2003, with help from the Balinese community and donations from friends across the globe, Lim and her husband opened the first Yayasan Bumi Sehat clinic. I would dedicate my life to it." Lim and her husband, Will, sold their home in Hawaii and moved the family to Bali to "reinvent their lives."
