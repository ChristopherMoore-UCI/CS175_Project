A January 2010 report from the human rights group says Irish women face financial, logistical, physical, and emotional burdens imposed by the laws of Ireland that force them to seek abortions abroad, without support from the state. Women in Ireland are permitted to travel abroad for abortions and obtain information about their options for doing so. It did not, however, recommend a change to Irish law, which prohibits abortion in all cases. Human Rights Watch praised the ruling as a "wake-up call to the Irish government" to regulate access to abortion. "It is time for the government to end their ostrich mentality regarding abortion and start delivering on women's human rights," Mollmann said.
