Earlier, Abdallah Kenshill, an NTC chief negotiator, had told CNN that anti-Gadhafi fighters had been just 1.5 kilometers, nearly a mile, from the center of Bani Walid, situated on the north, east and south. Inside Bani Walid, meanwhile, pro- and anti-Gadhafi groups clashed, but NTC fighters were not involved, said Badr Abu Shahma, assistant to the commander of Misrata's southern front. A military spokesman, citing heavy resistance from loyalists in Bani Walid, said anti-Gadhafi forces had retreated Friday. Sticking points included the demand by Gadhafi loyalists for NTC fighters to enter their communities unarmed, and to refrain from searching houses. Ben Ali also said he received intelligence reports that loyalist forces were moving captured NTC fighters to Qasr Bu Hadi for use as human shields.
