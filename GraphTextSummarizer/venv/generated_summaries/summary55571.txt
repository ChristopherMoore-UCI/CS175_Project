He said the Knights support the university's advances in targeted cancer treatments -- shutting down cells that enable cancer without harming healthy cells. -- Nike co-founder Phil Knight stunned backers of the Oregon Health & Science University's cancer institute by announcing he and his wife would put up half of a billion-dollar push for cancer research. Knight made the announcement at a Friday night gala for 400 top supporters of the university's Knight Cancer Institute, which the couple previously had backed with $100 million in 2008, said Dr. Joseph Robertson, president of the university. He said university leaders were already at work Saturday planning a national fund-raising campaign to match the Knights' gift. The $500 million gift from Phil and Penny Knight is contingent on the Portland university's ability to raise $500 million from other donors over the next two years.
