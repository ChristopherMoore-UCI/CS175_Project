National Transportation Safety Board investigators have focused on pilot reliance on automated flight systems as a possible contributor to the crash, but a final report has not yet been released. Pilots and others in the aviation community are deeply disturbed by the mystery surrounding Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. Analysis: Some aviation experts have compared Flight 370 to the crash of Air France Flight 447 in 2009. Fact: The missing plane had suffered a clipped wing tip in the past, but Boeing repaired it, and the jet was safe to fly, said Malaysia Airlines CEO Ahmad Jauhari Yahya on Sunday. "If it was a terrorist incident...if this was part of a much larger or broader potential act, and for whatever reason, they wouldn't come forward at this point, but at a later time." Fact: So far, no debris field of plane wreckage has been linked to the 777, which would indicate a bomb blast.
