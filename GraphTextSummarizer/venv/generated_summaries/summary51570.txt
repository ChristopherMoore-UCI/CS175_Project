Despite being self-sustaining and completely free of debt -- unlike a host of other Spanish clubs -- Eibar faced the prospect of relegation to Spanish football's third tier.

The underdog's underdog Meanwhile arguably one of the biggest underdogs in the history of top level Spanish football started life in La Liga with a shock victory. The two met in a Basque derby on the first day of the season, but it was Eibar that snatched a historic 1-0 victory thanks to Javi Lara's first half free kick. The club ended last season empty handed under Gerado Martino.
