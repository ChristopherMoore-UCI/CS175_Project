But it's hoped that the designs on display at Quartier21 in the MuseumsQuartier, Vienna, Austria, will pique the interest of both fashionistas and tech heads. "(The exhibition) proves that intelligent fashion has long gone beyond being a vision of the future ..." says MuseumsQuartier director Christian Strasser. The Bubelle dress, designed by Lucy McRae for the Dutch electronics firm Philips, reveals the wearer's emotional state using biometric sensors that trigger different light and color displays. Other highlights include "Taiknam Hat," which detects radio waves and responds by activating motors that move feathers adorning the hat, and "Intimacy 2.0" -- a dress that becomes increasingly transparent based on the wearer's heart rate, according to its creators, Studio Roosegaarde. Another dress, "Paparazzi Lover," is perfect for Hollywood starlets -- incorporating 62 LED lights that light up when the dress detects photographers' flash bulbs -- reminding crowds just who the star is, according to its creator Ricardo O'Nascimento.
