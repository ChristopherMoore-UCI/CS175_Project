Al-Shabaab said it was behind the raid, one of several recent Mogadishu attacks for which the al Qaeda-linked group has claimed responsibility as it presses its campaign to turn Somalia into a fundamentalist Islamic state. "Fortunately, the prompt actions of the Somali National Army, assisted by AMISOM forces (African Union Mission in Somalia), quickly halted the attack," said government spokesman Mustafa Duhulow. The group aims to establish Islamic rule in Somalia, though it has carried out attacks in other African countries, as well. Al-Shabaab, designated a foreign terrorist organization by the United States, has a relationship with al Qaeda that goes back several years. The U.S. State Department issued a statement condemning the attack and praising AMISOM troops, which get U.S. support.
