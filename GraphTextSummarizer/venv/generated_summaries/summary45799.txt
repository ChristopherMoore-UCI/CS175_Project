The Western-backed rebels are deeply divided on whether to go and will announce a decision on January 17. The activist group said the deaths took place between January 3 and January 12. The violence came as the "Friends of Syria" group of foreign ministers, including U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, convened in Paris on Sunday in a last-ditch attempt to persuade the Syrian opposition to attend a peace conference in Geneva, Switzerland, at the end of January. Forces from the al Qaeda-affiliated Islamic State of Iraq and Syria have increasingly come into conflict with Free Syrian Army fighters and other hard-line factions opposing the Syrian regime, while ISIS attempts to impose its strict form of Islamic Sharia law on areas coming under its control in northern Syria. It condemned the presence of foreign fighters in Syria, "both those fighting with the regime such as Hezbollah and other Iranian backed forces, and those fighting within other extremist groups," and demanded their immediate withdrawal.
