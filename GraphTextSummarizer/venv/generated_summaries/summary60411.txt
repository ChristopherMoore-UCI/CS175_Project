"Providing financial services to the 2.5 billion people who are 'unbanked' could boost economic growth and opportunity for the world's poor," says World Bank Group President Robert B. Zoellick. -- Three quarters of the world's poor are living without a bank account, impeded by physical distance from banks and by bureaucratic roadblocks, according to a World Bank report. Mobile banking is especially popular in Kenya, where about 7 in 10 adults have access to mobile money services, according to Safaricom, a leading mobile network provider that offers money transfers via text messaging through its M-Pesa service. Mobile banking is becoming a popular alternative to money lenders among the poor, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. "I hope policy makers will use this research to help make sure everyone, everywhere, has access to financial services," Her Royal Highness Princess MÃ¡xima of the Netherlands and the UN Secretary General's Special Advocate for Inclusive Finance for Development said in a news release.
