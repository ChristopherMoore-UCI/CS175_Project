" While swimming's toughest stroke remains his favored discipline, le Clos has also struck gold in the individual 200m freestyle -- at the short-course world championships in Doha last year -- and the 400m medley (butterfly, backstroke, breaststroke and freestyle) at the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi. "I really, really hope that he and his team decide to swim in Rio, I really believe it will be great," le Clos told Reuters last year. "My dream was always to swim like Michael Phelps so when I raced against him in the final it was actually a crazy feeling," le Clos tells CNN's Human to Hero series. Phelps, who announced his retirement following the 2012 London Games, made a shock return to the pool last year although things haven't exactly gone to plan -- the "Baltimore Bullet" is serving a six-month ban imposed by USA Swimming after he was arrested for drink-driving last September. As a 12-year-old, le Clos had gazed into his television set at home in Durban watching in awe as Phelps, widely regarded as the greatest swimmer of all-time, won six Olympic gold medals at Athens in 2004.
