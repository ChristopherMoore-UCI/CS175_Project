-- First-term Democratic incumbent North Carolina Sen. Kay Hagan lost in a tight contest against GOP challenger Thom Tillis, according to a CNN projection. Neither candidate has enjoyed much popularity in the state according to an NBC News/Marist poll from last week showing Hagan's disapproval rating at 48 percent and Tillis' at 44 percent. Hagan launched aggressive attacks on Tillis' tenure in the state legislature, highlighting how his legislature cut unemployment benefits, slashed funding for education and prohibited the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. With 99% of precincts reporting their vote totals, Tillis had 49 % to Hagan's 47%. He worked to nationalize the race by tying Hagan to President Obama, who suffers from high disapproval ratings in the Tar Heel state even though he -- along with Hagan -- were victorious there in 2008.
