It was a doubly bad day for France coach Didier Deschamps as Lyon midfielder Clement Grenier's World Cup was ended before it began due to a thigh injury. "You cannot copy them exactly but Morgan Schneiderlin is the player most in the profile of Clement Grenier, and Remy Cabella is the most in the profile of Franck Ribery." Ribery is the latest high-profile player to be ruled out of football's showpiece event. Colombia striker Radamel Falcao failed in his bid to recover from a knee injury, while reigning world champions Spain will be without the services of Ribery's Bayern teammate Thiago and Barcelona goalkeeper Victor Valdes. "(Ribery) stopped with a strong pain," Deschamps, who captained France to World Cup glory in 1998, told reporters. France is the latest team to suffer a hammer blow after playmaker Franck Ribery failed to overcome a back injury.
