The latest update comes from Barnes & Noble, which added an LED-based "GlowLight" to its Nook Simple Touch e-reader. Overall, Barnes & Noble Nook Simple Touch with GlowLight is a winner. Still, what truly sets the latest Nook Simple Touch apart from all other E Ink-based e-readers is the patent-pending GlowLight. If I were buying a new E Ink reader right now, I'd go for the Barnes & Noble Simple Touch with GlowLight. Nook Simple Touch's GlowLight is adjustable, via a touch-screen menu selection.
