What's needed is to end illegal immigration by creating ways for needed workers to come legally -- creating worker visas and establishing a system that allows employers who can't find enough willing and able Americans to connect easily and quickly with lawful immigrants. It's fixing the legal system so it works for the future -- for immigrants and the U.S. economy. And there are virtually no permanent visas to be had for unskilled workers. Don't get me wrong: The goal of reform is not to increase the overall number of unskilled immigrants entering the country. Exactly what is it about the broken immigration system that produced this vast underground world of workers and families -- a population the size of Ohio?
