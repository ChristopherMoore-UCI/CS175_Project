It had been to Myanmar, Pakistan and Kazakhstan, and was due to visit Laos and Vietnam after Indonesia, said the Russian news agency RIA Novosti. The plane was on its second demonstration flight Wednesday when it lost contact with air controllers at Jakarta's Halim Perdanakusuma Airport. President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono of Indonesia said in a brief televised address Thursday that there was a strong possibility that the plane had crashed into Mount Salak, a volcano south of Jakarta. Two helicopters were immediately sent out to search for the plane but had to return to their bases due to strong winds and unpredictable weather. Russia's state-run United Aircraft Corp. said the defect did not affect passenger safety.
