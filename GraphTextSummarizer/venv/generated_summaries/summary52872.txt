-- Gunmen stopped a bus near Beirut, Lebanon, in the early hours of Friday, boarded it and kidnapped two Turkish pilots, Turkey's foreign ministry said. They were riding the bus from Rafic Hariri International Airport to their hotel when the assailants in two vehicles stopped it, Lebanon's state-run National News Agency reported. Other employees aboard the bus made it safely to the hotel and are to head back to Turkey later Friday, the foreign ministry said. Reports on the number of attackers varied from four to eight. The pilots work for Turkish Airlines.
