And sitting in the half dark, with my own two children asleep in the next room, it occurs to me that the details of parental devotion are nothing you can quite put into words. I wandered the house to be wherever he was: on the carpet at his feet while he rattled ice in a glass and shared pretzel Goldfish with me; on a kitchen stool while he soft-boiled eggs; flung across the bed with my chin in my palms while he emptied the pockets of his suit -- subway tokens, handfuls of change, a clacking box of mints. It's between "Atlanta tickets" and "taxes," on a list that also includes such excellent questions as "Sicily?" What a relief to raise a dog after the worry and complexity of children!
