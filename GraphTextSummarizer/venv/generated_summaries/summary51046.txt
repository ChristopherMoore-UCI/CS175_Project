In 1995, France rejoined NATO's military committee, which advises NATO's political authorities on military policy and strategy and provides guidance on military matters to NATO's strategic commanders. While France was still not a part of the military command, it contributed troops and funding to NATO activities, including KFOR in Kosovo and ISAF in Afghanistan. France has continued, however, to contribute troops to NATO missions and to participate in NATO's political bodies. Some 5,000 French troops are currently committed to NATO operations and France contributes 13.8 percent of its military budget to the alliance, according to the French Foreign Ministry. -- France will soon rejoin NATO's military command more than 40 years after it left, French President Nicolas Sarkozy said Tuesday.
