The bear's name comes from the system of identifying bears from that Italian population, with M standing for males and F for females, said WWF spokesman Philip Gehri. The WWF advises that people in areas where bears may be present safeguard livestock, put garbage in bear-proof trashcans and protect beehives. M13 "was in no way a problem bear," she said, adding that wildlife officers should have continued efforts to make him more frightened of humans. Joanna Schoenenberger, an expert on bears at the WWF, said it was far too soon to shoot M13. The risk remains that other bears might follow in M13's paw prints and stray into Switzerland's Grisons area.
