According to Nestle CEO Paul Bulcke, the move strengthens relationships with suppliers in the long-term, and is worth the short term hit on working capital. Bulcke says Nestle is focused on long term gains, such as the relationship with suppliers. "We should never compromise the long term for a short term gain," Bulcke says. He says the company has financed around $40 million of micro-loans to farms. Thinking short term is "deadly," he says.
