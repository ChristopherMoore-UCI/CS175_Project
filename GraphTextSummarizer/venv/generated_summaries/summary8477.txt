The father and son are not named in the affidavit, which refers to the father as "H.P." and to his 17-year-old son as "N.P." The affidavit says that the plot began Thursday when Arriaza told her son she wanted to take him to Wal-Mart to purchase an Apple iPhone. According to the affidavit, Ponce said Arriaza came up with the idea to have herself kidnapped, along with her son, to get money from her ex-husband. The mother, Alejandra Arriaza, her boyfriend, Angel Ponce, and his nephew, Joel Boza, were charged Tuesday with federal kidnapping counts. The kidnapper placed thick tape over the son's eyes and instructed his mother to drive to a mobile home in southwest Miami, where a second person, who introduced himself as "El Negro," was waiting. During another phone call, Arriaza, who is the father's ex-wife, told him that kidnappers were burning their son's feet.
