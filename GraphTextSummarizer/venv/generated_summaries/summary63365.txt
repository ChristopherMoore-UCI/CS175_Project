Details of the crime, as laid out at trial and provided by Georgia Attorney General Sam Olens, are as follows: Owen and Kelly Gissendaner planned the murder for months. She later checked to make sure her husband was dead, then Owen followed her in Douglas Gissendaner's car to retrieve a can of kerosene that Kelly Gissendaner had left for him. Douglas Gissendaner also spent the evening away from home, going to a church friend's house to work on cars. An autopsy determined the cause of death to be knife wounds to the neck, but the medical examiner couldn't tell which strike killed Douglas Gissendaner because animals had devoured the skin and soft tissue on the right side of his neck. Currently the only woman on Georgia's death row, Gissendaner could be the second woman in the state's history to be executed.
