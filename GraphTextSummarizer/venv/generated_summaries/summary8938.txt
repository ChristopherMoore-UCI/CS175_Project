-- Olympic gymnast Shawn Johnson, who announced over the weekend she would retire because of recurring knee problems, said Monday the decision was one of the hardest of her life and that she thinks its impact hasn't truly hit her. "Having that period of my life over with is surreal. Even though she won't be able to compete at the Olympics this year, Johnson told Burnett she still plans to go to London to cheer on her teammates. Asked by Burnett what she plans to do next, Johnson said she will take a year off and then hopefully start college. It just came to a point where my body couldn't take anymore and kept telling me I had to face the science," she told CNN's Erin Burnett. Johnson, 20, won one gold and three silver medals during the 2008 Olympics in Beijing.
