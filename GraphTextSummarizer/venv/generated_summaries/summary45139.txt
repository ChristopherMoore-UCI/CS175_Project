Michael Jackson's estate provides $86,000 a month for Katherine Jackson and her grandchildren. The money given them by the Michael Jackson estate is in addition to the maintenance of the home -- which is owned by the estate -- in Encino, California, where Katherine Jackson lives with her grandchildren, the papers said. Katherine Jackson was granted custody of her son's three children soon after Jackson's June 25 death. She told CNN the family was aware of people posing as Jackson children with Twitter accounts. The petitions filed by Branca and McClain in July, and later approved by Judge Mitchell Beckloff, outlined $26,804 in monthly expenses for Katherine Jackson.
