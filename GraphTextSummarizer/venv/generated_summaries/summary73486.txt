The concert, a benefit and tribute to the late Atlantic Records chief Ahmet Ertegun, was the first full Zeppelin show by Page, singer Robert Plant and bassist John Paul Jones since the death of drummer John Bonham in 1980. When asked if the movie marks the end of Zeppelin, once and for all, Jones -- who is busy writing an opera and collaborating with Robyn Hitchcock and the Norwegian group Supersilent -- responds, "When I move house, I never look back at the house and go, 'Oh, that's the last moment I'll see there.' "With Led Zeppelin, it has always been that mystique of how the music is done -- how it works, why it works," Page says on the phone from London a couple of weeks before Celebration Day's worldwide theatrical premiere on October 17th. "The thing about Led Zeppelin was that it was always four musicians at the top of their game, but they could play like a band," Page says. And I have to tell you, the rehearsals were all quite different," Page says, "so much in that Zeppelin spirit and character."
