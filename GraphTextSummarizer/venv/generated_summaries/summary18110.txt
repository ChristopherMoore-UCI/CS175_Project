Google Glass, worn like regular glasses, has a high-resolution display and lets wearers use voice commands to shoot photos or videos and access features like e-mail, text messaging, Google Maps, Google search and a handful of other apps. -- The mystery barge in San Francisco Bay is indeed a Google project, and houses a fancy, floating showroom for Google Glass and other products, a CNN affiliate is reporting. The station cited "multiple sources" including at least one who has been aboard the barge, and said it was dreamed up at Google X, the company's secret facility where engineers have cooked up projects like Google Glass and a self-driving car. This week, Google announced current testers may invite up to three friends, as well as a planned rollout of a new version of Google Glass. The facility is constructed from interchangeable shipping containers and is designed to be disassembled and transported via barge or train to other locations, a source said.
