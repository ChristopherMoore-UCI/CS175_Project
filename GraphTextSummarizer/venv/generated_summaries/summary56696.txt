Saudi King Abdullah made more than one noteable appointment to his council of ministers. The religious police patrol shopping malls and streets, enforcing religious laws such as ones requiring women to keep their heads covered and refrain from talking to men who aren't their relatives. The religious police were in the background, and among young girls in particular, headscarves were gone and lipstick was in bright abundance. The king is well into his 80s and inherited many ministers and other top officials almost as old as him. -- What could be bigger than the appointment of the first female minister in Saudi Arabia?
