-- Young German driver Nico Hulkenberg is looking for a new Formula One team after failing to agree a contract extension with Williams, the motorsport's official website reported on Monday. "'First, I would like to thank Nico for his hard work this year, and before that in preparing himself for Formula One," team boss Frank Williams told his outfit's official website. Williams finished the season in sixth place overall, repeating last year's effort, despite not scoring any points at the final race in Abu Dhabi on Sunday. At Williams we have for many years tried to bring new talent into the sport, and we are convinced that Nico will go on to great things. " His agent Willi Weber, who also represents seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher, said the 2009 GP2 Series winner would remain in motorsport's elite class next year.
