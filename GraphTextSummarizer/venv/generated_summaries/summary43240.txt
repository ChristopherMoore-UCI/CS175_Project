Prominent Chinese-Australian artist Guo Jian has been detained by Chinese authorities ahead of the 25th anniversary of the Tiananmen crackdown, according to friends. Guo was taken from his home in eastern Beijing on Sunday night, and contacted friends by text message to let them know that he had been arrested. "The Australian Embassy in Beijing has contacted Chinese authorities to seek further information on the reported detention of Mr Guo Jian and to underline our strong interest in the matter," a spokesperson for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said. Friends contacted by text message Artist Melanie Wang told the Sydney Morning Herald she called Guo after receiving a text message and he told her he'd been taken to a detention center. Guo was an active participant in the 1989 demonstrations, which lasted weeks and culminated in PLA troops opening fire on a largely student crowd which had occupied the central Beijing landmark.
