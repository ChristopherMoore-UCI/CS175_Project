-- New Zealand captain and key forward Richie McCaw has been passed fit for Sunday's Rugby World Cup semifinal clash with neighbors Australia in Auckland. Australia, coached by former All Blacks fullback Robbie Deans, will have to become the first team to beat New Zealand at Eden Park in 17 years to reach a fourth World Cup final. " Australia beat New Zealand 25-20 when the two sides met in the Tri-Nations in August, and the Wallabies have won their last two World Cup contests -- in the semifinals in 1991 and 2003. James Hook replaces the injured Rhys Priestland at flyhalf for what will be his 58th international cap as Wales look to reach their first World Cup final. Wales have reached the last four for the first time since 1987, and coach Warren Gatland has made one change to the team which recorded a 22-10 win over Ireland in the quarterfinals ahead of Saturday's semi with France.
