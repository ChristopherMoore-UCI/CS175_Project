"I think it's clear that Mr. Laurent Gbagbo does not want to leave office," Ouattara told CNN, noting that representatives of the Economic Community of West African States and the African Union had tried to persuade him to leave earlier this week. -- African regional authorities are prepared to remove from office self-proclaimed President Laurent Gbagbo, who election observers say lost last November's presidential runoff but has refused to step down, Ivory Coast's President-elect Alassane Ouattara said Thursday. "There is no question but that the election in the Ivory Coast was stolen by President Gbagbo and those around him," Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Johnnie Carson told reporters Wednesday. Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga, the African Union envoy for the mediation effort who met earlier this week with Gbagbo, said the embattled leader was open to a meeting with Ouattara. Ouattara told CNN Thursday that he welcomes a proposal for direct negotiations with Gbagbo -- on the condition that Gbagbo recognize Ouattara as president.
