The state sent out 348 retail marijuana licenses to prospective retail marijuana establishments on Monday, including 136 marijuana stores, 178 marijuana cultivation facilities, 31 products manufacturing facilities and three marijuana testing facilities. The state's retail marijuana licensing process includes fingerprint-based background checks and financial checks. -- Retail marijuana licenses issued by Colorado -- the first in the nation -- should arrive in the mail by the end of this week, according to the state Department of Revenue's Marijuana Enforcement Division. In November, Colorado voters resoundingly supported taxing recreational marijuana. But strong support came from the fact that the nonpartisan Colorado Legislative Council projected it would generate nearly $70 million in additional state tax revenue next year.
