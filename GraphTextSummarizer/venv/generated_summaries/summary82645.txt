Del Potro has already confirmed he will play in the Thailand Open in September, but now he faces a race against time to regain full fitness before the U.S. Open begins. -- Juan Martin Del Potro has begun training again, raising hopes he may be fit to defend his U.S Open title at Flushing Meadows later this month. He denied a rumor last month that he was already back on the court, but a picture posted on Del Potro's Twitter account showed the 21-year-old practicing again - racquet in hand. " Del Potro had been battling with his injury for a long time before opting to go under the knife after his fourth round defeat by Marian Cilic at the Australian Open. The Argentinean has been out of action since the Australian Open in January after having surgery on his right wrist but was included in the list of entrants for the New York tournament, which starts on August 30.
