-- Four-star Army Gen. Peter Chiarelli -- the No. 2 general in the U.S. Army -- says he is absolutely not offended that Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett mistook him for a waiter at a fancy Washington dinner this week and asked him for a glass of wine. The incident was first reported on the website Daily Caller, which said Chiarelli, who oversees the Army's programs to help ill and wounded troops from the war, went ahead and got Jarrett a glass of wine. She apologized and will come to the house for dinner if a date can be worked out in March," Chiarelli wrote in an e-mail. Chiarelli, a veteran of Iraq, wears a chestful of medals, which Jarrett apparently did not see. It could have happened to anybody, Chiarelli tells CNN.
