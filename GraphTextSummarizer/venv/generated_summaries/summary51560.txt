According to an analysis from the Guttmacher Institute, half the women in our nation live in states hostile to abortion access; and in 2011 alone, states enacted a record 92 provisions seeking to restrict women's access to abortion. On the other hand, countries with the lowest abortion rates tend to have more supportive abortion policies and strong policy support for contraception. Evidence shows time and again that banning abortion does not make it go away -- it merely leads to more unsafe abortions and more women dying. By contrast, abortion in the United States is incredibly safe: Fewer than 0.3% of women experience complications that require hospitalization. We need to protect these investments from budget cuts to ensure that women everywhere can plan and space their children's births and prevent unintended pregnancy and disease.
