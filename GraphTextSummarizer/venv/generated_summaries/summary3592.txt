The city has committed to tie infrastructure development to carbon reduction, including "area greening" in residential areas. This has enabled intelligent transport management systems and a plan for energy efficiencies that could cut carbon emissions by 19% by 2030. A new university campus, modelled on South Korean tech cities, would develop elite engineering, energy and biotechnology projects, complete with extensive education and research facilities. The special zone uses advanced monitoring systems to manage energy and water, with buildings architecturally designed to maximize efficiency. But by the most popular criteria; sustainable energy and development, open data and government, and integrated information, communications and technology (ICT) serving wide areas of a city, these ultra-modern hubs are on the rise.
