-- Deputies in Arizona's Maricopa County will leave white wooden crosses at desert locations to mark the spots where immigrants die as they try to enter the country from Mexico. Arpaio is known for his strict approach to immigration enforcement in Maricopa County and has been at odds with the federal government over immigration policy. He said the crosses, made by inmates, also will serve as landmarks so people in distress in the desert can give their location when they call for help. In May, a federal judge agreed with the Justice Department that his deputies were illegally detaining Hispanics on pretexts to try to find undocumented people. Arpaio has said he will appeal the judge's ruling, which stopped a program of traffic sweeps.
