-- The deaths of four people this week at a Florida mansion leased out by tennis star James Blake were murders and a suicide, with a man shooting his wife and teenage children in the head and setting the home on fire before shooting himself, authorities said Friday. Authorities have identified the dead as Darrin Campbell, his wife Kimberly Campbell, and their teenage children, Megan and Colin, Hillsborough County sheriff's Col. Donna Lusczynski told reporters. Campbell used an accelerant to feed the fire and also placed fireworks throughout the home, Lusczynski said Friday. Campbell bought fireworks and cans of gasoline on Sunday and bought more gasoline from two stores on Tuesday, Lusczynski said. Blake, 34, born in Yonkers, New York, starred at Harvard before breaking into professional tennis.
