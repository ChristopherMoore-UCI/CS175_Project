Mexico coach Javier Aguirre dropped young Barcelona midfielder Jonathan Santos from his final 23-man World Cup squad along with home-based defenders Juan Carlos Valenzuela and Adrian Aldrete. Inter's Champions League final hero Diego Milito was selected despite playing a limited role in the qualifiers, and central defender Walter Samuel has the chance to feature at his second World Cup after missing out in 2006. Barrios, who has a Paraguayan mother, was given citizenship in April and scored in World Cup warm-up matches against the Republic of Ireland and the Ivory Coast. Veteran striker Martin Palermo, 36, has the chance to play at his first World Cup, being one of five Argentina-based players selected by the 1986 title-winner Maradona. "Adriano was given several opportunities," the 1994 World Cup winner said.
