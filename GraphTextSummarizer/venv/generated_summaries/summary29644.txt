A Swiss court has published its findings following an investigation into alleged illegal payments made by FIFA marketing partner International Sports and Leisure (ISL) to former FIFA president Joao Havelange and former executive committee member Ricardo Teixeira. -- FIFA president Sepp Blatter has admitted that he did know about alleged bribe payments made to former FIFA executives, but insists he didn't think they were illegal at the time. The report found that Havelange had received at least 1.5 million Swiss francs ($1.53 million) and Ricardo Teixeira was paid at least CHF 12.4 million ($12.64 million) from marketing partner ISL. "The president is trying to defend acts that would not be tolerated anywhere else." FIFA has been keen to point to its active involvement in the case, declaring on Wednesday in a response to the document's publication: "The decision by the Federal Court is in line with what FIFA and the FIFA president have been advocating since 2011, when world football's governing body announced its commitment to the publication of the ISL non-prosecution order." Blatter was FIFA's general secretary at the time of the alleged irregularities, and in that role he co-signed agreements with the marketing group.
