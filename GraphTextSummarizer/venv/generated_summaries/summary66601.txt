-- After Venus Williams beat Caroline Wozniacki at the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships, it looked as if a first all Williams tennis final in five years was on the cards. " Venus Williams has been slowed by Sjogren's Syndrome, injuries and age but the elder Williams continues to flourish in Dubai, winning her last 14 matches. The Frenchwoman stunned a sluggish Serena Williams in the second semifinal Friday, meaning a Williams versus Williams clash for silverware -- they haven't met in a finale since the year-end championships in 2009 -- will have to wait. It was Serena Williams' first tournament since a back injury hampered the 17-time grand slam champion at the Australian Open, and she accepted a wildcard from organizers to fend off the boredom from just practicing. Cornet, though, trails Venus Williams 3-0 in their head-to-heads.
