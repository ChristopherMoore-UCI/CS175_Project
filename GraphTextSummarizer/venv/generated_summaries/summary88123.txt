Sony favors a la carte over "the Netflix model," Aragon said, because it can offer new films close to when they are released on Blu-ray. The Sony tablet, which is set to debut early next month, will have a version of Video Unlimited, and the iPhone app will eventually include the ability to watch videos offline, he said. "We want you to be able to search and browse in a nonlinear way," Michael Aragon, a vice president for Sony Network Entertainment, said in an interview. The overall design looks a lot like the Metro style Microsoft is using in Windows Phone 7 and Windows 8. Music Unlimited and Video Unlimited will live under the Sony Entertainment Network umbrella, and they may eventually be joined by the PlayStation Network, Aragon said.
