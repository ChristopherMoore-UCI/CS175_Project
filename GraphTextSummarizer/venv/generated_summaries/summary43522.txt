"What we saw in court today was ridiculous," said Adel Fahmy, brother of jailed Al Jazeera English producer Mohamed Fahmy. -- Prosecutors presented evidence at a hearing this week for three Al Jazeera English journalists accused of terrorist activity in Egypt, but they did little to explain why everyday broadcast equipment and the defendants' personal belongings would implicate them in any crime. Detained Al Jazeera journalists appear in court as trial opens Among the evidence the state claims to have is video of news reports, allegedly fabricated by the Al Jazeera journalists. The case comes amid a crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood after the ouster of Egypt's first democratically elected president, Mohamed Morsy.
