In July, Regina Egea, a senior Christie aide, told the legislative panel investigating Bridgegate that she texted Christie during a key committee hearing last year and did not recall getting a response from the governor. " The governor's office also released a statement from Randy Mastro, the attorney Christie hired to do an internal investigation. "The Committee has finally acknowledged what we reported nine months ago -- namely, that there is not a shred of evidence Governor Christie knew anything about the GWB lane realignment beforehand or that any current member of his staff was involved in that decision," he said. But phone records show that it was Christie who texted Egea before the two traded a dozen messages during the hearing, according to a copy of the report obtained by CNN. But according to the report, Egea's phone records show that Christie texted her during the officials' testimony and the texting continued throughout the hearing.
