In a nod to public criticism, the ruling Communist Party's disciplinary arm in Shanghai also confirmed on Wednesday that several Huangpu district officials -- including the fired Communist boss and his deputy -- violated Party regulations by wining and dining for free at a high-end Japanese restaurant on the Bund shortly before the stampede. But Zhou, Shanghai's vice mayor, said that, after careful risk assessments, officials have green-lighted most planned events in the city for the upcoming Chinese New Year celebrations in February -- though the popular lantern festival at the ancient City Temple won't go ahead. After Chinese President Xi Jinping warned officials about public safety following the stampede, authorities across the country have rushed to cancel large gatherings, ranging from pop concerts to shopping festivals. An investigating team said the stampede happened at 11:35 p.m. local time when huge crowds trying to reach the iconic riverfront promenade, known as the Bund, clashed with others attempting to leave on a staircase. A New Year's Eve stampede in Shanghai that killed 36 people and injured 49 others was "totally preventable," local officials said Wednesday.
