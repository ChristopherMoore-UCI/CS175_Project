Even scrolling through the complete list of Fredskov's marathons on her website is exhausting. But Fredskov says her decision was empowering, helping to reinforce her viewpoint that she could retain an important element of control over her disease. A glutton for punishment, Fredskov decided to run not one but two marathons on her 365th day, spending a total of 10 hours and 45 minutes pounding the roads. It consists of one year, 366 marathons, 15,442 kilometers and 20 pairs of running shoes. She drank two liters of soda a day to keep her body infused with sugar, got through a pair of running shoes every 18 days, and maintained an average time of around five hours.
