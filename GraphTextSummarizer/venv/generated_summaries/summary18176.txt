-- Three bomb blasts in northwest Pakistan killed four security personnel Tuesday and destroyed an oil tanker carrying fuel for NATO forces in Afghanistan, police told CNN. About an hour north of Bannu, a roadside bomb in the outskirts of Peshawar killed two policemen and injured two others as they drove by in their police van, police official Amjad Khan told CNN. More than half of the supplies for NATO forces in Afghanistan travels through Pakistan. One of the bombs was planted along a road and exploded as a military convoy drove by, said senior police official Muhammad Iftikhar Khan. All five tankers were carrying fuel for NATO troops in Afghanistan.
