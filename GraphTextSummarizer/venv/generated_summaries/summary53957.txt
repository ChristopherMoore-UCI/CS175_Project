Hopefully, it will be my World Cup, Argentina's World Cup and that we hit the ground running and play up to peoples' expectations and win the World Cup," Messi said. Argentina are not among the favorites after struggling to impress under Maradona, and Messi admits that European champions Spain, five-time World Cup winners Brazil and 1966 titleholders England are the teams to beat. He played in all 18 of Argentina's World Cup qualifiers but netted just four times as La Albiceleste struggled to reach South Africa by snatching South America's fourth and final automatic place in the last round. Messi acknowledges that Barcelona's free-flowing style under coach Pep Guardiola gives him more chance to shine than with Argentina, where he has a different role. Maradona has had well-documented troubles with drugs and his party lifestyle, even being kicked out of the 1994 World Cup, but Messi maintains a much lower profile off the pitch.
