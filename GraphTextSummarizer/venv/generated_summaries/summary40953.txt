He then woke up his friend, Navy Petty Officer Bryan McGee, who according to Jones, immediately left the room. Punishment by Captain's Mast could have resulted in loss of rank, forfeiture of pay, or jeopardized Jones' top secret security clearance, Myers said. Navy Petty Officer Stephen Jones, a student at the Naval Nuclear Power Training Command in Charleston, South Carolina, told CNN that on the night of February 5, a male sailor stopped by to watch the CW TV show "Vampire Diaries." An investigation was launched, ending with the Command attempting to punish Jones and McGee by a "Captain's Mast," a non-judicial procedure meant to avoid a court martial. But the Navy is proceeding with discharging Jones, charging him with "willful failure to exhibit professional conduct," Jones' lawyer, Greg Myers said.
