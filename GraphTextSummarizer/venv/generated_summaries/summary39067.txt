"Mr. Putin remains to be one of the most popular politicians in the country, probably the most popular politician in the country, and it's quite natural that he's receiving the majority of the votes," Ponomarev, of the A Just Russia party, told CNN from Moscow's Red Square. Critics have long accused Putin of undermining Russia's democratic institutions during his years in power, and accusations of voter fraud in December's parliamentary elections have led to unprecedented public protests against his government. Kasparov, who served as a poll watcher in his Moscow neighborhood, said Putin's supporters "simply added new voters to the register using so-called supplementary voter rolls. Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called for unity as he appeared headed for a third term as president, declaring victory in an "open and honest fight" in Sunday's election. But chess champion-turned-opposition activist Garry Kasparov accused Putin's supporters of "massive fraud" early Monday by packing the polls with additional voters.
