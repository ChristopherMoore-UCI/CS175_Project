In Ukraine, Kiev's Olympic Stadium has the honor of the final, while the Donbass Arena in Donetsk, the Metalist Stadium in Kharkiv and the brand new Lviv Arena will also stage games. " All four airports in Ukraine's host cities are being revamped, while a series of new hotel developments have also been built -- 67 in Donetsk alone. The overall cost has been $27 billion and has made Poland the largest construction site in Europe." Yury Gromnitsky, head of the press office for the vice-prime minister of Ukraine, told CNN: "The Ukraine has invested $750 million in sport infrastructure to host Euro 2012, not including the cost of the airport and transportation infrastructure. A high-speed rail link will be in operation to ferry fans between host cities, and new road networks have also been built. The draw for the co-hosted tournament will be held in the Ukrainian capital Kiev, and football fans across the continent will learn the fate of their beloved nations.
