At the G20 summit in Australia, President Obama said that he had not changed his mind about U.S. ground forces when it comes to Iraq. "If we discovered that ISIL had gotten possession of a nuclear weapon, and we had to run an operation to get it out of their hands, then yes, you can anticipate that not only would Chairman Dempsey recommend me sending U.S. ground troops to get that weapon out of their hands, but I would order it." Obama critics Hagel declined to answer whether any of the top leadership of the Khorasan Group have been killed by U.S. airstrikes in Syria, but said the group still poses a serious threat. "There are always circumstances, in which the United States might need to deploy ground troops," Obama said. He still does not plan to deploy them, and Dempsey "has not advised me that I should be sending U.S. troops to fight," he said. In blistering criticism of President Barack Obama and the Pentagon, McCain said, "No one outside the Joint Chiefs of Staff believes we have a strategy" to defeat and degrade ISIS, as set forth by  the administration.
