"Tonight, it looks like a few people decided to exercise civil disobedience and have been arrested." Austin police arrested four more people Sunday afternoon, according to officer Dennis Farris. That's when they (police) started pulling people out arresting them," Occupy Austin member Ronnie Garza told CNN affiliate YNN. A Twitter post from the group as police entered the park said, "This is what a police state looks like." Police also arrested 38 people in Austin, Texas, who had set up a table with food and other items outside City Hall two days after the city issued rules saying food tables at the event must be put away between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. Austin Police Chief Aft Acevedo told YNN police were doing their jobs. On Friday, police said 51 demonstrators in San Diego, California, were arrested for various charges, including encroachment, unlawful assembly, illegal lodging and/or some form of obstruction of officers.
