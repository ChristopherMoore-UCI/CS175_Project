For the second time in days, New York police -- joined by officers from departments across the country -- buried one of their own Sunday. Officers from around the country joined local officers paying tribute. There were throngs of police officers -- many who had traveled from across the country to pay respects in New York. Before Liu's service, Police Commissioner William Bratton had asked that officers refrain from acting disrespectfully. Officer Liu "believed in the possibility ... of a city free of fear," Bratton said, and is the type of "officer that we want ... and the type that we have." De Blasio praised Liu for his love of family.
