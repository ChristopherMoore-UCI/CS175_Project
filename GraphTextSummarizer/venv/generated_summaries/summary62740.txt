" But Dr. Edward Livingston, a Texas surgeon who also has helped adolescents lose weight, said surgery for teenagers can be risky. Maria pleaded with her mother to find a doctor who would perform weight-loss surgery on teenagers. Dr. Evan Nadler, who started a program for adolescent surgery at National Children's Hospital in Washington, said he felt "compelled" to help Maria. She said, "Doctors have told me for years that if I keep gaining weight I'm not going to see 18 and that has terrified me. "So I felt that withholding a known therapy that works based on her age alone was really almost unethical." Between 2000 and 2003, some 800 teenagers went under the knife to lose weight, Nadler said.
