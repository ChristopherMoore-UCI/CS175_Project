"God has given me a peace about Katie," Nolan's father, David Nolan, told reporters Wednesday. "It was our hope that we might get a window today to take a last look," Clackamas County, Oregon, Sheriff Craig Roberts told reporters. " Anthony Vietti, 24; Luke Gullberg, 26; and Katie Nolan, 29, set out about 1 a.m. Friday on what was to have been a fairly easy "semi-technical" hike in which they would have descended the south side of the mountain, Sheriff's Deputy Scott Meyers has said. -- The search for two missing hikers on Oregon's Mount Hood has moved from a search operation into a recovery operation, authorities said Wednesday. Vietti's home is Longview, Washington; Nolan's is Portland, Oregon.
