I contend that a lot of perceived iPhone issues have more to do with AT&T than they do with Apple. I'm not sure you could make it through an entire working day without attaching an external battery pack to your iPhone, but Apple's found a balance in performance and power with the 3GS. The only iPhone killer on the market today...is a newer iPhone. Yes, believe me when I say that you'll notice a difference in speed (in direct comparison to the iPhone and iPhone 3G models). So, what else has Apple given the world in the iPhone 3GS?
