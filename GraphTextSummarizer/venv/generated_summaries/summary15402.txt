On Tuesday night, the student group that's tasked with selecting commencement speakers met and voted to withdraw Maher's invitation. "While Mr. Maher has the right to speak whenever and wherever he likes, he does not have the right to have his hate-filled views honored and tacitly endorsed by a prestigious university," said Zahra Billoo, of the group's San Francisco chapter. "Bill Maher is a blatant bigot and racist who has no respect for the values UC Berkeley students and administration stand for," the petition says. -- The controversy over having TV host Bill Maher speak at the University of California Berkeley has taken another turn. "The UC Berkeley administration cannot and will not accept this decision, which appears to have been based solely on Mr. Maher's opinions and beliefs, which he conveyed through constitutionally protected speech," the school said in a statement.
