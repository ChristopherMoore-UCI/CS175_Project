At the time of his dismissal, Lattera was a camp counselor and held the rank of Life Scout, which is one step below the organizationÂ¹s highest rank of Eagle Scout. The national scout policy that prohibits the hiring of gay men puts the local chapter in violation of the city charter and an ordinance outlawing discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and other grounds. The local chapter, Cradle of Liberty Council, was told by the city to pay $200,000 a year to lease the building or vacate the headquarters that have been located on city land since 1928. The lawsuit contends the city's ultimatum violates their First Amendment rights and that the city's position is unconstitutional and violates the organization's right to free speech and equal protection. "I broke down and cried," said Lattera, now 25, adding the scouts opened his eyes to the world around him and taught him life skills.
