Chinese officials who accompanied Chinese President Xi Jinping on a visit to Tanzania last year went on a buying spree for illegal elephant ivory, an environmental activist group has claimed. The two traders claimed that a fortnight before the state visit, Chinese buyers began purchasing thousands of kilos of ivory, the report says. He said the price of ivory doubled during the Chinese visit to $700 per kilo. The EIA report highlights the threat posed to Tanzania's elephant population by illegal poaching -- and warns that they are being "slaughtered en masse" to satisfy a growing demand for ivory. Another Mwenge dealer who spoke to undercover reporters in 2010 made similar claims about the entourage that accompanied past Chinese President Hu Jintao to Tanzania in 2009, the report said.
