The bright streaks you see are "interplanetary dust" burning up as it collides with our atmosphere at about 133,000 mph, according to NASA micrometeoroid expert Diego Janches. While the meteor show is entertainment for most, it is a research opportunity for Janches and other NASA scientists. "The small meteoroids feed the atmosphere with all these extra materials," Janches said in a NASA.com posting. The last close encounter with the comet was 20 years ago, but it left grains of dust in its wake. " "Each such fragment is approximately the size of a dime, but the more constant, sporadic meteoroids have been around much longer, breaking down over time into tiny fragments only about as wide as a piece of human hair," according to NASA.gov.
