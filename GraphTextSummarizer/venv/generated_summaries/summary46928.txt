"The Big Fun Sexy Sex Book" is a fun and innovative guide to rejuvenating your sex life and libido, co-written with renowned sex therapist Ian Kerner (who writes about sex on CNN's medical news blog, The Chart). I thought it was a great idea because I feel like not enough people talk about sex, we feel shame about it. There's so much taboo in this country around sex, yet it's something that is really the glue that holds a marriage together. If you don't have sex you just want to walk away half the time, so you really need to make the effort. I never thought I'd write a book about sex.
