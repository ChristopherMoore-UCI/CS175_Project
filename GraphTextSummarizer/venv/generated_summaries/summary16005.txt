Aaron Gregory Lucas, 32, pleaded guilty to four counts of sexual assault on a child, three counts of enticement, two counts of indecent exposure and one count of kidnapping, according to a spokeswoman for the 4th Judicial District Attorney's Office in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Defendants with an identical twin have sometimes accused the sibling of being the real culprit to try to create reasonable doubt and seek acquittal, but the finger-pointing isn't a sure-fire strategy, said CNN legal analyst Danny Cevallos, who's also a criminal defense attorney. Aaron Lucas is a decorated Army officer assigned to Fort Carson in Colorado Springs. "There is no evidence to suggest that the twin brother of Aaron Lucas was in any way responsible for these crimes," said prosecutor Jennie Darby. In an abrupt 180, a Colorado soldier who tried to blame his identical twin brother for sex crimes pleaded guilty Tuesday to those same charges.
