Dr Bob Kentridge, a member of the Cognitive Neuroscience Research Unit at Durham University, in England, told CNN, "Even if you find differences in the brains of people with different leadership abilities, it's very difficult to say if that difference is just related to leadership. What really excites him is the possibility of brain training and improving leadership skills. " Balthazard says that although he has identified brain profiles for antecedents to leadership, he stresses that before he can produce a set of exercises designed to improve leadership itself, he must develop a "leadership norm" -- a standard for what makes a good leader. "You might change things that contribute to leadership, for example people might learn to stay calmer in conflict situations, but is that the same as saying you're improving the leadership center of your brain?" So, what's inside the brain of a born leader? "There's zero correlation between IQ and leadership," Balthazard told CNN.
