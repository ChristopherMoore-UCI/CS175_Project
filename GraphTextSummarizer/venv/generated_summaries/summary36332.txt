So some of the landing sites are kind of small and it is a bit tricky to get several aircraft into there, but you just have to be careful and watch what's around you," said warrant officer Aron Cunningham, who flies a CH-47 Chinook. The U.S. military has 18 helicopters from the 16th Combat Aviation Brigade out of Wainwright, Alaska, flying aid missions to the Swat district of North West Pakistan. The crews will be on missions for about eight hours every day usually flying aid into ravaged towns like Kalam and evacuating residents from the area. If you've ever been on the subway during rush hour in one of the world's major cities you will understand how crammed the U.S. Army Chinook was taking off from the flood ravaged town of Kalam in the Swat district of North West Pakistan. The U.S. crews even fly produce for farmers in areas cut off from road access so they can get their goods to local markets.
