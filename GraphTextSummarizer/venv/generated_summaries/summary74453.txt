-- Days before a court in eastern China announced the date for delivering the much anticipated verdict in the trial of Bo Xilai, the disgraced Communist Party leader reiterated his innocence but anticipated lengthy imprisonment in a letter to his family. A charismatic and urbane politician, Bo was credited with a spectacular, albeit brutal, crackdown on organized crime during his time as the top party official of Chongqing, a metropolis in southwestern China. Wang and Gu both appeared as witnesses at Bo's trial last month. During the hearings of the politically sensitive trial that took place last month, Bo, 64, strongly challenged the prosecution's case against him, according to accounts published by the court.
