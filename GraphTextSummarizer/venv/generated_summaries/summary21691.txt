Thomas Guolee -- referred to as a "person of interest in the Tom Clements murder investigation" -- was taken into custody "on an active felony arrest warrant by local authorities in Colorado Springs" around 5:30 p.m. (7:30 p.m. ET), the El Paso, Colorado, County Sheriff's Office said. -- Colorado authorities on Thursday arrested a man wanted in connection with the March shooting death of state prison chief Tom Clements. Authorities have said they suspect Evan Ebel shot Clements outside his Colorado home. Law enforcement authorities in El Paso County and Colorado Springs did not immediately respond to requests Thursday night from CNN for more information, including on how Guolee was arrested and what the arrest warrant was for. Two hours later, he was being held on "a no bond hold for violation of parole" at the El Paso County Sheriff's Office Criminal Justice Center.
