Earlier this month, former Iraqi Prime Minister Ayad Allawi offered a grim prediction for the future of Iraq's government after a dramatic walkout staged by Sunni lawmakers in the Iraqiya bloc. The Iraqiya bloc, led by Allawi, had threatened to shun negotiations on sharing power with Kurds and Shiites. Under the proposed deal, the three major governmental positions were to be filled by three members of the country's largest ethnic groups: the Shiites, the Kurds and the Sunnis. " Al-Maliki's nomination came after months of delicate power-sharing negotiations within Iraq's fledgling democracy. Mahmoud Othman, an Iraqi Kurdish lawmaker, said mediation efforts by Kurdish officials, Americans and the Arab League began after the walkout.
