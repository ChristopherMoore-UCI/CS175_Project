Bali a late arrival to global surf scene Switra and Tandjung are part of the breakthrough generation of Indonesian surfers. Childs figures this new generation of Balinese surfers -- boys and girls -- is the best yet to come out of Bali, but it still could be another 20 to 30 years before a Balinese tops the surfing world. But with the 1971 documentary "Morning of the Earth," Bali finally got its recognition, as scenes of Uluwatu's barreling waves caused surfers around the world to grip their wax in excitement. " Though Indonesian surfers have been gracing the pages of international surf magazines for about a decade, Childs believes it takes a certain fire in their bellies to get out of their comfort zone and to the next level. Tandjung walks us over to a little hut on the beach where we meet Made Switra, a surf shop owner, painter and leisure surfer who also grew up in Kuta.
