A device called the Mosquito, which makes a high-pitched noise aimed at driving away young loiterers, has been installed near a Metro entrance just down the block from the Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery. The area is a popular strip at night, but a month ago, police say, a fight that began at the Gallery Place Metro station around 11 p.m. grew to a brawl involving 50 or 60 teenagers and young adults. The Mosquito's sound has to compete with the everyday urban cacophony of traffic, the Metro, and a couple of video billboards pitching ads. The building's management company, Transwestern, says the new device was installed in the past few weeks in response to loiterers. "The sound is benign, will not harm anyone, and is very effective in moving loiterers from an area.
