Fathers matter, and marriage helps to connect fathers to mothers and children. Redefining marriage denies the importance of mothers and fathers, and same-sex parenting arrangements, as the social science professors note, "by definition, exclude either a mother or a father." We have decades of rigorous social science data confirming that children do best with a married mother and father. " Marriage policy should place the needs of children before the desires of adults. It should respect the rights of children to the care of the man and woman who created them as much as the rights of adults to live and love as they chooseâ€”which adults can do, without redefining marriage for the entire nation.
