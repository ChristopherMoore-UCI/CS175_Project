"We made TOO MANY COOKS for Adult Swim and think the level of response is more surreal even than the thing itself," creators Casper Kelly and Paul Painter said on Reddit. On the surface, the video is a parody of television intros from the 1980s, evoking quintessential motifs of the era, from sweater vests, side ponytails and tacky couches to twin actors playing a cute baby and an ALF-like creature named Smarf. "I've always been a fan of humor that just pushes things past the point of funny," Kelly told Rolling Stone. The sitcom parody video, "Too Many Cooks," first aired on October 27 at 4 a.m. on Adult Swim, CNN cousin late-night network. The 11-minute video started making the rounds on social media after its creators uploaded the video to YouTube on Friday and it got a boost from Reddit users.
