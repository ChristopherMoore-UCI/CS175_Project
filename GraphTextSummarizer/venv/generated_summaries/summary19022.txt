The apparent disorder of his paintings concealed an underlying structure, sometimes described as Daoist in nature, which bore striking parallels to a similar balance between order and chaos found in Chinese traditional painting. Born in Beijing in 1920, he formed part of the second generation of Chinese artists to turn westward in their search for inspiration. "French thought and Chinese thought are not the same," he told me. His breakthrough, however, came with his 1954 masterpiece "Wind," a painting that was both his first purely abstract work and a return to his origins: the inky black forms rising in two wavering columns are abstractions of oracle bone characters -- the most ancient of Chinese scripts. No single phrase better encapsulates the union in his person and art of the two often disparate cultures and aesthetic visions of France and China.
