Smith was arrested and charged with first-degree murder in the deaths of Constance Smootz Hevener, 19, and Hevener's 20-year-old sister-in-law, Carolyn Hevener Perry, according to CNN affiliate WVIR. In other interviews with police, Smith said that she got into a physical altercation with Hevener at the store, which was consistent with evidence at the crime scene, Commonwealth Attorney Raymond Robertson said. In the November interview, Smith told police she gave the weapon to a detective on the police force in 1967, David Bocock, and that he buried it. Smith told police she acted alone, authorities said. In a transcript of the police interview, Smith told police she and the women worked at High's Ice Cream.
