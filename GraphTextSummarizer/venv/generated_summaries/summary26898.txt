Intelligence suggested that Khorasan, a group of veteran core al Qaeda operatives who have found sanctuary in Idlib province and surrounding areas, was in the final stages of planning terrorist attacks in the West, including against American aviation. Besieged in his apartment in Toulouse in a final stand before his death, Merah told French negotiators over a walkie-talkie that "an al Qaeda brother" in Pakistan who had spent time in France helped persuade him to return to France to launch attacks. According to Pelletier, French intelligence established that Drugeon joined a small al Qaeda subgroup known as Jund-al-Khilafah based in the Miran Shah area. A significant number of al Qaeda operatives were making the same journey, convinced that Syria now offered a better sanctuary away from the sight lines of U.S. drones. U.S. officials told CNN they believe Drugeon has been heavily involved in facilitating the movement of fighters back and forth from Europe, and in planning attacks in Europe.
