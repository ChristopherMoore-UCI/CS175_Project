New York authorities continue to investigate the incident, which happened after Ward crashed and then exited his race car during an Empire Super Sprints series race in New York. Brett Frood, executive vice president of Stewart's racing team, Stewart-Hass, said Friday that Stewart sent the Ward family flowers and a card, and that eventually he will want to spend time with them "I do believe that will happen at the appropriate time," Frood said. Authorities said that the 20-year-old Ward, a New York sprint car driver, died of "massive blunt trauma. " Ward, from Port Leyden, New York, was in his fifth season in the Empire Super Sprints series. And this is something that will definitely affect my life forever," Stewart said at the speedway in his first public appearance since Ward's death.
