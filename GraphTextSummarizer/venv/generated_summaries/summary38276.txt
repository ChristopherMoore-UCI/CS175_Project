If you'd asked 100 psychiatrists for their diagnosis of Mr. Russell upon first hearing the story, I'd bet more than 90 of them would instantly say "manic episode".

This appears to have been the most likely causative factor in the case of Mr. Russell. It says Mr. Russell was briefly psychotic and is now doing better. Manic episodes can be caused by various factors.
