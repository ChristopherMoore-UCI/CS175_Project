A Business Insider writer observed that her Invisible Boyfriend came from the city she requested, based on area code, and she praised the "attention to detail." Eventually, Invisible Boyfriend expects to offer gifts sent to you at work and other real-life services, says Homann. Though Homann says some of that information is proprietary, he'll allow that the St. Louis-based company has partnered with a service that has real people responding to your messages. Yes, the Internet has a solution for everything, and Invisible Boyfriend (or Girlfriend, they're not fussy) can take care of those pesky privacy-invading questions by supplying an actual person to call you, text you and leave you messages. Ideas like Invisible Boyfriend have been fodder for generations of stories, of course. Suddenly Homann -- who already had a full-time job running his company, an innovation-strategy firm called Kendeo -- realized that, thanks to the attention, Invisible Boyfriend had better be good.
