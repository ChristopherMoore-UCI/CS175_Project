You see that with the Makerbot, which is currently just making combs and shoehorns, but will soon be creating objects which are significantly more complicated." The Designer Ross Lovegrove, an industrial designer whose work covers aviation, transport, timepieces, consumer electronics and everything in between, says that the future of technology requires complete understanding of material structure: "You have to understand materials at a deep scientific or nano level. " For Fairs, wearable technologies such as Google Glass point to another major evolution in design: the disappearance of objects altogether. According to Marcus Fairs, editor-in-chief of influential design magazine Dezeen, the most high-impact developments over the next decade will be primarily in the areas of manufacturing and wearable technology. Lovegrove points to the Nike Flyknits -- an ultralight shoe with a knitted construction -- as an example of how future design will draw heavily on the latest thinking in science, health and manufacturing. At the same time, Sudjic believes there is a revival of interest in physical objects, noting that 2012 was the first year in two decades that saw a rise in vinyl record sales.
