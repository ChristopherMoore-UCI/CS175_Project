"Firstly, I would like to apologize for my behavior here in Rarotonga on Thursday night," the 22-year-old said in a statement on the All Blacks' official website. -- A New Zealand rugby star has apologized for his reported alcohol-fueled incident last week, when the 2011 World Cup winner is said to have entered a Cook Islands bar naked and wet before assaulting two patrons. Rob Guildford died from a suspected heart attack after seeing his son score two tries for New Zealand in the final of the Under-20 World Cup in Japan. "I want to apologize to the people who I was involved with and offended that night, the patrons and staff who witnessed my behavior, and the Cook Island people. " Guildford made his All Blacks debut against Wales at the Millennium Stadium in November 2009 and has represented New Zealand on eight occasions.
