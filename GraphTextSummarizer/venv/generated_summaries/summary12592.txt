In addition to allowing players to pay for special in-game tools, such as more powerful birds, the Facebook version of "Angry Birds" also adds a social-gaming element. Rovio's chief marketing officer (or "Mighty Eagle" in bird-speak) Peter Vesterbacka told the blog Penn Olson that the Finnish company hopes as many as 40% of players will pay for bonus items -- a far higher rate than for other social games like "FarmVille" or "Mafia Wars." Besides posting their scores to their News Feed, players can send in-game gifts to friends and get special rewards for earning some of the game's highest scores. Rovio's ridiculously addictive mobile game, which has been downloaded more than 500 million times on multiple platforms since debuting on the iPhone in 2009, hit Facebook on Tuesday. While the company had leaked out news that the merger of the game's millions of fans and Facebook's hundreds of millions of users was coming, a Facebook "launch event" was scheduled for 6 p.m. ET on Tuesday.
