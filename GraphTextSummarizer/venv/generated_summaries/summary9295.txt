"If you look at how challenged the U.S. has been in dealing with this one imported case, I think it's really important for WHO and other countries to up the preparedness in areas where they might have less resources," said Dr. Jesse Goodman, professor of medicine and infectious diseases at Georgetown University, who was not involved with the study. "We understand there could be global risks associated with the current outbreak," said study author Dr. Isaac Bogoch, a specialist in infectious diseases and tropical medicine at the University of Toronto. Airport screenings are "a control measure, but an imperfect control measure," says Dr. William Schaffner, an expert on infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University. -- Up to three Ebola-infected travelers might board an international flight each month in West Africa, according to a new study, and potentially spread the deadly virus to other countries. Scientists used a model to predict that, on average, three people who are infected with Ebola will leave Guinea, Liberia or Sierra Leone in each of the coming months to fly to another country.
