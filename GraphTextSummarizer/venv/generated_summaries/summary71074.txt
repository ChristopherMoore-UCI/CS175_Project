-- The government of Peru on Friday declared a state of emergency in a remote northern area after a clash between police and indigenous people protesting what they say is the exploitation of their native lands left a number of people dead. The clash took place at dawn outside the northern province of Bagua in the Department of Amazonas as police attempted to break up a roadblock on the 59th day of protests. Though a congressional commission has recommended the repeal of the laws rejected by the native communities, President Alan Garcia supports those that allow using the lands, maintaining that the richness of the Amazon belongs to all Peruvians and that a significant percentage of natural areas are already protected. Foreign Minister Jose A. Garcia Belaunde told CNN en Espa√±ol that the state of emergency was ordered to give the government the opportunity to re-establish order and reopen talks with the protesters. Alberto Pizango, a leader of the protesters, says his followers did not kill police officers.
