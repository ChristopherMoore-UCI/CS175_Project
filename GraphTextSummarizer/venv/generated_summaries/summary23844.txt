Forward Rickie Lambert scored his second goal in successive matches after Steven Gerrard's opener, while striker Danny Welbeck scored two more -- but picked up a suspension after being booked. World and European champion Spain took control of Group I, beating Finland 2-0 while second-placed France dropped points in a 0-0 draw away to Georgia. It gave England the edge over Montenegro, which dropped points in a 1-1 draw away to Poland as Robert Lewandowski canceled out Dejan Damjanovic's opener for the visiting team. Belgium went five points clear at the top of Group A after a 2-0 win in Scotland, while second-placed Croatia dropped points in a 1-1 draw in Serbia which ended its neighbor's slim hopes of a playoff place. Six other places will be settled in this weekend's last round of group matches, while Algeria, Ivory Coast and Egypt have already won spots.
