Jim Clark, who has been brought in to review the case, said Tulsa County Reserve Deputy Robert Bates, 73, "inadvertently" shot Eric Courtney Harris after Harris -- a possibly PCP-addled felon who had days prior sold methamphetamine to an undercover officer -- ran from authorities after trying to sell an illegal handgun during an undercover sting. The officers did not know that Mr. Harris had been shot." Officers in uniform jump out, and Harris bolts out the passenger door and sprints off. Police have said that Harris had reached for his waistband, and officers feared he might endanger them. The gun jumped out of Bates' hand because he wasn't expecting recoil, Clark said, and Bates expressed surprise and remorse that he had shot Harris.
