Pennsylvania voters must be registered by October 9 to cast a ballot in the November 6 general election. Pennsylvania is a likely swing state in the upcoming presidential elections, and that means any attempt to change the voting mechanisms this close to the election is bound to trigger accusations of partisan politics. Under the law, voters need to present one of the following at their precinct: * A Pennsylvania driver's license * Prior to this law, first-time voters in Pennsylvania were allowed to present documents such as bank statements and utility bills in lieu of photo identification. * An ID issued by a Pennsylvania care facility To get a photo ID, residents must have a valid Social Security card; an official birth certificate or U.S. citizenship documents; and two proofs of residency, such as a utility bill or tax records.
