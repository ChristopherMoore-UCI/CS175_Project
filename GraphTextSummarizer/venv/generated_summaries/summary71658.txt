The controversial R&B legend's unexpected appearance prompted festival-goer Katy Perry to reference last year's popular Tupac appearance on Twitter: "Production value has really gone up at (Coachella), it felt like R. Kelly was really there! But when the special guest finally materialized on the main stage, it wasn't Daft Punk, it was R. Kelly. Kelly wasn't the only R&B artist to make a cameo at Coachella on Saturday. Even though he's branched out as a musician in recent years, he returned to his DJ roots, playing the dance tent accompanied by visuals of outer space -- courtesy of his friends at NASA. As a musician, I've made friends with people at NASA, so every couple of years, I find myself doing something with them.
