Ilham Tohti, an economics professor at Beijing's Minzu University, was detained by police in January and taken to his native Xinjiang, China's restive far-western region where a spate of recent violent incidents have been blamed by the government on Uyghur separatists. The Chinese government has responded by launching a massive anti-terrorism campaign as well as pouring more economic resources into Xinjiang Executions Last week, China executed 13 people convicted of terrorism charges related to attacks on public places in Xinjiang in recent months, state media reported. Some Uyghurs have expressed resentment toward the Han majority in recent years over what they describe as harsh treatment from Chinese security forces and loss of economic opportunities to Han people in Xinjiang. Other critics, including exiled Uyghur activists, have attributed the rise of violence in Xinjiang to Beijing's increasingly repressive rule there -- a claim the government vehemently denies. In the region's deadliest violent incident in recent history, a suicide bombing last month killed 39 people at a street market in Urumqi.
