New Belgium supports sustainable agriculture, climate change and other initiatives, while Ben & Jerry's -- now a subsidiary of global conglomerate Unilever -- stays true to its hippie roots with support for environmental initiatives, fair trade efforts, marriage equality and more. But Colorado's New Belgium Brewery and the folks at Ben & Jerry's are teaming up on a beer inspired by ice cream -- salted caramel brownie ice cream, to be precise. New Belgium and Ben & Jerry's are both what are called "B Corporations," a certification issued by the private non-profit B Labs to companies that meet its social, environmental, accountability and transparency standards. "At this time I can confirm that Ben & Jerry's and New Belgium are collaborating to raise awareness around issues we are passionate about, and that the results will be delicious," New Belgium's Director of Sustainability, Jenn Vervier, said in a statement. Beer and ice cream.
