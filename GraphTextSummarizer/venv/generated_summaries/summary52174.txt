The raft of new legislation passed at the NPC includes labor laws, securities laws, corporation laws, banking laws and environmental protection laws. -- China's National People's Congress (NPC) meets every year and brings about 3,000 national delegates together in Beijing's Great Hall of the People to discuss government reports, pass legislation and formalize appointments of government officials. Since the early 1990s, the NPC has passed several laws aimed at building up a legal system and has sought to promulgate a "rule by law" rather than a "rule by men" -- an attempt to steer the party away from its Maoist structures to fit more closely the international norms that govern the world's capital markets. The NPC is constitutionally the highest organ of government power in China although it has long been considered a rubber-stamp parliament. It passes virtually every measure, resolution and law put forward by the government or the Chinese Communist Party.
