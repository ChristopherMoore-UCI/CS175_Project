The Schepp sisters were reported missing January 30 after their father, Matthias, took them from their home in St. Sulpice, near Lausanne in western Switzerland, Interpol said. Interpol issued an international Yellow Notice missing persons alert Saturday for Alessia and Livia Schepp. Such notices are distributed to police in Interpol's 188 member countries to help find missing people, especially children. A spokesman for the Vaud state police said the investigation is focused on Switzerland, France and Italy. State police said Schepp drove through Marseilles, France, on Tuesday.
