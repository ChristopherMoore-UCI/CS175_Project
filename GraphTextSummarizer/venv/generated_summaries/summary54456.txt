Much more than the romantic flicker of neon through a bedroom window, Hong Kong residents now have to contend with shopping precincts that are lit up like football stadiums and golf driving ranges that rise like daybreak on the horizon. Developed by physicists at the University of Hong Kong, the study -- Hong Kong Night Sky Brightness Monitoring Network (NSN) -- took more than 5 million night sky brightness measurements over a period of nearly three years. "The major problem for us isn't city lights, it's clouds," he said, adding that Hong Kong has more than 200 cloudy nights a year. "Light pollution is swiftly destroying the few remaining star-gazing locations in Hong Kong." Unlike other major world cities -- among them Sydney and London -- Hong Kong has no laws controlling urban lighting.
