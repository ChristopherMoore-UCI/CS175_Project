But any cell phone user who grew up in the age of landlines can tell you that the sound quality of calls to and from cell phones is far worse than landline call quality was decades ago. Also, nearly 70% of U.S. cell users receive unwanted sales or marketing ("spam") calls or text messages on their cell phone -- and for a quarter of cell users, that happens at least once a week. It's possible that feature phone users may have lower expectations for download speeds, but this is a significant gap in relative user satisfaction. For instance, 35% of smartphone owners experience dropped calls at least weekly, compared with 28% of feature phone owners. New research from the Pew Internet and American Life Project found that almost three-fourths of phone users experience dropped calls at least occasionally.
