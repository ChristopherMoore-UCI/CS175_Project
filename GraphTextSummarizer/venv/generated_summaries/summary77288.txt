We rode the jam-packed subway system from Prosperity Station to Glory Station. This was my first visit to North Korea, though I had been to South Korea, the DMZ and China. Every time I heard some martial music on North Korean television and radio, I wondered whether the regime was preparing the country for war. We had North Korean officials with us all the time -- and I mean all the time. Huge pictures of the late Great Leader, Kim Il Sung, and his son, the Dear Leader, Kim Jong Il, were all over the place.
