A police official initially theorized that Eugene was under the influence of "bath salts," a drug that contains synthetic stimulants that can "cause chest pains, increased blood pressure, increased heart rate, agitation, hallucinations, extreme paranoia and delusions," according to the National Institute of Drug Abuse. " Poppo's statements were made and recorded during a July 19 interview with Miami police. But an autopsy and lab tests showed the man had used marijuana, and had no alcohol, other street drugs or prescription drugs in his system. It shows Eugene coming across 65-year-old Poppo on a sidewalk along Miami's MacArthur Causeway, stripping clothes off him and eventually chewing on his face. -- The man whose face was chewed off by a naked man in a brutal assault in Miami says he doesn't know why his attacker singled him out, according to CNN affiliate WFOR.
