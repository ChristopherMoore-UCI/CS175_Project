-- Two decades after pummeling Nintendo Entertainment System owners into submission with classic boxing title "Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!," former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson is returning to the video game ring. A new Tyson boxing game for the iPhone is coming to Apple's App Store next month from Rock Software, and veteran players will note it bears more than a passing resemblance to the helium-voiced bruiser's original interactive debut. Rock Software's game will naturally benefit from Tyson's celebrity in addition to its bargain-bin price and nostalgic boxing action. Or is it simply a novelty act designed to cash in on Tyson's recent resurgence in fame? The new arcade sports simulation stars a fictional scrapper named "Little Sammy," who must battle his way past 10 fighters to earn a shot at socking it to Tyson himself.
