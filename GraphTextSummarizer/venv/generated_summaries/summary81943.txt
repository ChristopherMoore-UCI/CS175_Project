Her attorney said police had "failed to train the officers for this type of situation." "It's a clear issue of supervisory liability in the form of improper training, improper attention, possibly, improper hiring," said attorney Amy Marion. Duclos was one of nine people injured by police gunfire and ricocheting bullets after police engaged 58-year-old Jeffrey Johnson, who had been laid off from his job as a designer of women's accessories before gunning down his co-worker. Chenin Duclos, a student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, filed the lawsuit Tuesday in state Supreme Court and is seeking an unspecified amount in damages. The violence erupted just as visitors queued up to ascend the famous New York skyscraper in one of Manhattan's busiest neighborhoods. Police said all the passers-by who were injured were hit by police bullets.
