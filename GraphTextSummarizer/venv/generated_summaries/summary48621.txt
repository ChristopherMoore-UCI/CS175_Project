"We are confident that information will be uncovered which will lead to Myra's return, and we continue to solicit the public's assistance in locating this little girl," said Daniel McMullen, the FBI special agent in charge. Madison County Sheriff Randy Tucker told CNN affiliate WAPT that he believes the little girl is in the area. Myra Lewis was reported missing by her family on March 1 after playing with her sister outside their home in Camden, the FBI said. Despite the effort, the toddler remains missing, and the FBI is offering the money incentive for her return. She was last seen about 11 a.m. the same day wearing white or khaki pants, a turquoise sweater adorned with a bear, and pink tennis shoes.
