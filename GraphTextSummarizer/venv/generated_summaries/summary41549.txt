Mabunda's work was made possible through the efforts of the Christian Council of Mozambique, a group of local churches that launched the "Transforming Guns into Hoes Program", which offers participants tools and building materials in exchange for recovered weapons. Whether they draw from their colonial past, independence, or the turbulent years of civil war that followed, many Mozambicans have taken to the canvas to express themselves. For other artists, like Naguib Elias Abdula -- whose half-mile murals are dotted throughout the landscape of Maputo, the country's capital, independence was the spark plug that got him painting. Why do we still need weapons? It is a narrative that is becoming popular in the country, which has started to gain a reputation as an incubator of fine arts.
