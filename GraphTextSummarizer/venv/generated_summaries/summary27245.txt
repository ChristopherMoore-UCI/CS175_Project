Clearly, Facebook is only part of social media referral traffic, but it's becoming a larger part as the network grows and users become accustomed to interacting with third-party and external content from within the comfort of their social graph. (Mashable)  -- The new-this-year-yet-somehow-already-ubiquitous Facebook Like button has been around just long enough to generate some interesting numbers relating to Facebook users and web traffic. The Facebook "Like" button, however, might be bringing Facebook closer to competing with Twitter in the area of referral traffic, though. Facebook relays messages from publishers saying that these users "are more engaged and stay longer when their real identity and real friends are driving the experience through social plugins." Since the button launched and was integrated on millions of sites, many publishers are reporting large increases in traffic specifically due to this kind of social plugin.
