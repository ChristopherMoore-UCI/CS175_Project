"It is a very important step," said Ghita Schwarz, senior staff attorney for the Center for Constitutional Rights, which represented a group of black firefighters, referring to the latest graduating class. Paul Washington, a former president of the Vulcan Society, a group of black firefighters, praised racial makeup of the latest class. -- The New York City Fire Department on Thursday will graduate its most diverse class ever after decades of criticism and legal battles over the racial composition of its firefighting force. The lack of minorities in U.S. fire departments has been the focus of many lawsuits. In the last 12 years, the fire department has doubled the number of minority firefighters, the city said in a statement.
