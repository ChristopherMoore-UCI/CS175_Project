Every aspect of Windows Phone 7 is geared to social networks: phone, contacts, gaming, photos, even Office. Windows Live, Office Live, Xbox Live are all social networks where users work, share files and talk about media together. Facebook is already embedded in all of them: It's built into Messenger, Hotmail and Outlook, and it's what powers part of the social dimension of Xbox Live. Now Facebook's information is embedded in Bing search. Microsoft may be the underdog in search and phones, but it's actually been ahead of the curve in terms of incorporating social layers into its products.
