Pelosi's position is critical because House Republicans need Democratic support for the measure to pass. Maryland Rep. Chris Van Hollen, a top Pelosi deputy, said he's voting no, and described the opposition as "running deep and getting deeper" as more Democrats review the details. But on the morning of the scheduled vote, Rep. Steve Israel, a member of Democratic leadership, said the riders in bill have become a "poison pill" against Democratic support that the GOP majority needs for the measure to pass. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, asked by CNN if he was concerned about the bill's prospects, said no, replying with a smile, "do I look worried?" Key Senate Democrats are also blasting the deal. Democratic aides say it's still early to gauge how many members will vote no on Thursday, but acknowledge that the deal was brokered by Democrats and Republicans over several weeks.
