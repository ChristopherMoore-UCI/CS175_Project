He is Abdullah Sonata, an explosives expert with links to the late militant Noordin Top, responsible for terror bombings until he was killed last year by police. In the past year, police have launched a nationwide crackdown on militants, in which they have arrested or killed dozens of high-profile militants in the country, the most populated Muslim nation in the world. Noordin, killed in September, had been accused of involvement in July's twin suicide bombings at the Marriott and Ritz-Carlton hotels in Jakarta, the 2002 Bali nightclub bombing and attacks on the same Marriott hotel in Jakarta in 2003, as well as the Australian Embassy in 2004. Sonata was thought to have recently returned from the Philippines and started recruiting and training militants. Initially, police weren't sure the man in question was Sonata but said they intended to confirm his identity by fingerprinting him.
