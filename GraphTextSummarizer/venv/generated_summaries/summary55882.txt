Kent: East Africa and Southern Africa offer different safari experiences. Here, you find small luxury tented camps with game viewing in open vehicles and the rare opportunity for walking safaris and night game drives. In national parks like Kruger or Sabi Sands, guests are likely to see vehicles from many different safari lodges, so for those seeking solitude, choose lodges that offer game drives on adjacent private lands. But in recent years, the world-class hotels and restaurants in South Africa have been attracting guests who want a holiday that combines game viewing with gourmet food, interesting local wines and romantic accommodations. South Africa is a more developed safari destination with cosmopolitan cities, world-class hotels and fine restaurants.
