-- More airports around the United States will soon allow passengers to go through security without removing their shoes, light jackets, and belts. PreCheck is part of a larger effort by TSA to move to security based more on risks that certain passengers may pose. "As TSA continues to move away from a one-size-fits-all approach to transportation security, we are looking for more opportunities to provide the most effective security in the most efficient way possible," TSA Administrator John Pistole said in the news release announcing the expansion. TSA says later this year it will launch an application process to allow passengers who want to join PreCheck to pay $85, verify their identity and provide fingerprints at an enrollment center.
