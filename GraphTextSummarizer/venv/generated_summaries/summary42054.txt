As Richard and I walk through thick grass in a steady rain on Monte Dinero, the evidence is clear. Essentially, Richard has switched from being a sheep farmer that uses grass, to a grass farmer that uses sheep. The area had been christened Monte Dinero -- "Money Mountain" -- by gold prospectors -- and sheep were soon introduced. But slowly his efforts have paid off, and now 120 farms in Argentina, Chile and Uruguay are a part of the Ovis XXI -- a network which fosters innovation in sheep breeding and land management across South America. We loaded our gear into his 4x4 truck and began the two-hour journey towards his home at the southernmost tip of continental South America.
