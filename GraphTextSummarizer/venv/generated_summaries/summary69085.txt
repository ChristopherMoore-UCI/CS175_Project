" The Greens' parliamentary leaders, Renate KÃ¼nast and JÃ¼rgen Trittin, said they were "relieved that Christian Wulff has finally unburdened the country from agonizing debate with his resignation." Wulff, who was the state premier of Lower Saxony for seven years, was one of Merkel's biggest rivals within the Christian Democrats before being elected to the presidency in 2010. The German presidency is a largely ceremonial office, but Wulff's resignation is seen as a blow to Chancellor Angela Merkel, who supported his candidacy as president. -- Germany's President Christian Wulff announced his resignation Friday following a series of scandals that prompted calls for him to step down. She added: "With his resignation, President Wulff reiterated his conviction that he always behaved legally correctly in office and in service to the people of our country. " Merkel said Wulff's presidency would be remembered for his efforts to promote a modern, tolerant Germany.
