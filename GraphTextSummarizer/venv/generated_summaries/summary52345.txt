As each of the past four presidential elections has demonstrated, the road to the White House goes through the Latino community, and amassing the required Electoral College votes requires victory in states where Latino voters make the difference. (The lack of movement on immigration reform, an issue that for the second consecutive national election ranked as the No. 1 issue for Latino voters, was simply Exhibit A in a list of reasons why the community is frustrated). What happens next in Washington on immigration reform, and the other top issues for Latino voters -- jobs and the economy, education and health care -- will set the stage for the next election. Yet the failure of lawmakers to address the key issues of interest for Latino voters is particularly perplexing when we look at what happens when politicians do take these voters into account. With this in mind, the next would-be president must not only reach out and directly connect with Latino voters on the issues that most matter to them, but also show that he, or she, is from a party that is able to deliver action as well.
