-- British photographers and self-described "urban explorers" Daniel Marbaix and Daniel Barter see beauty amid the desolation of abandoned buildings. But after they learned of their mutual interest in taking photos of "older building and artifacts," a friendship developed that has led to many adventures, for work and pleasure -- often both. Barter's love of old buildings started as a child. Barter said the image reflects the separation of church and state in a reference to American politics. For their first book, they captured the forgotten structures of the eastern United States: ruins of churches and theaters in New York City, derelict train stations, asylums and factories in the Rust Belt.
