-- Veteran British actor Peter Capaldi is stepping into the blue police box as the 12th Doctor, the eccentric time traveler at the heart of the BBC's "Doctor Who," the network announced Sunday. 'Doctor Who' celebrates 50 years with biopic and new Doctor 2011: Joy for 'Doctor Who' fans as lost episodes materialize But the Glasgow native is better known for his portrayal of the foul-mouthed spin doctor Malcolm Tucker in the series "The Thick of It" and a 2009 film offshoot, "In the Loop." It's not Capaldi's first trip in the Tardis, as the Doctor's time machine -- which appears from the outside to be a London police phone booth -- is known. Capaldi has appeared in a 2008 episode of the series and in its spinoff "Torchwood."
