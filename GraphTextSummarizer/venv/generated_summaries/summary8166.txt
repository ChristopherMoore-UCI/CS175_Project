The architect of the bill -- parliament deputy from the ruling party Vadim Kolesnichenko -- says such legislation is necessary if Ukraine wants to become part of the European Union. The bill doesn't stipulate that Ukraine may have several official state languages -- something which can be changed only through a nationwide referendum. Our bill is written in full compliance with the European charter for minority languages, which is aimed at preserving minority languages and protecting them," Kolesnichenko said. -- Several dozen protesters picketed a cultural center in Kiev, Ukraine, on Saturday as part of continued demonstrations against a controversial regional languages bill. The protesters fear that the future of the Ukrainian language will be severely undermined by the bill, which aims to provide regional status to the 18 languages spoken by ethnic minorities in Ukraine, including Russian, Romanian and Tatar.
