Bayern Munich failed to regain top spot in the Bundesliga on Saturday night after dropping points in a 1-1 draw at Hamburg. Leverkusen had Czech Republic defender Michal Kadlec sent off midway through the second half for his second bookable offence while Stuttgart's Cristian Molinaro saw red in the 92nd minute for striking Andre Schuerrle in the face. Hamburg took the lead in the 23rd minute when Jacopo Sala headed home from a Jose Guerrero cross. The visitors took a shock lead when Egypt striker Mohamed Zidan scored 15 minutes into his Mainz debut. Fourth-placed Moenchengladbach could only manage a goalless draw at Wolfsburg while fifth-placed Bayer Leverkusen also drew (2-2) with mid-table Stuttgart as both sides finished with 10 men on the pitch.
