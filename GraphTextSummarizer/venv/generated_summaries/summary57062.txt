But his love of video games stretches back to his childhood. The rapper has tied music and video games together by including some game-only tracks with "Blood on the Sand." Some of those suggestions, he said, grew out of his experience performing for the troops in Iraq as well as his viewing of the film "Blood Diamond," which starred Leonardo DiCaprio. Those same fans might be surprised to learn the hardcore rapper also has a soft spot for old-school throwbacks like "Tetris," "Pac-Man" and the venerable "Super Mario Brothers." 50 Cent plays "Super Mario Brothers"?
