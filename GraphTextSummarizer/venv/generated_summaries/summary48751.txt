According to the U.S. Marine Corps, Melaku joined the Marine Corps Reserve in September 2007 and currently is listed as a Marine Corps reservist lance corporal and a motor vehicle operator with the Combat Engineer Support Company of the 4th Combat Engineer Battalion in the 4th Marine Division. The FBI statement said Melaku, of nearby Alexandria, Virginia, was detained for trespass in Arlington National Cemetery when it was closed. No explosives or other suspicious material were found in the vehicle, FBI Special Agent Brenda Heck said. A source in the military said Melaku had "fallen off the radar as a  Marine." Public safety concerns over items Melaku was carrying led to the road closures, according to the FBI.
