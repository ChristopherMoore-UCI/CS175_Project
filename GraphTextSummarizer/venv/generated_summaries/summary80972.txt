Mali extremist contacts alleged Mediouni was identified and recruited by Mali-based members of al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb through his interest in radical Islamist Internet sites, the Interior Ministry statement alleges. Both of the suspects in Spain are unemployed, the second Interior Ministry spokesman said. A second Interior Ministry spokesman said that was the younger suspect, Mediouni. Interior Minister Jorge Fernandez Diaz told reporters that police consider them "lone wolves," like the Boston suspects. However, the similarity is based only on how the two suspects in Spain were "radicalized," by going to online forums and chat rooms, and also in the suspects' alleged interest in pulling from the Internet information on bomb-making, said an Interior Ministry spokesman, who by custom is not identified.
