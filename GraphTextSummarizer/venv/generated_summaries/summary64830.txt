The decision clears the way for the trial of Phillip Garrido on charges of kidnapping, rape and false imprisonment to begin late this year, El Dorado County Superior Court Judge Douglas Phimister said. The next court date in the case is February 28, when Phillip Garrido will be arraigned on the indictment returned by a grand jury last year. -- A man accused of kidnapping then-11-year-old Jaycee Dugard and holding her captive for nearly two decades is competent to stand trial, a California judge ruled Thursday. Garrido's lawyers reached an agreement with prosecutors before Thursday's hearing and the defense waived the right to a jury trial on the issue of Garrido's competency. Nancy Garrido pleaded not guilty late last year to charges in connection with the case, and proceedings against her husband were suspended until a determination about his competency could be made.
