On Tuesday, officials showed reporters in Mexico City stacks of $100 bills that they said were seized in the operation. The cash is the second largest quantity of money the Mexican military has seized since President Felipe Calderon took office in December 2006, the statement said. Mexico's military has seized more than $15.3 million in cash from a vehicle in the border city of Tijuana, authorities said Tuesday. In 2008, soldiers seized more than $26 million in Sinaloa state. Calderon announced a government crackdown on cartels shortly after taking office.
