-- Tiger Woods produced some of his best golf to give himself a massive lead heading into final round of the BMW Championship as broke the Cog Hill course record. Woods' round broke the previous record of 62 at the course, while he also equaled the tournament record which had been set by Jim Furyk at Bellerive in September 2008, and he admitted something just clicks when he plays the Cog Hill course. Woods had a 16-under total of 197, seven shots ahead of American Brandt Snedeker, who carded a 66, and Australian Marc Leishman, who posted a 68. Woods carded a course-record 62 in the third round of the BMW Championship at Cog Hill, Illinois. " The $7.5 million tournament is the third event in the US PGA Tour's FedEx Cup playoff series and a victory for Woods would put him back at the top of the standings after he relinquished the place to Steve Stricker last week.
