Biden, who went to the Hawkeye State to headline Democratic Sen.

The most recent national survey on a potential Democratic field came from CNN/ORC International two weeks ago and indicated that 63% of Democrats and Independents who lean towards the Democratic Party said Clinton was their early choice for the nomination, with Biden second at 12%. In a meeting on Tuesday with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Biden said the United States was "deeply concerned by the attempt to unilaterally change the status quo in the East China Sea." Biden reaffirmed that "the United States looks to our alliance with Japan as the cornerstone of stability and security in East Asia, and we are fully committed to our announced strategy of rebalancing as well in the Pacific," according to a White House transcript of the meeting. "Clearly, Joe Biden is not an amateur when it comes to U.S. foreign policy, but unfortunately for him former Secretary of State Hillary's Clinton's experience in that realm trumps his," Rothenberg added.
