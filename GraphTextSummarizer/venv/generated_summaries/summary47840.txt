A Santorum victory would raise further questions about Romney's ability to attract broad conservative support in the primaries or against President Barack Obama in November's general election. "No matter who your preferred candidate might be down the road, if you want to stop Mitt Romney, Rick Santorum needs to stop Romney in Michigan," said an appeal from the Freedom's Defense Fund. Former White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs, now advising Obama's campaign, told CNN that Santorum has a "legitimate chance" to become the GOP nominee and described the former Pennsylvania senator as a candidate with blue-collar appeal who is "clearly somebody who has a very different economic background than Mitt Romney." New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a strong Romney backer, declared on the CBS program "Face the Nation" that "Rick Santorum's not going to be the nominee," while Arizona Sen. John McCain told CNN's "State of the Union" that he was "confident Mitt will do well on Tuesday night in Arizona and in Michigan and hopefully that will move this process forward so we can concentrate on the real adversary. Santorum cited negative ads by the Romney campaign and super PAC supporters for the tightening poll numbers, and he sounded resigned to a second-place finish in Arizona.
