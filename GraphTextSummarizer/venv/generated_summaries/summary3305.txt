-- A backlog in processing education benefits has forced the Department of Veterans Affairs to authorize millions of dollars in emergency funds for veterans who need the cash to pay for school. The VA has been speaking to schools to ensure that veterans do not get kicked out if their tuition has not yet been paid, said VA spokeswoman Katie Roberts. The delay in processing the benefits has created much consternation among veterans, with some worried they would have to drop out of school because of a lack of funds. The Veterans Affairs department will give up to $3,000 to students who haven't received funds from education bills VA statistics show more than 27,500 vets have already received benefits for housing or books under the new Post-9/11 GI Bill, and hundreds of thousands more have gotten benefits under its other programs.
