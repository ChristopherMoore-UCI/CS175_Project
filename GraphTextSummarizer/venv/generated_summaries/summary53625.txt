The warning Friday from Secretary of State for Defence Liam Fox marks the latest stage in attempts by the new British government to shake up the country's armed forces and defense spending. -- Britain's military chiefs have been told to prepare for a "leaner and less centralized" Ministry of Defence.

Fox said Britain's future strategic posture should be a "flexible and adaptable" one.
