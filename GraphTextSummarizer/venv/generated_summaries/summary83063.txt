McCain's wife, Cindy, and daughter Meghan also were milling around as well as Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina; former Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas and his wife, Wendy; Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman Jr. and his wife, Mary Kaye; top McCain aide Mark Salter; and senior adviser Charlie Black. McCain revealed that barbecuing for guests is one of the few ways he relaxes, especially during the grueling campaign, and was eager to share his carefully honed recipe on the gas grill: baby back ribs (bought at Costco), cooked bones down with a dry rub that's a third garlic powder, a third salt and a third pepper. -- Instead of appealing for votes on the campaign trail, Sen. John McCain spent the weekend playing host at his rustic Arizona home -- and on Sunday members of the traveling press corps were his guests. During a tour of the grounds, he peppered guests with wildlife information -- pointing out the black hawk nest overlooking the creek while talking about watching the mother teach the baby how to fly and joking about the woodpecker "condominium," telling reporters that woodpeckers had to peck a different nest every year. McCain greeted reporters as he tended to the grill -- tongs in hand -- on the deck of his ranch house.
