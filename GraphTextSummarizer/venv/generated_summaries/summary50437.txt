-- Kathryn Joosten, the Emmy-award-winning actress known for her roles on "The West Wing" and "Desperate Housewives," died Saturday after a lengthy struggle with lung cancer, her family said. According to information from her publicist Nadine Jolson, Joosten embraced the "Desperate Housewives" plot that called for her to be diagnosed with -- and eventually succumb to -- lung cancer in the series' final season. After several more productive years, in 2005 Joosten landed the role of Karen McCluskey -- the crusty, older neighbor living among a roster of beautiful, if often troubled women on Wisteria Lane in "Desperate Housewives." "Kathryn succumbed to her 11-year battle with lung cancer today ... surrounded by love and humor till the end," her family said in a statement. Off the set, her life was defined by her family and, more recently, her bout with lung cancer.
