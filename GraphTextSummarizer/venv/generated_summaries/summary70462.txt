"As a precaution, PATH has suspended escalator service at Exchange Place through (Tuesday) morning," said Marsico. " PATH officials are investigating whether the effects of Superstorm Sandy played a role in Monday's incident, according to a PATH statement. "In addition, workers are reviewing all PATH escalators throughout the system." While that station's escalators are out of the service, the station remains open, with customers directed to stairs and elevators. Rodriguez, the witness, said that since Sandy, the Jersey City PATH station hit by Monday's incident has had major issues. The incident occurred at the Exchange Place station in Jersey City, and the three injured and taken to hospitals had possible back or neck injuries, according to Ron Marsico, spokesman for the Port Authority Trans-Hudson (PATH) service.
