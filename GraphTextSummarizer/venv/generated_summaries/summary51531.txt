According to the study, white parents were much more likely to be both responsive and demanding than black and Hispanic parents; whereas black parents, in particular, were often highly demanding, but tended not to be as responsive in the ways the study measured. Especially in churches, neighborhood organizations, families and informal social networks, helping parents do their best needs to be as big a priority as achieving excellent schools. However, it is also true, according to the National Assessment of Educational Progress, that test score gaps between 12th-grade blacks and whites with highly educated parents -- parents with 16 or more years of schooling -- are greater than test score gaps between 12th-grade blacks and whites whose parents have less education. Beginning in September 2008, researchers and parent leaders from communities in several states have met every four months at Harvard to learn about relevant research, trade ideas, coach one another, and share examples of their own leadership. The main purpose is to equip parent leaders with ideas and energy for helping others in home communities to help ALL our children succeed.
