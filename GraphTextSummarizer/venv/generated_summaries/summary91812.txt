-- Oil could turn Gulf marshlands into open water and affect millions of migratory birds for generations, Tom Moorman, the senior science official and leader of the oil spill task force for Ducks Unlimited said Friday. If oil enters and lingers in the Gulf marshlands through the late summer and fall, it will affect millions migratory birds that rely on marshland resources for the winter, Moorman said. For the birds, oil could kill them quickly by covering their plumage and preventing temperature control, slowly poison them through their food supply of oysters, insects and plants, or inflict "sublethal impacts" by causing reproduction problems when they head back north for winter, Moorman said. Cleanup efforts are in action in marshland areas already hit by oil, he said. If necessary, Moorman said, flooding agriculture areas nearby should be considered in the hope some birds would migrate to those areas this winter.
