"If you had a law which said healthy people are going to pay in -- if you made it explicit that healthy people pay in and sick people get money, it would not have passed. For one, it was hardly a secret that the law relied on healthy people to pay in so that sick people would get coverage. The latest caught-on-tape remarks from economist Jonathan Gruber, one of the architects of the Affordable Care Act, has him asserting back in 2010 that the "American public" -- that's you and me -- "doesn't actually care that much about the uninsured." And legislators, economists and health care scholars will be trying to fix the mess that Gruber et al created for many years to come. Gruber's misguided sense of accomplishment reflects not so much elitism as it does the arrogance of liberal "solutionism," or the tendency of technocrats to assume they can solve complex social problems easily.
