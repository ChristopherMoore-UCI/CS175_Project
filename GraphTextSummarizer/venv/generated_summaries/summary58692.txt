The "Transformers" director served as a producer on 2014's "Turtles" adaptation -- leaving the directing to Jonathan Liebesman of "Battle Los Angeles" -- and tapped former "Transformers" star Megan Fox to go along for the ride. In "Turtles," Fox plays April O'Neil, the eager NYC TV reporter who stumbles across the titular crew of teenage mutants who are well-versed in the martial arts. But according to The Washington Post, those turtles -- whether you find them to be cool or simply creepy -- don't get nearly enough screen time, and are treated more like "sidekicks to the actual focus of this film: summer-movie sexpot Megan Fox."
