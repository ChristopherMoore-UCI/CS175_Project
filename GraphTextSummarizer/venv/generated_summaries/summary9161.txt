When Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials gave Gonzalez a visa so he could live in El Paso, Texas, his fellow Juarez cartel members began to get suspicious, El Paso Police Chief Greg Allen said at a press conference. Allen said Gonzalez's exit from Mexico, combined with a raid on a cartel warehouse and the arrest of cartel lieutenant Pedro "El Tigre" Aranas Sanchez led cartel members to believe he might be working as an informant, Allen said. He said police believe Apodaca and Duran were not cartel members. He was shot eight times outside his home in El Paso, Texas, police said. Rodriguez and the victim were in the Juarez cartel, based across the border from El Paso, police spokesman Chris Mears said.
