For other militant groups around the Muslim world, it allows for a cross-pollination of ideas and training through a sort of jihadist exchange program, where some groups send members into Syria or Iraq to learn from ISIS. Inside Syria and Iraq, ISIS has also gathered up smaller militant groups. And, in its 2Â½-decade existence, al Qaeda has only manged to add some half dozen affiliates, one of which was al Qaeda in Iraq, the parent organization of ISIS that has now split off from the core al Qaeda organization. Finally, ISIS and the al Qaeda-aligned Nusra Front had previously been at war with each other in Syria for much of this past year. In many ways it really is the "Islamic State of Iraq and Syria" that it claims to be, because it has taken large portions of both countries from government control, replacing local administrators with ISIS governors who distribute social services.
