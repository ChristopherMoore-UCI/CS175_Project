-- A French man jailed for an alleged plot to kill Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in 2009 was deported to France on Saturday, a Venezuelan official said. "Frederic Laurent Bouquet was sentenced to four years (in Venezuelan jail), after confessing to plotting against Chavez. According to Venezuelan state-run National Radio and the state-run Venezuelan TV station, Bouquet was arrested in 2009 with three men from the Dominican Republic. In her tweet, Varela said Bouquet's deportation complies with a Venezuelan law that allows the government to expel anyone who jeopardizes the security and defense of the nation. El Aissami at the time said Bouquet had military experience and had spent some time in Israel.
