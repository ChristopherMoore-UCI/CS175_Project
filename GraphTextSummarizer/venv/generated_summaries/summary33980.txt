-- Defense attorneys for New York police officer Gilberto Valle, accused of a cannibalism plot, tried Thursday to show their client engaged in "fantasy role-play" during online conversations with his three alleged co-conspirators. Authorities said they found a document in Valle's account on his wife's laptop titled "Abducting and Cooking Kimberly -- A Blueprint." Walsh testified about the document, revealed in court, which contained a picture of Kimberly Sauer and personal information, including her bra size and shoe size. Graphic e-mails read at New York cannibalism plot trial Prosecutors also presented evidence that Valle had twice trained on the system and that he would have been instructed not to access the database for personal reasons. On redirect, the prosecution noted that none of the conversations between alleged co-conspirators made references to "just fantasy," "make believe" or had instances where Valle wrote "It's not real," and "I am just talking fantasy," as he did write in 80% of the conversations with 21 other people found in his e-mail account. Prosecutors have argued that Valle was "deadly serious" about online plans to allegedly kidnap, rape, torture, cook and eat women.
