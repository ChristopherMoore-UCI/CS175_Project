During the meetings with Grossman, the senior U.S. official said, a Pakistani official voiced strong concern about the continuation of U.S. drone strikes against targets inside Pakistan, but he and other members of the Pakistani leadership expressed a willingness to press al Qaeda, conduct joint operations and support reconciliation. " The revelation that bin Laden was living in plain sight for years amongst Pakistani military installations, and Pakistan's humiliation at the U.S. decision to undertake the raid without telling them, has thrown the relationship into one of its worst points in history. "Now is the time for action and closer coordination; for more cooperation, not less; for the friendship to get stronger, not weaker." Clinton said Pakistan has a responsibility to prevent insurgents from waging war in Afghanistan from its territory. During several meetings with Zardari, and others, Grossman said the United States was looking for more cooperation from Pakistan in fighting extremism. "I believe strongly it is in our national security interests to have a comprehensive, long-term partnership with the government and people of Pakistan." Last week, Marc Grossman, special envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan, traveled to Islamabad, where he delivered the set of demands, emphasizing the United States needed actions, not words from Pakistan, according to a senior official briefed on the talks.
