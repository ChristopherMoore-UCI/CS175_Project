"We were living in Makkah two years ago and were planning to move back to Riyadh, but Abdullah and Ibrahim said they wanted to go to Medina before coming back with us," the father, Hassan, told the newspaper last year. Also shortly after the attempt against the Saudi prince's life, the Saudi Gazette newspaper spoke with Ibrahim and Abdullah's father, who shed some more light on the young men's upbringing. "Abdullah started to go out a lot with his new friends to camps known as 'preaching camps.' In 2009, Abdullah al-Asiri died when he detonated a bomb on his body with the intent of assassinating Saudi Prince Muhammed Bin Naif, a top security official. Ibrahim Hassan al-Asiri is one of Saudi Arabia's most wanted men, according to a list published by the government last year.
