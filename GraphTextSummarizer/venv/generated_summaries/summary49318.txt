-- Thirty-eight al Qaeda militants were killed in clashes with Yemen's military, local security officials said Friday. The Yemeni branch of the group calls itself al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula; Ansaar al-Sharia is an affiliate of AQAP. The Yemeni government this week blamed an affiliate of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula for a massive suicide bombing Monday that killed more than 100 soldiers. Dozens were also wounded in a fierce battle involving several army brigades and the air force, state-run news agency SABA said. The partially lawless Middle Eastern country has become a central battleground in the fight against al Qaeda.
