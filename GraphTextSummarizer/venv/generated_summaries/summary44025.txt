In a 48-minute speech, the Colorado Democrat called on Obama to "purge his administration" of CIA officials, including Director John Brennan, involved in the interrogation techniques detailed in a new Senate Intelligence Committee report. " Udall's comments came the day after Senate Intelligence Committee Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) released an explosive report detailing the rough techniques the CIA used to interrogate detainees under President George W. Bush. But Brennan pushed back, acknowledging in a statement that the CIA made "mistakes" but saying those techniques "did produce intelligence that helped thwart attack plans, capture terrorists, and save lives. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest defended Brennan on Wednesday, telling reporters that he has done an "exemplary job" and that Obama is "pleased to rely on his advice. Sen. Mark Udall accused the CIA of "lying" about the effectiveness of torture, called for the resignation of its director and blasted President Barack Obama's handling of the spy agency on the Senate floor Wednesday.
