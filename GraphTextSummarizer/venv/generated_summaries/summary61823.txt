The bank was informed Sunday morning about a fire at the bank and only learned of the robbery the next day, when police said the fire followed a burglary, LCL spokesman Olivier Tassain said. The theft happened late Saturday night at a branch of Credit Lyonnais (LCL) in central Paris. "(The guard) is in good health," Tassain told CNN. It wasn't clear Tuesday how many safes were broken into, in part because some safes were damaged by the fire but not by the burglary, Tassain said. The burglars broke into the bank through the basement and entered the vault through a hole in the wall, Tassain said.
