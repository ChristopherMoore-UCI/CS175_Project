The EU has fined all kinds of cartels and market abusers, but rarely does it fine big American companies based on complaints from American competitors -- so the case catches the eye, especially with critics who accuse American companies of "jurisdiction shopping" to get a favorable outcome. The ruling, which Intel plans to appeal, may have future implications for American companies accused of "jurisdiction shopping" to avoid anti-trust verdicts against them, says CNN's Jim Boulden, who explains the basics of the Intel case. The EC says Intel has systematically given PC makers and stores rebates to keep computers with AMD chips off the shelves. AMD (another American company and Intel's only competitor) first raised the red flag in 2000. On Wednesday the European Commission fined Intel a record $1.45 billion for violating anti-trust laws.
