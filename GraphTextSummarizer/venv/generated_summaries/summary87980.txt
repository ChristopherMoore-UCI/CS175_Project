Writing in an editorial for CNN last year, Masai Ujiri, general manager of NBA team Denver Nuggets said Africa represents a potentially huge talent pool for U.S. basketball. Basketball without Borders takes the top youth players, aged 19 and under, from all over the world and invites them to train with NBA stars and coaches. -- Soccer may be the number one sport in most of Africa but basketball is growing fast and the NBA has set its sights on the continent to provide future stars, and tomorrow's fans. In recent weeks, Amadou Gallo, managing director of NBA Africa, has embarked on a continent-wide tour including stop-offs in Ethiopia, Nigeria and South Africa. Despite, a lack of infrastructure in Africa, the NBA has a long tradition of African players.
