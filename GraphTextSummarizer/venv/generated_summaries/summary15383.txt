Audio recordings released on Monday reveal confusion between air traffic controllers and the veteran crew of a Southwest Airlines jet after they landed at the wrong airport in Missouri in January.

The plane from Chicago actually landed several miles away at a municipal airport in Taney County, which doesn't have a control tower.
