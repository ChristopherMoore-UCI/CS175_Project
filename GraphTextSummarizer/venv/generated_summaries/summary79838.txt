According to the U.S. official, who spoke to reporters Thursday, Mosul police and tribal forces would likely join Iraqi troops in the assault on the city. Months after Iraqi troops dropped their weapons and ran for their lives in Mosul, up to 25,000 are expected to head back there in April or May to try to retake the city from ISIS, according to a U.S. official. Still, even with all this talk about U.S. advisers, no officials have indicated American troops will engage ISIS in fighting on the ground -- something President Barack Obama has been wary to do. The more ISIS reinforces its defenses around Mosul -- as it has been doing -- the more help Iraqi forces would need in locating military targets, a Central Command official told CNN this month. Right now, ISIS has an estimated 1,000 to 2,000 fighters in Mosul, the U.S. official said, but more could join the fight if they take the threat of attack seriously.
