On ABC's "Good Morning America" last year, he said he purchased travel cancellation insurance on a website and also purchased medical, dental and accident insurance on both him and Gardner. "While we recognize that Mr. Giordano enjoys an infamous reputation, the Annapolis arrest was simply a matter of effective police work in response to citizen complaints," Annapolis Chief Michael Pristoop said. Giordano took out a $1.5 million life insurance policy on Gardner days before they traveled to Aruba. In Aruba last year, Giordano had been held in the disappearance of 35-year-old Robyn Gardner of Maryland. Giordano acknowledged he inquired about the policy two days after Gardner disappeared but said he was told by his then-attorney Michael Lopez to do so.
