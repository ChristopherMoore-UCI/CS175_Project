Two people died after being trapped on Utah's Logan Peak during an avalanche. "We are still in extreme avalanche danger," he said, and he urged snowmobilers to "take into account they need to stay in probably the areas that have less of a slope to them. Lt. Matt Bilodeau of the Cache County Sheriff's Office told CNN that someone using a satellite phone called at 10:30 a.m. (12:30 p.m. ET) and told authorities about the incident.
