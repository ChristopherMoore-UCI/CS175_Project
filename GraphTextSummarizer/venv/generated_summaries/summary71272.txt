Key issues to be resolved between the new president and Washington include: any continuing U.S. mandate to perform counter-terrorism mission in Afghanistan; extending immunity for U.S. military personnel; and the fate of Taliban prisoners. While doubts remain about that country's ability and willingness to facilitate such an agreement, last week Pakistani government representatives entered into formal peace talks with the Taliban in North Waziristan. And as the election underlines, a nascent, albeit dysfunctional, democracy may be taking root after years of Taliban oppression. Despite these concerns, and the prospect of Taliban attacks at polling stations, the ballot is nonetheless a watershed moment in the country's history. Whether Afghanistan prospers, or implodes, will be determined in part by the new president's success in dealing with a complex set of inter-related issues including: trying to forge a security deal with Washington and its NATO partners beyond 2014; pursuing the reconciliation agenda and a possible peace agreement with the Taliban; and preventing an economic downturn as foreign aid is reduced.
