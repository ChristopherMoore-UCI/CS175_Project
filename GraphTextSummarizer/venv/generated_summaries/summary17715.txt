They would empower small dollar donors and help them compete with the lobbyists, bankers and wealthy donors writing big checks. On October 8, the court will hear oral arguments in McCutcheon v. FEC, a case brought by Alabama businessman Shaun McCutcheon and the Republican National Committee that threatens to remove the aggregate limits that individual donors can give, in total, to federal candidates and committees each election cycle. Wall Street was the biggest industry to put money into politics. In the first six months of 2013, the finance, insurance and real estate sector has already given $63 million to federal candidates and committees. If the court sides with McCutcheon, an individual donor could bundle more than $1 million to congressional fundraising committees.
