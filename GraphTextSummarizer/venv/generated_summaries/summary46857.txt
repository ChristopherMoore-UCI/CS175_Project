When Los Angeles Superior Judge James Dabney sentenced Lohan to 90 days in jail in March he gave her the option of serving the time in a "lock down rehab" facility. It is not known if prosecutors will ask the judge to order Lohan to move to another facility or else be sent to jail to serve out the sentence. -- The facility Lindsay Lohan entered Thursday to comply with court-ordered rehab is not licensed to provide alcohol or drug rehab treatment, a state official said. The actress has appeared in court at least 20 times before four Los Angeles judges who have now found her in violation of probation six times and sentenced her to a total of nine months in jail. Lindsay Lohan acknowledged her drug and alcohol addiction in past court appearances.
