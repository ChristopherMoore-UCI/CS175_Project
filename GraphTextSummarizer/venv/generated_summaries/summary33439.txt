The victims were Mark Niederbrock, 50, the beloved pastor at Walker's Presbyterian Church; his 16-year-old daughter, Emma Niederbrock; Melanie Wells, Emma's 18-year-old friend from West Virginia; and Niederbrock's estranged wife, Debra Kelley, 53, a professor at Longwood University. Police said she invited McCroskey to fly from his northern California home, stay with her in Virginia and then attend the Strictly for the Wicked Festival, a Horrorcore fest in Michigan featuring bands with names like Dismembered Fetus and Phrozen Body Boy. McCroskey is a young man with no criminal record who took delight in the blend of horror hip-hop that celebrated macabre killings. McCroskey has been charged only in the killing of Mark Niederbrock. Memorial services were held over the weekend for Emma Niederbrock and her mother, Debra Kelley.
