Basically, the guy started to show up just about everywhere, including big-screen appearances in "Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star," "Spider-Man 2" and as the cult leader Zoltan in "Dude, Where's My Car?" (Zoltan: "Soon we will leave this lame planet and fly through outer space with cool aliens who like us!") " Shortly after taking over "Talk Soup," Sparks landed a role on the Showtime series "Queer as Folk" and numerous other parts on various networks. If you've ever turned on VH1 (or at least passed by it while channel surfing to something with sharks), there's a 200% chance that you've seen the network's "I Love The ... " series, which also means that you've stumbled upon comedian Hal Sparks waxing nostalgic on everything from Nerf footballs to the R. Kelly sex tape. In fact, in 1999 the budding comedian received his big break on TV when the E! network pegged him to host "Talk Soup," a show that aired the best clips from the previous day's daily talk shows (read: people getting naked on "Springer"). 'Jerry Springer' is just kind of the chubby, redneck version of throwing Christians to the lions.
