Since the glorious days (and hair) of Jimmy Johnson, when Emmitt Smith, Troy Aikman and Michael Irvin owned the NFL -- tallying three Super Bowl victories in the '90s -- the headline has been the same: "Playoff victory escapes Cowboys." Win or lose, Houston has a long road to rival the Cowboys, whose eight Super Bowl appearances are tied for most ever. Say what you will about our megalomaniac oilman owner, but at least he'd never leave Big D. That's because the Cowboys are part of an elite class of franchise whose brethren include the Yankees and Celtics. It will take decades or longer before Mr. Martin and I can seriously discuss whether the Texans rival the Cowboys in the Lone Star State (which, to be sure, is a reference to the state flag and not the Cowboys' helmet). The Cowboys rule Texas, and no 2002 upstarts from Houston enjoying their first playoffs can take that away.
