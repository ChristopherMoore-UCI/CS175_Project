" "Senator Yee attributed his long career in public office to being careful and cautious," the arrest affidavit recounts. Jackson is accused not only of being Yee's bagman but of taking part in other Chee Kung Tong schemes, including a murder-for-hire plot. The allegations have stunned his constituents in San Francisco and its suburbs and cast a shadow over his state Senate colleagues, who have suspended Yee and two other Democrats who have run afoul of the law in recent months. " Doreen Silk, a constituent and Yee supporter, said the news of his arrest "surprised all of us." Over the course of the next three years, prosecutors say Yee raked in about $50,000 from undercover agents, with Jackson acting as an intermediary.
