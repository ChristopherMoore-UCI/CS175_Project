Actor Thomas Guiry allegedly head-butted a police officer after he was told he was too drunk to board a flight at Houston's Bush Intercontinental Airport last weekend, police said Wednesday. Guiry, 31, faces a felony charge of assault against a public servant in the Saturday incident, according to Houston Police spokesman John Cannon. United Airlines employees called police after they refused to let Guiry board Saturday, Cannon said. Guiry became agitated and made repeated threats to the police sergeant after he was told he could go to the sobering center if he was compliant, Cannon said. The head-butting happened as the sergeant tried to restrain him, Cannon said.
