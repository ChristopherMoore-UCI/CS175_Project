-- Google this week unveiled its Chrome Web Store, which aims to do for the Web what Apple's App Store did for mobile devices: It provides a place to explore and "install" Web-based applications. In this new world of Web-based software, meanwhile, desktop applications are replaced with Web applications -- all of your data and applications are stored on the Web rather than the device. This will be made possible by Google's super-simple operating system, Chrome OS. In truth, I don't see the Chrome Web Store gaining steam until we have devices in stores running Chrome OS -- expected sometime next year. But this is less intuitive when using a computer with existing desktop apps, browser bookmarks and other hallmarks of the existing paradigm.
