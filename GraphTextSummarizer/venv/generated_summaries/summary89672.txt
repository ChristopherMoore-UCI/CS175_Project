-- Oklahoma voters are considering an unusual question that will appear on their ballots this Tuesday: whether Islamic law can be used in considering cases in state court. "What's Sharia law have to do with Oklahoma?" Some 1,200 Muslims from India, Bangladesh, the Middle East, Africa and elsewhere participate in services at the Islamic Center of Oklahoma City, according to Quraishi The facility, founded by Oklahoma City cardiologist M.A. Shakir, has been open for about two years. "I don't think there's much of a chance of Sharia law becoming any kind of law in Oklahoma," said Price. The group is also sponsoring automated phone calls to Oklahoma voters from former CIA director and Oklahoma native James Woolsey. "Help us stop Sharia law from coming to Oklahoma."
