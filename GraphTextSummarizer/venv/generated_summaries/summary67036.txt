The U.S-led coalition and NATO -- based in Afghanistan -- have been seeking a way to effectively battle Taliban and al Qaeda militants who they believe are launching attacks from Pakistan's swath of tribal areas along the border. North Waziristan is one of seven districts within Pakistan's ungoverned tribal region along the Afghanistan border. A suspected U.S. missile from an unmanned drone killed three people Saturday in Pakistan's tribal region, according to a Pakistani military source and a North Waziristan official. On November 20, the ministry lodged a protest with Patterson against a strike in the Bannu region of Pakistan's North West Frontier Province that left five dead and seven wounded and was deeper inside Pakistani territory than previous attacks. This is the latest in a series of deadly missile strikes in Pakistan's border region over the past two months.
