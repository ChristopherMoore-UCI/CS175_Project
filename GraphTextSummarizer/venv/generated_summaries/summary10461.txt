Before Kasem's death, Jean Kasem removed her ailing husband from a care facility in Santa Monica, California, and took him to stay at the home of family friends in Washington state. Danny Deraney, the publicist for Kerri Kasem, said last summer that Jean Kasem removed her husband's body from a funeral home in Washington. Kerri Kasem was given a conservatorship over her father's health, which Jean Kasem subsequently fought in court, claiming his children were prematurely ending their father's life. "This morning my family and I learned that my Dad's abusive wife Jean Thompson Kasem and their daughter Liberty conned a cemetery in Norway into burying my Dad there," his daughter Kerri Kasem said on her Facebook page. The former host of "American Top 40" was buried December 16 at Vestre Gravlund, a cemetery in Oslo, Norway,  manager of cemetery administration Stein Olav Hohlen told CNN on Tuesday.
