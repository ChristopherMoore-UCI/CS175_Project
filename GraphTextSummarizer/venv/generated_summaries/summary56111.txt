Asked whether the covert U.S. drone war in Yemen was creating more enemies than it removed, he concluded: "Drone strikes take out a few bad guys to be sure, but they also kill a large number of innocent civilians. Drones destroy the fabric of Yemeni society. Our President may reassure the U.S. of his support for drone strikes, but he does so in complete contradiction to the Yemeni people's wishes. As usual the initial press coverage labelled the dead as "al Qaeda militants," but when the relatives threatened to deliver the bodies to the President's gates, the Yemeni government was forced to concede that all 12 people killed were civilians. The use of drones in Yemen might seem a simple, quick-fix option for Obama.
