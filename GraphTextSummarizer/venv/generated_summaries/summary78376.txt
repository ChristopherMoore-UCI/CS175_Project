The suspect also had access badges to hospitals around Florida, doctor and nurse scrubs, a respiratory technician badge, police blue lights and access stickers to Coast Guard bases around Florida, Steffens said. They intend to dig deeper to make sure nothing more sinister was at hand, New Port Richey Police Chief James Steffens said. During questioning, Antigua admitted that he had fabricated most of the credentials and items that police seized, Steffens said. Antigua has denied any criminal wrongdoing, Steffens said. Since a news conference Monday about Antigua's arrest, authorities have received more than 100 tips, Steffens said.
