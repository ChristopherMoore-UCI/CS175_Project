Watch Ziegel display his model skull Â» "The VA system is not ready, and they simply don't have time to catch up," Tammy Duckworth -- herself a wounded veteran who heads up the Illinois Department of Veteran Affairs -- told the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee in March. Many wounded veterans return home feeling that the VA system, specifically its 62-year-old disability ratings system, has failed them. Duckworth, the Illinois VA chief, knows exactly what Ziegel and other severely wounded vets are going through. Ziegel, a 25-year-old Marine sergeant, knew the dangers of war when he was deployed for his second tour in Iraq. The VA changed his head trauma injury, once rated at 10 percent, to traumatic brain injury rated at 100 percent, substantially increasing his monthly disability check.
