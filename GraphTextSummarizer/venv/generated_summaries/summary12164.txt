The vast majority of missing children are missing because they were runaways, lost, accidentally injured or gone for a variety of benign reasons (e.g., lost track of time). Many parents of long missing children understandably pray that their children are among such victims. Children can be missing for a wide variety of reasons (e.g., runaway, throwaway, lost, injured, etc.) It is simply not possible or reasonable for law enforcement to respond to every missing child case as if it were a sexually motivated nonfamily abduction. Such cases are among the most difficult, frustrating and emotionally draining for law enforcement.
