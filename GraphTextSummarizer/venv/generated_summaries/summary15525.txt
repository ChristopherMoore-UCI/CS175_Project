In the past two decades, Canada has intensified security in government buildings after a man drove a bus into Parliament Hill in 1989. Authorities investigating Wednesday's attack will likely look at why the security agencies at the parliament did not tighten security after Ottawa police received a 911 call at nearby National War Memorial.

The Royal Canadian Mounted Police -- the national police force -- covers the parliament grounds while a House security detail is in charge of buildings under the House jurisdiction. Canada came to a standstill when a gunman killed a soldier outside a war memorial in Ottawa -- then stormed into parliament, sending lawmakers hiding behind barricaded doors.
