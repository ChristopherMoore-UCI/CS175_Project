The risk factors for silent heart attacks are the same as for regular heart attacks, experts say, and include smoking, diabetes, stress and family history. Some people may have had heart attacks without knowing it, studies show. But there are silent heart attacks that do not have associated Q-waves. But experts do not recommend that people generally be screened for silent heart attacks unless they have other heart-related problems. Although the study was done on a relatively small sample of people at risk of coronary artery disease, meaning the results may not apply to the general population, other cardiologists say the study has merit in adding to the knowledge of silent heart attacks.
