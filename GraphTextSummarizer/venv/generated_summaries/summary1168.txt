Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston, head of the Joint Agency Coordination Center, described them as "fleeting, fleeting acoustic events." So the steady "pings" -- which actually sound like the snap of fingers -- could be confused with or overwhelmed by other noise, such as the waves lapping against the boat. When a Chinese patrol ship picked up two pulses in the southern Indian Ocean, the head of the Australian agency coordinating search efforts called it "an important and encouraging lead. In fact, search supervisors, citing the new analysis, are moving the focus of the search to an area that includes the location of the Haixun 01. Video of the searchers show them listening to the hydrophone with earbuds, not headsets that would block out ambient noise.
