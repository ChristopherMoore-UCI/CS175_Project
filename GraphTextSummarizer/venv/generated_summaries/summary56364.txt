Teams Bellkor (AT&T Research), Big Chaos and Pragmatic Theory combined to form Bellkor's Pragmatic Chaos, the first team to qualify for the prize on June 26 with a 10.05 percent improvement over Netflix's existing algorithm. Netflix says it will announce the winner of its $1 million Netflix Prize at an event September 21. A Netflix spokeswoman told us, "We are definitely going to touch on the methodology in the press conference," and offered to let us interview Netflix executives to find out more about how they picked the winner. The company must also determine whether the winning team's results are reproducible, meaning that its algorithm handles new data as well as it did the test data. Before Sept. 21, Netflix must decide (assuming they haven't done so already) which of the two qualifying teams has the best algorithm based on how they score on various undisclosed tests.
