In a study published recently in the journal Cerebral Cortex, researcher Steven Cramer found that people with a certain gene variant performed more than 30 percent worse on a driving test than people without it. However in people who have the gene variation that Cramer studied, BDNF secretion is limited. "I'd be curious to know the genetics of people who get into car crashes," Cramer said. The next time you see a motorist obliviously straddling two lanes, don't fault bad driving, but genetics. "These people make more errors from the get-go, and they forget more of what they learned after time away," Cramer said in a statement.
