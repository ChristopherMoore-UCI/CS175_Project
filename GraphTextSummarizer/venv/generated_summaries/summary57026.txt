Brandon's brother is from Atlanta and went in May to stay with his brother for the summer, Kitsap County Deputy Sheriff Scott Wilson said. Brandon Gunn, 27, and his wife Viviana, 34, are in the Kitsap County Jail outside Seattle on $500,000 bail each, charged with kidnapping, unlawful imprisonment and four counts of assault, county prosecutor Cami Lewis said. The boy said the couple called the abuse "punishment sessions" for not doing chores or breaking household rules, and that the "sessions" would last for two to three hours, according to Deputy Sheriff Wilson. They saw injuries to the boy's head, face, chest, abdomen, back, arms, legs, hands and feet, ranging from fresh open wounds to wounds that were in the process of healing, the certificate of probable cause says. "In the first six hours they were able to develop enough probable cause for the arrest of the brother and the brother's wife," Wilson said.
