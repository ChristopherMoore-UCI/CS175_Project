Michael Pirie, 18, and Grant Lockenbach, 20, both died Saturday of what appears to be hypothermia, David Ashburn, director of Walker County emergency services, said late Sunday. Walker County Sheriff Steve Wilson said affiliate WTVC that Pirie and Lockenbach broke away from the group and decided to explore by themselves. "Both passed away in Ellison's Cave in Walker County and their bodies are at the state medical examiner's office now," Ashburn said. Lockenbach was president of the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, which held a prayer service for the two students Sunday night, the Orlando Sentinel reported. Pirie was also a member of FCA and played in the University of Florida Drumline.
