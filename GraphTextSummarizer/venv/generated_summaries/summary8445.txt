This settlement demonstrates BP's continued progress in resolving significant issues related to the Deepwater Horizon accident,'' said BP Chief Executive Bob Dudley. -- BP announced Wednesday it has reached a class-action settlement with attorneys representing thousands of businesses and individuals who made claims after the 2010 oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Oil spewed into the sea for nearly three months before a cap was placed on the BP-owned Macondo well, nearly a mile beneath the surface. BP and Halliburton sued each other in April 2011, each claiming the other was to blame for the deadly explosion and resulting leak. BP has asked a court to delay a liability trial until it decides whether to grant final approval to the agreements.
