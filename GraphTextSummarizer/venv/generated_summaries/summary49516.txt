Luisa Chan, a mother of two, died in the blaze, said Mario Alvarado, a member of Jovenes Cristianos -- Christian Youth, a church with about 200 members, most of them Guatemalan immigrants, on 17th Avenue in Brooklyn. At Chan's church, members in mourning were waiting Monday for more information from authorities, Alvarado said. Thirteen firefighters sustained minor injuries. "People are all concerned and very sad," said Maria Luz de Zyriek, the Guatemalan consul in New York. A 2-month-old baby was in critical condition, fire officials said, but the child was not immediately identified; three other people sustained injuries ranging from serious to minor.
