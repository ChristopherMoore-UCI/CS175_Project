Dusek believes Mickelson still has the game to challenge for more titles -- and more majors. -- There is much debate in the world of golf as to whether four-time major winner Phil Mickelson deserves his place in the game's Hall of Fame, but journalist David Dusek is in no doubt. Fowler finally comes of age with first PGA Tour title But Dusek disagrees and thinks the player -- known affectionately by fans as "Lefty" -- still has a few major championships left in the tank. "If Tiger Woods wasn't there Phil and many other players, like Ernie Els, would have won more titles. "Mickelson showed on the PGA Tour (at Pebble Beach) that he is capable of playing fantastic golf," he said.
