In this clutter, especially with so many entertainment options, it's hard to break through and remain in front year after year after year. In the early 2000s, the United States and some other economies dipped in the months and years after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. For eight years running, the Fox network show topped the Nielsen charts as the nation's most watched program, year in and year out. Then again, sometimes that happens when you're hundreds of years old. Still, "American Idol" could take solace having already left other legendary TV shows -- "Seinfeld," "All in the Family" and "M*A*S*H" among them -- in its wake.
