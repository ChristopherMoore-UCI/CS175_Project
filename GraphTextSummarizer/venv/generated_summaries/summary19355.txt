Three candidates have so far stated their intention to challenge Blatter;  Frenchman Jerome Champagne, Prince Ali Bin Al Hussein of Jordan and former star footballer David Ginola. Sepp Blatter has issued a defiant message to his rivals for the FIFA presidency and challenged European governing body UEFA to put up a candidate of its own in the election later this year. Criticism reached a fever pitch when the man hired to investigate the bidding process for those World Cups, U.S. lawyer Michael Garcia, resigned in protest last year, unhappy that the published summary did not accurately reflect his findings. But perhaps at odds with his other comments, Blatter also called for unity in football, effectively inviting UEFA to put up or shut up. If I win the better, if I lose ok!" A UEFA spokesman told CNN Sunday that they had no immediate comment to make over Blatter's remarks.
