Jonas Cuarón, son of Mexican director Alfonso Cuarón, with his girlfriend, Eireann Harper, who starred in "Año Uña." Jonás Cuarón has put his own to much better use -- the 25-year-old son of Mexican director Alfonso Cuarón has turned his collection of family photographs into a feature film. Watch Jonás Cuarón talking about "Ano Uno." Amongst those engrossed by "Año Uña" are some of contemporary Mexican cinema's most iconic figures. Unlike "Año Uña," the project involved a more traditional form of collaboration between Jonás as director Alfonso as producer. The final product is a most unusual film -- a montage of stills, brought to life through a mixture of dialogue, narration and sound effects.
