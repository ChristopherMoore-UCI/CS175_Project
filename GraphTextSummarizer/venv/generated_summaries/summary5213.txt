-- The head of the U.S. Coast Guard and a congressman planned to travel to the Coast Guard Academy on Thursday to speak to cadets about the discovery this summer of two small hangman's nooses on Coast Guard properties. Coast Guard Commandant Adm. Thad Allen, seen in a file photo, planned to address cadets on Thursday. The so-called "Jena 6" case began about a year ago when white students in a small Louisiana town hung nooses from a schoolyard tree after black students sat under it. Last week, after the incidents became public, academy superintendent Rear Adm. J. Scott Burhoe ordered the Coast Guard Investigative Service to investigate further. The last thing you want are your leaders not being tolerant," Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Maryland, told CNN before heading for the academy with Coast Guard Commandant Adm. Thad Allen.
