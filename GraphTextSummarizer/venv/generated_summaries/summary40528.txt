Even the players and president of Real Madrid, Barcelona's fiercest rival, showed public support for Abidal while he was laid up in a hospital bed following the operation, which took place just days after the tumor had been found. Teams wore t-shirts urging Abidal a quick recovery, Twitter and Facebook were awash with good wishes and television pictures showed Barcelona fans singing his name in the 22nd minute of each half -- the shirt number which he wore with such distinction. Abidal again made a heroic comeback, returning to action a year later on April 6, 2013 as Barcelona went on to regain the Spanish league title from Real. He began his professional career in the Principality, before going on to play for Lille and hometown club Lyon, where he won the French title in each of his three seasons before joining Barcelona for $16 million in 2007. Such was Abidal's willpower that he did indeed return to the Barca side -- making a substitute appearance against Real Madrid on May 3.
