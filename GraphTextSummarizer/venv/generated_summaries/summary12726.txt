But some users of Android 4.2, the system's newest update, are complaining they can't note December dates in the app because its calendar skips from November to January. It said: "We discovered a bug in the Android 4.2 update, which makes it impossible to enter December events in optional fields of the People app (this bug did not affect Calendar). Rest assured, this will be fixed soon so that those of you with December birthdays and anniversaries won't be forgotten by your friends and family." The bug does not affect the Calendar app in Android 4.2 -- nicknamed Jelly Bean -- where December is still alive and well. But that didn't stop the snarky headlines after it was discovered that a buggy app in the new version of Google's mobile operating system omits the month of December.
