"I understand from President Ouattara that he wants President Gbagbo to go on trial in Ivory Coast," said the U.N. official. "We will stand by Ivory Coast and its people by immediately starting to work with the government of President Ouattara to support him in getting the country on the right track towards reconciliation, democracy, economic recovery and sustainable development," he said. The organization will airlift food from Niger and Mali into western Ivory Coast and Monrovia, Liberia, as part of a plan to transport 15,000 metric tons of cereals, vegetable oil and other items, it said in a statement. Gbagbo rejected an offer to teach at an American university and have supporters in Ouattara's cabinet, as well as immunity from International Criminal Court prosecution, an African diplomat with knowledge of the situation told CNN Tuesday. Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga, who served as the African Union's main negotiator in Ivory Coast, said he hopes Ouattara will be merciful as president.
