Performers and venues determine show length as well as ticket prices (generally $10-$15); many shows have pay-what-you-will performances. Most festivals sell buttons or badges for a small fee that act as a festival pass; individual shows are priced separately. Those are just two of the performances on tap at fringe festivals this summer. Buttons are $9; show tickets are $3-$11. Like New York, this festival is busy, encompassing 1,200 performances; it's also high stakes, with commercial producers and casting agents scouting around (festival alums include Bradley Cooper and Mindy Kaling).
