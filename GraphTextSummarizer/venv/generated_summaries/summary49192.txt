-- Siberia's Lake Baikal, the world's largest and most biologically diverse lake, faces the prospect of severe ecological disruption as a result of climate change, according to team of U.S. and Russian scientists. Shortened periods of ice cover and changes in the ice's transparency may also harm the Baikal seal, the lake's top predator and the world's only exclusively freshwater seal. Shorter periods of ice cover is expected to slow the growth of the lake's algae, the authors say; the organisms bloom under the ice in springtime and are highly dependent on ice cover for their reproduction and growth. The report's authors say Lake Baikal's climate has become measurably milder over recent decades, and that annual precipitation is expected to increase. Lake Baikal's algae are particularly vulnerable to expected reductions in the length of time the lake is frozen each winter.
