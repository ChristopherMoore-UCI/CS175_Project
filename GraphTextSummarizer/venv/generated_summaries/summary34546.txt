Netflix CEO Reed Hastings said the split will better serve customers in the long run because each company will be able to better focus on one type of service. Along with Netflix compatibility, Apple lets you purchase and rent movies from its iTunes media store, along with the ability to buy TV shows (due to lack of customer demand, Apple discontinued TV show rentals last month). Titles available the same day they're released on DVD, unlike other services that require waiting periods. Smaller media selection compared to other existing services. Rentals and purchases stay on par with most other services, settling in the $1 to $5 range for rentals, and upwards of $5 for purchases.
