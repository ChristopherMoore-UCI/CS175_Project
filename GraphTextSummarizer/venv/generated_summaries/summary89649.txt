" Yet, Baxter said that the annual Small Business Saturday is just the beginning of American Express' effort to build up small businesses. According to Cinda Baxter, American Express retail expert and former small business owner, Black Friday has evolved to exclude smaller merchants. " To boost small business sales, American Express held its first-ever Small Business Saturday, where consumers are encouraged to spend locally. Baxter said Small Business Saturday is an opportunity for American Express to flex its financial muscle to help out local economies. To motivate consumers, American Express gave a $25 credit to 100,000 card members who register their card and use it to shop on Small Business Saturday.
