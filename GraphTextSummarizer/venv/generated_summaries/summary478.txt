At the final whistle there were unsavory scenes as Milan midfielder Gennaro Gatusso clashed with Tottenham assistant coach Joe Jordan, headbutting the former Scottish international. Earlier in the second half, Tottenham goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes produced two wonder saves to keep AC Milan at bay, both from Mario Yepes. A late goal from Peter Crouch stunned seven-time European champions AC Milan as Tottenham Hotspur secured a 1-0 win in the San Siro on Tuesday night. After Crouch's 80th minute goal, Milan went in desperate search of an equalizer and Robinho's close range effort was blocked by the excellent Michael Dawson. Tottenham had the better of the first half with the home side handicapped by the loss of goalkeeper Christian Abbiati, who was taken to hospital with a head injury after being stretchered off after a awkward fall.
