-- British Prime Minister David Cameron congratulated the country's cricket team Friday after it beat Australia on Aussie home turf in a series of matches for cricket's historic Ashes trophy. The Ashes is a symbolic trophy that dates back to 1882, when Australia beat England on U.K. soil for the first time and a British newspaper ran a tongue-in-cheek "obituary" saying cricket had died and the body would be cremated and the ashes sent to Australia. England overwhelmed their arch rivals in three Tests, winning each by an innings, the most decisive manner of victory in cricket. It was the first time in 24 years that England clinched an Ashes series win in Australia. In a rivalry that started in 1877, England and Australia play for the Ashes every two years, alternating between the two countries.
