" Back on the protest route, police faced threats to their safety as violent people amid the protest made threatening remarks "about shooting police, about burning down the town," Johnson said. Johnson bristled at the suggestion that police were responsible for or ambivalent about the fire, saying numerous residents "stood there for 11 minutes watching it burn." Across town, about 2 miles from the normal protest route, a museum and custard shop called the Whistle Stop was set on fire, and "gasoline appears to have been poured around that facility," Johnson said. Officers will continue to strive to protect public safety as well as the freedoms of speech and expression, Johnson said, but if certain violent elements among the protesters -- and he stressed that most of the demonstrators were, indeed, peaceful -- authorities will have no choice but to respond. -- Five people were arrested as tensions flared again in Ferguson, Missouri, with people threatening officers, shooting at them, throwing rocks and bottles, and one person tossing a Molotov cocktail at a parking structure, police say.
