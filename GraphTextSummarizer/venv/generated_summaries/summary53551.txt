The book deal comes after Williams' recent Grammy wins including best pop solo performance and best music video for his hit song, "Happy." After Williams signed the book deal for "Happy!" with Putnam Books for Young Readers, three more books were negotiated with the soon-to-be children's author. It comes as no surprise that Grammy-award winning artist Pharrell Williams has signed a deal for a book inspired by his song "Happy." Be it the music he makes, the songs he sings or the vintage Vivienne Westwood hat he sports, Williams is constantly coming up with original ideas that stick. "I'm humbled by the global success of 'Happy,' but especially in awe of the song's young fans," Williams said in a press release announcing the deal.
