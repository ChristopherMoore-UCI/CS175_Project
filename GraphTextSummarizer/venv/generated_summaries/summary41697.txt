Only Andre Agassi and Rafael Nadal have achieved the feat of claiming a full set of grand slam titles and backed it it with Olympic gold in the singles. Bolt became a household name with his gold medal win in the 2008 Beijing Games. Ryan Cochrane of Canada finished second, while Oussama Mellouli of Tunisia took bronze. Sunday's events follow an action-packed Saturday that saw the host nation rake in six wins, bringing its gold medal count to 14. Meanwhile, the U.S. leads the gold medal count with 26 among its 54 total medals.
