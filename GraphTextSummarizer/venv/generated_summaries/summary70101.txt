In July 2006, Bedell got into an altercation with Matthew Bedell and signed a citizen's arrest to have him taken to jail and booked, Hill said. On the social networking Web site LinkedIn, a profile page for a J. Patrick Bedell in the San Francisco Bay Area -- where Bedell's family lives -- described him as an "MSEE student," short for Master of Science in Electrical Engineering. Bedell "was very well dressed in a suit" and showed "no distress in his appearance" as he approached a screening area to enter Pentagon grounds about 6:40 p.m. Thursday evening, Pentagon Police Chief Richard S. Keevill said. The Texas Highway patrolman used Bedell's cell phone to call Bedell's family, Hill said. Bedell had been committed to mental institutions at least three or four times, according to Hill.
