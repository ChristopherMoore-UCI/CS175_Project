-- Wilmot Greene sat among charred remains of his iconic Georgia Theatre recalling the fire that reduced it from an alternative rock icon to rusted steel girders and walls of black bricks. "The Georgia Theatre was the scene of many great nights of music and fun for me, both as a player and a fan of music. Benefit concerts have raised some money, most notably a Zac Brown show at Atlanta's Fox Theatre last year. The club had a vast open floor where hundreds of sweaty music fans would dance the night away and a balcony upstairs for those that wanted to just sit back and enjoy the show.
