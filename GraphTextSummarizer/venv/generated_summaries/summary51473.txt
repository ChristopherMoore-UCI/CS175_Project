The blast occurred as the provincial leader of the Awami National Party, part of Pakistan's coalition government, took the stage to speak, said Wazir Khan Nasar, a police official in Quetta. -- A bomb planted on a bicycle at a political rally in southwestern Pakistan's volatile Balochistan province killed seven people and wounded 12 on Friday, a senior police official said. While there was no immediate claim of responsibility, authorities believe Kasi was targeted because of his party's platform opposing extremism in Pakistan. Its strongholds are in Balochistan and Sindh provinces. The provincial leader, Aurangzaib Kasi, was among the wounded, he said.
