"This calendar is meant to capture the best of those `snapshots' all in one place while also continuing to raise funds for the work that our police do." The foundation's website invites Watertown residents to submit photos of the "dramatic confrontation with the Marathon bombing suspects, pursuit and arrest." Leaked photos of the younger Tsarnaev's capture landed a Massachusetts State Police photographer in hot water back in July. -- April 19 was perhaps the most harrowing day in the history of Watertown, Massachusetts -- the suburb where the manhunt for Boston Marathon bombing suspects Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev came to separate, bloodied conclusions. A wounded Dzhokhar Tsarnaev surrendered later that evening from a boat parked in a Watertown yard. Interesting photos, compelling photos, preferably positive photos of the pride we all have in our Watertown Police and our town. "While we will never be able to put into words our gratitude for what our police did, we can try to let the photos from that night in April speak for themselves," Watertown Police Foundation board member Steve Messina said in a statement.
