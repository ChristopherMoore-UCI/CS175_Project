The 47th Annual CMA Awards opened with a musical number that parodied a real-life "feud," pitting the Zac Brown Band's frontman against supporters of chart topper Luke Bryan -- reportedly because Brown had criticized Bryan's latest single in a radio interview. Shelton also picked up his first win for album of the year Wednesday night, but "The Voice" star was aced out as entertainer of the year by sentimental favorite George Strait, who last won that title in 1990. Kacey Musgraves was named new artist of the year, while Florida Georgia Line nabbed duo of the year and single of the year for the summertime smash "Cruise." -- The Country Music Association Awards show is billed as "Country Music's Biggest Night" -- and it certainly was for married stars Blake Shelton and Miranda Lambert, who cemented their status as Nashville's golden couple by winning male and female vocalist of the year for the fourth year in a row. And at the tender age of 23, Taylor Swift received the CMA's prestigious Pinnacle Award for achieving global success and recognition unique to country music.
