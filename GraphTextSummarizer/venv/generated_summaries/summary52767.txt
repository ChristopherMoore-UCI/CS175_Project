My team is now investigating the cellular effects of love, testing whether people who build more micro-moments of love in daily life also build healthier immune cells. If we reimagine love as micro-moments of shared positivity, it can seem like love requires that you always feel happy. Your body has the built-in ability to "catch" the emotions of those around you, making your prospects for love -- defined as micro-moments of positivity resonance -- nearly limitless. My research team and I recently learned that when we randomly assign one group of people to learn ways to create more micro-moments of love in daily live, we lastingly improve the function of the vagus nerve, a key conduit that connects your brain to your heart. The radical shift we need to make is this: Love, as your body experiences it, is a micro-moment of connection shared with another.
