FAMU trustees and school officials have taken numerous steps to strengthen rules against hazing since Champion's death, including setting up an independent panel of experts to investigate hazing allegations. The count accusing FAMU of wrongful death says the FAMU Board of Trustees owed Champion "a duty of care" and knew, or should have known, that the band engaged in conduct that violated laws and school policies. "Instead, Mr. Champion allowed himself to be subjected to an act of hazing known as a 'hot seat,' during which he allowed his adult body to be deprived of oxygen, punched, kicked and hit with objects," the court documents say. "The Champion family is shocked at the defense FAMU has chosen in the brutal hazing death of Robert Champion," family attorney Christopher Chestnut said. It also argues that band members "were under the control of FAMU at all times" during the weekend when Champion died.
