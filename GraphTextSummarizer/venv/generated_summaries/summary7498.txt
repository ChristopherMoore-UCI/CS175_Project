Bradford City, currently in the fourth tier of English football, stunned Premier League Aston Villa with a 3-1 win in the first leg of their semifinal in the League Cup just weeks after toppling the mighty Arsenal. A despondent Paul Lambert said his young Villa side weren't good enough to match their supposedly inferior opponents on the night. Villa are owned by Randy Lerner, the American businessman who recently sold the Cleveland Browns NFL franchise. Their manager Phil Parkinson told Sky Sports: "To beat Aston Villa 3-1 is outstanding achievement, we played so well. The club are now just 90 minutes away from their first major final since they lifted the FA Cup back in 1911, if they can successfully negotiate the second leg at Villa Park on January 22.
