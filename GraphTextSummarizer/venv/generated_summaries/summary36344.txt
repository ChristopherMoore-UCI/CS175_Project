-- Jacobo Arbenz was overthrown as president of Guatemala in a CIA-backed coup in 1954, a seminal event that historians say set the Central American country on a path of dictatorships and civil war that would last for decades. Arbenz, in an effort to reduce income inequality in the country, instituted a land reform program that would have taken unused United Fruit Company land and turned it over to farmers. This week, 57 years later, current President Alvaro Colom made a public apology to the Arbenz family, a large gesture in Guatemala. Even though he was democratically elected and popular at the time, after Arbenz was deposed, his reputation was ruined and he was written out of Guatemala's history books. The State Department said that its embassy in Guatemala was preparing a statement regarding Arbenz, but as of Saturday it had not been released.
