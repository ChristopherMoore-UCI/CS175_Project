" McGregor has kept in touch with Monteith's on-and-off-screen love interest, Lea Michele, and said the actress reaches out to her via text messages and e-mails. Three months before his death in 2013, Monteith voluntarily checked himself into a treatment center to seek help for substance abuse. Monteith's mother, Ann McGregor, sat down with ABC's "Good Morning America" on Thursday, saying that she's only recently been able to come to terms with Monteith's passing.
