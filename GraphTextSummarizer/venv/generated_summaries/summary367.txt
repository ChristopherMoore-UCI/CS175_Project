Michelle and Jim Bob Duggar, stars of TLC's "19 Kids and Counting," are expecting their 20th child this spring. "She has been getting on an elliptical for about an hour a day and is very careful of what she eats." Michelle, who is under the care of a high-risk pregnancy doctor, says she is being cautious, eating a lot of protein and green vegetables and abstaining from caffeine. Josie's medical drama -- and Michelle's own fight for survival -- was documented throughout their TV series. The special "Duggars World Tour: Scotland & Ireland," showing a newly pregnant Michelle traveling to Europe with the whole family, premieres November 13, at 8 p.m. on TLC. She was born following Michelle's preeclampsia diagnosis at a mere 25 weeks, weighing only 1lb., 6 oz.
