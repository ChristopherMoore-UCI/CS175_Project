There is a six-way tie for second a shot behind Baldwin -- with his compatriot Gary Boyd, Dutchman Joost Luiten, Scott Strange of Australia, Jean-Baptiste Gonnet from France, Swede Fredrik Andersson-Hed and South African Jbe Kruger all hot on his heels. -- He became the youngest player in European Tour golf history after teeing off at the China Open and Guan Tian-Lang's record-breaking round was below par -- but not in a good way. He made three bogeys and one double bogey in his first six holes and ended the day 12 shots behind leader Matthew Baldwin, from England. But despite Guan's baptism of fire, playing partner Marcus Fraser, who ended the day two shots off Baldwin, said the schoolboy has a bright future ahead of him. Guan will have his work cut out if he is to catch 25-year-old Baldwin at the top of the leaderboard, after his bogey-free opening round.
