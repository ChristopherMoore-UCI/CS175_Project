At issue was whether Krupski should have sued Costa Cruises or Costa Crociere SpA in federal court. On Monday, Justice Sonia Sotomayor was announcing the court's opinion in Krupski v. Costa Crociere SpA (09-337), a lesser-known appeal dealing with the scope of the right to file an amended lawsuit to correct a mistake in a party's identity. Costa Cruises is a British and American-owned firm based in Genoa, Italy, where it is registered as Costa Crociere SpA. "Costa Cruises responded that she should have sued a related company called Costa ... "Costa Crociere should have known that Krupski's failure to name it as a defendant in her original complaint was due to a mistake concerning the proper party's identity," Sotomayor said, with admirable pronunciation.
