Locals may see a new building and go "Oh, its Barn Light, they're getting bigger again," Barn Light's communications coordinator Betty Lynne said. By 2008, when recession caused many small businesses to close shop, the Scotts left their day jobs to grow the business, Barn Light Electric Company. The Scotts, both 48, left careers in law enforcement and nursing to focus on Barn Light. They've been married for 29 years, Scott said, and building Barn Light made them stronger.
