That made Elizabeth's stuttering father George king, and Elizabeth became queen when he died aged 56 following a lung operation. Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, as she was known once George VI died, lived to be 101. Two new photographs of the queen were released Monday as part of the Diamond Jubilee celebrations, showing her wearing a necklace worn by Queen Victoria in her own Diamond Jubilee portrait in 1897. Celebrations of her Diamond Jubilee, marking six decades on the throne, officially begin Monday and continue through June, when London will mark the anniversary of her coronation with festivities including up to 1,000 boats sailing up the River Thames. The British monarch has no political power but Elizabeth has immense power as a figurehead.
