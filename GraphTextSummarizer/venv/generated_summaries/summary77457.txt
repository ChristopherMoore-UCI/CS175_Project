It's one of only eight new hotel additions to AAA's exclusive Five Diamond list of resorts and restaurants, the travel company announced Friday. The ratings come from on-the-ground inspections by the AAA team of inspectors, who visit about 1,200 hotels and restaurants weekly. The list is made up of only 0.3 percent of the more than 58,000 AAA Diamond-rated hotels and restaurants.
