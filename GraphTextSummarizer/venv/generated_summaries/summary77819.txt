Wesleyan University officials announced Monday that residential fraternities will be required to accept women and men as full members. The policy change comes after consulting fraternity members, alumni and faculty, university spokesperson Kate Carlisle said. Delta Kappa Epsilon International Fraternity, the organization's national governing body, said it "strongly" disagreed with the decision, calling the university's justification for the decision "vague." "Remarkably absent from the University's statement are any facts -- even opinions -- about why Wesleyan feels it will be better off with co-educational fraternities. Wesleyan's board of trustees asked President Michael S. Roth in May to "prepare a plan to address the future of Greek life" after "highly publicized incidents of sexual violence." "The trustees and administration recognize that residential fraternities have contributed greatly to Wesleyan over a long period of time, but we also believe they must change to continue to benefit their members and the larger campus community," Roth and Joshua Boger, the chair of the university's board of trustees, wrote in a joint statement on Monday.
