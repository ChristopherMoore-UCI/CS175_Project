It appears that technology giant Samsung is handing out free Galaxy S smartphones to iPhone 4 owners frustrated by reception problems. Samsung is so confident about the superiority of the Galaxy S that they're sending free ones to existing iPhone customers so they can decide for themselves. It's entirely possible that Samsung has taken a gamble that getting a few of the devices out in the wild, so that people can see and play with them, will be worth the initial outlay in terms of the effect they'll have on sales. We decided to contact a cross section of individuals to offer them a free Samsung Galaxy S as a replacement, as we're confident that once people have the phone in their hands, they'll see how impressive it is for themselves." Imagine my surprise, then, when this morning I am tweeted by Samsung offering me a free Galaxy S, their latest phone.
