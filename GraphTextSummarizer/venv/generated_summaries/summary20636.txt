-- Kenya's plan to use its judiciary to try perpetrators of post-election violence reneges on an earlier pledge to use an independent tribunal, Human Rights Watch said Monday. "Bringing justice to these victims is the most urgent test of the coalition government's willingness to resolve Kenya's crisis," said Georgette Gagnon, Africa director at Human Rights Watch. "It will undertake accelerated and far-reaching reforms in the judiciary, police and investigative arms of government to enable them investigate, prosecute and try perpetrators of post-election violence locally," he said. In a statement to announce the decision after a Cabinet meeting, President Mwai Kibaki said that the government was ready to pursue national healing. "An independent domestic court with international participation remains the best option to start establishing accountability, and the government should immediately adopt legislation to establish the special tribunal," Human Rights Watch said in a statement.
