"They'll be bringing in equipment and moving cars out of the room, before they start work on the sinkhole," said museum spokeswoman Katie Frassinelli. This week General Motors and Chevrolet unveiled the 2009 ZR1 Blue Devil -- the first of three damaged cars that will be restored from a disaster that stunned Corvette fans around the world. An agreement with GM allows the museum to keep the insurance money for the Blue Devil and Spyder -- which are both owned by GM -- in addition to paying to fix the Blue Devil, the 1962 Black Corvette and the 1992 1 Millionth, Frassinelli said. A special team of hotshot Corvette restorers has dealt a blow against an evil sinkhole that desecrated the National Corvette Museum in Bowling Green, Kentucky. It's not often car restorers get a chance to rescue a vehicle this special.
