-- Occupy London protesters who have been camped outside the landmark St. Paul's Cathedral for the past four months lost their court bid to avoid eviction Wednesday in a decision made by London's Court of Appeal. Last month, the High Court ruled in favor of the City of London Corporation, the body that runs London's financial district, which applied for an eviction order after the protesters failed to abide by a previous order to pack up the camp. "Peaceful protest is a democratic right but the camp is clearly in breach of highway and planning law," said Stuart Fraser, policy chairman for the City of London Corporation." The Occupy London group then filed an appeal against the ruling at the Court of Appeal. The activists, who set up camp outside the cathedral October 15, had been protesting against corporate greed and economic inequality.
