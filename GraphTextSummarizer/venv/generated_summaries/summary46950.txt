Madison Keys -- who sent Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova packing -- reached her first grand slam quarterfinal by beating compatriot Madison Brengle 6-2 6-4. Venus Williams, too, hadn't beaten a top-10 player at a major since the 2010 U.S. Open. And she left in good spirits, since Venus Williams upset sixth-seed Agnieszka Radwanska 6-3 2-6 6-1 to make a first grand slam quarterfinal in five years. It was also the first time Nishikori defeated Ferrer in straight sets, his previous six victories all going the distance. For the third straight match, women's top-seed Serena Williams survived an early wobble to progress.
