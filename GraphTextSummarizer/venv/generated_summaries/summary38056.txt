"Victims of sexual assault need to know that they can seek medical care without the concern that reports will be made to police or campus officials without their consent. According to the ESPN report, in February 2010, after a night out drinking with friends, Courey said she went home with a former university football player -- off-campus -- and had consensual sex. "People were telling us that she had been raped and she wrote it in her journal," said Lynn Courey, Courey's mother. "The University did the right thing" School officials say they later discovered and turned over to Courey's parents a transcript of Courey's conversation with the rape counselor. According to Title IX, a federal law that guarantees college men and women are protected equally on campus, universities are legally required to investigate allegations of rape -- even if the alleged victim is no longer alive.
