Among those selected this year is Eugenio Merino, a controversial artist whose latest exhibitions have included mannequins of dead leaders -- including Spain's General Francisco Franco -- stuffed inside refrigerators, and one of President George W. Bush in the shape of a punch bag. The Andalucian village's immaculate streets of whitewashed houses -- and its contemporary art museum -- are now filled with dozens of works of art. The offer is open only to artists who must produce sculptures or other work during their stay, and bequeath at least one to the village. The beautiful southern Spanish village of Genalguacil is offering free accommodation for more than two weeks during the summer peak season. Artists are offered cottages or other accommodation and all the materials they need to produce their work.
