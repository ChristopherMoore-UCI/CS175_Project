The per capita rate is one of the highest in the country, said Todd Landry, director of the Division of Children and Family Services for the Department of Health and Human Services, "I think this has spurred some really healthy conversations about how do parents get the help that they need when they are struggling with some of these parenting issues," he said. There are 6,600 children in state custody in Nebraska, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. " Safe-haven laws allow distraught parents who fear their children are in imminent danger to drop them off at hospitals without being charged with abandonment. State legislators have expressed concern that, if the law is not changed, Nebraska's social services system will be overwhelmed by older children delivered by parents from around the country who find they are unable to provide proper care. Thirty-five children have been dropped off at Nebraska hospitals since the law was enacted.
