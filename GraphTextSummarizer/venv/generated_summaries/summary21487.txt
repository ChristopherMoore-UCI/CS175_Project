Like Mubarak, Shafik is a former air force officer with close ties to Egypt's powerful military, "the quintessential candidate of the counter-revolution," in the words of Khaled Elgindy, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington. As a result, Shafik is supported by many of those who lost out as a result of Mubarak's removal from power, said Omar Ashour, director of Middle East studies at the University of Exeter in England, who is currently in Cairo. Shafik, who briefly served as prime minister in the waning days of Mubarak's presidency, is one of two candidates to advance from the country's first round of presidential voting in May. As Egyptians rose up against Mubarak in January 2011, the man who had led the country so long that he was nicknamed "Pharaoh" shuffled his government ministers one last time, promoting Shafik from civil aviation minister to prime minister. On Thursday, Egypt's highest court ruled cleared the way for Shafik to participate in the runoff after invalidating a law that barred former members of Mubarak's regime from running in the election.
