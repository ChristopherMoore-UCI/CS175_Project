Israel will provide officials for the other two, with Meir Levy to referee Hamilton Accies v St Mirren and Eli Hacmon taking charge of Kilmarnock-Aberdeen, also on Saturday. -- This weekend's Scottish football fixtures have been curtailed as overseas officials scheduled to cover for striking referees decided not to help out. Luxembourg's Alain Hamer will referee two Scottish Premier League matches in two days as he takes charge of second-placed Celtic's home clash with Inverness and defending champions Rangers' trip to Dundee United. The 44-year-old Hamer has a decade of experience in Europe's top club competition, the Champions League, and has refereed Scotland matches at international level. Scotland's category one officials decided earlier this week that they would stand down in protest against increasing levels of criticism from players, managers and the media.
