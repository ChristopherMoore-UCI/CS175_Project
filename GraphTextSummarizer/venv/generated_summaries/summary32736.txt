Kashif Irfan, left, and his brother Atif Irfan were among family members removed from the flight Thursday. The dispute occurred about 1 p.m. Thursday as Atif Irfan and his brother Kashif Irfan boarded AirTran flight 175 at Reagan National Airport near Washington for a trip to Orlando, Florida. The families of Atif Irfan, a tax attorney, and his brother Kashif Irfan, an anesthesiologist, were removed from a flight in Washington before takeoff Thursday after a passenger reported hearing Atif Irfan's wife say something suspicious. After the FBI interviewed family members, the agency released them, Irfan said. Family members said Friday they had not decided whether to accept AirTran's apology, saying there were a variety of opinions.
