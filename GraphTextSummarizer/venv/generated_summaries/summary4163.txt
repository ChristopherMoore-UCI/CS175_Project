The petition claims that daughter Julie Kasem and her husband, Dr. Jamil Aboulhosn, have been unable to check on Kasem's health even though her father signed papers in 2007 giving them the power of attorney over his heath care in the event he was unable to make his own health decisions. Kerri Kasem and other members of the family held a protest at Kasem's Holmby Hills house to raise public attention to their dispute last month. Kasem's daughter Julie Kasem and her husband filed a conservatorship petition in a Los Angeles court last month, claiming the retired radio host "has been isolated from his daughters, friends and other family" by his wife. Daughter Kerri Kasem said last month that her stepmother suddenly barred her sister, her uncle and some of Kasem's friends from seeing him about three months ago. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Lesley Green ruled Tuesday that Kasem, 81, was being well cared for by his wife, Jean Kasem.
