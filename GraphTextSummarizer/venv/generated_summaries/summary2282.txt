But Democratic candidate Chad Taylor's abrupt decision to drop out of the Kansas race last month transformed the election here into an unexpected head-to-head contest between Roberts and independent Greg Orman. Ruby red Kansas has not elected a Democrat to the Senate in over 80 years, but Roberts is under attack for a cardinal sin in politics -- losing touch with the people back home. The Kansas-based Koch brothers, who have so far engaged minimally here, are poised to step up their efforts to help Sen. Pat Roberts, according to sources familiar with their plans. Brian Baker, who runs the group, tells CNN they saw polling that showed Roberts in trouble, and worry that his opponent, independent Orman, is really an "Democrat masquerading as an Independent." Baker was an aide to former Kansas Senator Bob Dole, a close friend of Roberts who is working behind the scenes as well as in public to pull Roberts over the finish line.
