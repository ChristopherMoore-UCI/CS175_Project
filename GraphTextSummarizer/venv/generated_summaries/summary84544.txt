Online donations to the organization have surpassed $3 million, according to the WFP statement, but the financial goal for efforts to help refugees in the Horn of Africa remains $250 million short of current needs. On Monday evening, a cargo aircraft landed in Nairobi with ,"Plumpy Sup," a high nutrient substance designed to feed malnourished children under age five, according to WFP officials. The largest agency in the fight against worldwide hunger is increasing its efforts to assist millions of people affected by famine and drought in the Horn of Africa. The U.N. declared famine in five areas of southern Somalia in June, including Mogadishu. The agency is working to deliver at least 14,000 metric tons (more than 15,000 U.S. tons) of energy and nutrient rich resources to help feed starving refugees in region.
