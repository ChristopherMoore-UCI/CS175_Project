-- Former Ivory Coast President Laurent Gbagbo arrived Wednesday at the International Criminal Court in The Hague to stand trial for his role in his country's post-election violence that killed thousands. The court charged Gbagbo with four counts of crimes against humanity, "namely murder, rape and other forms of sexual violence, persecution and other inhuman acts. " President Omar al-Bashir of Sudan and the late Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi have also been subject to ICC arrest warrants, but al-Bashir has not come into ICC custody, nor did Gadhafi, who was killed in October during Libya's revolution, Human Rights Watch said. The action comes a week before parliamentary elections are scheduled to be held in Ivory Coast. Gbagbo refused to accept the results of U.N.-certified elections.
