Now detectives are investigating, and police say it appears that "an intentional act" was behind high levels of chlorine gas that forced the evacuation at the Hyatt Regency O'Hare in Rosemont, Illinois, early Sunday morning. The hotel was hosting the Midwest FurFest, a convention where many attendees don animal costumes and "celebrate furry fandom, that is, art, literature and performance based around anthropomorphic animals," according to the event's website. In a statement Sunday, convention organizers said guests were allowed to return to their rooms several hours after the evacuation. Investigators detected a high level of chlorine gas in the air when they arrived at the hotel around 1 a.m., officials said. Video from CNN affiliate WGN shows guests dressed as foxes, tigers and bears spilling onto the streets as fire trucks and hazmat crews arrive.
