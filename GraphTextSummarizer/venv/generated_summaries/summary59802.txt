A report by pathologists hired by the defense, obtained by CNN, stated they found no evidence tissue samples were taken from Gloria's body after her death, despite the fact Qatari investigators submitted an autopsy report. The Qatari prosecutor sought to paint Grace and Matthew Huang as inhumane -- alleging they bought their adopted daughter cheaply from her poverty-stricken parents in Africa -- and had threatened to seek human trafficking charges. The Huangs -- who were living in Qatar while Matthew Huang worked for a international company working on construction projects for the 2022 World Cup -- were arrested in January 2013 when their 8-year-old daughter Gloria died. An appeals judge in Qatar on Sunday cleared American couple Matthew and Grace Huang of starving their adopted daughter to death in 2013, in a case that drew global attention to the Middle Eastern nation's justice system. Earlier, Matthew Huang issued a statement thanking the Qatari judge for his decision.
