A draft report, released by Japan's Atomic Energy Commission of the Cabinet Office last week, said the removal of debris -- or nuclear fuel -- should begin by the end of 2021. Tokyo Electric Power Co. said Wednesday it detected the chemical element xenon in a nuclear reactor at the crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, a sign that nuclear fission may have occurred. The March 11 disasters sparked a nuclear crisis and a backlash that postponed plans to reopen reactors shut down because of damage, inspections or unrelated technical problems. Another power company said it may have suffered a setback in its efforts to handle damaged nuclear reactors. Kyushu Electric Power Co. said it has started generating electricity from the No. 4 reactor late Tuesday at the Genkai nuclear power plant in western Japan.
