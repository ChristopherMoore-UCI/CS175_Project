CNN spoke with Anderson from Santa Margherita Ligure, Italy, about the making of "Moonrise Kingdom," the film's lack of nostalgic impulses and the impulse for audiences to read deeper into on-screen metaphors. Should I read into that as a metaphor about what's brewing between everyone on screen? Anderson: Even though there's every reason to think its nostalgic: It's set in the '60s, and it's childhood and first love and that sort of thing. CNN: Over the years, your films paint these pictures of various male figures that struggle in some way to grow up or face reality. The film stars Bruce Willis, Francis McDormand, Tilda Swinton and Ed Norton along with Anderson favorite Bill Murray and Jason Schwartzman.
