He posted a blistering 72-run stand with Chennai and Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni (27) but their total still looked only respectable with the likes of Tendulkar and Keith Pollard in the Mumbai ranks. But off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin immediately piled on the pressure with an opening maiden over to Shikhar Dhawan, who fell in the next over to Australia paceman Doug Bollinger as he edged to Dhoni. Chennai Super Kings won the third staging of the Indian Premier League (IPL) as they beat Mumbai Indians by 22 runs in the final of the Twenty20 tournament on Sunday. However, both Rayudu (21) and Pollard fell in the penultimate over from Albie  Morkel and the game was up for Mumbai with the final action played out in near silence among the capacity crowd. The killer blow came in the 15th over when left-arm spinner Shadab Jakati had  Tendulkar caught for 48 on the boundary and then removed Saurabh Tiwary.
