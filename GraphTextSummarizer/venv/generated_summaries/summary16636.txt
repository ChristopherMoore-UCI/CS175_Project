"If we've learned anything in the last 60 years of building atomic clocks, we've learned that every time we build a better clock, somebody comes up with a use for it that you couldn't have foreseen," says physicist Steven Jefferts, lead designer of NIST-F2. A new atomic clock, so accurate it will lose or gain only one second every 300 million years, was unveiled Thursday by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, a branch of the U.S. Department of Commerce. While it might be the most accurate atomic clock to use cesium, researchers say there are already clocks that use other atoms being tested and that those are even more precise. "All of these technologies, and many more that we use every day, rely on exquisite timing and synchronization that is only possible with atomic clocks. Timekeeping in the United States, which was already a pretty precise science involving lasers and atomic particles, just got even more exact.
