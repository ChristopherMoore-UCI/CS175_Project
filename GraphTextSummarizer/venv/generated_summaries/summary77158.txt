-- There were goals, there was choreographed dancing, there were moments of great footballing beauty, but Colombia -- one of the teams to excite most at this thrilling World Cup finals -- is going home after Friday's quarterfinal defeat at the hands of Brazil in Fortaleza. Hulk and Fred came close with a snap-shot that Colombia keeper David Ospina palmed away and a header that flashed over respectively. "I think Neymar won't be able to play," coach Luiz Felipe Scolari told reporters after the game, before the team's doctor revealed the 22-year-old forward had a fractured vertebra from being kneed in the back by Colombia's Juan Zuniga. Tellingly, however, Colombia has only ever beaten Brazil twice and never in Brazil -- a run that extends all the way back to 1945 and the formative years of the Copa America. The home fans' jubilation was dampened, however, by an injury to Brazil's star striker Neymar, who was stretchered off in what seemed like considerable pain in the game's closing moments and will miss the rest of the tournament.
