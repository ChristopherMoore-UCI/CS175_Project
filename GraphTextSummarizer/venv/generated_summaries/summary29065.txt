" The emphasis on military history consumes the curriculum for high school history classes. In her Advanced Placement U.S. history class for 11th-graders, Serkedakis included a "visitors" assignment for each era, where students played the part of important figures in American history and brought them to life in the classroom. "In school, we focus on the 'important people' and Founding Fathers, but what that 'great man version' of history does is really leave out an awful lot of people who have tremendous impact," Davis said. "We need to revise history because we learn things all of the time about the stories and people who were left out," he said. The emphasis turned off students who wanted to learn more than dates and battles; people, places and facts, not dates, make history come to life, Serkedakis said.
