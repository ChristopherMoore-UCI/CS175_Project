The process works like this: Lehigh brings in scrap rubber from tire manufacturers and rubber chips from tire recyclers who have already removed the steel and fiber. Cialone is founder of Lehigh Technologies, a Naples, Florida, company that pulverizes rubber from used tires and factory scrap into powder as fine as talc. Lehigh Technologies Chief Financial Officer Patrick George says that the rising prices for oil-based synthetic rubber and natural rubber are an incentive for companies to re-use rubber. The powder from Cialone's business also can be used in manufacturing new tires. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reports that about a quarter of scrap tires are left in landfills each year.
