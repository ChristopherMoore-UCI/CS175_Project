After going back to North Bergen High in March 2006, Alessa was immediately returned to home instruction, Swibinski said. The teenager transferred to the public North Bergen High School in late 2004, but within months, he was placed on administrative "home instruction" for exhibiting "radicalized behavior that was very threatening," according to spokesman Paul Swibinski. Alessa grew up in an upstairs apartment in North Bergen with his parents, who are from Jordan, according to the landlord, Hemant Shah. "Home instruction usually arises from disciplinary or security issues," Swibinski said. Mohamed Mahmood Alessa, 20, of North Bergen, New Jersey, and Carlos Eduardo Almonte, 24, of Elmwood Park, New Jersey, are charged with one count each of conspiracy to kill, maim and murder persons outside of the United States, which carries a maximum sentence of life in prison.
