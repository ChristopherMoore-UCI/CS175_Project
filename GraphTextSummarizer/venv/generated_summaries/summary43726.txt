According to the ICJ, the court said local laws and international agreements such as the Rome Statue that Kenya has signed supersede African Union policies. The Kenyan High Court ruling was the result of a case that the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) brought against Kenya's attorney general and internal security minster in 2010. "The courts have said that Kenya has an obligation to arrest Bashir if he is to come to country, if there was doubt as to the legal position, that has been clarified," says George Kegoro, the executive director of the ICJ. At the time Kenyan officials said that Kenya was beholden to African Union decisions on arresting the Sudanese president. -- The government of Sudan on Monday ordered Kenya's ambassador to leave the country, after the Kenyan High Court ruled that Sudan's president must be arrested if he sets foot on Kenyan soil.
