Opinion: How Hillary Clinton flubbed the wealth question Clinton performed her role as defense counsel to an unpopular, indigent client with skill and competence, affording him the constitutional rights cherished by Americans. The Clinton affidavit stated that a "child psychology" expert advised her that "children in early adolescence tend to exaggerate or romanticize sexual experiences and that adolescents with disorganized families, such as the complainant, are even more prone to such behavior." For example, while seeking to compel a psychiatric examination of the sixth grade victim, Clinton submitted her own sworn affidavit saying she had: "...been informed that the complainant is emotionally unstable with a tendency to seek out older men and engage in...fantasizing ... she has in the past made false accusations about persons, claiming they had attacked her body... In her book, Clinton describes her daring visit to a "bombed-out" (read: "African-American") Brooklyn neighborhood to obtain the services of a renowned expert in blood analysis. While all this may sound horrible to the nonlawyers of the world, in fact everything Clinton did as defense counsel at the time appears to have been ethical and proper.
