Personally, I'm a devotee of Steve Jobs' products, but even as Jobs sticks to the facts of Jobs' life (and what a difficult person he could be), the movie gets a little too caught up in his legend. In Jobs, Gad's deadpan flip performance as Wozniak strikes the most relatable note in the movie, but the only thing we're really arrested by, apart from the spectacle of Jobs' bad behavior, is seeing him talk about computers. As the movie goes on, Jobs evolves from a grouchy hippie to a corporate sharpie in three-piece suits, and Kutcher lets his voice get more and more crisp with grandiosity, so that he's not talking, he's lecturing, because he's the only one who grasps the inner truth of computer design as transcendence. When Wozniak, a burly nerd who works on this stuff mostly so that he can feel like one of the guys, takes out his trusty soldering iron to attach transistors to a flat green board, Jobs channels the early paradox of computer culture: that to us the gizmos seemed light, virtual, magical, but to the people who invented them, they were built, diode by diode. At the same time, almost everything we see Jobs do that doesn't involve designing computers is unconscionable.
