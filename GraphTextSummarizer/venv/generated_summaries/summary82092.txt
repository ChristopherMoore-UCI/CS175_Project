Seau had brain disease that comes from hits to head, NIH finds NFL spokesman Greg Aiello acknowledged that Jenkins has reached out to the organization for help, but that -- as of right now -- he is ineligible for disability programs to which he has applied. " Desperate for help Jenkins found out last year that he is ineligible for the NFL's neuro-cognitive benefit, a program that could have provided him with financial help for living and medical expenses. Jenkins believes that he, too, is suffering with CTE -- which is associated with the symptoms he has: memory loss, aggression and depression. In the 11 years since he retired from the NFL, Jenkins has dealt with serious cognitive issues: a memory that is feeble at best, crushing depression and rage he can neither understand nor predict. Jenkins has appealed the decision; the results of his appeal will be revealed by NFL this month.
