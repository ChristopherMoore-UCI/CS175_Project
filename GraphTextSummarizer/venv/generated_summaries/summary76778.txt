Cleveland police removed Knight's name from an FBI database of missing people in November 2003 -- 15 months after her family reported her missing -- police said. They did so after "failing to locate a parent, guardian or other reporting person to confirm that Ms. Knight was still missing. Her grandmother, Deborah Knight, had gone to the same home on Friday because she'd also heard Knight might be there and "besides, Gina's parents here have been waiting to meet us." Cleveland police have been subject to intense criticism from some quarters over their handling of missing persons cases, but city officials have said they did everything they could to find the missing women. The Cleveland public relations firm of Hennes Paynter Communication is representing all three women, said Barbara Paynter of that company.
