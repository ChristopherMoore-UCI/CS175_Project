Boeing announces changes to Dreamliner battery system Boeing "will now gather and analyze the data and submit the required materials to the FAA," the company said in a news release. U.S. Department of Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said in March the Dreamliner will not be allowed back in service until Boeing proves the new design is safe for passengers. -- A flight labeled the "final" certification test of an improved battery system for the grounded Boeing 787 Dreamliner was "straightforward" and "uneventful," the airplane maker said Friday. In March the FAA approved a Boeing certification plan to fix the 787's problematic lithium-ion battery system and prove the new design is safe. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and similar regulators worldwide grounded the Dreamliner in January after two battery-related fires damaged 787s in Boston and Japan.
