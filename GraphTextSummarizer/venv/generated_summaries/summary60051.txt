Big hits, big stages, big-time players and big salaries have characterized the growth of the game and its image. When the revelations of the bounty that players of the New Orleans Saints players had for their opponents became public, my first thought was the rate of inflation: $10,000 seemed excessive -- but so too does a $100 million dollar contract from someone of my generation. Bloody knuckles and vicious hits were the script by which the raw, orchestrated violence of the NFL was sold. And, while we must do all we can to prevent injuries, we must also recognize the insatiable appetite we have for the violence -- and the subsequent reward, of admiration and dollars, we bestow on NFL players. For players making league minimum, it became a part of their service, like a tip to a waiter.
