With the sound of tolling bells at my back, I join the line and watch first light over central Sri Lanka. Local legend has it that Sri Lanka's King Valagambahu was the first to stumble upon Sri Pada during a reign that ended in about 76 BC. I've tackled quite a few mountains in my life, but never have I hiked with as many solemn spirits as on Adam's Peak in Sri Lanka. We're all going up silently toward the summit of what is a holy mountain for Buddhists, Hindus, Muslims and Christians in Sri Lanka. Tough going To Buddhists, Sri Pada, or the sacred footprint, is an imprint left by the Buddha himself.
