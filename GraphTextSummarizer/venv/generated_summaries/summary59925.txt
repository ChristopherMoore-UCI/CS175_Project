The Washington Monument will remain closed for repairs for at least another year and possibly into 2014, National Park Service officials said Monday. Repairs are expected to begin this fall. With Rubenstein's donation and congressional funds that were approved in December, Deputy Interior Secretary David Hayes said in January there was enough money to begin the repairs. Indoor repairs are also required. The service said that huge scaffolding will be needed for the outside repair work, which will take 12 to 18 months to complete.
