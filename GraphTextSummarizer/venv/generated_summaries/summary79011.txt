One might think Democrats are in disarray, given the recent legislative battle that pitted the Obama administration and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid against top House Democrat Nancy Pelosi and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. " Patrick, a self-described "pro-growth progressive" offered support for Warren generally, but advocated for a balance between government help and private market principles. " Schumer called economic issues "the soul of the Democratic Party" and reiterated his belief that party members are on the same page -- name-checking Warren, a newly minted member of the Senate Democrats' leadership team. But with groups on the left envigorated by Warren's anti-Wall Street rhetoric and Pelosi willing to buck Obama's White House, there's evidence Democrats may splinter yet. Not so, argue New York Sen. Chuck Schumer and outgoing Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick.
