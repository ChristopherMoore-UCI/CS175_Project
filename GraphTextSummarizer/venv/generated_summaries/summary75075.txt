Ciara Torres-Spelliscy, a law professor and expert in this type of spending, commented (PDF), "Corporate law is ill-prepared for this new age of corporate political spending by publicly traded companies. And a big part of that story is the corporate political spending that is laundered through dark money conduits, nonprofit organizations and trade associations repurposed into political spending juggernauts with the ability to keep their donors secret. Although undisclosed corporate political spending has caused heartburn for transparency advocates and government watchdogs, another group of Americans has equal cause to fret: investors. Corporate political spending could jeopardize the retirement savings of millions of Americans. Gambling with a corporate brand through political spending is a high-stakes game for companies, for the people who depend on these companies to help them save, and the risks cannot be overstated.
