" The U.S. Marine Corps Futenma Air Station in Okinawa was built in 1945, following the battle of Okinawa in World War II, according to the Marine Corps' website. In recent years the base has been unpopular with the island's residents because of allegations against, and crimes committed by, U.S. military personnel. It took 17 years for the approval of plans to relocate a controversial U.S. military base in Japan, and now it appears those plans won't happen after all. Intense media coverage of the case brought pressure on the Japanese government to review its agreement with the United States about handling criminal cases in Japan involving the U.S. military. In 2002, a U.S. staff sergeant in the Air Force was convicted of raping a Japanese woman in a parking lot outside a popular nightclub in Okinawa.
