The run-in with the law Monday was his third in his home state in recent months, which included a citation for marijuana possession in Greer, South Carolina, in August. He had been booked to appear on "The Wendy Williams Show" in New York on Wednesday, but he's decided to stay at home "due to recent media scrutiny," representative Domenick Nati said. The rapper, whose real name is Earl Simmons, has been arrested several times in his home state of South Carolina in recent months. "DMX, you are loved, but if you're not here by Friday, we've got to move on with our plans," Williams said on her show Tuesday, hours after the rapper was arrested on charges of driving with a suspended license and having no car tag or insurance. He was also arrested in Greenville, South Carolina, on July 26 on charges of driving under the influence, driving without a license and driving without a seat belt, police said.
