But impressive progress has been made in places where conservation groups, indigenous communities, industry and government leaders work together to protect entire forest ecosystems. According to the U.N., forests have disappeared in 25 countries, and another 29 nations have lost more than 90%. Nevertheless, other wildlands across the globe are rapidly disappearing, which means the spirit of cooperation seen in the remarkable accomplishments this year must continue and grow if we are to preserve the vital functions that forests provide for people and the planet. Over the past year, Ontario and Quebec have, together, proposed protecting 390 million acres, with half designated as parks and refuges. Strikingly, fully 80% of the waterfowl species found in North America breed in Canada's wild forests.
