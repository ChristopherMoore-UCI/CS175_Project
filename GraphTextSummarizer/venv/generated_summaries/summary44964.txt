At least 26 people have died and dozens wounded in the airstrikes in the Nuba Mountain areas of South Kordofan state, rights groups said. The Satellite Sentinel Project said it has evidence of a total of eight mass graves in the area since June, citing witness accounts and images of what it says are body bags. The Sudan government is targeting a border region with airstrikes -- forcing residents to live in caves and under the bushes to avoid the "indiscriminate" bombardments, according to international rights groups. South Kordofan remains a territory of the Sudanese government in the north, but borders South Sudan. The reports come a week after a U.S. satellite project said it has found evidence of additional mass graves in the state capital of Kadugli .
