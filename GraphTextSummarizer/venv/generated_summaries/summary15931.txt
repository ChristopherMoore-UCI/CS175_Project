Who's who in Aaron Hernandez case In early January, Shayanna Jenkins met with Bristol County, Massachusetts, prosecutors in what court documents call an immunity meeting, but the results of that meeting are secret even from the Hernandez defense team. On the other hand, if Jenkins decides to testify without immunity, takes the Fifth Amendment against self-incrimination and gives no substantive  testimony, Callan said the defense may argue ahead of time that her testimony would be prejudicial to Hernandez and not be allowed. " The evidence against Hernandez: What's in, what's out A home surveillance video shows Jenkins leaving the house about an hour later carrying something "rigid" she described as a box, court documents state. That's because, Callan said, prosecutors could later contend at a perjury trial that she repeated an alleged lie under oath. While some jurors may think prosecutors should not "force" a loved one to testify, Callan said it may be unavoidable if prosecutors are convinced it's necessary to help prove their case.
