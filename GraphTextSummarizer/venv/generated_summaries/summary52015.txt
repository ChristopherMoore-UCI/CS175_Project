A more challenging situation is when airstrikes seek to target ISIS inside populated areas like Mosul in Iraq, Raqqa in Syria and other cities under ISIS control. " ISIS is on its heels after the loss of Kobani and an offensive by Kurdish Peshmerga -- armed fighters who protect Iraq's Kurdish region -- around Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city and a focal point for all sides in the conflict. Two purported ISIS fighters interviewed for a news agency working in ISIS-held territory have given the same reason for the militants' retreat from the Syrian city of Kobani: the constant pummeling by coalition airstrikes. A joint operation is underway by his police officers, Peshmerga and Kurdish security forces to free the hostages and take back control of the oilfield, seized by ISIS militants on Friday, Qader said. He said ISIS forces had raided 360 villages around Kobani, from which the people "ran away like rats."
