Dallas Cowboys players involved in fatal crash were 'like brothers' People we lost in 2013: Eskridge played for the Chicago Stags and the Indianapolis Jets before joining the University of Kansas as assistant coach, where he helped recruit basketball superstar Wilt Chamberlain, his obit said. Eskridge was 89 when he died near his home at a hospital outside Kansas City this week, the Dallas Cowboys' website reported Friday. Iconic Cowboys coach Tom Landry hired him as an equipment manager. He wasn't from the Lone Star State, though he liked Texas enough to live there twice in his life for a total of 23 years -- the first time to work for the Cowboys, the second to teach school, according to his obituary.
