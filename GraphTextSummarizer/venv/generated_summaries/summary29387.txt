Speaking Wednesday, Kashmir's Indian-appointed governor N. N. Vohra made a fervent appeal for demonstrators to maintain calm. Hindu protesters shout slogans against Jammu and Kashmir state governor N. N. Vohra. A round-the-clock curfew in Srinagar, the summer capital of Kashmir, was lifted for several hours Wednesday to allow residents to buy essential commodities. Several thousand people joined the Wednesday morning funeral procession for one of the victims in old Srinagar city. The latest round of protests was started on Monday by fruit growers who were upset that Hindu protesters had blocked a highway leading into India, preventing their crops from getting to market.
