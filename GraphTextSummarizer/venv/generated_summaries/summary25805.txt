According to Entertainmentwise.com, "Track 3" from her new album, "1989," shot to No. 1 on iTunes in Canada after it was released. A song cowritten with fun.'s Jack Antonoff called "Out of the Woods" was released last week, and it skyrocketed to No. 1. Swift recently told Esquire that she's moved to New York and is focusing on work and enjoying her life, including being surrounded by a great group of girlfriends. "You have celebrities who are pushed to the brink of a public meltdown, and so the public thinks that every person in the public eye has dirty secrets that they're keeping, or isn't what they seem, or is masking it and faking sincerity, faking authenticity, faking being surprised at award shows when you win a Grammy," she said. Wow, Canada, you really, really love Taylor Swift.
