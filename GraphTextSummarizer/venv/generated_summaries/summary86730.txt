The Pentagon said Monday that American military aircraft would help the peacekeeping efforts by flying African and European peacekeepers to the Central African Republic from Burundi. France, the former colonial power in the Central African Republic, has deployed 1,600 personnel there to support African Union troops, after a vote last week in the U.N. Security Council authorizing military intervention. He also "reiterates his full confidence in the French forces deployed alongside African forces to restore security in the Central African Republic, protect civilian populations and ensure access to humanitarian aid." Meanwhile, as forces from other African countries and France work to restore security, the United States will support their efforts to protect civilians," Obama said. As the convoy neared its destination, automatic weapons fire was directed at the main French checkpoint leading into Bangui, where there's a buildup of French forces.
