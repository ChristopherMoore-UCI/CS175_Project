-- A full autopsy report on the death of conservative blogger and activist Andrew Breitbart was released Wednesday, concluding that he died of heart failure as a result of coronary artery disease and an enlarged heart, coroner officials announced. According to the autopsy report, Breitbart had been diagnosed with congestive heart failure in 2011 after being rushed by ambulance to the same hospital because he had shortness of breath. The 6-foot-3, 251-pound Breitbart was considered "a light drinker," and he had 0.04 gram percent of alcohol in his blood and heart at the time of his death, the autopsy report said. Breitbart, 43, died on March 1 after collapsing on a sidewalk in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Brentwood. He was transported to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center and pronounced dead about 40 minutes later when emergency physicians were unable to revive him.
