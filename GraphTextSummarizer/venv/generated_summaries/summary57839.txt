Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Vice President Joseph Biden and outgoing Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, all Democrats considering White House runs, did not release statements on Election Night. Republican victories nationwide in this Tuesday's midterm elections gave the GOP's possible presidential hopefuls a surge of momentum Tuesday night as they enter a period of serious consideration of their own White House bids. Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul, who plans to huddle with close aides in Washington, D.C. next week to discuss his political future, seized the moment first by claiming the election result were not just a repudiation of President Barack Obama, but to Hillary Clinton â€” the likely Democratic presidential nominee -- as well. "That requires pursuing and passing a serious growth agenda for our nation that expands opportunity for all Americans." New Jersey Republican Gov. Chris Christie, the head of the Republican Governors Association who barnstormed states in the weekend before election day, delivered statements of congratulations for the GOP governors who won Tuesday night. Regardless, these possible White House contenders spent the past several months campaigning and fundraising for candidates across the country, an investment that will help encourage those they helped to support them if they choose to run next year.
