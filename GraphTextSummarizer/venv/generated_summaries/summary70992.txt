-- Four days before Baylor University basketball star Isaiah Austin hoped to be drafted into the NBA, his dreams of playing in the pros were extinguished by a rare genetic disease called Marfan syndrome. Curved spines, chests that stick out or sink in, flexible joints, and stretch marks not related to weight gain or loss are also visible signs of Marfan syndrome. But after a standard physical, test results revealed he had Marfan syndrome. People with Marfan syndrome are usually very tall and thin. Eye problems are a common effect of Marfan syndrome.
