-- New York police on Sunday identified the man fatally wounded the day earlier by officers a short walk from Manhattan's Times Square as a 51-year-old from nearby Long Island. Officers there approached a man because he was smoking what appeared to be a "marijuana cigarette," Deputy Police Commissioner Paul Browne said Saturday. iReport: ' looked back saw him holding the gun...' Officers deployed pepper spray six separate times during the drawn-out ordeal, "to no avail," police said. Video shot by CNN iReporter David Fowler shows several officers -- at least three of them with their guns drawn -- following the man through the middle of Times Square. After becoming agitated, the man "placed the marijuana cigarette in his pocket and pulled out an 11-inch knife, raised it above his head and began to put a blue bandana on his head," police said on Sunday.
