A FIFA statement Wednesday read: "FIFA has opened disciplinary proceedings against six match officials in relation to the international friendly matches Bolivia v Latvia and Estonia v Bulgaria played in Antalya (Turkey) on 9 February 2011." The games under suspicion are Bulgaria against Estonia and Latvia against Bolivia, two friendlies which took place last month. "We received information of possible manipulation even before the game as the same agency also organized the match between Latvia and Bolivia and there was the same scenario there. At the time, Estonian Football Association spokesman Mihkel Uiboleht admitted there had been concern about the matches. Football's world governing body was alerted after unusual betting patterns on the two games, which were both held at the Turkish resort of Antalya.
