But any coalition government may struggle to formulate strong policies on the critical issues Pakistan faces, even under an established figure like Sharif. Nawaz Sharif, 63, has had a long and rocky career that includes two stints as prime minister during the 1990s, ordering Pakistan's first nuclear tests, a showdown with the nation's powerful military, time in jail and years of exile. And since the assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto during campaigning for the 2008 elections, a lot of Pakistani politicians are afraid of well-organized, merciless militants like the Taliban, according to Rumi. Uncertainty over relations with U.S. An unwillingness to continue the fight against insurgents could put a Sharif government at loggerheads with the military and also strain already difficult relations with the United States, a key prop for Pakistan's shaky public finances. Sharif has also raised eyebrows by vowing to improve ties with Pakistan's archrival, India.
