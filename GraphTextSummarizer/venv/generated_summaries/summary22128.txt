In 2011, for instance, the Tanzanian government issued land titles to a community of Hadza living in Yaeda Chini. The Hadza don't store food, plant trees or build houses. The techniques they use for finding sustenance are passed down generation to generation. Furthermore, a lot of the big game animals and local plants that traditionally have made up the bulk of the Hadza diet are disappearing. In the last 50 years, they have lost 90% of their land to farmers and cattle herders, according to Survival International, an NGO in defense of tribal people around the world.
