On Tuesday, the council accused Nusra Front fighters of raiding one of its courthouses in Aleppo. Nusra Front fighters are said to be leading the ongoing siege of the Khweiris military airbase in Aleppo province. "The U.S. and the European Union didn't help us, and that created an increase in Islamic radicalism here," said Marwan Gayed in an interview in Aleppo last month. So we started raising the banner of Shahada, the black banner of war," explained a Syrian activist who has spent much of the last two years organizing anti-government protests in Idlib province. They are also credited with helping lead the capture of the Taftanaz helicopter airbase in Idlib province last month.
