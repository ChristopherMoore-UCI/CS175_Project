-- Former Penn State head football coach Joe Paterno may have played a greater role than previously known in a decision made by university officials not to report a 2001 incident involving former coach Jerry Sandusky and a boy in a locker room shower, according to e-mails written by university officials. "Some number of e-mail exchanges between former Penn State officials have apparently been leaked to the media. The "selective" leaking of e-mails "is not intended to inform the discussion but to smear former Penn State officials, including Joe Paterno," said Sollers. At Sandusky's trial, former Penn State graduate assistant Mike McQueary testified he believed he saw sexual contact between Sandusky and a boy in the shower and told Paterno in February 2001. Disturbing e-mails could spell more trouble for Penn State officials Paterno, a revered Penn State icon who died in January, testified before a grand jury that when he learned about the situation, he contacted his then-boss, athletic director Tim Curley, as required and left it up to the university to investigate.
