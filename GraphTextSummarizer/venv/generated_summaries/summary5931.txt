Friends, relatives bewildered by arrest of 'storybook kid' in teacher slaying The armed robbery indictment alleges that Chism robbed Ritzer of credit cards, an iPhone and her underwear. Chism, in the presence of his mother, Diana Chism, waived his Miranda rights. According to a police affidavit, a ninth-grade student told investigators that Chism became visibly upset when Ritzer spoke after class on the day of the crime about his home state of Tennessee. The affidavit also said Chism may have sought to "memorialize" the crime by photographing or videotaping parts of it with his cell phone, which was later destroyed in what investigators said was an attempt to hide incriminating evidence. Philip Chism was indicted Friday on an additional count of aggravated rape in connection with the death of Colleen Ritzer, 24, on October 22 in the girls' bathroom of Danvers High School.
