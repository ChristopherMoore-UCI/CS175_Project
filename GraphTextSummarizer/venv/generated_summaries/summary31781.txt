The initiative, dubbed Brain Research Through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies, or BRAIN, "aims to help researchers find new ways to treat, cure, and even prevent brain disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, and traumatic brain injury," the White House said in a release issued in advance of the event. -- President Barack Obama on Tuesday unveiled a $100 million initiative to unlock the "enormous mystery" of the human brain in hopes of boosting the understanding and treatment of brain disorders. " Mapping the brain: Top brain scientist is 'philosopher at heart' Obama said he will seek the $100 million funding in the budget he sends to Congress next week. In the same call, National Institutes of Health Director Francis Collins said that "advances in tech which are coming along very quickly make it possible to take a look at what's happening in the brain," and the research "leads us to believe we can accomplish something very dramatic." In his State of the Union address in February, he said, "If we want to make the best products, we also have to invest in the best ideas," and alluded to scientists "mapping the human brain to unlock the answers to Alzheimer's."
