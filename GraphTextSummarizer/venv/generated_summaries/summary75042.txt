As for what he'll do with the grant, Guskiewicz wants to develop rehabilitation protocols, not just for athletes with head injuries but also for soldiers, since there has been a documented similarity between blast injuries and sports concussions. Guskiewicz, 45, dedicated his career to discovering and harnessing knowledge about head injuries. Although there is some skepticism about this, Guskiewicz is confident that there will be fewer concussions this season as a result. Guskiewicz sees his work as piecing together a puzzle: preventing, diagnosing and treating concussions are all pieces that he wants to fit together. Major sports groups such as the National Football League, the National Hockey League and the National College Athletics Association have done a better job of increasing awareness about concussions over the last few years, Guskiewicz said.
