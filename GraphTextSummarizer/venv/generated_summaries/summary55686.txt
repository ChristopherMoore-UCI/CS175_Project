Six other crew members were also injured in the accident, which occurred when Jones and others were filming on train tracks in Wayne County, Georgia. Randall Miller, Jody Savin and Jay Sedrish were charged Thursday with involuntary manslaughter and criminal trespass regarding the death of Sarah Elizabeth Jones, a camera assistant on the film. Under Georgia law, involuntary manslaughter carries a potential sentence of 10 years. After the incident, Jones became the subject of mourning in the film community. "I am so terribly saddened by the news of the tragedy that took the young life of Sarah Elizabeth Jones on the film set," he wrote on his website.
