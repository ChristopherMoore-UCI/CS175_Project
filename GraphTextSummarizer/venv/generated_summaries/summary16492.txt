West, of Poulan, Georgia, faces one count of aggravated assault, two counts of battery, two counts of disorderly conduct, false imprisonment and cruelty to children for allegedly beating Hill outside a Cracker Barrel restaurant September 9, according to a Clayton County Court online docket. West, 47, was arrested on misdemeanor charges after the incident, but Clayton County District Attorney Tracy Graham Lawson took the case to a grand jury asking for more serious charges. Attorney Kip Jones, who represents alleged victim Tashawnea Hill, said a judge Tuesday ordered West placed under house arrest, and he was fitted with an ankle monitor. -- A Georgia man accused of screaming racial slurs while beating an African-American female Army reservist outside a restaurant was released from jail on bail Wednesday, Clayton County, Georgia, authorities said. He also was told to surrender his passport, have no contact with Hill and stay out of Clayton County, where Hill lives, the lawyer said.
