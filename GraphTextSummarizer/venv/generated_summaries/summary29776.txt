"General public attitudes toward online dating have become much more positive in recent years, and social networking sites are now playing a prominent role when it comes to navigating and documenting romantic relationships," reads a summary of Pew's report. Six out of 10 Americans now believe dating sites are a good way to meet people, according to a new report from the Pew Research Center's Internet and American Life Project. According to the survey, conducted with 2,252 adults in April and May, 11% of Internet users, and 38% of those who said they're currently "single and looking," have used online dating sites or apps. And barely two out of every 10 people (21%) still feel that "people who use online dating sites are desperate." In 2005, 43% who tried online sites actually went on a date.
