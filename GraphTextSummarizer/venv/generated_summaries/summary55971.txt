He challenged the 40% figure for gun sales without background checks -- particularly at gun shows. But federal law does not require background checks for "private transactions," such as sales at gun shows. In total, 16 states and the District of Columbia require background checks on handguns sold at gun shows, Nichols said. Across the country, more than 1 million people failed background checks to buy guns during the past 14 years because of criminal records, drug use or mental health issues, according to FBI figures. Keene did say he favored background checks to block people who may be mentally ill or potentially violent from buying guns.
