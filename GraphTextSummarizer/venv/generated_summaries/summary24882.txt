At the scene, he presented a Michigan driver's license, which police determined "was not valid," said Baltimore, Maryland, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi. -- The driver who collided with a vehicle driven by Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps will be cited for failure to stop at a red light, police said Friday. But the gold medal winner will also be cited -- for failure to present a valid driver's license and for failure to establish a Maryland residency and obtain a Maryland driver's license -- in connection with his involvement Thursday in a car wreck, police said Friday. Michael Phelps' black Cadillac Escalade collided with another vehicle at an intersection, police say. Phelps was driving one of two vehicles that collided at an intersection about 9 p.m., Guglielmi said.
