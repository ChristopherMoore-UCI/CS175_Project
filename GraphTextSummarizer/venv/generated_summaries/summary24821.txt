Dallas police arrested Short around 2 a.m. Saturday for public intoxication at the address for Katy Trail Ice House, a "beer garden" and restaurant, police spokesman Warren Mitchell said. Mitchell had no information immediately on whether, or when, Short, 31, was released from custody. Shortly thereafter, Columbus Short announced he would not be returning to the hit ABC series "Scandal." The actor was arrested in March after being accused of punching and knocking out a patron at a West Los Angeles restaurant. Former "Scandal" actor Columbus Short has again found himself accused of being on the wrong side of the law.
