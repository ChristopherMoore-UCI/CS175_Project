A Belgian Federal Police spokeswoman, Tine Hollevoet, confirmed that the 29-year-old Frenchman had been extradited to Belgium on Tuesday morning but could not give further information for security reasons. The suspect in the deadly shooting at Belgium's Jewish Museum was extradited from France to Belgium, a French court official said Tuesday. When French police arrested Nemmouche on May 30, they also seized a Kalashnikov rifle wrapped in a flag bearing the ISIS insignia, according to prosecutors. Nemmouche recently spent a year in Syria and is a radicalized Islamist, French officials said. Four people were killed in the daytime attack in central Brussels.
