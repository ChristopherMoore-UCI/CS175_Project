Satyam Chairman B. Ramalinga Raju said the balance-sheet padding began several years ago to close "a marginal gap" between actual operating profit and one reflected in the company's accounting books. -- The chairman of India's fourth-largest software-services provider resigned Wednesday after confessing to inflating the company's profits for years with "fictitious" assets and non-existent cash. " Analysts say Satyam is ripe for a takeover, and the government is expected to submit a formal report on the matter Thursday. The news sent stocks of the Hyderabad-based Satyam Computer Services into free fall. "It was like riding a tiger, not knowing how to get off without being eaten," Raju said in a letter to the company's board of directors.
