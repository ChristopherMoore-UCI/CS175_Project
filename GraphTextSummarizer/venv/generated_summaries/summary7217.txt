Landstra, a former choir director in the Bradenton community, according to CNN affiliate Bay News 9, was leaving church when, according to witnesses, she appeared to think she put her Chevrolet SUV in drive but instead shifted into reverse. According to Bueno, three Bradenton residents -- Johanna Dijkhoff, 80, Wilhemina Paul, 70 and Margaret Vanderlaan, 72 -- died as a result of their injuries. Witness Jan Verstveg told Bay News 9 that he watched Landstra reverse into the crowd. Landstra was interviewed by investigators at the scene and then left with her family, according to Bay News 9.
