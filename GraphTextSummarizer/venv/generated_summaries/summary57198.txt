British Airways has drafted in an army of volunteers to staff flights and has leased aircraft and crew from other airlines to operated scheduled services. His call came as the union claimed heavy disruptions to services during the three-day strike which began midnight Friday, despite BA claims that a better-than-expected turnout by cabin crew had allowed them to offer a good service. But Unite has said the plans, which call for longer working hours and a cut in crew staffing levels, will damage customer service and the BA brand.

British Airways and Unite have been at odds for more than a year over changes the airline wants to make to cabin crew pay and work practices.
