Harry was playing in the Veuve Clicqout Polo Classic in aid of a charity he co-founded to help AIDS victims in the tiny African nation of Lesotho in South Africa. Harry, the younger son of Prince Charles and the late Diana, Princess of Wales, has faced more dangerous situations than a charity polo match -- he served for two months as an Army officer in Afghanistan, and is now training to be a military helicopter pilot. The "sport of kings" proved a bit tricky this weekend for Britain's Prince Harry, who fell headfirst off his horse during a charity polo match in New York. Prince Seeiso of Lesotho is the other co-founder of the charity, Sentebale. --
