I understand that for campaign managers and some candidates, a schedule of debate after debate is a hassle that cuts into their fundraising time. The fact that there is a risk involved in debates just reflects the real stakes of the race for the most powerful job on earth. Newt Gingrich's rise to top-two status is almost entirely due to strong debate performances, balancing Republican red-meat rhetoric with thoughtful policy prescriptions. Mitt Romney succeeded in gliding through the first dozen debates as the de facto front-runner, as other candidates seemed reluctant to take him on hard. But it was his failure to repeat a clever line about "Obamney Care" to Mitt Romney's face that caused many voters and donors to conclude that he didn't have the toughness to take on the top job.
