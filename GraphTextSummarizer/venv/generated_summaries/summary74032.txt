We will also streamline the paperwork associated with conducting scientific investigations, whether it's making it easier to recruit patients for clinical trials or adapting the operation of trials as we learn new information. This unacceptable fact led to one simple question: What policies can we enact to help get more cures and treatments to patients? New public-private partnerships that can help build the science around biomarkers and patient-reported outcomes are one way to produce more collaboration, move toward faster cures and better involve patients. Today, partnerships with patients and advocates, health care workers and researchers, and government and the private sector can speed the cycle of finding faster cures. With the explosion of technology, we can collect, monitor and analyze information like never before, helping patients stay healthy and adopt healthy habits while also making treatments safer and more effective.
