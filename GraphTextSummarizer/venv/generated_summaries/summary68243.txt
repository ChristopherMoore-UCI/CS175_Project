Last September she did reach the U.S. Open final in New York -- losing to Williams -- and returned to the Big Apple a few months later to take part in the New York City Marathon. "It's always been a dream of mine (to be in the swimsuit Issue)," Wozniacki, a former No. 1 like Sharapova and Ivanovic, told the For The Win website Monday in New York. Her pal, world No. 1 Serena Williams, along with Maria Sharapova and Ana Ivanovic, have featured in the swimsuit edition in the past and the Dane couldn't wait to join them. While Wozniacki waits for her first grand slam title, her inclusion in the swimsuit edition is likely to do no harm to her off court profile. " Wozniacki posted pictures of the shoot on Twitter -- and one of her other friends on the tour, Victoria Azarenka, was impressed, calling the photos "stunning."
