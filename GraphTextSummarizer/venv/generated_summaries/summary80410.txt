Although their wedding has yet to air on that popular TLC show, Jill Duggar and new husband Derick Dillard have revealed to People magazine that they are expecting. "We are so excited," said Jill Duggar, who now goes by Jill Dillard. The pair texted and Skyped under parental supervision during their courtship while Dillard served as a missionary in Nepal. Although Jill is the Duggars' first daughter to marry, this baby won't be the first grandchild for the Duggars. The baby is a first for the pair, who married June 21 in Springdale, Arkansas.
