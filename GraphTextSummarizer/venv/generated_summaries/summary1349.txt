The party had been arranged with the bar in advance by the student class board, which includes two of the African-American students who were later denied entry, Cutz said. Bar personnel cited dress code violations -- specifically baggy jeans -- in barring the African-American students, Cutz said. "These six [students] were better dressed than I was," Cutz told CNN. " Roberts approached the same manager who had turned away the African-American students, paid the entry fee and was allowed in, Cutz said. Fernando Cutz, senior class president at the university in Missouri, said the aggrieved students have been in contact with lawyers representing Original Mother's, a bar in Chicago's Gold Coast neighborhood.
