-- Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair's daughter was briefly held at gunpoint in central London this week, police and Blair's office said Thursday. The first robbery attempt was committed by one man wearing dark clothing and a balaclava -- a ski mask covering most of the face -- and the second involved two men, with one described the same way as the man in the first incident, police said. "Kathryn was with a group of friends," said Rachel Grant, a Blair spokeswoman. Blair's office said his daughter is fine. In both instances, a firearm was seen, but no shots were fired and nothing was taken, Scotland Yard said.
