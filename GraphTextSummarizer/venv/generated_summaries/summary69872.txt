-- Internet giants signed up Tuesday to a "zero tolerance" approach to images of child sexual abuse as the British government announced a new, tougher strategy to find and block illegal content. "This will mean more images of child sexual abuse will be tracked down and acted on," said Culture Secretary Maria Miller. In each case, the killer had viewed child sexual abuse images and violent pornography on the Internet, sparking calls for action to eradicate such content and protect vulnerable young people. The Web giant also is creating the Child Protection Technology Fund to develop more efficient ways to fight child porn, and already works to tag illegal images and prevent them being found elsewhere. After the summit, the government said the Internet Watch Foundation -- a watchdog body set up in 1996 -- would have new powers to seek out child sex abuse images, block access to them and remove them.
