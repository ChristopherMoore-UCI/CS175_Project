Then the comments started flying with woman after woman not only liking the status update but also telling their own tales of married men trying to befriend single women. In social settings, these married men partied all night long, had lingering conversations and exchanges with single women all under the guise of business for their charity or event. So, to avoid these questions, my advice to married men is simple: You are married and cannot enjoy some of the same luxuries as single people. That includes befriending single women under the guise of business ventures without introducing your wife. To single women: If it feels icky, then it more than likely isn't meant to be a business discussion.
