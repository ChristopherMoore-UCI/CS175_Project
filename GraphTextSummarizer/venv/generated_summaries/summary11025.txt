U.N. Number of Syrian refugees tops 2 million To simply live in a makeshift tent on a 10-by-10-foot plot of dirt, some of the landowners in Bekaa Valley are charging $100 a month. For the past several days, I had been in refugee camps along the border between Syria and Lebanon. But, for the time being -- this is the price they pay as refugees in Lebanon, September 2013. In Port-au-Prince, Haiti, I saw young children searching for their parents in large garbage dumpsters, hoping to catch a final glimpse of them. As a dad, you get pretty good at judging the age of children, based on their size.
