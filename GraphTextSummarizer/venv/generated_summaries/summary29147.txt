Turkey's main airline is banning certain shades of lipstick and nail polish among flight attendants. Another set of recent guidelines prohibited flight attendants from having platinum blond hair as well as certain shades of red dye. "Red, dark pink and similar colors of lipstick and nail polish that are not in the current uniforms breaks up visual coherence," the airline statement said. Outrage spilled into social media, sparking newspapers columns and a movement after Turkish Airlines announced the new dress code this week. Last month, when photos of new uniforms being considered for the airline were leaked on social media, many criticized the more conservative trend, which featured longer hemlines and more traditional necklines.
