Also, for those tracking this stuff, Fox has passed on comedy pilots "No Place Like Home," "Fatrick" and "Dead Boss." In the ratings, "Dads" averaged 4.2 million viewers and a 1.8 rating including DVR playback; "Surviving Jack" had 5 million and a 1.4 rating; and "Enlisted" had 2.7 million and a 1.0 rating.
