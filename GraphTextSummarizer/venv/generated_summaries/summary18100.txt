Genzel said the center of the galaxy was a "unique laboratory" for the study of the strong gravity, stellar dynamics and star formation with a level of detail "never possible beyond our galaxy." Stefan Gillessen, the chief author of the study, published in the Astrophysical Journal, said: "The Galactic Center harbors the closest supermassive black hole known. " "Undoubtedly the most spectacular aspect of our long term study is that it has delivered what is now considered to be the best empirical evidence that super-massive black holes do really exist," said Genzel. Hence, it is the best place to study black holes in detail." The center of the galaxy is a "unique laboratory" for astronomical study. Professor Reinhard Genzel, who led the study at the Bavaria-based Max-Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics, said the data collected proved the existence of the black hole "beyond any reasonable doubt.
