Winning brings major life change Part of the allure is that everyone else is doing it, said Dr. Stephen Goldbart, author of "Affluence Intelligence" and co-director of the Money, Meaning & Choices Institute. In 2008, researchers at Carnegie Mellon University attempted to explain why the poor are more likely to buy lottery tickets. Members of a third group were told they could either spend $5 on lottery tickets or buy none at all. "Because we're in a recession, people love to have a rescue fantasy," human behavior expert Dr. Wendy Walsh told CNN last year when the Mega Millions jackpot hit $656 million. Some study participants were given $1 at a time and asked if they wanted to spend each dollar on a lottery ticket, author George Loewenstein said.
