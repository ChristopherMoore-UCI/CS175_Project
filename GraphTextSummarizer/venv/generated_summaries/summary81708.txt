The Lakers are now hoping they can bounce back in game five, hopefully with the help of a fully fit Bynum, and not allow the Celtics to take a series lead. -- Los Angeles Lakers center Andrew Bynum was forced to retire from the fourth game of the NBA finals with an ongoing knee problem, as his team went down 96-89 to the Boston Celtics. " Lakers coach Phil Jackson believes that his team were outplayed by the New Englanders, especially in the closing stages of the game. Bynum had fluid drained from his knee just days before the first game of the best-of-seven series last week, but until now the injury has not hampered his performance. However, the 22-year-old spent almost half of Thursday night's game in Boston on the bench, only managing 12 minutes of action in the second half as L.A.'s East Coast rivals leveled the finals at 2-2.
