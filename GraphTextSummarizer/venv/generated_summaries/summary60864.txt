Camelot was sired by the great Montjeu, who was also responsible for fellow Derby winners Motivator, Authorized and Pour Moi. "However long I last, I last." A victory in the Triple Crown in what may be one of his final seasons on the flat would lend added poignancy to what has already been an omen-laden endeavour; the last horse to win the Triple Crown, Nijinsky, was trained at the very same Ballydoyle stables that Aiden O'Brien now occupies by a different O'Brien, legendary trainer Vincent. Tellingly, he also sired St Leger winners Scorpion and Masked Marvel (the 2011 champion). A victory in the St Leger would be the crowning glory of a sensational season for O'Brien, which has seen his Ballydoyle operation make a clean sweep of all the English Classics so far -- the 2,000 Guineas, the Derby and their fillies' equivalents, the 1,000 Guineas and the Oaks. Victory at Longchamp would see Camelot finally step out of the shadow of Nijinsky, who finished second in the Arc following his Triple Crown.
