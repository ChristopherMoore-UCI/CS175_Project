The Caterham and Marussia teams were forced to miss the race because of financial difficulties and have also dropped out of next week's Brazilian Grand Prix. A new ruling for 2014 will see double points awarded at the last race in Abu Dhabi -- which means a win is worth 50 points instead of 25. While there may be two races left to settle the 2014 world title and double points on offer come the finale, for the teams lower down the grid it may be a case of double or quits when it comes to their finances. There were swirling suggestions in Austin that Mercedes are privately worried that a final twist of fate in this fierce title race lies ahead in the desert denouement. But even if Hamilton wins next week's Brazilian Grand Prix just ahead of Rosberg, there is still a chance the 2008 champion will be denied a second title.
