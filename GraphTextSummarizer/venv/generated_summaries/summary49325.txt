All of the tainted cantaloupes were grown at Jensen Farms in Granada, Colorado, although they were shipped to 17 states -- Illinois, Wyoming, Tennessee, Utah, Texas, Colorado, Minnesota, Kansas, New Mexico, North Carolina, Missouri, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Arizona, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania. "It's important to know that if you know the cantaloupe that you have is not Jensen Farms, then it's OK to eat," CDC Director Tom Frieden told reporters during a conference call Wednesday. Jensen Farms has now ended its cantaloupe harvest for the season, so no new contaminated fruit will be entering the market, FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg said Wednesday. Although Jensen Farms does produce other products, there is no concern for any other product from the company, McGarry said. Officials could not give a figure Wednesday for the number of cantaloupes recalled.
