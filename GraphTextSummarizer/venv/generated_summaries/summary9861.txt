The tiny pair were born to mother Lun Lun, a 15-year-old giant panda, at Zoo Atlanta on Monday, the first arriving at 6:21 p.m. and the second at 6:23 p.m. "Twins are an entirely new scenario for Lun Lun, Zoo Atlanta and our animal care teams, who will no doubt be extremely busy over the next few months," King said. The twins are the first for Lun Lun, who has two other offspring at Zoo Atlanta, and are the product of artificial insemination. This is a success we share with all of our fellow zoological organizations working to understand and protect this iconic species, and we share our joy with our local community and with our colleagues in China," Raymond B. King, president and CEO of Zoo Atlanta, said in a statement. "We're thrilled to welcome Lun Lun's and Yang Yang's twins.
