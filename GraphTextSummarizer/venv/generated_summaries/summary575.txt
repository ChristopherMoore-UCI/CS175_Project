But Udinese struck back almost immediately with goals from Cristian Zapata after 20 minutes and Antonio Di Natale five minutes later. Di Vaio scored his 13th goal of the season and his team's third in injury time at the end of the match. The result means Udinese stay in eighth place, but are now only one point behind Palermo. Three minutes later the home side were ahead as striker Marco Di Vaio carved through the Lazio defense before finishing neatly. The Rossoneri had several chances to wrap up the match in the second half with Robinho going close twice, but it was left to the ever dependable Ibrahimovic to make sure of the points as he slotted home from a tight angle in injury time.
