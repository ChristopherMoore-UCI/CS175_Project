Although little is known about the aircraft's disappearance, the region has been struck by torrential rain -- which has some speculating that inclement weather could have played a role in the flight's disappearance "It is typical they would encounter monsoon weather," Maginnis said. And while the search won't cover as large an area as that of MH370, the Malaysia Airlines flight that disappeared in March, it is still a "broad area," which will be affected by weather, according to Maginnis. "Bad weather per se does not bring down aircraft," he said. "Turbulence doesn't bring an aircraft down," Maginnis said.
