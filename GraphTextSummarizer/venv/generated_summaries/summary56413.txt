Mickelson, who will be seeking his fourth Green Jacket at Augusta next month, shot his worst round at Bay Hill -- 79 -- as he battles to regain the form he showed in winning at Phoenix last month. It was another frustrating finish for the 37-year-old, who started the tournament in high spirits after publicly acknowledging his relationship with skiing star Lindsey Vonn. Major champions Ernie Els, Phil Mickelson, Webb Simpson, Lucas Glover and Trevor Immelman all missed the halfway cut along with FedEx Cup series leader Brandt Snedeker. Alongside him were fellow former world No. 1 Vijay Singh and fellow American Mark Wilson, who both moved up from 15th overnight with their 68s. Added to injury problems, he dropped as low as 58th in the standings before resurrecting his career with three titles last year and two more this season.
