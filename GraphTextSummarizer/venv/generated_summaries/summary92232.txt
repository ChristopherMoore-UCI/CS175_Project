He was one of the last actors to train with the legendary Lee Strasberg at the Actor's studio in New York with Al Pacino, Robert De Niro and Chris Walken and Harvey Keitel. It is the uncomfortable parallels between the ups and downs of Rourke's life and that of his character Randy "The Ram" Robinson -- a burnt-out fighter, once a crowd-puller, now scraping a living from second division fights in school gyms -- that give particular resonance to the role. "I knew he'd want me to revisit some very dark painful places." Things started to go wrong for Rourke in 1987, at the height of his fame after explicit blockbuster "9 1/2 Weeks." Today, a relaxed, expansive Rourke is sitting in sweats in a private room at an exclusive London hotel that is thick with cigarette smoke. Despite early promise, Rourke gained such a terrible reputation for self-destructive behavior and on-set antics that, no one in Hollywood would touch him.
