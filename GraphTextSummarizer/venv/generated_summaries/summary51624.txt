One question, though: After all he's been through, isn't it time Captain America got promoted? What we can infer from that (apart from the obvious, that "Captain America" survives the ordeal of "The Avengers") is that Samuel L. Jackson sounds like he will be a significant part of the sequel, as opposed to the glorified cameos he has done in other Marvel movies. Captain America is being redeployed. The coda to last year's "Captain America" set up "The Avengers" and, in turn, "The Avengers" is apparently setting up a "Captain America" sequel. "Captain America 2" (or whatever it is eventually called â€” let's pray it's not "Cap2n America," or some such) won't be the first sequel to hit theaters after "The Avengers."
