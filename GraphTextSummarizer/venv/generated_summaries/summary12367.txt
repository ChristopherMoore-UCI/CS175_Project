However, flip over to the iPod Touch camera specs and we see the following: "HD (720p) up to 30 frames per second with audio; still photos (960 x 720) with back camera." Then again, with the camera connection kit you can always just import images from a real camera. The specs for the iPad's rear-facing camera only lists one number: 720p. It seems impossible for Apple to put a decent camera into anything but the iPhone, and despite many hopes, both cameras in the iPad 2 are about as rudimentary as you could get without having to load a roll of film in there. It's extremely likely that the iPad 2 and the iPod Touch share the exact same camera (although we won't know for sure until iFixit tears one open to see).
