While the characters are rendered in a new way, some things never change: The familiar theme song is still intact, Snoopy still has a highflying imagination, and poor Charlie Brown is still the butt of everyone's jokes. Blue Sky Studios and 20th Century Fox rolled out the two-minute clip on Tuesday, giving another look at what Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Lucy and the rest look like in CGI. Craig Schulz co-wrote the "Peanuts" script with his son, Bryan, and Bryan's screenwriting partner Cornelius Uliano. "Horton Hears a Who" and "Ice Age: Continental Drift" director Steve Martino is at the helm of the project, which is also being produced by filmmaker Paul Feig. "Snoopy will not be rapping, (and) no one will be twerking," Feig has previously promised.
