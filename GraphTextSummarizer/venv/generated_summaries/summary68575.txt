-- France votes Sunday in a presidential runoff pitting incumbent Nicolas Sarkozy against Francois Hollande in an election dominated by economy, unemployment and immigration concerns. I must speak to the French, no matter who they are." Hollande, of the center-left Socialist party, also appealed for unity at his final rally in Perigueux, southwestern France. In the first round of voting, nearly a fifth of voters backed far-right National Front leader Marine Le Pen -- who wants to limit the number of immigrants entering France -- leading both candidates to reach out to her supporters. If elected, Hollande would be France's first left-wing president since Francois Mitterrand left office in 1995. Both candidates have been working hard to reach out to France's undecided voters in the two weeks since the first-round vote on April 22 left them the only two still in the race.
