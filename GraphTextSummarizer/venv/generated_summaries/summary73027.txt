Zenaida Gonzalez has filed a civil suit against Casey Anthony, who was acquitted last year of murder and other charges tied to the death of her 2-year-old daughter Caylee though she was convicted on four counts of providing false information to law enforcement officers. In her judgment Thursday, Circuit Judge Lisa Munyon ruled that the critical issue of whether or not Anthony -- in her statements to police and in a recorded jailhouse conversation with her parents -- fingered Gonzalez, the plaintiff, or effectively exonerated her in her daughter's disappearance "must be decided by a jury. " Moreover, Gonzalez's assertion that Casey's mother Cindy Anthony was "acting as (an) agent of" her daughter is likewise "a disputed matter for jury determination. Anthony's civil attorneys have argued that their client never identified the specific woman suing her as the "Zenaida Gonzalez," the name she gave police. " "Both parties agree that the defendant did not implicate (Gonzalez) in the disappearance of the child in the July 16, 2008, statements to law enforcement," Munyon wrote in her ruling.
