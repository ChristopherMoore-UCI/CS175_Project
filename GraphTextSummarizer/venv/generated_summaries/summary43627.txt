Although Silverstein is best remembered for his children's poetry, he also penned songs for stars like Loretta Lynn, wrote plays and was a mainstay at the Playboy Mansion. In 1968 Beach Boys drummer Dennis Wilson was pals with an eccentric struggling singer-songwriter named Charles Manson. "Islands in the Stream" (The Bee Gees) This chart-topping duet for Kenny Rogers and Dolly Parton came from the minds of disco icons. "A Boy Named Sue" (Shel Silverstein) Johnny Cash's beloved tune came from a surprising source: poet Shel Silverstein. Stalwart songwriter Paul Jabara and David Letterman's bandleader, Paul Shaffer, actually co-wrote the number-one dance hit.
