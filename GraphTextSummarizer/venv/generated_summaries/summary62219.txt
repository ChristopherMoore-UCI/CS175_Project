The plane, a high performance L-39 Albatross jet trainer, was attempting a 45-degree bank when it crashed, Assistant Police Chief Don Schaeffer told CNN affiliate WQAD. "Ladies and gentlemen, please keep your seats," an announcer can be heard saying on the video obtained by CNN affiliate KWQC. The pilot of the plane was killed in the accident Saturday afternoon when the plane nosedived into an alfalfa field during the Quad City Air Show, officials said. The pilot was a member of the Hopper Flight, a group of exhibition fliers, Schaeffer said. -- A plane performing at an air show in Davenport, Iowa, crashed and exploded in front of thousands of spectators.
