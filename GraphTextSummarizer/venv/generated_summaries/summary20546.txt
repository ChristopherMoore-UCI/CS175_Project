Yeah, a lot of voters have already made up their minds based upon party affiliation, but I believe most Americans dread being manipulated for 10 more months by an onslaught of isolated statistics, abbreviated facts and slick campaign ads. The president Obama promised to be would have said, "This is America, where we have freedom of religion and the fact that this is being used as a way to characterize me as unfit to be president is not only religious bigotry, it's unconstitutional and un-American. A cursory glance at the record and statements of the GOP candidates as well as President Obama shows a heap of flip-flops. I don't regret voting for Obama, especially considering that Sen. John McCain's way of playing the game could have resulted in putting Sarah Palin within a heartbeat of the presidency, but I wouldn't classify myself as an Obama supporter either. " Or look how the professorial Newt Gingrich told us Herman Cain would be a good president, even though we all witnessed Cain struggle to talk intelligently about Libya, China or even huge chunks of the United States.
