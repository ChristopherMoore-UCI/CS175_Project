Akilah and Kris Richards Lawrenceville, Georgia Married eight years When Akilah and Kris became friends in the 10th grade, she was the extroverted captain of the cheerleading squad and the student-government vice president. The qualities the couple once prized in each other -- Akilah's verve and attitude, Kris's easygoing manner -- were now sources of irritation. And when Akilah felt herself acting like an imperious prosecutor, she would reach out and take Kris's hand. "I liked that Kris was really laid-back," says Akilah, 33, "and he appreciated my big personality." When faced with a problem, Akilah preferred to lay everything out on the table, while Kris, who hates conflict, would try to drop the subject.
