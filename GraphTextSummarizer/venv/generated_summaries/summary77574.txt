Sheikh Nur Mohamed Abkey, another radio journalist, was also killed in Mogadishu in early May. "The violence in Mogadishu has made it extremely dangerous for media professionals to carry out their work without falling victim to the ever-flying bullets and widespread criminality," said Omar Faruk Osman, NUSOJ secretary general. In June 2006, Martin Adler, a Swedish cameraman and journalist, was shot dead by an assailant with a pistol during a packed rally in Mogadishu. We call on African Union troops and Al Shabaab to safeguard the lives of journalists. Adan was on top of Hurma Radio station's roof in Mogadishu, helping fix a transmitter when a stray bullet hit him in the stomach, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ). Barkhat Awale Adan, 60, was killed Tuesday afternoon while covering fierce fighting between Al Shabaab rebels and Somalia's government forces.
