In November 1950, a United Nations force -- including U.S. Marines, U.S. Army units and British Royal Marine commandos -- deployed around the strategic Chosin Reservoir, a frozen, man-made lake high in the Hamgyong mountains that supplied hydroelectric power to the industrial cities on the coastal plain. "Korea is too hard to define in Hollywood terms: They put out movies of heroism and derring-do in World War II or arrogance and stupidity in Vietnam, and people understand," said Don Kirk a veteran Asia-based U.S. correspondent. Hamgyong witnessed arguably the most harrowing battle fought by U.S. or British troops since World War II, a forgotten epic that offers every ingredient for the perfect war movie: an embattled force, towering odds, murderous combat and treacherous weather. Although Hollywood has produced numerous classics on World War II and Vietnam, perhaps the only memorable Korea-set films are "Pork Chop Hill" (1959) and "MASH" (1970). Despite its near invisibility in art, the Korean War marked numerous Cold War milestones.
