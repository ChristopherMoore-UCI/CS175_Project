They have used political clout to maintain government subsidies for working-age men to study the Torah full time and protect the ability for ultra-Orthodox Israelis to win easy exemptions from compulsory military service. -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Cabinet has approved legislation that could end the exemption ultra-Orthodox Jews get on military service. "Our objective is two-fold: integrating young ultra-Orthodox into IDF (Israel Defense Forces) and national service and, no less important, integrating them into the labor force." But the latest ruling government coalition formed this year excludes ultra-religious parties, almost always part of such coalitions in Israel. "We will enact this change gradually while considering the special needs of the ultra-Orthodox population," Netanyahu said.
