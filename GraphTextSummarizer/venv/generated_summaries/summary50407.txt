Sporyshev and Podobnyy also tried to recruit U.S. citizens as intelligence sources in New York, the complaint said. The charges and Buryakov's arrest "make clear that—more than two decades after the presumptive end of the Cold War—Russian spies continue to seek to operate in our midst under cover of secrecy," said U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara. The reason for the puzzling behavior, according to a federal complaint unsealed Monday, is that the men were Russian spies exchanging intelligence information in New York City. " Agents like that, known as "NOCs," generally receive "less scrutiny by the host government, and, in many cases, are never identified as intelligence agents by the host government," a statement from U.S. law enforcement authorities said. He also accepted documents that the source claimed had come from a U.S. government agency and "purportedly contained information potentially useful to Russia, including information about United States sanctions against Russia," according to the U.S. law enforcement statement.
