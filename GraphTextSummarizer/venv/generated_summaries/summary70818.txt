More than 600 acres now, Arlington is mostly known for dignified rows of white marble headstones that sweep down an expansive, rolling tree-lined slope where the hallowed ground almost touches the Potomac River. Many flock to the most well-known grave -- that of President John F. Kennedy. It is a solemn ritual repeated multiple times daily, year-round at Arlington National Cemetery outside Washington. Under an almost cloudless sky, family members gathered and soldiers marched in full military dress. Christman, a civil war soldier, was the first to be buried at Arlington and the graveside remembrance was held to mark the start of the cemetery's 150th anniversary commemoration, which will continue through June 16.
