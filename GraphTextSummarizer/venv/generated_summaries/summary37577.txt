Down on one knee, Tovin opened up a ring box to reveal Phillips's lost treasure. After searching on social media, Tovin eventually connected with Robert's son, Eric Phillips. In some ways, this decades-long loop of life has been closed, and a new story -- one that the Phillips family will be telling for generations -- has been written. Phillips e-mailed a copy of his father's diploma, and Tovin was convinced he was in the right place. Tovin hoped he could return the cherished ring to Phillips at his home, but Phillips -- now fighting cancer -- was not there.
