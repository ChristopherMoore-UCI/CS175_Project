Nicaraguan authorities said Toth first entered the Central American country on October 12, 2012, using a false identity. Eric Toth, 31, a former private school teacher and camp counselor, entered no plea to charges of possession and production of child pornography. Toth was placed on the FBI's "Ten Most Wanted" fugitives list last April. As he was escorted away in a patrol car, Toth told reporters that "the police have been very professional." Journalist Samantha Lugo contributed to this report from Managua, Nicaragua. FBI Assistant Director Valerie Parlave said investigators looking for Toth for five years received a "high quality" tip on April 18 and were able to take him into custody on Saturday in the small Nicaraguan community of Esteli.
