The players -- Salman Butt, Mohammed Asif and Mohammed Amir -- were due to head to London on Wednesday morning from Taunton, England, where their squad is preparing for a match against the local team, Somerset, Saeed said. The meeting will take place Thursday morning at the Pakistani High Commission in London, team manager Yawar Saeed said. The newspaper, the News of the World, reported that two Pakistan players deliberately bowled "no balls," or fouls, during their test series with England in London last week. They and Saeed were already questioned by London's Metropolitan Police over the scandal, he said earlier this week. Three people were also arrested Sunday in connection with the scandal and held on suspicion of money-laundering, a representative of HM Revenue and Customs told CNN.
