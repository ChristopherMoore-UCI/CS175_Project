"The idea is to inspire, inform and engage young people on the issue of climate change and bring to light what's been happening in the arctic region in particular," Liautaud, who was born in California, told CNN. Parker Liautaud, who attends the prestigious Eton College in southern England, will begin his two-week odyssey on March 31. Parker's expedition will include a large social media component, with Parker rallying young people around the world to become catalysts for change. Led by experienced adventurer Doug Stoup, Parker hopes to raise awareness among young people about environment issues. Twice a day, he will update his location on Facebook via Google Earth.
