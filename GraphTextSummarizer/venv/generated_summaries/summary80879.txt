Supporters rally for U.S. journalists Euna Lee and Laura Ling on June 4 in Seoul, South Korea. -- North Korea's state media released a "detailed report" Tuesday claiming that American journalists Laura Ling and Euna Lee entered the country illegally in order to record material for a "smear campaign" against the reclusive communist state. It added that the two women "admitted that what they did were criminal acts ... prompted by the political motive to isolate and stifle the socialist system of the DPRK by faking up moving images aimed at falsifying its human rights performance and hurling slanders and calumnies at it." Ling and Lee were sentenced this month to 12 years of hard labor in North Korea. They were arrested in March for "having illegally trespassed into the border of the DPRK [Democratic People's Republic of Korea, as North Korea is officially known] and committed hostile acts against it for which they were tried. Relations between North and South Korea are extremely tense.
