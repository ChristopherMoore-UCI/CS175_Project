With that Oscar-winning short, Pixar's John Lasseter first started playing with "this notion of a juxtaposition with the audience," as Lasseter puts it in the documentary "The Making of Toy Story." You can spot that sequence on the license plate of the minivan driven by Andy's mom in "Toy Story," "Toy Story 2" and "Toy Story 3." We were inspired from 'Tin Toy' with the ideas we developed there of toys being alive." Pixar then played around with the idea of the "Tin Toy," Tinny, being one of two stars of a toy-focused buddy movie. "Toy Story" wasn't supposed to be the movie's title "Toy Story" was supposed to just be the working title for the project, and not what it was supposed to be called when it arrived in theaters. It all goes back to a short called "Tin Toy" In 1988, Pixar created a short film using computer animation called "Tin Toy," which told the story of a little toy soldier who was horrified by the babbling baby eager to play with him.
