The Royal Gibraltar Regiment fired a 62-gun salute for her real birthday at the Tower of London, Retired Lt. Col. Stuart Green said. On her official birthday each June, the Queen and other members of the royal family attend the Trooping the Colour military parade in central London. Hundreds of guests gathered for the salute, which included 21 guns for the Queen's birthday, 21 because it's a royal palace and 20 guns to show the City of London's loyalty to the monarch, Green said. The regiment, usually based in Gibraltar, is currently in London for ceremonial duties including guarding Buckingham Palace and the Tower of London, he said. The salute in Hyde Park was performed by the King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery, using teams of galloping horses to pull six World War I-era guns into position.
