Netanyahu's position is to solve Iran first and then Israel can deal with Palestinian peace. Because Obama has made clear he thinks a Palestinian state better serves Israel's and the United States' security, there were expectations of a showdown between him and Netanyahu. Again, sitting next to Obama, Netanyahu spoke of a scenario in which "Israel and the Palestinians live side by side in dignity, security and in peace," but he didn't mention a Palestinian state. For instance, if Israel halts settlement activity or removes outposts, the Arabs could take any number of steps, such as opening trade offices in Israel or allowing telecommunications or air travel between Israel and Arab countries. -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met in President Obama what might be a new chapter in the 60-year relationship between Israel and the United States.
