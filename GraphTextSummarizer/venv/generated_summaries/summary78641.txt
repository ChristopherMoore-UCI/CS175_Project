"They've been honest with them, in the hope of mercy on the behalf of Mr. Garrido for Mrs. Garrido," said Tapson, who does not represent Philip Garrido. Stephen Tapson, the court-appointed attorney for Nancy Garrido, told reporters that she and Philip Garrido had given "full and complete statements" to the El Dorado, California, sheriff's office -- including one such session in which Dugard was in the same room, separated from her alleged abductors by only a table. Tapson alluded to Nancy Garrido's role in kidnapping Dugard and other issues, while distancing his client from her part in the forced sexual relationship between Dugard and Philip Garrido. He said that Nancy Garrido served as a mother figure to Dugard's children, fathered by Philip and born while Jaycee was in captivity. Absent a plea agreement, Nancy Garrido could face 278 years, eight months in prison, while Philip Garrido might get upwards of 440 years, according to Tapson.
