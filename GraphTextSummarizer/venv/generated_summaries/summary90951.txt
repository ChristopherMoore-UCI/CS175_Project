Further development on the three West Bank outposts has been banned, according to settlement watchdog group Peace Now, because they have been built on private Palestinian land. But Palestinian authorities, including Hebron police Chief Ramadan Awad, disputed that the purchase was made legally. -- Israeli police evicted 15 Jewish settlers from a an illegally occupied house in the restive West Bank city of Hebron on Wednesday following a weeklong showdown between the settler community and Israel's Defense Ministry, which administers the occupied territory. In retribution for the eviction, Hamdan added, Israeli settlers from Tel Rumeida in the old city of Hebron burned a tent that was set up by Palestinian activists in protest of the taking over of the house. Relations between Israelis and Palestinians living in Hebron have been marked by years of hostility and tension that have frequently erupted into violence.
