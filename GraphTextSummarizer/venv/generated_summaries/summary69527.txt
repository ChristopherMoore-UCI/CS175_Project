He was acquitted by an Egyptian military court and will be released Tuesday, said attorney Nizar Ghorab. "Zawahiri has been tortured for years by Mubarak's state security officers because he is the brother of Ayman Zawahiri," Ghorab said. -- Mohamed al-Zawahiri, brother of al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri, will be freed from prison in Egypt after 13 years, his attorney said Monday. Last year, Egypt's interim government released him along with scores of other political prisoners after a general pardon was issued by the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, which ruled the country after the ouster of President Hosni Mubarak. Five other Islamists charged with similar crimes were acquitted along with Al-Zawahiri, said Ghorab.
