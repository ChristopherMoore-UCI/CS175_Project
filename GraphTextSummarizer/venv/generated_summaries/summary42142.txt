So, when Republican politicians talk about limiting the scope of federal government, many blacks will be concerned that a contraction of federal power will limit continued progress in the realm of civil rights enforcement. By the early 1990s, Michael Dawson was able to demonstrate empirically that middle class blacks who believed in the idea that what happens to other blacks affects them were more likely to support racially redistributive policies that ran counter to their apparent class interests. As long as blacks still believe that they are the targets of discrimination, it is reasonable to expect them to factor group interests into their political choices. Do blacks really behave as political lemmings, and could they benefit from embracing the Republican agenda? In the 1970s, political scientists started to notice that politically active blacks were more likely to frame their ideas about politics in terms of racial group interest.
