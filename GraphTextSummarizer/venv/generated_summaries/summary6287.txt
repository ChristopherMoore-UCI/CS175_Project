" Holder Luke Donald opens his defense against veteran South African Ernie Els, with Peter Hanson of Sweden or American Jason Dufner awaiting the winners. Westwood will open his tournament against Belgian Nicolas Colsaerts, with the winner facing either Robert Karlsson or Fredrik Jacobson, both of Sweden. -- Spain's Gonzalo Fernandez-Castano believes he can send former world number one Tiger Woods packing in this week's WGC Match Play tournament, as a high-class field arrives in Arizona vying for a winner's purse of a cool $1.4m. A high-class field sees 64 of the world's top 68 players battling it out at the Ritz-Carlton Club, Dove Mountain, with Woods the most successful player in the event's history having won the title three times since its inception in 1999. " Despite Woods' slide down the rankings in recent years, he is still ranked 20th in the world, meaning Fernandez-Castano would have to cause a major upset to progress to a last 32 clash against either Nick Watney or British Open champion Darren Clarke. However, despite the American's ominous tournament record, world No.48 Fernandez-Castano is relishing the prospect of taking on the former world number one on Wednesday.
