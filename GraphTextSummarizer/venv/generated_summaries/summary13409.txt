-- Residents of Galveston Island, Texas, who were evacuated before Hurricane Ike strafed the Texas Gulf coast can return to their homes Wednesday, but they will find few comforts, Mayor Lyda Ann Thomas said Saturday. Thomas said residents can begin returning at 6 a.m. (7 a.m. ET) Wednesday. Thomas gave a long list of supplies residents should take with them when they return. Residents of the heavily damaged west end of the island can assess their damages but must leave the area by 6 p.m., Thomas said. "Very limited water, sewer, natural gas, and electric services have been restored to areas behind the seawall," the mayor said in a statement.
