American Idol finalists Kree Harrison and Candice Glover wowed the audience at the Nokia Theater at L.A. Live Wednesday evening with three show-stopping ballads each. Harrison and Glover may not have Urban's luxury of distance, but both offered up insights into their performances as well. With that kind of pressure, it's tempting to think that Harrison and Glover are enemies, just playing friendly on stage. After the performances, Glover, Harrison and judge Keith Urban came backstage to talk about their night, that coin flip, and singing those soulful songs. "My birthday is the day after the finale," Harrison said, adding with a laugh: "Vote for me for my birthday!" As many know, Glover was an American Idol contestant before, but despite her success this year, she doesn't feel as though she was robbed before.
