That's when they realized that the guy had actually shot at him, hit him, struck his cell phone, and the cell phone had stopped his bullet," Winter Garden Police Lt. Scott Allen said. After both the store workers' efforts to open it failed, the man fired a single gunshot as he left the store, WESH reported, citing police. The man then pulled out a revolver and demanded that the clerk open the safe, CNN affiliate WESH reported, but the clerk was unable to get the safe door open. The chest pains were caused by the impact of the bullet on the cell phone, which was in the clerk's chest pocket, according to WESH. Police described the suspect in the attack as a black man about 6 feet tall wearing a dark-colored hooded sweatshirt, pants, sunglasses, a bright yellow traffic vest and white gloves, according to WESH.
