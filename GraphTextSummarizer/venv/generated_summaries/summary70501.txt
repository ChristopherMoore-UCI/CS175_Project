The 45-year-old becomes the sixth coach to lose his job in the Spanish top flight this season following the departures of Abel Resino (Atletico Madrid), Juan Carlos Mandia (Racing Santander), Marcelino Garcia Toral (Real Zaragoza), and Hugo Sanchez and Jose Angel Ziganda (both Xerez). -- Villarreal have sacked coach Ernesto Valverde following Sunday's 2-0 Spanish Primera Liga defeat at home to Osasuna. Despite a recent draw against Barcelona at the Nou Camp, Valverde has paid the price for an inconsistent season which has also seen the club crash out of the Spanish Cup to second division side Celta Vigo. Meanwhile, on the pitch, Sevilla moved up to fourth place in the table as a double from Alvaro Negredo -- the second a superb chip -- earned them a 2-1 home victory over third-placed Valencia. And Atletico Madrid were jeered off by their own fans after slumping 2-0 at home to Malaga, their ninth defeat of the season.
