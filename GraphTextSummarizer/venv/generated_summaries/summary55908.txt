"This is the first time Nogales police officers have ever been threatened by anyone in drug trafficking," says chief Kirkham. "They named the Nogales police department officers that were in that area off duty," says police chief Jeffrey Kirkham. And last year, the town of Nogales captured headlines when U.S. Border Patrol agents found a sophisticated drug-smuggling tunnel that went under the border fence. Yet the cartels responded swiftly with a message for Nogales police: When you're not in uniform, you better look the other way or you'll be targeted. The busts netted about $600,000 in marijuana -- relatively small potatoes in the underworld of drug trafficking.
