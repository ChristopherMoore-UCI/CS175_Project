"The investigation has revealed that Chamberlain has utilized an anonymous, Internet-based market place known as Black Market Reloaded to facility the unlawful acquisition and possession of biological agents and lethal toxins in California and Florida," FBI agent Michael Eldridge wrote in the latest documents. -- A San Francisco man accused of possessing bomb-making materials in his apartment also bought lethal toxins online, the FBI said in documents unsealed Friday. Authorities had been looking for him after searching his neighborhood on a tip that he had "items of great concern" at his home, FBI Special Agent in Charge David Johnson said. If convicted of the illegal destructive device possession charge, he faces up to 10 years in prison and a $10,000 fine. But the latest documents detail lethal poisons bought anonymously in dark, encrypted corners of the Web.
