"Nutrition wise, compared to other pizzas or fast food items in the market, it's really not astronomical -- if you're going to indulge, this pizza is definitely worth it," Little Caesars spokesperson Tina Taylor tells CNN. The rectangular, deep-dish pie comes wrapped in whole strips of thick-cut, crispy bacon, then topped with pepperoni and even more chewy pieces of bacon. A new menu offering from Little Caesars will also wrap 3.5 feet of bacon around the pizza's crust. No longer is it enough to have bacon on your pizza. At $12, Taylor asks, "What could be more delicious than a pizza wrapped in bacon?"
