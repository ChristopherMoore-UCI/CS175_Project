Text messages and online chats revealed that the 59-year-old victim from Hanover asked to be killed, police said. There is no evidence that the suspect ate body parts, and he denied doing so, Laske said. " Marko Laske, a police spokesman, said: "Our investigations have just begun, and we cannot confirm rumors yet that the suspect has eaten parts of the victim or that it was a sexually motivated act." German media are identifying him as "Detlev G." After having been in contact for months through chat, e-mail, telephone and text, the men agreed to meet on November 4. For an unusual case with such wide repercussions, it will take a while to find out the truth about what really happened and why he did it," Laske said.
