But U.S. District Judge James Cacheris asked: "What if God tells him to do this again when he gets out?" Troccoli said El Khalifi believed he had "satisfied his faith" and also noted the plea agreement called for his client to be deported to Morroco after he serves his time. That's it," Amine El Khalifi said before his sentencing at U.S. District Court in Alexandria, Virginia. Troccoli said El Khalifi's main interest was in mixing music but that led him to a lifestyle that included spending time in night clubs and using drugs. According to a statement of facts in the case, El Khalifi changed his mind about what to target and at various times considered a restaurant, a military installation and a synagogue. El Khalifi has no ill will toward Americans and was relieved his plot was thwarted and no one was injured, Troccoli said, adding that his client admitted culpability to a serious offense but was "enabled" in the plot by two men who he didn't know were working for the FBI.
