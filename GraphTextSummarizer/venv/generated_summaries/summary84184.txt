But a lawyer for Alexander's estranged husband, Rico Gray, says he has concerns. According to police reports, Alexander had no injuries, but Gray had a bloody swollen eye and told police Alexander had punched him. A police report from that time shows that Alexander was arrested for a domestic violence offense connected to an altercation with Gray. In a Jacksonville, Florida, court, a judge is expected to decide if Alexander will be released on bond in a case that has drawn national attention. In September an appellate court ordered a new trial for Alexander, who was sentenced to 20 years in prison for firing a gun to scare off her allegedly abusive husband.
