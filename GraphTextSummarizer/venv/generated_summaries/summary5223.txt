China doesn't have any of America's problems of bad press in the Middle East or Africa, or people back home saying they shouldn't buy conflict diamonds or whatever. Brooklyn, New York (VBS.TV) -- Before I went to Sudan, I didn't know much about the conflict in Darfur beyond everyone saying, "It's the worst genocide of our time" and watching footage on CNN of the Janjaweed militia wiping out whole villages. In fact, we could point our finger at America for the early days of it, because Chevron sank the first well in southern Sudan. All the money that Sudan gets from these wells goes to the north to Khartoum. They finally enacted a peace agreement to unite north and south Sudan, and the UN went to Sudan especially to monitor that agreement.
