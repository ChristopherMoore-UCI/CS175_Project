In Miami, basketball star Dwyane Wade tied the knot with actress Gabrielle Union on Saturday, the same weekend that Ashlee Simpson -- the musical younger sister of Jessica Simpson -- reportedly wed Diana Ross' actor son Evan in Connecticut, and Donnie Wahlberg said "I do" to Jenny McCarthy. According to People magazine, the ceremony was attended by close friends and family, including Simpson's sister, Jessica, and Simpson's 5-year-old son Bronx Mowgli, whose father is her ex-husband Pete Wentz. Wahlberg's NKOTB bandmates, including Jordan Knight and Joey McIntyre, were in attendance, along with McCarthy's former "View" co-host Sherri Shepherd. Closing out the love-filled holiday weekend was New Kids on the Block star Wahlberg and former "The View" personality McCarthy, who swapped vows in Chicago. It was on the ABC talk show that McCarthy, 41, announced her engagement to Wahlberg, 45, in April.
