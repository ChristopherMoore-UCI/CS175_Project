But Laxman joined Tendulkar, who made a patient 54 off 122 balls -- his 56th half-century in his record 169th Test appearance -- before also falling to Randiv at 171-5. But I was in such pain that I thought that the best decision in team's interest was to have a runner instead of just giving away the wicket due to pain. Tendulkar had been dropped by a close fielder when on 18 also off Randiv, who claimed his first five-wicket haul in just his second outing after coming in to replace retired world record-holder Muttiah Muralitharan. Resuming on 53-3 in their second innings on Saturday, India soon lost nightwatchman Ishant Sharma for four as off-spinner Suraj Randiv claimed his fourth wicket. Hopefully, he plays plenty more innings like this for us." Laxman, a veteran of 113 Tests, said he had struggled to keep momentum due to his back pain.
