What if beyond the bloodshed, hostility and extremism, there were also hopeful examples of Palestinian and Israeli civilians leading effective nonviolent movements to end the occupation and build peace? Our latest documentary film, "Budrus," tells the story of a Palestinian community organizer who successfully unites Palestinians of all political factions together with Israeli supporters in an unarmed movement to save his village from destruction by Israel's Separation Barrier. Looking back at some of the great influential social movements of the past few decades, whether it's the civil rights movement in the United States, the global feminist movement or the recent Arab Spring, some of the biggest positive changes to our societies have come from grassroots nonviolent activism, not the actions of governments or armed campaigns. TED.com: Jeremy Gilley's plan for "One day of peace" If we, as a global audience, focus solely on violence and militarism, we reinforce the notion that they are the most effective form of action. The lessons of Budrus and the dozens of other nonviolent initiatives we follow resonate even more loudly when considering recent historical examples.
