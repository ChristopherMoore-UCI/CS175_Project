In Deir Ezzor, Free Syrian Army members purportedly destroyed "the Division of the Countryside," a government ministry, as the opposition fighters battled government forces who were subjecting them to "intense shelling." -- Fresh explosions and riveting gunfire punctuated the pre-dawn hours Monday in cities around Syria, opposition activists said, with the ongoing violence coming on the heels of yet another bloody weekend in the embattled nation. Around 3 a.m., the Local Coordination Committees of Syria -- a network of opposition activists -- reported on its Facebook page that at least three major blasts in a few hours had rattled the Damascus neighborhood Mazzeh, where persistent gunfire rang out for at least an hour. " Some of the latest violence appeared to pit Syrian government forces against members of the rebel Free Syrian Army. Opposition activists also described what happened to 32 surviving children and two women after an attack last week in the Rifai district of Homs province.
