One of the best places in the world to get up close to these monstrous delicacies is the remote Great Orme coastline in north Wales. "During the trip we haul numerous lobster pots so guests can see them up close and have an opportunity to handle the lobsters -- and for that matter a whole host of other marine creatures also caught in the pots," Davies said. Along with magical rides and stage shows, the Florida theme park also offers waterways teeming with bass. When it comes to ferocious fish, the South American peacock bass didn't earn the nickname "freshwater bully" for nothing. The Lobster Safari offers boat trips beside the towering cliffs, with on-board marine biologist Carl Davies explaining the process behind catching the elusive creatures in huge traps, known as pots.
