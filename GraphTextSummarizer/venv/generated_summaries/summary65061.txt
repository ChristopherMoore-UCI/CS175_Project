Cheney sisters spar over same-sex marriage, parents weigh in This week, while calling on Enzi to denounce the ad and labeling it "gutter politics," Cheney stood by those earlier positions. In a country where, as public opinion polls make clear, the opinion of so many Americans on same-sex marriage is rapidly evolving due in large part to the fact that young Americans consider this a nonissue, it would have been good to see some personal growth from Cheney. Here is what Liz Cheney missed: To many proponents of marriage equality, the very idea of "traditional marriage" is offensive. "This is an issue we have dealt with privately for many years, and we are pained to see it become public," Vice President Dick Cheney and his wife, Lynne, said Monday in a statement. An independent political group calling itself the American Principles Fund, which is defending Enzi, recently launched an ad attacking Cheney for opposing a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage and supporting the decision of the State Department to give benefits to same-sex partners of employees.
