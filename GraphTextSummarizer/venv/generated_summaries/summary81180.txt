As Grace said afterwards -- well to be honest she heckled me at the time with the words "shut up Dad, this is embarrassing," -- I was answering a question I had not been asked, namely "why aren't there more women in the book?' rather than the one I had been asked, "do men and women win in different ways? At every single one of the nine or so events I have so far done about the book, and in several of the many interviews, I have been asked -- usually but not always by a woman -- a version of this same question: "Do men and women win in different ways? The row in the car on the way home was reasonably good-natured, considering my partner of 36 years was basically confirming I was not a new man and suggesting I talked absolute tosh about whether men and women win in different ways. She said it was still a man's world and women had essentially to do twice as many jobs as men. Having been Tony Blair's spokesman and strategist for a decade and more, having been at his side through election campaigns, wars and peace processes, political and personal crises, scandals galore, having spent thousands of hours facing down possibly the most questioning media on the planet, and having done thousands of talks and interviews since leaving TB's side, I am very experienced in answering difficult questions.
