The two Tests between Australia and Pakistan will take place at Lord's in London on July 13-17 and Headingley in Leeds from July 21-25. " Khawaja, who is also a fully-qualified pilot, was named in a strong 14-man Australian side for the series which begins on July 13. "Ben Hilfenhaus has successfully returned from injury during the current Australia A series in Queensland," Hilditch said. Khawaja, who was born in Islamabad but moved to Australia at the age of four, said he was "shocked" at being selected for the two-Test series, which was moved to England due to safety concerns in Pakistan due to last year's extremist attack on the Sri Lankan cricket team bus. The 23-year-old made headlines in 2008 when he became the first cricketer of Pakistani-Australian background to play first-class cricket in Australia, making his debut for New South Wales in an inter-state match against Victoria.
