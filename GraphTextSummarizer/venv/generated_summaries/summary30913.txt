Public health in New Orleans before Katrina meant treatment in run-down, understaffed public hospitals. The enduring erosion of the coastline, caused by bad water management all the way from the upper Mississippi River and the coastal canals, erodes the marshes and leaves coastal Louisiana exposed to the full brunt of future hurricanes. Chief of those was Charity Hospital, known as "Big Charity," the state-run teaching hospital for Louisiana State University Medical School. The region has more hotels and restaurants than it had before the hurricane, and its major infrastructure -- sewer, water, public service buildings, police and fire departments, National Guard -- has new or rebuilt buildings. The Veterans Hospital, next to Big Charity, was also destroyed during Katrina.
