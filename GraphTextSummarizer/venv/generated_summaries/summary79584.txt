The sudden shutdown of ERT has prompted fear among many Greeks that other public sector employers could be next. Their support helped swell the number of demonstrators outside the ERT headquarters, estimated at about 10,000 by Athens police. Thousands gathered outside the headquarters of the broadcaster, ERT, whose TV channels and radio services were pulled off the air overnight Tuesday to Wednesday. Prime Minister Antonis Samaras described ERT Wednesday as a "symbol of waste and lack of transparency" that needed to be changed. The European Commission said Wednesday it had not sought the closure of ERT, "but nor does the Commission question the Greek Government's mandate to manage the public sector."
