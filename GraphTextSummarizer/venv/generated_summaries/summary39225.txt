Thus far, the only member of the Bush clan to publicly reject the idea of Jeb Bush running for president has been his mother, Barbara Bush, who told PBS in January, "I hope he won't." That was former President George W. Bush's take on the likelihood of his brother, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, running for president in 2016. In April, Jeb Bush's younger brother Neil said their father, former president George H. W. Bush, also endorsed the idea. Bush has not been shy about publicly encouraging his younger brother to run for president in 2016. Last month, he told Fox News that he thinks his brother "wants to be president." Bush 43 admitted that he does "occasionally fuel speculation" about his brother's political ambitions, but said he does so because he thinks his brother is the man for the job.
