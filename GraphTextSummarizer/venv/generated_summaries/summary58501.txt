(RollingStone.com) -- Before the curtain rose for "American Idiot" at Manhattan's St. James Theater last night, an announcer listed the house rules and then added, "By the way, the role of St. Jimmy will be played by Billie Joe Armstrong." "These people were on a stage singing my songs -- it was kind of like being invited to your own funeral," Armstrong told "Rolling Stone" after witnessing the play last spring. 'American Idiot' musical: Meet the show's rocker cast Armstrong appeared 30 minutes into the show, atop a moving staircase, where he howled the "1-2-3-4" count-off during "St. Jimmy." " Since the musical (which is based on the 2004 Green Day album of the same name, which itself sold five million copies and won a Grammy for Best Rock Album) debuted in April, Billie Joe has promoted it tirelessly, once surprising the audience with a short Green Day set, performing with the cast on Monday Night Football and appearing on local New York television. " Peter Travers reviews 'American Idiot' Playing St. Jimmy amounts to Armstrong's biggest show of support yet for the show, which last week played to half-full houses.
