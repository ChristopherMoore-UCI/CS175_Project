Balfour was accused of fatally shooting Hudson's mother, Darnell Donerson, 57, and the singer's brother, Jason Hudson, 29, in their Chicago home in October 2008. Cook County prosecutor Jennifer Bagby said in her closing argument that Balfour had threatened to kill the family of Julia Hudson. "It is our prayer that the Lord will forgive Mr. Balfour of these heinous acts and bring his heart into repentance someday," the sisters said in the statement, which was posted to Jennifer Hudson's website and linked to via Twitter. "None of us wanted her to marry him," Hudson said of her sister's decision to marry Balfour. In her closing argument, Bagby said Balfour shot Hudson's mother as she tried to defend herself with a broom.
