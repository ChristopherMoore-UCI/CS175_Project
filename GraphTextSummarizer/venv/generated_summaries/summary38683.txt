-- A California man indicted in a Vanderbilt University football rape investigation traveled to Tennessee and surrendered to police, Nashville authorities said Friday. His bail was set at $10,000, Nashville police said, and it was unclear Friday whether Finley had posted that bail. Finley, of Bermuda Dunes, California, and Quinzio are friends of Brandon Vandenburg, one of four former Vanderbilt football players indicted on charges of rape, and are each accused of one felony count of tampering with electronic evidence, authorities said. A co-defendant, Joseph Dominick Quinzio, 20, of Palm Desert, California, "continues to go through the legalities of the extradition process in California," police said in a statement. He was allegedly joined in his dorm room by three now-former Vanderbilt football players also indicted on charges of rape: Cory Batey, Brandon Banks and Jaborian McKenzie, authorities said.
