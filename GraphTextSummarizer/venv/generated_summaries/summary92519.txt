United States v. Windsor asks whether Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act, which defines marriage for federal law and programs as between one man and one woman, is unconstitutional. But the federal government is free to decide whom to confer federal benefits on â€” largely economic entitlements and federal issues such as immigration. Hollingsworth v. Perry is about whether state laws defining marriage as one man and one woman violate the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. But New York did not create gay marriage until 2011, so Windsor was not harmed by DOMA not allowing the federal government to recognize her marriage, since if the IRS used state definitions Windsor would still be regarded an a single woman. It also raises the issue of whether courts must recognize polygamous marriages, which are legal in dozens of nations worldwide.
