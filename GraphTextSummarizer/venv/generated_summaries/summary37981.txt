An arrest warrant was issued Friday morning for Trung Le -- a 20-year-old from nearby Belle Chasse, Louisiana -- on one count of first-degree murder and nine counts of attempted first-degree murder, police said. Police Officer Hilal Williams told CNN by e-mail early Friday evening that police officers and U.S. Marshals had apprehended Le. Authorities in New Orleans have caught the man they say fired the first shot in a deadly exchange of gunfire last weekend in the city's French Quarter, police said Friday. Specifically, he asked President Barack Obama to send a "targeted surge team" of federal law enforcement officers to help stem crime and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal to assign 100 state police officers to the city and rededicate a penny from the hotel/motel tax from the convention center to the city for public safety. The shooting took place about 2:45 a.m. Sunday on the 700 block of Bourbon Street, a popular gathering place for tourists and revelers who pack bars and clubs between St. Peter and St. Ann streets and often spill into the streets.
