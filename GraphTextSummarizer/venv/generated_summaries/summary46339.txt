The NFL has also expressed an interest in sharing donated brain tissue, in cases such as Duerson's, so that it can perform analysis of brain tissue in conjunction with institutions like Boston University. "He felt the left side of his brain was the cause of many of his problems that he was experiencing," said Duerson's ex-wife, Alicia Duerson. "We are taking this very seriously, and accelerating research on (the disease) will help get us more insight." For Duerson's family, the first clue that something was wrong came by way of a cryptic text: "a bizarre text message that he sent to my mother saying that he loved her and he loved my family and to please get his brain to the NFL brain bank," Tregg Duerson said. The details remain hazy, but family members believe that Duerson avoided injuring his brain so that it could be tested for disease. "It is quite striking to see case after case, especially the ones who took many years of brain trauma, to find this in nearly every one," said Chris Nowinski, co-director of the Boston University center.
