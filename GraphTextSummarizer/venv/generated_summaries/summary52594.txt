" Mandela's choice wasn't a surprise; Magubane, who had already photographed several milestones in Mandela's life, including his early days as a political activist in the 1950s, was renowned for his impressive body of work chronicling the cruelties of apartheid. "I became his photographer the next day he got home," remembers award-winning Magubane. Undeterred by threats, bans and prison, Magubane's defiant spirit shaped his work in the field. "I'm sick and tired of taking pictures of dead people," says Magubane. -- When Nelson Mandela was released from prison in February 1990, where he'd spent more than 27 years for fighting racial segregation, the South African leader knew exactly who he wanted to become his official photographer: Peter Magubane.
