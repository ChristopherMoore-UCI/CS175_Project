Park passports are $25 and provide entry to Arches, Canyonlands National Park, Hovenweep National Monument and Natural Bridges National Monument. "I just waltzed in to Arches National Park visitor center and asked if they needed help," she says. The location: Arches National Park is located in southeast Utah, about five miles north of Moab. Funniest moment in the park: Discovering that five members of a NorteÃ±o band, dressed in full concert costume, had lugged their instruments three miles to Delicate Arch and began belting out tunes under its shade. From the largest, Landscape Arch, to the tallest, Double Arch South, the park's 119 square miles are one of the most unique places on earth.
