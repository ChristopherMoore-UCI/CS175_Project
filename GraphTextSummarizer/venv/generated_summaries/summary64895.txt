There's a long list of performances, which include Taylor Swift collaborating with Alison Krauss and Vince Gill, Dave Grohl joining the Zac Brown Band, and George Strait and Alan Jackson paying tribute to the late, great George Jones. Back in August, when Paisley began talking to exec producer Robert Deaton about this year's show, one of their first conversations was about how the broadcast would honor Jones. If anybody's close to the stratosphere that George Jones was cruising in, it's them. For the sixth straight year, Brad Paisley and Carrie Underwood will cohost the CMA Awards, airing tonight at 8 p.m. ET on ABC. When we spoke to Paisley, he expected them to have fun with the genre's current identity crisis, epitomized by Brown referring to Entertainer of the Year nominee and fellow performer Luke Bryan's bro-country chart-topper "That's My Kind of Night" as "the worst song I've ever heard."
