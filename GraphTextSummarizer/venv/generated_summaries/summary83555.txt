The competing red carpet special on E! averaged 2.2 million viewers between 6 and 8 p.m. ET, which E! said was one of its highest-rated editions in Globes history. The strong ratings for the Globes were another affirmation that live awards shows are a boon to television networks in this age of increasingly time-shifted viewing. On the Internet, Nielsen SocialGuide, which measures the reach of Twitter messages, found that 2.36 million messages about the Globes reached a total of 10.4 million users on Sunday night. Entertainment Weekly, which like CNN is owned by Time Warner, observed that "any ratings boost could be seen as another endorsement of hosts Tina Fey and Amy Poehler, who hosted the show for the second year in a row. According to Nielsen, the average total audience during the three-hour broadcast was 20.9 million, up from 19.7 million last year.
