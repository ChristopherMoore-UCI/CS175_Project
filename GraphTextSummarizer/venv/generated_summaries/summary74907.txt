-- Pakistani authorities have started legal proceedings against the widows of former al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden for allegedly entering Pakistan illegally and alleged forgery, Pakistan's interior minister told reporters Thursday. Last year, Pakistan told U.S. officials that three wives of bin Laden, who was killed in Pakistan by U.S. forces last year, were living in the country. 2011: U.S. interviews "hostile" bin Laden widows "Their entry into Pakistan was illegal," Malik said. The status of the third widow, who authorities reported last year was also residing in Pakistan, was not immediately clear Thursday. The widows are in the custody of Pakistani authorities, Minister Rehman Malik said.
