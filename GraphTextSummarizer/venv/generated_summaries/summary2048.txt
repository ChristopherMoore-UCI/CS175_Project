-- Rafael Nadal claimed his first Australian Open title and denied a tearful Roger Federer his 14th grand slam crown after another epic five-set victory, 7-5 3-6 7-6 3-6 6-2 in Melbourne on Sunday. As expected, it proved a titanic struggle between the two leading players in world tennis, who were meeting for the first time since Nadal took Federer's Wimbledon title last July in another five-set classic. Nadal, who played the longest match in Australian Open history to beat Fernando Verdasco in his semifinal, was expected to show signs of tiredness, but it was Federer who wilted in the decider. In the tiebreak it was Nadal who pulled ahead again, reaching set point with a rare volleyed winner and sealing it as Federer double faulted. Federer showed his fighting qualities to force a decider, but once again it was his nemesis Nadal who proved the stronger despite spending nearly 10 hours on court in his final two matches at Melbourne Park.
