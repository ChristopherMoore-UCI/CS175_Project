New Jersey prosecutors argue that Ravi's crimes warranted more than a 30-day jail term and called Superior Judge Glenn Berman's sentence "insufficient under the sentencing laws of this state." Berman defended the jail sentence Wednesday, CNN affiliate WABC reported. Ravi's court appearance Wednesday formalized his decision to head to jail, waiving his right not to serve jail time twice for the same crime, as prosecutors appeal his sentence. He noted that under New Jersey law, the judge had the flexibility to sentence Ravi to anything from zero to 10 years in prison. Ravi was handed a 30-day jail sentence, three years of probation and must complete 300 hours of community service aimed at assisting victims of bias crimes. -- Dharun Ravi, the former Rutgers University student who was found guilty of using a webcam to spy on and intimidate his gay roommate, has reported to a New Jersey jail Thursday where he will serve a 30-day sentence, according to Middlesex County Sheriff Mildred Scott.
