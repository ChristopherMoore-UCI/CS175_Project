Schwartz's tales were popular enough to spawn a trilogy -- soon after "Scary Stories" appeared in 1981, Schwartz delivered "More Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark" as well as "Scary Stories 3." With Schwartz's spin on urban legends and Stephen Gammell's unnerving illustrations, "Scary Stories" was "one of the most controversial (books) throughout our entire childhood," August recalled on his podcast, Scriptnotes. CBS Films has been working on an adaptation of Schwartz's notoriously terrifying short story collection, which debuted in 1981 and went on to give generations of kids plenty of sleepless nights. We're aiming for a PG-13 -- the same way that I loved 'Poltergeist' and 'The Ring,' movies that aren't gory, but man they can freak the bejesus out of you." Deadline notes that August will be digging into the source material for his script, which as of yet doesn't have a director attached. Alvin Schwartz's "Scary Stories to Tell In the Dark" may have been just for kids, but the movie version won't be.
