-- Seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher could be set to make a shock return to Formula One as Ferrari look for a short-term replacement for the injured Felipe Massa. Massa's crash came less than a week after Formula Two driver Henry Surtees, the son of former world champion John Surtees, was killed in similar circumstances, knocked unconscious by a tire which flew off another car in a race at Brands Hatch in England, before crashing. Colajanni also provided further encouraging news regarding Massa, although he played down Bazso's assertion that he could walk out of hospital as early as next week. Ferrari spokesman Luca Colajanni later confirmed to the Press Association that Schumacher, who retired in 2006, was an option. Michael Schumacher remains very much part of the Ferrari set-up as an advisor for the Formula One team.
