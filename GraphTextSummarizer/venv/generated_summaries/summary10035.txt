TED.com: Ken Robinson says schools kill creativity To me, that journey to creative confidence looks like Doug Dietz. He designs life-saving, award-winning medical imaging equipment, MRI machines, and he's had a fantastic career at GE. I mean, Bandura's methodology didn't just cure people with a lifelong fear of snakes; it affected other parts of their lives. The hospital and GE were happy too, because less anesthesiologist time meant more patients could finish in one day. Creativity, the ability to see things differently and come up with new breakthroughs, isn't some God-given gift to be enjoyed by the lucky few.
