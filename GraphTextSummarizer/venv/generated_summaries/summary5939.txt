It's not the first time Miller's attention has been drawn away from ski racing. And, although he enters horse racing as something of a novice, Miller is confident that a modern approach could reap rich rewards. " The high-octane world of flat racing holds no such risks for Miller, only tantalizing rewards. "I'm one of the people who sees it really clearly because I'm in a different sport that uses all that stuff," Miller told CNN at last weekend's World Cup ski opener in Solden, Austria. "For me he's a great example of how to balance out expert horsemanship -- which he has -- with sports science and technology, which is what I have," Miller says of his new partner.
