Mike Hewitt, senior staff photographer at Getty Images, had a ringside seat as Maradona took charge for his first competitive World Cup finals match against Nigeria at Johannesburg's Ellis Park Stadium. " Maradona's last finals as a player in 1994 was also the scene of Hewitt's debut as a World Cup photographer. For now, another World Cup final at Rio's Maracana Stadium awaits Hewitt. "It's quite an iconic image from a World Cup final -- they don't come around very often," Hewitt says. " Hewitt experience extends across the sporting spectrum with a portfolio that includes six Olympic Games, four cricket World Cups, four rugby World Cups and two round the world yacht races to his name.
