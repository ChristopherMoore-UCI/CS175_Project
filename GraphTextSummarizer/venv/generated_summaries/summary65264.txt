Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has called for snap parliamentary elections for next month, following news that the country had slipped into a recession. Critics say Tokyo must find ways to generate solid growth before turning to fiscal matters. On a quarterly basis, Japan's GDP declined by 0.4% as business investment slipped. Abe also announced an 18-month delay in a controversial sales tax hike during a press conference Tuesday. Gross domestic product shrank by an annualized 1.6% in the three months ended September, Japan's Cabinet Office said Monday.
