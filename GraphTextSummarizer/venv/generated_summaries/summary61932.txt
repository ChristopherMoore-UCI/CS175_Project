Considering that the bald eagle is a national symbol of U.S., maybe it's fitting that the day's other viral imagery involved President Barack Obama. Although Time's choice of Obama over Pakistani schoolgirl activist Malala Yousafzai was controversial to some, Twitter was immediately captivated by the Spider-Man image. Despite broad and immediate skepticism of its authenticity, it had more than 5 million views by Wednesday evening. Obama posted the photo Wednesday morning on his Twitter account, and by the evening it had been retweeted more than 9,200 times. Time's website published a behind-the-scenes gallery of photos of Obama, snapped by White House photographer Pete Souza, to accompany the magazine naming Obama its Person of the Year.
