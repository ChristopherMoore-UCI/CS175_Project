The Clintons currently maintain their primary residence in New York and another home in Washington, D.C. Clinton's returning to one of these "home" states this weekend -- Arkansas -- for a 10th anniversary celebration of the Clinton Presidential Center in Little Rock. Here is how Clinton is linked to four states -- Illinois, Arkansas, New York and Pennsylvania -- and why it matters. Hillary Clinton moved to Fayetteville, Arkansas in 1974 to marry Bill Clinton, a native son of the state and rising political star. After living in Washington, D.C., for eight years as first lady, Clinton moved to Chappaqua, New York and represented the Empire State for eight years in the Senate. Clinton's supporters argue she was a Yankees fan as a child and photos from 1992 published in her 2003 memoir "Living History" show the first lady in a New York hat.
