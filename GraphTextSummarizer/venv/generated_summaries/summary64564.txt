Froome's abandonment is a major blow for race organizers of an event billed by many as a head-to-head between Froome and Spain's Alberto Contador. In good form and a former Tour winner, Wiggins would have been an obvious Plan B but that task may now rest on the shoulders of Australian Richie Porte, Froome's close friend and near neighbor in Monaco. Nightmare it was for Team Sky as Froome crashed three kilometers before even the first of nine cobbled sections on the stage, which makes up much of the Paris-Roubaix classic, better known as "the Hell of the North", his team announcing his official retirement via Twitter. Wednesday's stage was won by Belgian rider Lars Boom while race leader Vicenzo Nibali extended his lead by finish just 19 seconds back in third. Two sections of the cobblestones -- or pave -- were scrapped by race organizers because of the treacherous conditions, which Sky team boss Sir Dave Brailsford described as "the wisest decision."
