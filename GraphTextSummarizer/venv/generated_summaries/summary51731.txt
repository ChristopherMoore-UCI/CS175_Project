Naturally, global girls outgrow such local traditions as arranged marriages, dowry and bride price, which have not been exclusive to African tradition (see the English period drama, "Downton Abbey") but have certainly lingered longer in homes of African descent. You see, dear African moms, global girls need global boys. Granted, African moms are not alone in their hopes. Which brings me to my second plea to African moms. Sometimes, dear African moms, that process is just a little more complicated than marrying your cousin like in the 18th century.
