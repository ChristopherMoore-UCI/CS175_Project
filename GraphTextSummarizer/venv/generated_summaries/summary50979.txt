The researchers say in the study that as whole-genome sequencing improves and analyses are able to incorporate more people as well as ancient DNA, we may reach a "better understanding of ancient events where little or no historical record exists, to identify many additional events ... and to provide more precise event characterization than is currently possible. Did you know that your DNA contains genetic segments you've inherited from groups that intermingled in the past? Researchers set out to pinpoint which groups intermixed, and when, over thousands of years, using modern DNA. Their software, Globetrotter, was able to describe genetic mixing events dating back about 4,500 years. Researchers say there have been many such admixture events among people from populations that were separated by thousands of miles.
