And that he, single-handedly, can't stop climate change didn't stop him from driving his boat down the coast to attend the People's Climate March in New York on Sunday, which is being billed as the largest public demonstration for climate action to date. But instead of giving up, he's currently helping to pioneer new techniques for "ocean farming," growing, among other things, kelp seaweed for use in pasta, martinis and biofuel. He sees oysters and other ocean creatures as the canaries in the coal mine for climate change. Opinion: Why climate change is an 'everybody issue' now I was lucky enough to get to join him and his co-conspirator, Ron Gautreau, 52, on the 7Â½-hour journey from the Thimble Island Oyster Co., near Branford, Connecticut, to Pier 59 in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan. He told me he took the boat instead of a car because traffic on Interstate 95 headed into New York is "f---ing hell" and because it's a fun bit of "political theater," inspired in part by 1970s protests in which farmers drove their tractors across the country to Washington to demand better farm policy.
