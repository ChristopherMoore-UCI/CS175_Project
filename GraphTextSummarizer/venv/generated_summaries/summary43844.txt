Engine maker Pratt & Whitney said in a statement that it was working with Air Force investigators to inspect all engines in the fleet. Developed at a cost of nearly $400 billion so far and beset for years by cost overruns and delays, the so-called Joint Strike Fighter was put down temporarily this week following a runway fire at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida. But its production has been controversial for its soaring cost history -- the price tag has nearly doubled from early estimates, to $135 million per unit as of last year, according to a U.S. Government Accountability Office report in March -- as well as its schedule, software and other setbacks. It is producing variants of the plane for the U.S. Navy, Marines and Air Force. Richard Aboulafia, a Teal Group analyst, said every component of the F-35 overall "is pushing the frontiers of technology" as engineers combine extraordinary engine power with a lighter weight design.
