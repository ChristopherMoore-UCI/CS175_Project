CNN: "Boston Legal," what a finale: a wedding between Denny and fellow lawyer and best friend Alan. -- From Captain Kirk on "Star Trek" to Denny Crane on "Boston Legal," William Shatner has been a fixture on television for decades. William Shatner has a new talk show and has written an autobiography. We laughed our way through five years of great joy, great entertainment, and we got some wonderful awards during the years and the beauty of it all was that when we came in this season, we knew we were going to do 13 shows and be out. CNN: "Boston Legal" was a brilliant show: the writing, your famous wit.
