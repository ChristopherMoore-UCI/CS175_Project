Within the past day or so, some 8 inches of rain has fallen in Veracruz, according to CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller. -- What was Hurricane Karl weakened Friday to a tropical storm after making landfall, but the heavy rain it spawned could still cause mudslides and flash floods in the Mexican interior, forecasters said. Karl was downgraded after coming ashore as a Category 3 hurricane about 10 miles (15 kilometers) north of Veracruz, Mexico, CNN's satellite and radar estimates showed. " Texas could be spared any major problems because a storm surge occurs only near the landfall location, said CNN meteorologist Sean Morris. The homes of at least 3,000 families in central Mexico were damaged, the state-run Notimex news agency reported.
