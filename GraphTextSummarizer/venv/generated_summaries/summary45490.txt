The current chair, Rep. Steve Israel, D-New York, said he doesn't want another turn at the job, and at least three mentioned for the post are younger than those already in leadership -- Rep. Jim Himes, D-Connecticut, and Rep. Jared Polis, D-Colorado, and Rep. Donna Edwards, D-Maryland. Pelosi often points to one accomplishment in particular: House Democrats for the first time in 2012 became a caucus made up of more female and minority members than white men --a so called majority-minority caucus. But now that House Republicans have expanded their ranks to the largest GOP majority since the 1920's, Pelosi told her colleagues in her Wednesday letter that her party has to do a better job of boosting turnout. Pelosi publicly says she has a good relationship with House Speaker John Boehner, but there are few issues where the two are likely to come together to produce bipartisan legislation. Harry Reid, the Democratic leader in the Senate, and Nancy Pelosi, the top Democrat in the House, are both expected to keep their leadership positions next year despite the election's punishing losses.
