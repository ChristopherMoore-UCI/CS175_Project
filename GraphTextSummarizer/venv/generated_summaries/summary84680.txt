More guilty pleas in Massachusetts bullying case Across the United States, 19.9% of students in grades 9-12 say they were victims of bullying on school property over a one-year period, according to a 2009 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention survey of a representative sample of United States youth. France's education minister made national headlines this week when he announced plans to combat bullying by shutting down Facebook accounts of students who harass their classmates. In a statement, Facebook described bullying prevention as an "important issue," pledging to help promote online safety. One district attorney described the systematic bullying of Phoebe Prince, 15, who took her own life in January 2010 after weeks of ridicule and teasing at school. "We will also work with our partners to respond effectively in cases where French users have been prosecuted for offences related to online bullying," the statement said.
