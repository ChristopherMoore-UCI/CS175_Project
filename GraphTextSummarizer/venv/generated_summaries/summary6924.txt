South Africa is the custodian of one of the most progressive constitutions in the world, held up as a model state when it comes to protecting freedoms and rights. He simply could not contain his emotions when talking about the freedom that he and many other black people in South Africa had fought for. He took the court back to South Africa's fight for freedom and human rights. At issue is "The Spear," a piece of artwork depicting the president of South Africa as a Lenin figure with his genitals exposed, accused of offending the dignity of Jacob Zuma. One judge then asked how dignity could be restored by removing the picture from websites.
