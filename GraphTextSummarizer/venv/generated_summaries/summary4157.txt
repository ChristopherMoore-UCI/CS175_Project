"After an extensive investigation, the FBI-led Joint Terrorism Task Force (JTTF) of Northern Nevada has disrupted an individual's involvement in facilitation activities in support of a foreign terrorist organization, targeting an ally of the United States," said FBI Special Agent in Charge Laura A. Bucheit. He is also accused of providing advice on how to carry out acts of terrorism and traveling to Pakistan, India and other countries to meet with co-conspirators. He is accused of using a false identity and obtaining false documents in the United States so that he could travel to India without being apprehended by authorities there. Singh sent money from the United States to co-conspirators in India, the indictment read. Singh is accused of belonging to two terrorist organizations -- Babbar Khalsa International (BKI) and Khalistan Zindabad Force (KZF) -- whose members seek to create an independent Sikh state in the Punjab region of India, read the indictment.
