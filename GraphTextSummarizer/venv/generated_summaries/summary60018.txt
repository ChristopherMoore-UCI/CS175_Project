Instead, when eating a dish with cooked rice, use your fork only to push food onto your spoon. "The greater need is to identify with European culture, so food is [eaten] with a knife and a fork," Allen says. In fact, says Allen, don't even pass important documents with your left hand. But sticking them upright in a bowl of rice is even worse: During funerals in Japan, the rice bowl of the deceased is placed before their coffin...with their chopsticks upright in the rice. Manners here are a little more formal than many other South American countries.
