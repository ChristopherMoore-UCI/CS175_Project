The movie is Drew Barrymore's directorial debut (she also plays fellow Hurl Scout Smashley Simpson), and it's clear she's more attuned to grrrlishness than real athletic power: Smashley is the first to scream ''Food fight!'' (Entertainment Weekly) -- "Whip It!" suggests what might have happened if Juno had gone to a high school as poky as Napoleon Dynamite's and decided that although her mother wanted her to be a beauty queen like Little Miss Sunshine, she'd rather just strap on roller skates. There, she dubs herself Babe Ruthless, making up in speed what she lacks in muscled aggression. Ellen Page plays roller derby competitor Babe Ruthless in "Whip It!" Only here the petite, droll, feisty, Ellen Page-like heroine played by Ellen Page is named Bliss.
