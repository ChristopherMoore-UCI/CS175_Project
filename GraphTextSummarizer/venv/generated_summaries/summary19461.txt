In Santo Tomas, the festival is known as Takanakuy, everybody fights everybody, and it happens bright and early Christmas morning. The town of Santo Tomas is 12,000 feet above sea level, nestled cozily in the vertiginous Peruvian Andes. After a few days of preliminary drinking and dancing in costumes that combine the best aspects of traditional Andean horse-riding gear with the most nightmarish aspects of traditional acid trips, the residents of Santo Tomas wake up and head to the local bullfighting ring to beat each other silly. See the rest of Takanakuy at VICE.com I went to last year's Takanakuy in Santo Tomas and the nearby village of Llique, where I met a legal student from Lima who'd made the same tortuous trek as I had to watch the fighting. The geographical department of Chumbivilcas, for which Santo Tomas serves as the capital, is historically one of the poorest in Peru and cut off not only geographically from the power centers and financial interests of the Pacific coast, but most resources and government services thereof.
