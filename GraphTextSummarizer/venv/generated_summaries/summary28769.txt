The search for two people who remain missing will continue alongside salvage operations, said Franco Gabrielli, head of the Italian Civil Protection agency. Officials now hope to have the ship upright by late June or early July and to tow it to some port by September. "We are working round the clock to get the job done as fast as we can," said Nick Sloane, head of salvage operations. The Concordia's captain, Francesco Schettino, could face charges that include manslaughter and abandoning ship. One year ago Sunday, the luxury liner struck rocks and turned on its side off the Italian island of Giglio, killing 32 people.
