Former Presidents George H.W. Bush, left, and Jimmy Carter can smile now about their performance in polls. Sixty percent of Americans questioned in a CNN-Opinion Research Corp. survey released Wednesday morning say they approve of how George H.W. Bush handled his job as president, and 64 percent give a thumbs up to former President Carter. The poll was released hours before Bush and Carter, along with former President Clinton, sit down for lunch at the White House with President Bush and President-elect Barack Obama. None of those ratings compare with Obama's, who has seen approval ratings as high as 82 percent during the presidential transition, Holland said. "The elder Bush had a 34 percent approval rating just before the 1992 election, although the Americans felt better about him once they booted him from office and his rating rose to 56 percent by January 1993," Holland said.
