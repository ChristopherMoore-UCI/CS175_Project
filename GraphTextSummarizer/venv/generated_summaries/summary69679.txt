Prime suspect Bruce Jeffrey Pardo, who police said committed suicide hours after he went on a shooting rampage and started a raging house fire in the Los Angeles suburb of Covina, left a rental car with a gasoline canister outside the home of attorney Scott Nord, said Pat Buchanan of the Covina Police Department. On Saturday, Covina police released the names of the nine people unaccounted for since the shooting and fire. Bruce Jeffrey Pardo went on a shooting rampage in a Los Angeles suburb on Wednesday, police say. "The bodies were so badly burned they cannot be identified any other way," said Covina police Lt. Another rented car that Pardo used to flee the scene was found booby-trapped after the shooting, police said.
