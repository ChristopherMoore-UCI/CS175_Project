Nigeria has been rocked by violence in recent years, which the government has blamed on Islamist extremists. Militants in the oil-rich Niger Delta have also been a focal point in recent years. Jonathan is from the Niger Delta in the Christian-dominated south while Abubakar is from the majority Muslim north. Jonathan, then the vice president, inherited the presidency when President Umaru Yar'Adua, a northerner, died during his first term last year. He beat rival Atiku Abubakar, a former vice president supported by a group of influential northern leaders.
