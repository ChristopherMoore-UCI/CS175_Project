Anti-riot police patrolled the Bangladeshi capital of Dhaka and elsewhere in the country Tuesday as angry protesters took to the streets, damaging motor vehicles and burned used tires in a general strike, police and witnesses said. " The U.S. embassy in Dhaka in a media statement condemned the attack and said, "The ability to engage in peaceful protest is a fundamental democratic right; there is no justification for the resort to violence. "No diplomatic staff was inside the vehicle, which was going to the airport," Khilkhet police station chief Shamim Hossain told journalists. In many areas, pickets clashed with police, who used teargas shells to disperse angry mobs. Protesters from the country's largest Islamic party, Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami, clashed with police in Dhaka and other major cities, blocking roads and highways.
