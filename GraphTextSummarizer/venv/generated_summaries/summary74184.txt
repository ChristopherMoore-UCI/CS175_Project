White House press secretary Jay Carney defended the invitation Wednesday when asked whether it was appropriate to invite the leader, whom U.S. officials have accused of corruption. Obama and President Ali Bongo Ondimba will discuss regional issues and bilateral topics. The White House has announced that first lady Michelle Obama will travel to South Africa and Botswana this month. "Gabon is holding the rotating presidency of the U.N. Security Council; it's an important position," Carney said at a news briefing. Though human rights concerns remain an issue in the country, Ondimba has made several reforms, according to Carney.
