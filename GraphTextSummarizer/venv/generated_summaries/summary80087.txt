The materials released by the judge -- photographs from inside the gym at Lowndes County High School, surveillance video from outside and investigative documents -- are unlikely to prove what happened to the boy, Johnson family attorney Chevene King said. None of the imagery is believed to show what led to Kendrick's death, King said. But the materials could cast doubt on the official explanation and nudge officials toward reclassifying Kendrick's death to allow a new investigation into what happened, King said. CNN has obtained surveillance video, which was part of what the judge ordered released, showing Kendrick walking along a school hallway and into the gym where he was later found dead. -- Michael Moore, the U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Georgia, is expected to make an announcement Thursday in the case of Kendrick Johnson.
