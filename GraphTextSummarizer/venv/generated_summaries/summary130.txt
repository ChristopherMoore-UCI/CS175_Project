The trend towards bigger yachts is due in part to new technological advances in the yachting industry as well as the changing lifestyles of gigayacht owners, says Becket. But, says Beckett, this doesn't mean superyacht owners are going to scrimp on luxury. "There is no standard definition of what a gigayacht is," says Paul Ashton, editor of SuperYacht World. While that pricing means gigayachts are strictly for the super rich, you get a lot of bang for your bucks, Beckett explained: "There is nothing standard when it comes to this area of our market. That's the great thing about these yachts," said Jonathan Beckett, CEO of Burgess Yachts, one of the world's leading yacht brokers.
