Last week, as I traveled through Mingkaman, a small village in South Sudan's Lakes state, with the aid organization Oxfam, I met people whose lives have been turned upside down by conflict over the last year, but who still haven't lost their belief that things can get better. -- When most people think of South Sudan, if they think of it at all, they imagine poverty and war. What I saw on my three trips through South Sudan were people just like you and me. Since then, thousands of people have been killed, nearly 2 million people have been forced to flee their homes, and 6 million South Sudanese -- almost half the country -- have found themselves in desperate need of aid. A year ago Monday, conflict again erupted in South Sudan.
