After his indictment by a jury in the Eastern District of New York, federal prosecutors gave Medunjanin another speedy arraignment waiver, one that included an additional sentence, the letter said. "It is our understanding that law enforcement obtained statements from Mr. Medunjanin ... He added, "It is our expectation that the records and materials we seek by these proposed subpoenas will establish both the efforts taken by law enforcement to move Mr. Medunjanin and secret him from his attorneys and to obtain an unlawful purported waiver of his right to the assistance of his attorney," the letter said. As agents were explaining the form to Medunjanin and telling him that he had been indicted, "the defendant expressed concerns about being charged with conspiracy to kill United States nationals abroad," the letter said. In a letter to Judge Raymond J. Dearie, filed Friday, federal prosecutors said Medunjanin spoke to authorities three times about the "terrorist-related activities of himself and others in the United States and Pakistan" after he waived his right to a lawyer.
