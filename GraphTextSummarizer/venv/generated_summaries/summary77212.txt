During the board meeting, FAMU Trustee Rufus Montgomery proposed administrative leave for Ammons because he said the university "did not act" following the death of Robert Champion, who died last month after a halftime performance in a football game in Orlando, Florida. By an 8-4 vote, the board chose to reprimand President James Ammons instead of putting him on administrative leave as administrators have done to the band's director, Julian White. The school also reversed an earlier decision to dismiss four students "who received disciplinary action regarding a hazing incident with Mr. Champion," Ammons said. I believe that had we shown action -- prudent actions -- there would not have been a cause for them to have an investigation because we would have been conducting ourselves in a sound manner.
