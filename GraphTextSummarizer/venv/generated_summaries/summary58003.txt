Neighbors say suspect in Patz killing lived a quiet life with his family Hernandez, who was 19 in 1979, told police he lured Etan to a store with the promise of a soda, choked him and placed his body in the trash about a block and a half away, Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said. -- Pedro Hernandez was arraigned early Friday evening on a second-degree murder charge tied to the case of Etan Patz, the New York boy whose disappearance 33 years to the day spurred nationwide attention about missing children. In the years after Etan's disappearance, Hernandez told a family member and others that he had "done a bad thing" and killed a child in New York, police said. Other employees of the store were interviewed after Etan disappeared, but not Hernandez, police said. " But Lisa Cohen, whose 2009 book, "After Etan," is widely considered the definitive account of the case, said she's not convinced that Hernandez killed the boy.
