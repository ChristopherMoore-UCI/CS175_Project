Stated another way, domestic abuse occurs at rates higher than the combined number of automobile accidents, stranger rapes, and muggings that women experience. The other major factor is the intergenerational effect of domestic violence, with research showing that witnessing abuse between one's parents is the strongest risk factor for transmitting abusive behavior across generations. To prevent domestic violence, we must grapple with the causes of violence and the societal forces that condone and perpetuate abuse. In our country, one-in-three high school girls and women experience intimate partner violence,according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Laws against domestic violence are recent and it wasn't until the mid-1990s that each state had protection order laws.
