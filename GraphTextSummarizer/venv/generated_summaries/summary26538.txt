That is the question for 12 jurors and six alternates in the Massachusetts murder trial of former New England Patriots player Aaron Hernandez when the region's beloved Patriots play in Super Bowl XLIX on Sunday. Shaneah Jenkins testified that she introduced Lloyd to Hernandez on her birthday in August 2012. Jenkins told the jury that Lloyd and Hernandez were in the "beginning stages of a friendship." Though the motive for the killing is unclear, Bomberg said Lloyd and Hernandez were at a nightclub days before and the defendant appeared annoyed. Hernandez, 25, pleaded not guilty in the 2013 killing of Lloyd, 27, who dated the sister of Hernandez's fianc√©e.
