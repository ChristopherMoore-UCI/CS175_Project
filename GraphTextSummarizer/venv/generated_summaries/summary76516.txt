The militant group ISIS represents a "very significant potential threat to homeland security," and officials have a "good sense" of the individuals from the United States who are trying to travel to Syria and fight with the terrorist group, the secretary of Homeland Security said Monday on CNN. "They are a dangerous organization that has acquired territory in Iraq and Syria from which they could launch attacks, train, command and control," Jeh Johnson said on "The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer. Johnson said Monday that ISIS "represents a very, very dangerous organization and a very significant potential threat to homeland security." At least 100 Americans have either left or attempted to leave to go to Syria and help ISIS, Johnson said. His comments come as the group has released a new online video in which its leader specifically calls for lone wolf attacks in the United States and France -- two countries that have been conducting airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq.
