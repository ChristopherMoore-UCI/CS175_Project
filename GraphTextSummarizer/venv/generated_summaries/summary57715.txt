Well, we've moved past the days of such outmoded projectors (unless it's a bad-ass D-ILA and you're screening "Planet Earth" while trying to seduce that cinephile chick you picked up at the indie film fest last week), and we really should move past the practice of photographic torture. We're assuming that since you're putting your photos online, you want people to look at them, and no one wants to look at 15 identical pictures -- sans captions -- of your aunt standing in front of the Chinese Theatre with her arm around the dude dressed as Jack Sparrow. -- After months and months of your cubicle walls contracting in on you like some kind of demonic fun house, it's finally time for that most coveted of reprieves: a vacation! Although some of you may be hesitant about location-sharing, if you're smart about it (i.e. only letting friends follow you on Foursquare, having a closed Twitter account and Facebook profile, etc.), Foursquare and the like can be great for sharing your experiences with your friends. Share snaps wisely Remember the good old days when, after a vacation, Dad would get out the projector and invite the neighbors over for a Jell-O mold, cocktails and an endless parade of awkward photos of you and your sister blinking into the sun in front of the Grand Canyon?
