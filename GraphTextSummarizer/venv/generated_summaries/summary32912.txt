He is the manager of United Airlines technical operations and has spent more than 25 years working his way up with Continental and United. CNN went behind the scenes with maintenance crews at United Airlines at its base in Houston to find out how they work to keep planes flying safe and on time. "We do just a walk around inspection, then we go upstairs and check the gauges and the log books and if there is anything broken we will fix it at that point," United Airlines technician Michael Baumgarten told CNN as he inspected a 737 just arrived from Guatemala. There are about 8,000 United mechanics worldwide, as well as 2,000 other members of its Tech Ops division, including engineers, maintenance planners and inspectors. If repair work requires a long time, planes are moved to the hangar area.
