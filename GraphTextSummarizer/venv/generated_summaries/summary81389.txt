Said Boumedouha, deputy director of Amnesty International's Middle East and North Africa program, said last week that Saudi authorities should "publicly announce an end to his flogging and release him immediately and unconditionally," rather than assess his fitness to be flogged week by week. The case of Badawi, who was sentenced last year to 10 years in prison and 1,000 lashes after a Jeddah court convicted him of insulting Islam, has garnered international headlines and global outrage. He wasn't flogged as scheduled in subsequent weeks, including this Friday, his sister, Samar Badawi, said. There is no way of knowing whether the Saudi Arabian authorities will disregard the medical advice and allow the flogging to go ahead," Boumedouha said last week. Badawi started a blog called "Free Saudi Liberals" in 2008 to encourage discussion about Islam, particularly the intrusion of the nation's religious police in Saudis' personal lives.
