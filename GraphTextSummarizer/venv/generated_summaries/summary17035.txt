Great work skills, by the way, are something at which women excel, but they are too often tempted to hide behind their great work, rather than step out and be counted when situations turn messy and difficult and leadership is needed. There are now many more talented women to choose from, and yet we women still hold relatively few positions of influence. The decision makers know how to size up other men on such characteristics but they don't know the inner strengths of women well enough to judge, so they choose the known, the familiar - in other words, another man - to fill the top spots. Women, of course, do have such potent leadership qualities but they're not sure how to communicate their unique way of being tough and resilient. Even though I was a pioneering woman among a world of men, I think it's harder for women today than it was for me to enter these circles of authority and influence.
