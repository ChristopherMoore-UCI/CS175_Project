Watch Makoni help young girls find safety and empowerment in Zimbabwe Â» Makoni says nothing will end her fight for the rights of women and girls. Like many young girls in Zimbabwe, Hope was the victim of a widely held belief that if a man with HIV or AIDS rapes a virgin he will be cured of his disease. "I [said] to girls, 'Let's have our own space where we talk and find solutions,' " Makoni said. Makoni said she was not surprised: "Every woman and girl identified with the issues that we were raising," she said.
