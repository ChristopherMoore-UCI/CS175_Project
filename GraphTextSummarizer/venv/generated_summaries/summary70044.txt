"Molly would never have abandoned her job or her post of her own accord," said her sister, Heather Bish. Her mother, Magi Bish, saw a man in a white car as she dropped Molly off on the morning of June 27, 2000. John and Magi Bish slowly began to realize that Molly must have been abducted. "This is one of the first real leads we've had in a long time that makes sense and I am very hopeful it's the break we've been looking for," said Tom Shamshak, a private investigator hired by the Bish family. Molly Bish was 16 and working as a lifeguard when she disappeared.
