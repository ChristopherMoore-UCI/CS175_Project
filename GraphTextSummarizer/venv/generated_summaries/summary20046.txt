But there is irony that the trust-buster actually helped grow the economic pie of baseball, making more players and owners wealthy. Marvin Miller died Tuesday at the age of 95.Â  And here's why you should know his name: Miller transformed the game of baseball even though he never put on a uniform. And that was the innovation that Miller brought to the game, against the bitter opposition of team owners. Yes, players are now paid sometimes absurd salaries, but fans come to see players, not owners, and they deserve their share of the profits as a result. Yes, fans are too often denied their game by selfish strikes perpetrated by players and owners alike.
