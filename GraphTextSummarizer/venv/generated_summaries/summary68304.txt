Developed by the company Traveler's Tales, the latest in the LEGO series, "LEGO The Lord of the Rings," puts Frodo, Gandalf, Aragorn and the rest of the characters from "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy into block toy form as they trace storylines from the popular books and movies. Ricks said the company doesn't shy away from characters getting killed, but they do it LEGO style. The appeal of these two popular franchises combined in a video game is expected to hit a wide audience from older fans who read the J.R.R. Tolkien series in the 1960s and 70s as teens to the younger generation who can quote lines from the movie from memory and who are the target audience for the LEGO toys. Nicholas Ricks, executive producer for Traveler's Tales, said that true-to-movie setup created some challenges. -- Most console video games these days imitate box-office blockbusters with life-like, amazing special effects, dramatic dialog and powerful storytelling.
