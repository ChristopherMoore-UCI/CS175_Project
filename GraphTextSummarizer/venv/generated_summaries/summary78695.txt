Pixadores live in poor suburbs but their preferred target is seedy, downtown Sao Paulo, where visibility is guaranteed. On Thursday nights, hundreds of pixadores converge on a street in the center to brag about their latest feats and plan their next targets as they drink beer and smoke cigarettes and marijuana. "Where I come from, the only way to get famous is being a professional football player or drug dealer," says Cripta Djan, one of the city's more outspoken pixadores and gang leaders. "We were better off under the dictatorship when at least a minimum of order was maintained." "We should have harsher laws and better education," another woman says. They are mostly young men, but a few women are also active pixadores.
