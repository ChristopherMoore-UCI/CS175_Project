Companions put Darby at the wheel of the white Chevrolet that hit Butts from behind on a highway in Panola County, about 150 miles north of Jackson. Two teens who were in the car the morning Butts was killed said they and Darby -- all white -- had been drinking vodka and smoking marijuana all night. " Butts' family met with Darby in jail for three hours last week, their lawyer, Wilbur Colom, said Thursday. Matthew Darby, 18, pleaded guilty earlier this week to manslaughter in the July 2012 death of 61-year-old Johnny Lee Butts. Darby also pleaded guilty to a separate burglary count in a deal with prosecutors that a judge approved on Monday.
