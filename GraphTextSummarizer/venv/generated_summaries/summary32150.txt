" Mitt Romney exit widens path for Jeb Bush Ever since Romney trial-ballooned his campaign at the office of Republican bundler Woody Johnson earlier this month, his donor network had grown lukewarm to the idea, his former staffers had started accepting offers with other potential candidates, and the media consensus about "Romney 3.0" had teetered somewhere between skepticism and ridicule. Longtime Romney adviser Ron Kaufman said that Romney believes "the best role for him is to help formulate the message and help the winner of the primary process deliver that message." "I think he came to the conclusion that while yes, he can win the primary, yes, he can raise the dough, perhaps he can beat Mrs. Clinton, there's an easier path to winning the presidency if Mitt doesn't get involved but stays above it as the most popular Republican in the country," Kaufman said. " Romney's decision to forgo a run, made over the weekend in consultation with his family, came on the heels of what associates described as "frank" and "clinical" strategy session with his closest advisers in Boston last Friday at the offices of Solamere Capital, the financial firm run by Tagg Romney and Spencer Zwick, Romney's top fundraiser. "He decided he could be the nominee," said Tagg Romney, the oldest of Romney's five sons. His hire of David Kochel, formerly Romney's top strategist in Iowa, blindsided Romney this week.
