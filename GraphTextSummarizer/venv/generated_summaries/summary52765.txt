Defense rests in Boston Marathon bombing trial The Tsarnaev family first immigrated to the Boston area back in 2002. Though not elaborating on her beliefs, Ailina Tsarnaeva has said she believes, as her mother does, that her surviving brother Dzhokhar and her dead brother Tamerlan are innocent. Tsarnaeva is the sister of Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev. FBI agents interviewed Zubeidat Tsarnaev as part of the investigation into her son, whose case was closed after several months. Police shot and killed Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, during the manhunt and later captured Dzhokhar, who is now on trial.
