On March 16, the Turkish military said hundreds of Turkish troops made an incursion several kilometers into Iraqi territory in "hot pursuit" of PKK militants. Over the last week, Turkish warplanes have carried out several air raids against suspected rebel targets in northern Iraq. -- Despite an epic rift in Turkish-Israeli relations, Turkey's top general announced his troops are relying on new unmanned aerial drones recently purchased from Israel to battle Kurdish rebels. The fact that Turkey still depends on Israel for high-tech defense technology could complicate the Turkish government's threats to punish Israel for a botched Israeli commando raid in which eight Turks and a dual-national Turkish-American were shot dead aboard a Turkish ship carrying aid to Gaza. Turkey has been reluctant to freeze defense industry ties with Israel," said Lale Kemal, a journalist who writes a column on military affairs for the Turkish newspaper Zaman.
