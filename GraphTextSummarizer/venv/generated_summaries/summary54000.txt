Instead, according to the source, Zerilli -- convicted years ago of crimes in connection with organized crime in Detroit -- told the FBI that Detroit mobsters wanted Hoffa dead. -- The search in a field near Detroit for ex-Teamsters boss Jimmy Hoffa ended Wednesday, and as with so many past attempts to find him, authorities walked away empty-handed The mobster allegedly told Zerilli that Detroit's crime bosses ordered the Hoffa hit. Keith Corbett, a former U.S. attorney, told CNN earlier this year that Zerilli headed a Detroit organized crime family from 1970 to 1975, but was in prison when Hoffa vanished. Anthony said he's skeptical of Zerilli's claim that Hoffa was killed with a shovel because it wasn't the way of organized crime members in those days, who Anthony said would have preferred to shoot him in the head at close range.
