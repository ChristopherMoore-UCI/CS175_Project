They're suggesting something that would take us back to the days when women had to pay out-of-pocket for their prescriptions, making birth control harder to get for many women, not least women who use birth control methods that simply cannot be stocked on store shelves, like IUDs, one of the most effective (and expensive) forms of long-acting birth control. When health insurance doesn't cover birth control and women have to pay out of pocket at the drugstore, it won't expand access to birth control but shrink it. For women, birth control isn't a controversial topic or a political bargaining chip; it's basic health care, and it's only a "social issue" if you've never had to pay for it. In the decades since birth control became widely available, child mortality declined and health outcomes improved for women, infants and children. Offering over-the-counter birth control instead of insurance coverage for birth control amounts to a $483 million tax on women.
