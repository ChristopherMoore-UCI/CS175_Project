El Nuevo Georgia Editor Rafael Navarro said the picture was meant to call attention to Hispanic issues -- and grab the attention of residents and politicians who often ignore the Hispanic community. The photo illustration, published in the paper's January 6 edition, shows Republican Gov. Nathan Deal wearing a Nazi uniform, a swastika armband and a Hitler-like mustache. He won the Republican primary, edging out a former secretary of state who was endorsed by former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin. The full-page article also quotes local community leaders forecasting tough times ahead for illegal immigrants in the state. One leader quoted is Democratic state Rep. Pedro Marin -- one of only two Hispanic legislators in Georgia.
