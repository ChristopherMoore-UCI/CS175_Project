Attorney Harry Marsh and his fiancÃ© Kaitlin Rush say the insects appeared soon after takeoff, and when Marsh pointed them out to flight attendants, they did nothing to help. A North Carolina couple is suing AirTran Airways, alleging that cockroaches crawled out of air vents and overhead carry-on bins during a flight from Charlotte to Houston in September. Bottom line, I foresee a lot of free flights for this couple if they want to get back on AirTran," Hostin said. The couple accuses AirTran of negligence and recklessness, infliction of emotional distress, nuisance, false imprisonment and unfair and deceptive trade practices, and is suing for more than $100,000 plus the price of their tickets. In a response to the complaint filed with the U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina, AirTran denies most of the allegations.
