Maria Sharapova won the battle of French Open champions as she claimed the Stuttgart title Sunday with a straight sets win over China's Li Na. It has proved an excellent work out for Sharapova as she builds up to the French Open defense, with hard fought wins over Lucie Safarova, Ana Ivanovic and Angelique Kerber on the way to the title match. Sharapova will be defending her title at the clay court grand slam in Paris next month, while Li took the French crown in 2011. Sharapova, who won in Stuttgart in 2012, reserved her best tennis of the week for the final as she brushed aside Li in just over 90 minutes on the indoor clay court surface. "It definitely helped last year on the way to the French Open, it's good to bring back the same confidence on clay as last year," Sharapova added.
