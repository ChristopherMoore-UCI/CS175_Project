Anti-government forces also claimed two major successes Saturday: preventing pro-government forces from taking the city of Zawiya, near the capital of Tripoli, and capturing the strategic eastern oil town of Ras Lanuf. Saturday, rebels also captured the strategic oil port of Ras Lanuf, a day after pro-Gadhafi forces fought with opposition members there, fighters and commanders said. Forces loyal to leader Moammar Gadhafi withdrew from the city's Martyrs' Square and returned to their positions on the outskirts after intense clashes with rebels, according to a witness who is serving as a rebel spokesman. The witness said pro-Gadhafi forces entered a residential area in the city and shot live ammunition and automatic weapons at residents in the streets. On Saturday, Libyan opposition leaders announced an alternative government as the United States and other countries helped evacuate refugees of the conflict.
