Barcelona failed to retain their Champions League title in 2010 after they were beaten in the semifinal by Italian champions Inter Milan, who were then coached by Jose Mourinho. In his first year in charge he led his team, including Argentina striker Lionel Messi and Spanish pair Xavi and Andres Iniesta, to the Spanish league and cup double, as well as a European Champions League triumph. -- Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola has signed a one-year contract extension with the Spanish champions. Barcelona provided seven of the starting 11 players that secured Spain's first ever World Cup win as they beat Netherlands 1-0 in South Africa. Mourinho has now taken over as coach of Barcelona's rivals Real Madrid and will be aiming to take Guardiola's title next season.
