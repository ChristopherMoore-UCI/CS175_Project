"You can reverse skin damage with three basic tenets," says New York City dermatologist Neil Sadick, M.D. "Turn over skin cells, stimulate collagen, and add volume." As for retinoids, research shows that they're the ultimate multitaskers, preventing the buildup of dead skin cells, diminishing wrinkles, and lightening sun spots. Any moisturizer (especially if it has hyaluronic acid, which draws moisture from the air) will plump up the area temporarily, but one that also has antioxidants like vitamins A, C, and E can help reverse the signs of sun damage and prevent further damage. We know what you're thinking: Sure -- if you're willing to empty out your savings in the name of skin care, anything's possible. Using a broad-spectrum sunscreen with SPF 30 or higher every day -- no matter the weather or season -- isn't just about preventing sun damage.
