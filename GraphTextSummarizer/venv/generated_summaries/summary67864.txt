Perez wouldn't give away any plot details but suggested that the movie -- researched through "a cursory reading of the Steve Jobs Wikipedia page" -- will be ridiculous enough that it won't run the risk of offending fans of Jobs', who died in October 2011. In a publicity photo, Long mimics the pose Jobs struck on the cover of Walter Isaacson's 2011 biography, "Steve Jobs," looking something like a cross between Jobs and a brainy homeless man. The next Steve Jobs biopic you see will star the "I'm a Mac" guy and come from the twisted minds of Funny or Die. "We took quite a bit of dramatic license with Steve Jobs' life, but not as much as the makers of 'Argo' took with their story," he said. Starring as Jobs will be Justin Long, whom most people know from Apple's "I'm a Mac-I'm a PC" ads but who also appeared in TV's "Ed" and "New Girl" and films like "Live Free or Die Hard," "Drag Me to Hell" and "Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story."
