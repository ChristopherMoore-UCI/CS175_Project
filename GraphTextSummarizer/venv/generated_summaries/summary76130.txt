The decision means Tunisia have finished above Cape Verde in African qualifying Group B and will take its place in the forthcoming playoff matches to decide which five teams from the continent will qualify for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. "The match has been declared to be forfeited and awarded 3-0 in favor of Tunisia, meaning that the Cape Verde Islands will not progress to round three of the FIFA World Cup African zone qualifiers having dropped to second place in Group B with nine points while Tunisia finish first with 14 points and will now advance." -- Cape Verde has seen its hopes of qualifying for a first football World Cup dashed after the sport's global governing body FIFA punished the African country for fielding a suspended player. Varela played in a match against Tunisia in September which Cape Verde won 2-0. The decision is a major blow for Cape Verde, which has only ever played in one major international tournament.
