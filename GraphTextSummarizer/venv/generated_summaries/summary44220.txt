Suu Kyi was released from house arrest on November 13, after spending most of the past 20 years under house arrest or in prison. The younger son of political activist Aung San Suu Kyi left Myanmar Tuesday after a long-awaited visit with his mother, from whom he'd been separated for a decade. Suu Kyi release came after national elections in Myanmar. Suu Kyi and her National League for Democracy party boycotted the November 7 elections, faulting the country's ruling military junta. Before the election, the regime had enacted a new law that forced the Suu Kyi's party to choose between honoring her as its leader and risking the party being declared illegal, or ejecting Suu Kyi from the party and contesting the elections.
