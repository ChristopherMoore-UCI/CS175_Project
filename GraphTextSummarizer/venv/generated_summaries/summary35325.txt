The ceasefire aims to end 10 months of violence in eastern Ukraine. Ukraine's Defense Ministry concurred that combat activity by "illegal armed groups" fell after the ceasefire went into effect, but said the situation in Donetsk and Luhansk regions remain "extremely difficult." In a statement, defense spokesman Andriy Lysenko said that since the beginning of the ceasefire, "enemy forces" initiated fire from artillery, grenade launchers, mortars and small arms against Ukrainian military positions in the area near the towns of Debaltseve and Shyrokine. However, Svyatoslav Tsegolko, a spokesman for the Ukrainian president, said that those responsible for shooting down Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over Ukraine last summer will not be given amnesty under the Minsk agreement. But less than 90 minutes after it started, Ukrainian officials reported  mortar shelling at a military post near Zolote in the Luhansk region.
