Impact Your World: A life celebrated through service When I was growing up, my parents and grandparents taught me that engaging in service, helping our neighbors and building strong communities are all part of being a good citizen and a good person. They both had hard lives growing up during the Depression and World War II, but despite the obstacles they faced, they found time to volunteer at their churches and community centers and later, their kids' schools. That's part of what makes service special. Nineteen years ago, my father proudly signed the bill making Martin Luther King Day a time dedicated to serving others. President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, members of Congress and their families will be rolling up their sleeves at service projects in our nation's capital.
