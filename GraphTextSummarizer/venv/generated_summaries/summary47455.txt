The documents include hundreds of police reports taken from witnesses who describe seeing lights or strange objects in the sky, from southern England and Wales up to Northern Ireland. Other reports came from stunned members of the public, pilots, and members of the military. In 1979, two years after Steven Spielberg's alien-visitation movie "Close Encounters of the Third Kind," reports of strange sightings had increased and the House of Lords decided to hold a debate on UFOs. "The vast majority of them are just ordinary people who've seen something unusual and thought that they ought to tell someone about it," said David Clarke, a professor at Sheffield Hallam University and a UFO expert who worked with the National Archives on the project. "The Ministry of Defense has no other interest or role regarding UFO matters and does not consider questions regarding the existence or otherwise of extraterrestrial life-forms," it said Wednesday.
