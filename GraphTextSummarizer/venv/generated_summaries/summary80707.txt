The developer sent apologetic champagne, and the homeowners association sent repeated encouragements to "keep an eye out for anything unusual!" Heavily marketed as havens of prestige and a sure footing on the social ladder, gated communities in Florida also create an insidious fortress mentality. And within such communities, a neighborhood watch member such as George Zimmerman can get carried away. The forting-up phenomenon that began in the 1960s shows no sign of slowing, ranking Florida as second only to California in the number of walls, street patterns and barricades that separate people from each other. This is the paradox of Florida's famed gated lifestyle, into which Trayvon Martin walked, was shot and tragically died. "For residents who aren't expecting people to be passing through, to be in their space, attitudes can be taken to the extreme," Eliza Harris, Orlando's representative at the Congress for the New Urbanism, told me.
