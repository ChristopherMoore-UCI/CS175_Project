There is still some way to go before satellites can take the place of farmers and be used to totally manage crops, water supplies and tell the difference between organic and non-organic crops. From Californian vineyards and Chinese rice fields to Colombian coffee plantations and Kenyan crops, satellites imagery is being used to monitor land and water use and promote environmental protection. People can genuinely use satellite imagery to fertilize correctly, or manage water stress." "In a few years, we'll have nine billion people living on this earth and in a lot of regions water is already scarce, but in about 50% of these people will live in water stress positions. Satellites have been used to prove that crops were fertilizer-free in a year-long project by Ecocert, one of Europe's leading organic certification agencies, and the European Space Agency.
