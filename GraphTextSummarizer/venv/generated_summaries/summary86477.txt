-- "I know I didn't chow down on a spoon!" declared John Manley, who recently discovered that an eating utensil was the source of his two years of ill health, coughing, vomiting and pain. The Wilmington, North Carolina, resident had surgery last week to remove part of a plastic spoon from his lung. "It must have been in the food or drink," Manley told CNN affiliate WECT. "He explained that there was an object down there, and it had writing on it," Manley said. His doctor found the spoon after looking into his lungs with an endoscope, a medical instrument with a long, thin tube containing a light and a video camera.
