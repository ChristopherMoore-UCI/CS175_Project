The latest moves by the Chinese government on tobacco are "hopeful," said Dr. Judith Mackay, the senior adviser at the World Lung Foundation, who examines tobacco issues in China. -- China, the world's largest tobacco consumer, is aiming to ban indoor smoking in public areas by the end of the year. The WHO warns that if tobacco use is not decreased in China, these deaths will increase to 3 million by 2050. " Tobacco use in China has far-reaching consequences, she said. Although the nation's health ministry issued guidelines in 2011 to ban smoking in places like hotels and restaurants, they haven't been "strictly enforced," according to Xinhua, China's state-run news agency.
