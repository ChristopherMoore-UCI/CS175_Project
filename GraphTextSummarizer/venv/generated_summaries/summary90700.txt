-- High temperatures forced Amtrak to keep the brake on rail speed in the Northeast on Friday, while a cold front bearing thunderstorms hinted at some relief from the Great Lakes to northern New England. In New York, utility company Con Edison urged customers to conserve energy as electric use hit an all-time high in its service area, a peak of 13,214 megawatts at 2 p.m. Friday. The National Weather Service said there was a slight risk of severe thunderstorms, damaging winds and hail from northern Illinois and southeastern Wisconsin east to Maine. Amtrak said the speed restrictions were necessary along rail lines between Philadelphia and Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, because of extreme heat that can distort tracks. Temperatures above 90 degrees will combine with roughly 100% humidity to put heat indexes, which measure how hot it feels, near 100.
