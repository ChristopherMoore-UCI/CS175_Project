Officials said they were not returned to China because of credible fears they could be mistreated if returned. "The district court's ruling, if allowed to stand, could be used as precedent for other detainees held at Guantanamo Bay, including sworn enemies of the United States suspected of planning the attacks of 9/11 who may also seek release into our country," she said. The detainees are ethnic Uighurs, from a mostly Muslim autonomous region in western China. U.S. District Judge Ricardo Urbina on Tuesday ordered the 17 detainees to appear in his Washington courtroom at 10 a.m. Friday and said he would hold a hearing next week to determine under what conditions they will be settled in the United States. Urbina scheduled an October 16 hearing for immigration officials and other government agencies to discuss conditions for the 17 men.
