-- The pilot of the Asiana Airlines plane that crashed in San Francisco on Saturday was making his first landing with a Boeing 777 at San Francisco International Airport, the airline said. The cockpit voice recorder of Asiana Airlines Flight 214 appears to show the pilots tried to abort the landing less than two seconds before the plane crashed on the runway at San Francisco International Airport, the head of the National Transportation Safety Board said Sunday. At San Francisco General, 17 survivors remained hospitalized, six of them in critical condition. "We were expecting a lot of burns," said  Dr. Margaret Knudson, San Francisco General Hospital's chief of surgery. But it wasn't his first time flying to San Francisco.
