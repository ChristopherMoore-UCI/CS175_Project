Obama and Lee also said they will continue to cooperate on efforts with respect to North Korea. " Lee is a reliable ally for Obama, especially when it comes to U.S. policy on North Korea. South Korea has seen the North launch artillery fire at Yeonpyeong island and sink one of its warships, at which time the United States stepped up joint military exercises with the South. Obama praised the Senate's confirmation Thursday of Sung Y. Kim as the first Korean-American ambassador to South Korea. Today, I'm proud to say the alliance between the United States and the Republic of Korea is stronger than it's ever been." Lee said he had paid respects at the Korean War Memorial shortly before the ceremony, remembering the 37,000 U.S. service members killed during the Korean War.
