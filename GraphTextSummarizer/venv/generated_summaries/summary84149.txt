Musk says he believes the United States is at the beginning of a profound, fundamental renaissance in space exploration, perhaps greater than when President Kennedy declared the United States was going to the moon during the infancy of the space program. The successful launch is the latest step toward commercial space ventures that could eventually ferry astronauts and cargo to the international space station. If all goes as planned after a series of test flights, Musk says SpaceX will be ready to begin flying cargo to the space station next year. This push toward the privatization of space is part of President Obama's blueprint to allow NASA to do bigger and better things with its budget, such as a mission to Mars. The United States will be renting space from the Russians aboard their Soyuz spacecraft.
