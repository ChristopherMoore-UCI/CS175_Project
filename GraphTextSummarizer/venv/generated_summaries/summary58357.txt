The Argentine Grand Prix was held from 1953 to 1998 at Buenos Aires' Autodromo Juan y Oscar Galvez circuit. The first phase of construction, expected to last 14 months, will include a 3.1-kilometer track, pit lane, garages and an off-road track. " Ground was broken on the Velociudad Speedcity site, situated 80 kilometers from Buenos Aires, on Friday. Argentina's bid to host a Formula One race for the first time in more than a decade is under way after work started on a new circuit outside the capital Buenos Aires. "We are really proud to contribute with our design to create a new destination for F1, which always means an economic catalyst for the area and produces global exposure," said the company's associate principal John Rhodes.
