The second cut in U.S. interest rates in as many weeks is putting further pressure on the members of the Gulf Cooperation Council to reconsider their currencies' peg with the dollar; and none more so than Qatar. John Defterios started by asking Sheikh Hamad whether the sharp decline in U.S. interest rates was putting too much pressure on Qatar's dollar-peg. (HA):  Oil and gas are saleable in dollars, but most of our imports are not in dollars but in Euros or Asian currencies. Eight days later, the Fed moved again, this time with a cut of half a percentage point to take U.S. interest rates to three percent. But for countries like the GCC and Qatar, especially Qatar, it puts us under pressure on how to deal with inflation and our currency, which is undervalued already by at least 35 percent.
