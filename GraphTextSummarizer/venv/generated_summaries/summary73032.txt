Aziz, who has been hospitalized a number of times while in custody, has been in poor health, and his lawyers and family members have voiced their concerns about his handover to the Iraqi government and how we would be treated while in their custody. According to Boshu, being former regime members will not affect the way Aziz will be treated by Iraqi authorities. -- Tariq Aziz, formerly Saddam Hussein's top diplomat, who has been in U.S. custody in Iraq, has been transferred to the custody of the Iraqi government, an Iraqi official said Wednesday. Aziz was one of the best-known faces of Hussein's government, serving as deputy prime minister from 1981 to 2003 and as foreign minister for part of that time. Aziz was handed over on Monday from Camp Cropper and is being held at Kadhimiya prison in Baghdad, Boshu Ibrahim, deputy Justice minister, told CNN.
