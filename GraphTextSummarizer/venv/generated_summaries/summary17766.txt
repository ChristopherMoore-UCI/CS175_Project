About a week later, Allen filed for custody of his three children with Farrow --  Moses and Dylan, who were adopted, and Satchel, their biological son, who now goes by Ronan Farrow. In 1992, in the wake of an affair between Allen and Soon-Yi Previn -- Mia Farrow's adopted daughter with composer Andre Previn -- Farrow accused the filmmaker of molesting Dylan. Film director Woody Allen released a statement Sunday denying adopted daughter Dylan Farrow's allegation that he sexually assaulted her when she was 7 years old. The statement released by Allen representative Leslee Dart said: "Mr. Allen has read the article and found it untrue and disgraceful. The experts concluded there was no credible evidence of molestation; that Dylan Farrow had an inability to distinguish between fantasy and reality; and that Dylan Farrow had likely been coached by her mother Mia Farrow.
