-- European trade unionists descended on Brussels, Belgium, Wednesday in the tens of thousands, determined to both vent their anger at austerity measures and to tell European governments to "put people first." Demonstrators wanted to tell European governments and banks to put the needs of people ahead of balanced budgets, according to the ETUC website. Marchers were on the streets to express their concern about both the economic and social situation, and to assert their belief that austerity measures designed to balance budgets will put more people at risk. But overall, authorities say the day was peaceful Spanish unions to called the strike because they believe planned government reforms will make it easier for companies to lay off workers, especially higher-paid ones. Some of those representatives later met with European Union President Jose Manuel Barroso.
