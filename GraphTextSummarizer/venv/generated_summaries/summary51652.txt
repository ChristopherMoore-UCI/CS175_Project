Traffic fatalities involving young children have dropped sharply since the mid 1970s partly due to increasing use of car seats, NHTSA said. Small cars yield mixed results in crash test, but improving overall If new requirements are ultimately put in place, car seat manufacturers will likely have several years to comply with new standards. Manufacturers would have to demonstrate that child seats can safely restrain an occupant and minimize force from the accident that is transmitted to the child's upper body. NHTSA said manufacturers in recent years have begun beefing up car seat structures and adding more padding to protect the head and torso, noting that those products are effective at protecting kids.
