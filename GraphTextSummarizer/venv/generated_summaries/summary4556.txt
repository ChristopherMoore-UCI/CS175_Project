-- It is a case at the intersection of science and finance, an evolving 21st century dispute that comes down to a simple question: Should the government allow patents for human genes? On one side, scientists and companies argue patents encourage medical innovation and investment that saves lives. The justices asked tough questions, raising a number of colorful hypotheticals to explore the boundaries of patent law, including whether things like baseball bats, leaves from exotic Amazon River plants, and the human liver could get federal government protection. When his life-saving treatment was announced, he said the people would "own" the vaccine, adding "Could you patent the sun?" Maybe not the sun, but in the past 31 years, 20 percent of the human genome has been protected under U.S. patents. Medical science had traditionally shunned patents.
