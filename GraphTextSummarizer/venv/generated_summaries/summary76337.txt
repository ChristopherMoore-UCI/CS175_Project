-- A federal judge determined Wednesday that Shannon Richardson, an actress accused of sending ricin-laced letters to President Barack Obama and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, is a "flight risk" and thus must remain behind bars. Actress first accuses husband, then is arrested in ricin case Nathaniel Richardson denied doing any such thing, telling investigators that his wife was "intentionally misleading" them and that she'd wanted to end their marriage and leave them, court papers said. He filed for divorce in June, and court papers indicated that Shannon Richardson was pregnant. Richardson -- who has had minor roles in television series including "The Walking Dead" and "The Vampire Diaries" -- initially told FBI agents that her now-estranged husband Nathaniel had sent the ricin-tainted letters. The Texas woman, also known as Shannon Rogers and Shannon Guess, was arrested in June.
