The ITF said he had provided "substantial assistance" to its anti-doping program, and that his requirement to do so is "ongoing." Fish described the ITF's decision as "a black eye for all of sport, not just tennis," in quotes reported by U.S. newspaper USA Today. -- Mardy Fish has criticized tennis authorities for halving the suspension handed out to fellow American player Wayne Odesnik for importing controlled drugs. The 25-year-old pleaded guilty to importing human growth hormone into Australia at the start of last year, but is now free to play again when the 2011 season begins Down Under next month. Odesnik will be able to resume his career from December 29 after the International Tennis Federation conditionally canceled the second year of his ban following his cooperation with anti-doping officials. I have learned a lot during my time away from competitive tennis and I now have even a greater appreciation for what a privilege it is to be a professional athlete," Odesnik said in a statement.
