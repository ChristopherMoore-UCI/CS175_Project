Bo Xilai indicted for corruption Until March 2012, the charismatic, populist leader was a member of the policy-making politburo of the Communist Party and party chief of Chongqing, a megacity in southwestern China. The accusations, according to those sources, may be linked to the case of Xu Ming, a multi-millionaire entrepreneur who owned several companies in Dalian, a bustling port city in eastern China where Bo Xilai served as mayor for nearly nine years. Bo, 64, is currently in detention, awaiting a trial that could cap the biggest political scandal to hit China in decades. In late July, Bo Xilai, a former darling of the party, was finally indicted on corruption charges. He has not been seen in public since news of the scandal emerged, and he was stripped of his role as Chongqing party chief and later his prestigious politburo post.
