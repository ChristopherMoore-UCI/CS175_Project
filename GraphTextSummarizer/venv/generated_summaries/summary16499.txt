In sting operation last July, undercover FBI agents gained access to a hotel suite by disabling the hotel's Internet, and then posing as Internet repair technicians. But former FBI Assistant Director Tom Fuentes, who served on the agency's review committee for undercover operations for five years, said undercover operations are carefully reviewed before they are conducted, including by agency lawyers. At Caesar's Palace, a casino hotel on the Strip in Las Vegas, FBI agents deliberately cut off the Internet for a suite used by Paul Phua, a high-stakes gambler. But during the visit, the agents were actually videotaping the hotel room and its occupants in secret, looking for evidence of online gambling. The FBI declined to comment, referring inquiries to the prosecutor's office in Las Vegas.
