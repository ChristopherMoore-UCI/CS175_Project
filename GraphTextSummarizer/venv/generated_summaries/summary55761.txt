-- While those about him have lost their heads, Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany has been a model of consistency. His parents fled Zaire, now known as Democratic Republic of Congo, during the regime of president Mobuto Sese Seko, heading to Belgium where Kompany was born and raised. " Despite the success he has enjoyed since signing for City in 2008, Kompany continues to have numerous extracurricular interests. "I couldn't go anywhere without finishing my studies," Kompany told CNN reflecting on the years he spent combining football and his education. British newspaper the Daily Mail reported in January 2012 that Kompany had signed up for a three-year Business Administration course, while he also purchased a football club in his hometown and renamed it BX Brussels.
