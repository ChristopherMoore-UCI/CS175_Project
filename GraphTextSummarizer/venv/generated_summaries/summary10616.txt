The selection puts a symbolic end to Colonel Reb, who enjoyed lingering popularity among many Ole Miss fans. "Because Colonel Reb is a mark we wish to own as university property to prevent its inappropriate use by others and to avoid confusing consumers and Ole Miss supporters, we are going to reclassify the mark as "historical" and add it to our college 'vault,'" it stated. Rebel Black Bear likely will wear a T-shirt and "bring competitive energy to the game," Thompson said, adding mascots by necessity have to have a look and expression suitable for all occasions. Ole Miss on Thursday announced that Rebel Black Bear had outpolled other contenders to earn the honors, beginning in 2011. Extensive polling resulted in the bear defeating the Rebel Land Shark and Hotty Toddy, based on a cheer exchanged between Ole Miss fans, the mascot selection committee announced Thursday.
