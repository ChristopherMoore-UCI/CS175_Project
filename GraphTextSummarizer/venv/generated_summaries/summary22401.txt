-- It is true many Iraqis celebrated the fall of Saddam Hussein but few expected they would be held hostage to policies over which they -- the Iraqi people -- had no say but for which they would still have to pay the price. The Iraqi people continue to be the victim of both their own country's policies and those of the country -- America -- that directly or indirectly promised them a better life after Saddam Hussein. Nahla al-Nadawi, like tens of thousands of other Iraqis, knows the bitter cold feel of death too well. Standing next to Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki last week, President Barack Obama congratulated the Iraqi leader. In the moments after the last American convoy departed from Iraq, one of our Iraqi colleagues, echoing a thought we'd heard time and time again, said: "We thank the U.S. for getting rid of Saddam, but not for anything that happened afterwards."
