Cuba has freed all 53 political prisoners it had promised to release as part as an historic rapprochement with the United States, a U.S. official said Monday. "Prisoner releases will be no more than a smokescreen if they are not accompanied by expanded space for the free and peaceful expression of all opinions and other freedoms in Cuba," she said. " Her point was echoed by Erika Guevara Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International, who commented on the releases last week. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf provided details about the timing of the releases on Monday. American Alan Gross headed home on "humanitarian" grounds from Cuba last month.
