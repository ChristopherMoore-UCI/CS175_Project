She rejoiced in President Barack Obama's decision last week to send 100 U.S. military advisers to the Central African Republic to help hunt down LRA leaders. "It is not uncommon for the girls who are abducted to be converted into sex slaves or forced into marriages with LRA fighters," according to Daniel DePetris, associate editor of the Maxwell Journal of Counterterrorism and Security Analysis. But all these years have gone by and efforts to quell LRA violence have not been successful. The LRA sprouted as a rebel movement in the late 1980s among the Acholi people in marginalized northern Uganda. One summer night in 2001, Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) guerrillas snatched Apoko from a community center near her home in Gulu district, Uganda.
