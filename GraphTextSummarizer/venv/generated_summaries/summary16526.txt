This was the latest twist in a case that has made international headlines, in part because of the circumstances of the killing but also because van der Sloot was arrested twice, but never charged, in the 2005 disappearance of U.S. teenager Natalee Holloway. Besides the Flores murder trial, van der Sloot also faces possible extradition to the United States.
