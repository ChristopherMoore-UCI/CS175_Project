Other prominent Apple executive are expected to testify, including marketing chief Phil Schiller and Eddy Cue, who runs Internet and software services. The plaintiffs allege that Apple engaged in antitrust behavior by not allowing music sold in other digital stores to play on iPods, specifically iPods sold from 2006 to 2009. If you bought a song from another music marketplace, it wouldn't play on Apple devices. Digital music is now basically a commodity and can be heard on an infinite amount of devices from many different providers. The deposition took place for approximately 2 hours with Jobs often saying he couldn't remember certain e-mails or conversations.
