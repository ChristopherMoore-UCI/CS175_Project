Days of heavy rains triggered a rush of mud, rocks and trees from the mountains overlooking Java's Banjarnegara District on Friday evening. The death toll from a landslide that struck a village in central Java Friday, burying dozens of homes, has risen to 39, Indonesian authorities say. Satellite data appears to show parts of central Java have received about 200 millimeters (7.9 inches) of rain so far this month. Friday's landslide came a day after two other slides killed two people in or near Banjarnegara District, Antara reported. It wasn't clear exactly how much rain fell Friday in Banjarnegara District.
