Reviewing "The Naked Gun" in The New York Times, Janet Maslin -- who called the ZAZ comedy style "proudly sophomoric" -- added that the film had an aura of "unexpected sophistication," thanks to the "dapper presence of Leslie Nielsen who, as Lt. Frank Drebin, manages to bring something heroic to the role of a perfectly oblivious fall guy." Nielsen, of course, was never really oblivious; he knew exactly what he was doing every second he was onscreen. Leslie Nielsen dead at 84 From that point on, Nielsen -- who had been making a living as a handsome, but rather stiff, leading man in such films as "Forbidden Planet," "Tammy and the Bachelor" and "The Poseidon Adventure" -- had found his calling. So while we're chuckling, as we go about our lives today, at the very thought of bumbling Lt. Frank Drebin, and all those other clueless wonders he so effortlessly portrayed, let us give thanks that Nielsen got the chance to show us his comedic chops. That's the sound of the whoopee cushion that Leslie Nielsen placed on the chairs of his co-workers while filming the first "Naked Gun" movie. " "Airplane," of course, led to the short-lived but much beloved TV series "Police Squad," with Nielsen as the utterly bewildered Frank Drebin.
