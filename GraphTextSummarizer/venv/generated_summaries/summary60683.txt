Scheidt was convicted in August of two counts of practicing medicine without a license and two counts of impersonating a physician assistant at Osceola Regional Medical Center in August 2011, when he was 17. Are you that stupid that you are just going to put me in the system as that, without any credentials or any paperwork or nothing?" Prosecutors said Scheidt used the badge to work in the hospital emergency room for weeks, changing bandages, handling IVs and helping to conduct exams. "Their error was putting me in apparently as a physician assistant into their computer," Scheidt told investigators in August. After his arrest, Scheidt acknowledged having performed CPR on a patient suffering from a drug overdose, authorities told CNN affiliate WFTV. A Florida teenager was sentenced Wednesday to a year in jail after he was convicted of four felonies linked to his impersonation last year of a physician assistant in a hospital emergency room.
