-- A radical Islamic cleric who faced charges relating to terrorism was killed in a daylight ambush Monday morning in Kenya's main coastal city, Mombasa, Kenya Police said. Aboud Rogo Mohammed was accused supporting Al-Shabaab militants in Somalia and was blacklisted by the United States and U.N. Security Council. "We have received reports that Aboud Rogo Mohammed has died," said Eric Kiraithe, the Kenya Police spokesman. But Rogo's wife, Hania Said, claimed the shooters were Kenyan police. A U.N. report in July said that Rogo "threatened the peace, security, or stability of Somalia, by providing financial, material, logistical or technical support to Al-Shabaab."
