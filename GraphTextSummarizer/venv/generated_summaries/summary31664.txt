Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Upinder S. Kalra denied a media request Wednesday to have cameras in the courtroom because, he said, the identification issues surrounding the two men as defendants "are unresolved." -- Two men pleaded not guilty Wednesday to felony charges related to the brutal beating of San Francisco Giants fan Bryan Stow after a Los Angeles Dodgers game in March. During arguments about the media's camera request, Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney Frank Santoro told the court that authorities have statements from the defendants that prosecutors used to file charges. During their arraignment in Los Angeles County Superior Court, Marvin Norwood, 30, and Louie Sanchez, 29, both of Rialto, California, were ordered by the judge to remain in custody in lieu of $500,000 bail each. The two men withdrew their earlier request for a bond reduction Wednesday, said Gilbert Quinones, Sanchez's attorney.
