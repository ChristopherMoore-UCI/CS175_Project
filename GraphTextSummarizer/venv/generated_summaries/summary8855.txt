On February 7, suitcase-sized packages wrapped in sacking were found on Bude beach, in north Cornwall. The latest was found on Pentreath beach, on the Lizard Peninsula, Britain's southernmost point. Rumors circulating in Pentreath as to the possible origins center around a Liberian container vessel which found herself in thirty foot seas off Cornwall, at the beginning of February. The following day, more packages were found at Helston on Cornwall's southern coast. I'd heard rumors of a lot of drugs washed up on Cornish beaches.
