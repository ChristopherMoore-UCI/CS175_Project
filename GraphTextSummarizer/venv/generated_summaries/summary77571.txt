Watch Adams walk off Â» Earlier, as the show began, King said Adams had received a letter from West's family, saying that if Adams discussed West's case on the show, the family would ask the Medical Board of California to decertify him. " The letter from West family attorneys asking Adams not to go on the show was faxed to one of Adams' attorneys in California, Tenenbaum said. " When King asked Adams if he would ever answer questions regarding the West case, he said, "I will talk with them," meaning her family. "I think I'm taking up your air time," Dr. Jan Adams tells CNN's Larry King before walking off. But preliminary reports indicate West may have died from complications of cosmetic surgery, which was performed by Adams the day before, he said.
