Inspector General Richard Skinner said US-CERT does not have the authority to enforce its recommendations to federal agencies, impeding the government's ability to move forward on cyber security. That bill calls for a permanent White House cyber security coordinator, creates a National Center for Cybersecurity and Communications within DHS to lead federal efforts to protect government and private networks, and gives the president emergency powers to protect systems under attack. According to a Government Accounting Office analysis, the number of security incidents reported by federal agencies increased more than 400 percent between 2006 and 2009. Committee Chairman Thompson wanted to know what could be done about complaints from federal agencies that DHS was not sharing enough of the data collected from Einstein concerning possible security breaches. A critical report from the Department of Homeland Security's inspector general released Wednesday concluded the agency responsible for protecting civilian computer and information networks was seriously understaffed and did not have the authority to order government agencies to protect their systems.
