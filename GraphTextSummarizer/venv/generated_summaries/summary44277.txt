Defense attorneys said they are preparing new pretrial motions to deal with the fallout from the FBI investigations. Hearings this week at Guantanamo Bay are expected to deal with the FBI investigations to see if there's a conflict of interest. Lawyers for the defense team said Sunday that their investigation revealed that the FBI asked three other members of the defense team to cooperate and not to reveal that they were approached. The four people approached by the FBI had top-secret clearances, working with the defense teams to help them sort through classified information. The U.S. Justice Department has acknowledged the contact and said investigators looked into whether someone on the defense team representing defendant Ramzi bin al-Shibh may have aided unauthorized communication between him and people overseas.
