A new formula to decide the seedings has been implemented for the first time which sees teams selected on rankings places alone, rather than basing the decisions on rankings and previous tournament performances. Had November's rankings been used France could have been seeded instead of England, FIFA's general secretary Jerome Valcke told the British Press Association this would have been unfair. Hosts South Africa take their place in Pot One with the seven top placed sides in the world rankings as of October, these being Brazil, Spain, Holland, current holders Italy, Germany, Argentina and England. Pots for Friday's World Cup draw: Pot One (Seeds): South Africa, Brazil, Spain, Holland, Italy, Germany, Argentina, England. "Countries who had been involved in the play-offs would have had an unfair advantages because they would have played more games and that affects their rankings."
