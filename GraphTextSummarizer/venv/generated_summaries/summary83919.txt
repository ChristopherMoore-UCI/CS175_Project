-- Military police poured into Cairo's Tahrir Square on Wednesday in hopes of stopping clashes between protesters and police, as the Egyptian government said a truce had been declared through a group of clerics. But along the barricades separating protesters from security forces, some clerics were talking to protesters, trying to negotiate. Security forces could be seen making arrests Wednesday. In an audio message aired by Egyptian state TV, he called for a "peaceful protest for Egypt's sake. Mohamed Mahmoud Street leads from Tahrir Square -- the center of the protests that toppled Hosni Mubarak as president in February and of the most recent demonstrations -- toward the Interior Ministry.
