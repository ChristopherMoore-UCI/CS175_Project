"There was no intent to portray Mr. Zimmerman unfairly," the company said last year. I think he is going to have to take a lot of time to relax, to center himself, to get used to his new reality, which is a free man, exonerated," brother Robert Zimmerman Jr. told CNN en EspaÃ±ol on Sunday. And it's unclear what that could mean for Zimmerman's cash flow. So far, Zimmerman's lawyers and family have been tight-lipped about his next steps. One site, gzdefensefund.com, raised more than $330,000 in just over a year, according to a spokesman for Zimmerman's lawyer.
