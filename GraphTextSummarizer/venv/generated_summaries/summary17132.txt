-- Ventures lead guitarist Bob Bogle, whose fretwork on such instrumental hits such as "Walk -- Don't Run" and "Hawaii Five-O" influenced countless bands, died Sunday in Vancouver, Washington. Thirty-eight of the band's long-players hit Billboard's Top 200 chart, including albums that covered country songs, dance tunes and Christmas melodies. The cause was non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, according to Don Wilson, who co-founded the Ventures with Bogle in the 1950s. "I can't think of a better contribution for instrumental music on his style than 'Walk -- Don't Run,' " Wilson said. Wilson and Bogle learned how to play guitar while working as construction workers in the 1950s in their native Tacoma, Washington.
