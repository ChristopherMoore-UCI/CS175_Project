The siege in Oakland, where police have repeatedly clashed with protesters, reminds us that there's one other thing that police officers shouldn't do: impersonate soldiers. My upbringing doesn't prevent me from -- in the course of doing my job -- criticizing police officers or law enforcement agencies when they turn into bullies, betray the public trust or deny a suspect due process. I'm also highly critical of the tendency of some police officers to dabble in areas of law enforcement they don't understand, such as federal immigration law. In recent weeks, hundreds of protesters in Oakland have clashed with police officers in riot gear. Leaf through a police magazine these days and you'll see ads for automatic weapons, military equipment and the like -- all being pitched at police officers.
