Bird hopes the range of languages represented will bring a new audience to the Globe, a reproduction of the original Elizabethan theater on the banks of the River Thames in which William Shakespeare himself had a stake. Over six weeks next spring, London's Globe Theatre will present all 37 of the Bard's plays in 37 languages, performed by companies from as many countries. Tom Bird, festival director for the Globe to Globe event -- which will run from April to June as part of the "cultural Olympiad" ahead of the London 2012 Olympics -- told CNN it was the most ambitious project of its kind. The Globe to Globe festival starts April 23, William Shakespeare's birthday. "The tricky thing is we can't get everyone in, so we thought a little bit about the languages that are spoken in London, like Urdu, Yoruba and Polish," Bird said.
