According to the Washington-based cities organization, the effects of the financial crisis are also "increasingly evident in city property tax revenues in 2012," after dropping 3.9% nationwide last year and thereby bringing in fewer dollars for municipal services. And Newark is by no means unique in implementing police cutbacks to save city money. " Still, in 2010, Newark's mayor said police layoffs were an "unfortunate situation that was entirely avoidable," and blamed the cuts on an unwillingness by police unions to negotiate needed reductions in the wake of the financial crisis. Newark is listed as one of only a handful of New Jersey cities that maintain gangs with more than 200 members, according to a state survey. In short, the overall pie has gotten smaller, say city officials who point to the hundreds of public sector layoffs in Newark in 2010.
