Brawn left his latest role as team principal of Mercedes in 2013 after taking the Silver Arrows to the verge of their most successful season in the sport since the 1950s. "Ross Brawn is an iconic figure at [Ferrari headquarters] Maranello," Mattiacci told CNN. As Ferrari's former technical director, Brawn helped guide the Scuderia to six constructors' titles as well as five world titles between 2000 and 2004 with Michael Schumacher. Ferrari's new team principal Marco Mattiacci revealed to CNN he would be happy to work with the English technical guru. Ferrari would welcome back Ross Brawn to help turn around the famous Formula One team's flagging fortunes.
