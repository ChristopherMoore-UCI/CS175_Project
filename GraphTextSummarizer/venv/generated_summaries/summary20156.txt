Think big With over 400 stores, Yas Mall will be the second largest shopping complex in the United Arab Emirates, developers hoping it will emulate the success of neighboring Dubai Mall -- double the size at 502,000 square meters. And before consumers have even stepped inside Yas Mall, Al Mubarak is already talking expansion. "Over the last five years, the growth of both Dubai Mall and the Mall of the Emirates has been immense," explained Al Mubarak. If shoppers are as "hungry," as Al Mubarak says, then Abu Dhabi is working hard to feed them. Aldar was 13.7billion dirhams (U.S. $3.7 billion) in debt last year, later merging with rival Sorouh Real Estate.
