Now, fans of Nirvana have the chance to have the gold-colored Visa that belonged to deceased front man Kurt Cobain. The online platform, which claims the credit card is in excellent condition, is offering the item as part of its "Legendary: Memorabilia From Rock Gods and Pop Stars" collection. The Seafirst BankCard Visa has Cobain's signature on the back in blue. Even the grungiest rock stars have owned credit cards. The credit card is one of the top valued items on the auction house's site, which is offering pop culture-inspired memorabilia, including Frank Sinatra's driver's license from 1944, and a handwritten U2 setlist from their tour supporting the band's 1983 album "War."
