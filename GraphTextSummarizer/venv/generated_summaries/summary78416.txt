"While I'm not familiar with what was done in the classroom setting, I can confirm for you that our recipe for the Oreo Double Stuf cookie has double the stuff, or creme filling, when compared with our base, or original Oreo cookie," said Oreo spokeswoman Kimberly Fontes. But most have never calculated just how stuffed Oreos are, until now A high school math teacher in upstate New York tasked his students to find out just how much "stuf" is in each type of Oreo -- original, Double and Mega Stuf. "Most of them have had practice, as have I, in separating the Oreo in half and getting a clean side, but getting two clean sides off just leaving the stuff was difficult," said teacher Dan Anderson. Mega Stuf? And it apparently would be a surprise to the folks at Oreo too.
