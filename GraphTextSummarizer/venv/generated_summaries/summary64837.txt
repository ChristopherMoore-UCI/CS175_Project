"Over and over again, you said, 'Do the impossible,' " Norton, a Democrat, said, referring to NTSB recommendations that Metro replace older cars with sturdier new ones. -- The cause of a deadly Washington Metro subway crash last month remains a mystery, with one problem identified by investigators persisting even after engineers replaced a key part that was believed to be faulty, a top Metro official said Tuesday Investigators are shown at the crash scene in Washington. The National Transportation Safety Board, which is leading the investigation, acknowledged that Metro's system of detecting trains continues to have unexplained, intermittent failures. Metro has said it will operate the subway trains on manual control until officials have identified and fixed the problem with the automatic train system. Eleanor Holmes Norton, the District of Columbia's Congressional delegate, chided the NTSB for making prohibitively costly safety recommendations while ignoring cheaper, common sense solutions, such as putting the newer, more robust rail cars at the front and back of trains.
