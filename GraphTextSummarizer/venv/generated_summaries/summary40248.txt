Obama and Xi will have "candid and in-depth conversations" on a range of issues, Rice told reporters last week. National Security Advisor Susan Rice raised the issue of press access with her Beijing counterparts in the weeks leading to the President's visit, which will include a formal bilateral meeting with Chinese President Xi at a summit of APEC leaders. "If you go back to when Chinese leaders have agreed to joint press availabilities, you'll have a very hard time finding one where they have been willing to take questions from the press," said Brookings Institution analyst Ken Lieberthal at a briefing on the President's trip last week. White House officials accompanying Obama cautioned leaders in Beijing are still balking at the U.S. proposal for a joint news conference with Chinese President Xi. Obama administration officials prepared reporters for the possibility of limited access to Obama during a background briefing with reporters last week.
