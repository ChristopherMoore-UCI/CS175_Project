News: Scandal threatens to overshadow pope's final days Pope Benedict XVI came from a Catholic Bavarian town. Later he hosted Muslim leaders at the Vatican at the start of a Catholic-Muslim forum for dialogue. In 2009, on a visit to Aquila, Italy, Benedict left at Celestine's tomb the pallium, a stole-like vestment that signifies episcopal authority, that Benedict had worn for his installation as pope. And in a paradox of life, his most human moment -- giving up the power of office -- may prove to be his most potent, delivering a message that, as St. Paul noted many centuries ago, "Power is made perfect in infirmity." A similar controversy erupted when he tried to bring the schismatic Society of St. Pius X back into the Roman Catholic fold.
