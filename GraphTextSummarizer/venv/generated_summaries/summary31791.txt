Jordan and longtime girlfriend, Yvette Prieto, got engaged on Christmas Day, CNN affiliate WCNC reported. -- NBA Hall of Famer Michael Jordan has been off the court for years; now, he's off the market. The couple has been seen at various high-profile public events in recent years, including the Kentucky Derby, golf outings and vacations. Since his hoops days, Jordan has continued lucrative endorsement deals with corporate giants such as Coca-Cola, Hanes and Nike, which houses a subsidiary with his namesake, Jordan Brand. In 2009, during opening ceremonies for the Presidents Cup, she was seen alongside Nicki Stricker, the wife of PGA Tour star Steve Stricker, and Elin Nordegren, then-wife of Tiger Woods.
