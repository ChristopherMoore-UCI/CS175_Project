Castan reported the problem during halftime of his side's 1-0 victory against Empoli, and after facing tests earlier this month, he went under the knife to remove the cavernoma -- a cluster of abnormal blood vessels -- in his brain. Roma defender Leandro Castan underwent successful neurosurgery Wednesday, having previously complained of acute dizziness during an Italian Serie A match in September. The 28-year-old, who arrived at Roma from Corinthians in 2012, has made just one appearance for the Italian Serie A club this season, having been sidelined since being substituted at halftime against Empoli. Castan has become a key player for Roma since joining, making 36 appearances last term as the club booked their place in Europe's Champions League. While Wednesday's operation should ensure that Castan will be able to play football again, reports suggest that he will not be ready to return to action for up to eight months.
