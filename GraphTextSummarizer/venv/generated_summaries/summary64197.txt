Artist, sculptor and former Marine firefighter Curtis James Miller will unveil his memorial Sunday, the 10th anniversary of the terrorist attacks, in an Atlanta suburb. So the whole site is in a 52-foot circle in front of DeKalb County police and fire headquarters. Curtis James Miller: Doug Harms, who works with (the) DeKalb (County) Fire (Department), approached me about doing this memorial. CNN: You've said you enjoy doing memorials. But I'm not building bridges; I'm not saving people's lives; I'm painting pretty pictures.
