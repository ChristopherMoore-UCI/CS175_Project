-- More than 100 people who attend or work at a southern California high school will be treated with antibiotics after being exposed to tuberculosis, a spokesman for the Riverside County Health Department said Monday. Of the 1,471 students and staff at Indio High School, 126 -- or 8.6% -- were exposed to tuberculosis, but only one student actually has the illness. It can also infect other parts of the body including the kidneys, spine and brain. Tuberculosis is an infection caused by a bacterium called Mycobacterium tuberculosis that mainly affects the lungs. Treatment of TB requires antibiotics for at least six to nine months, the Mayo Clinic says on its website.
