There is AUS $60 million ($52.8 mil) earmarked by the Australian government for mapping and underwater search, and Australian expenditure is to be matched by Malaysian government. Although search teams have been focusing along the seventh arc or "partial handshake," where investigators believe the aircraft ran out of fuel, for months, it's only within the past several weeks that investigators have shifted their focus further south. The Australian government said in August that it has picked Fugro Survey, a Dutch company for the mapping and the next phase of undersea search, along with a vessel, the GO Phoenix, supplied by the Malaysian government. It will conduct search activity for 12 days before going to Fremantle, in western Australia, for resupply. " Continued analysis of the satellite data, along with a better understanding of the communication between aircraft and satellite and of aircraft performance limits has enabled investigators to further refine the search areas.
