" Michael Obi, who runs a transport company in Jos, the main city in Plateau State in central Nigeria, has not been seen or heard of since he failed to return home from work last Friday. Obi Mikel was told of the problem just before the start of Chelsea's Premier League match at Stoke Sunday which finished goalless and said his father was at the forefront of his thoughts throughout the match. Chelsea midfielder John Obi Mikel has made an emotional appeal after his father was abducted in his native Nigeria. He has played 30 times for the Nigeria national team. "Nigeria is the country I am from, I've always tried to help my country in any way I can, playing for my country or anything," he said.
