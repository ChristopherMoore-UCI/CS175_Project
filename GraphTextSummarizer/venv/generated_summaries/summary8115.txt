American contractor David Berry was among the people killed in a terrorist attack at the Corinthia Hotel in Tripoli, Libya, on Tuesday, according to Cliff Taylor, chief executive officer of Crucible, a security firm where Berry was working. At least 10 people and two attackers were killed in Tuesday's attack against the luxurious Corinthia Hotel in Tripoli, Libya, a spokesman for a security division of the Ministry of Interior in Tripoli said. He was captured by U.S. special forces in Libya. Al-Libi was an alleged al Qaeda operative accused of involvement in the bombing of U.S. embassies in Africa. A witness to the events told CNN that all roads leading to the Corinthia Hotel had been sealed by security forces.
