Finnish cellphone giant Nokia on Tuesday unveiled its latest range of smartphones as it bids to recover lost ground to rivals Apple and Blackberry. Analysts: Symbian and Android will dominate by 2014 Nokia chairman to step down in 2012 "The time is right to accelerate the company's renewal; to bring in new executive leadership with different skills and strengths in order to drive company success," Jorma Ollila, Chairman of the Nokia Board of Directors, said in a statement. However technology journalist Kevin Tofel, who attended Nokia World, told CNN that he feels Nokia may stem the loss of market share with their latest offerings but this is "basically a band-aid." Symbian is already the most widely used operating system for mobiles in the world, but Nokia admits competitors such as Apple and Google have started to catch up. All four models will be available in time for the key Christmas period and will have access to the revamped Ovi Store, Nokia's version of Apple's App store where users can download applications, games and videos.
