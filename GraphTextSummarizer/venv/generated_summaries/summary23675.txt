" NSA misrepresented scope of data collection to secret court Senior intelligence officials attempted to assure reporters that the news was not so much the compliance violation, but the fact that the NSA uncovered the problem, reported it to the Justice Department and the FISA Court, "took steps thereafter to do a thorough scrub of operations," and reported back to the FISA Court after the changes had been made. The NSA also kept a separate "alert list" that was used to compare the new numbers that were coming in daily and consider whether new numbers should be added to the category of those with "reasonable articulable suspicion." The civil liberties group has challenged the constitutionality of the NSA phone records collection program in court. Internet companies fight to release more information on NSA requests But each day, the NSA ran the alert list against the new information to see if it could establish reasonable suspicion.
