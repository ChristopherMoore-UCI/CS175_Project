"I'm going to be proposing some new community policing initiatives that will significantly expand funding and training for local law enforcement, including up to 50,000 additional body-worn cameras for law enforcement agencies," Obama said. The president also announced a new task force, chaired by the Philadelphia police commissioner and a criminology professor, that will reach out to law enforcement, community activists and other stakeholders to come up with best practices on creating accountability and trust between communities and police. After meeting with law enforcement officials and activists Monday, President Barack Obama outlined several new efforts. But Obama plans to issue an executive order to tighten some of the controls over the programs to better track equipment provided to law enforcement agencies. They've been joined by demonstrators across the country who say they won't stop clamoring for change until they see real action.
