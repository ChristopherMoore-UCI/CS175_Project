Not only are Americans putting off health care and facing increasing dissatisfaction, they are also shopping around for better deals on doctors' fees, prescription medication prices or health insurance plans to cut costs, according to the survey. In addition to data about how many Americans fail to seek necessary medical care because of high costs, another theme that emerged in the survey focused on consumers' dissatisfaction with the nation's health-care system: â€¢ 94 percent of respondents said they believe health-care costs threaten their own financial security. They either didn't have medical insurance coverage or they perceived the cost of such care to be excessive, according to the survey, which was released early Tuesday to CNN by the Deloitte Center for Health Solutions, a nonpartisan, independent research center. More than half said they think 50 percent or more of the money spent by Americans on health care is a waste. There has been a lot of perceived loyalty and commitment in health care, Keckley said, and many providers think patients will stay with them.
