"Air France confirms that it asked passengers if they had cash, as payments for fuel can only be made in cash in Damascus," an Air France statement said. -- Passengers were asked to help pay for fuel on a Beirut-bound Air France flight that had to be diverted to Syria this week, the airline said. After Air France figured out the issue, the passengers were flown to Cyprus and then taken to Beirut on Thursday. "Ultimately, Air France could pay the full amount itself, and passengers did not have to advance any cash." The plane could not secure a flight path to Amman, so instead, the crew decided to land in Damascus, Air France said.
