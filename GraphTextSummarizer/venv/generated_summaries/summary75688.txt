Williams will face former French Open winner Francesca Schiavone in her opening match Monday, while older sister Venus plays Belgium's Wimbledon semifinalist Kirsten Flipkens. " With world No. 3 Maria Sharapova missing the tournament due to injury, and Wimbledon champion Marion Bartoli having retired earlier this month, Azarenka is Williams' biggest threat along with Polish third seed Agnieszka Radwanska. "Every time I lose, I get so pumped afterwards," said Williams at a pre-tournament press conference Saturday. Meanwhile, world No. 9 Petra Kvitova's U.S. Open preparations stumbled Saturday as the Czech lost 6-2 6-2 to Romania's Simona Halep in the final of the WTA event in New Haven. Azarenka served for the title just under 12 months ago in New York, but Williams fought back to claim her 15th grand slam title.
