-- A barrage of rockets and mortars fired into southern Israel continued Sunday, the latest in a four-day escalation of violence sparked by a series of attacks on Israeli civilians and soldiers Thursday. The rockets and mortars fired from Gaza on Saturday forced more than 500,000 people into bomb shelters, Israeli defense officials said. By noon Sunday, 20 incoming rockets had been reported by Israeli officials. Since then, nearly 100 rockets have been fired into Israel, Israel Defense Forces spokesman Brig. An eighth victim died from Thursday's attacks, Israeli police said Sunday.
