But finding Dr. Mario was a good excuse for an urban adventure in New York. Later I learned the art was actually the character Dr. Mario, who I believe was an alter ego of Super Mario -- the Italian plumber who got freaky with a princess in the Mushroom Kingdom. And after a simple search for "New York City," I found a newly uploaded photo that was becoming somewhat popular with users on that site. Surely there was something locally interesting going on that people were talking about all over the Web -- something culturally relevant and noteworthy that could give us a deeper glimpse into the psyche and spirit of New York. Dr. Mario was in Chinatown at the corner of Walker Street and Cortlandt Alley.
