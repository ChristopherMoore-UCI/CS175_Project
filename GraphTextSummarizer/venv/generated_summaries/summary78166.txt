Despite the injustice that follows LGBTI Ugandans into a new year, our desire for freedom has taken deep root. In drag and plain view, LGBTI Ugandans celebrated life in the face of legislation that calls for our death. Seated in the same office at the gay rights organization, Sexual Minorities Uganda, known as SMUG, David and I had committed to ending discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. People like one trans woman who in September was brutally beaten in public by friends who discovered her identity, and another who was dragged to the police in full glare of the public. With action on Uganda's anti-homosexuality bill looming, the lives of the nation's LGBTI are threatened.
