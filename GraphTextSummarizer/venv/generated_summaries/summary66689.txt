"(Doing the movie) opened a window for me into this world of casting that I'd never really been conscious of before," says "Casting By" director Tom Donahue in a phone interview. " It's a conundrum: Producers may want an established name, while casting directors may see an unknown with real potential -- an unknown who won't get a chance until he becomes, well, an established name. " Dougherty, who died in 2011, felt the same way -- and the feeling was reciprocal: "Casting By" ends with a chorus of tributes from colleagues. " Despite their key role in shaping movies, casting directors still don't get all the credit they deserve. She was also a mentor to a number of future casting directors, including Juliet Taylor (who has done more than three dozen films with Woody Allen, as well as "Schindler's List," "Working Girl" and "Network") and Ellen Lewis ("Forrest Gump," "The Birdcage" and several Martin Scorsese pictures).
