But Daniel Abugatas, president of the Congress of the Republic and a member of the Gana Peru Party to which President Ollanta Humala belongs, said such an outcome is improbable. As a candidate and now as president, Humala has pledged to respect contracts signed by previous governments. Although government functionaries say the controversy over the mine is a problem that Humala inherited from a former government, some analysts say that he handled the conflict poorly. Newmont, which is based in Denver, Colorado, and describes itself as one of the world's largest oil companies, said it had suspended construction on the project "for the safety of employees and community members." "The Conga Environmental Impact Assessment was approved in 2010 after extensive review by the Peruvian government which included significant engagement and consultation with local communities," it said.
