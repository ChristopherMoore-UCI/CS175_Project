Scrum half Weepu missed the conversion in a nervy start but was on target with a penalty after Australia flanker David Pocock was pulled up for a ruck infringement. Two second half penalties from scrum-half Piri Weepu, taking over the kicking role from the injured Dan Carter, sealed victory for a relieved home team who carried huge weight of expectation. James O'Connor had the Wallabies on the board with a penalty but New Zealand fly-half Aaron Cruden, playing after groin injuries ruled both Carter and Colin Slade out of the World Cup, put his team further ahead with a 22nd minute drop-goal. We just need to regroup next week and do the same thing," said New Zealand coach Graham Henry. Cooper pulled it back to 11-6 for Australia with a neatly-taken drop-goal but Weepu added a penalty before the half to open up an eight-point lead again.
