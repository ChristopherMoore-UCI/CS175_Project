More than 700,000 Filipinos heeded warnings and evacuated to Red Cross shelters, Philippine Red Cross Chairman Richard Gordon said. It was the epic 5-meter-tall (16-foot-high) wall of ocean water that crushed the city of Tacloban, smashing houses and floating them away. CNN's Andrew Stevens and Tim Schwarz and a team of storm chasers chronicled Haiyan's wrath from a hotel in Tacloban. But there's a reason for that, Tacloban Mayor Alfred Romualdez said Tuesday. The Philippine Red Cross chairman said Saturday it may be another day or two before aid can arrive in Tacloban.
