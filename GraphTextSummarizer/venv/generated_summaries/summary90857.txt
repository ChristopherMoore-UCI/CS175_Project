"I saw the horse at a full gallop with either people or a person in the carriage," said CNN's Soledad O'Brien, who watched the incident unfold in front of the network's New York bureau. All of them have nothing but minor injuries, if there are any injuries at all." Witnesses said the horse was moving westward along Central Park South when it entered Columbus Circle, a traffic rotary at the park's southwest corner, and bolted. But how about a horse running down Broadway dodging Manhattan traffic while dragging terrified tourists? "The horse got spooked and rolled the carriage," NYPD Detective Martin Speechley said. Many have flocked to Broadway to see these animals, in plays of course.
