Anti-abortion protesters plan demonstrations this weekend outside Dr. LeRoy Carhart's clinic in Bellevue, Nebraska. "Operation Rescue has said Dr. Carhart is the next target ...," said Katherine Spillar, executive vice president with the Feminist Majority Foundation. "That's when she told me that George had been shot in church and that he was dead." Carhart is unlike many abortion doctors. Carhart was a close friend and understudy of Tiller's. " Carhart was performing an abortion in his clinic when Tiller was killed that Sunday morning.
