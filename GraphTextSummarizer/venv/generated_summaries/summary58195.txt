Here's what you should know about the four most common types of pre-symptom cancer screenings, including the leading experts' recommendations and what the test involves: Prostate cancer Prostate cancer is the most common form of cancer among men, with approximately 30,000 dying from the disease each year. Cervical cancer The number of cases of cervical cancer has decreased significantly in the United States over the past 40 years thanks to regular screenings, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recently announced that it is no longer recommending prostate cancer screening for men. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force released a statement two years ago recommending against yearly mammograms for breast cancer for women in their 40s. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the National Cancer Institute recommend that women age 40 and older get screened for breast cancer every one to two years.
