-- Nine years ago, Frankie Valli was rescued from oldies-station oblivion with the smash Broadway musical "Jersey Boys." And in chronicling the careers of Valli & Co., he charts a predictably linear through-line: the band's hardscrabble Italian-American roots, which lead them to a sentimental wiseguy (Christopher Walken) who takes them under his wing; their first flirtation with fame; the downward slide of excess, money trouble, and infighting; and a redemptive third act in which they let bygones be bygones when they're inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990. You'd think that after all the grousing over Leonardo DiCaprio's distracting mugful of old-age putty in "J. Edgar," the director would have paid more attention to the unconvincing wrinkles and jowls in the final stretch of "Jersey Boys." This trick doesn't always work, but when it does, and Valli or one of his bandmates turns to the camera, winks, and dishes about how the reality of events clashes with what we're actually witnessing on screen, it gooses the film with a giddy jolt of jukebox electricity. The biggest problem is that the film, written by Marshall Brickman and Rick Elice, never makes a convincing case for why Valli the man or the singer matters beyond the music in the way that "Ray" and "Walk the Line" did for Ray Charles and Johnny Cash.
