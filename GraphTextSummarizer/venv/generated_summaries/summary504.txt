-- Pop star Michael Jackson will avoid foreclosure on his Neverland Ranch property with a new loan, a Jackson insider told CNN Wednesday. The Santa Barbara County Recorder's Web site lists a "notice of trustees sale" by Jackson and his property lenders, Financial Title Company, filed Monday. Jackson has not lived at Neverland since June 2005, after a Santa Barbara County jury found him not guilty of child molestation charges. Michael Jackson owes millions of dollars on his sprawling property in the Santa Ynez Valley in California. A real estate source inside Santa Barbara County said the trustees filing is only the first step in a long process that could drag on for months.
