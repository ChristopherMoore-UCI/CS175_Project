The French Laundry, the oh-so chichi Napa Valley landmark with its three Michelin stars and wine list that reads like porn for oenophiles, is suffering from bottle shock after its wine cellar was raided on Christmas Day. Keller singled out two wines in particular: Screaming Eagle, a local Cabernet Sauvignon that can run as much as $6,500 a bottle, and Domaine de la Roman√©e-Conti, a French wine he sells between $6,000 and $8,000 per bottle, depending on the vintage. Seventy-six bottles, with a total worth of about $300,000, were stolen from the Yountville restaurant, according to CNN affiliate KPIX. "Specific wines of specific value were stolen," tweeted French Laundry's owner, the culinary demigod Thomas Keller. It's a restaurant so exclusive and so extravagant that even the scofflaws who broke in and robbed it have discerning, sophisticated palates.
