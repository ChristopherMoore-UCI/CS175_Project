The case dealt with the constitutionality of state "personhood" laws that say life begins at conception, and would give human embryos the rights and privileges of citizens. Opponents counter it would essentially block abortions even in cases of rape, incest, or when the mother's life was in danger. Many backers had hoped to use such "gateway" measures to force another Supreme Court showdown over the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling legalizing abortion. Those justices said the measure, if approved, would unconstitutionally ban access to abortions, and concluded that defining a fertilized human egg as a person "is clearly unconstitutional." Initiative Petition 395 is a proposed ballot measure to amend Oklahoma's state constitution, but was unanimously struck down by the state's supreme court.
