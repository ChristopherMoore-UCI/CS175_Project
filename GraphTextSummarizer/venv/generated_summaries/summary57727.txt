While most games take two to three years before hitting the shelf, lead designer Jake Solomon said his split-personality labor of love has taken more than four years to come to fruition. "XCOM: Enemy Unknown" is a science fiction, strategy game pitting Earth against an invading alien force. Sid Meier "has a quote -- 'One good game is better than two great games,' " Solomon said, jokingly referring to Meier as "my lord and master." The field squad portion of the game is more about combat tactics, maximizing your weaponry and out-thinking (and out-shooting) the enemy. But the creators of a recently released, turn-based strategy game hope that by blending two differing styles of play in one title they will find a pot of gold at the end of the double rainbow.
