Hurricane Igor maintained its Category 4 status Monday afternoon, still huffing and puffing top sustained winds of 150 mp (240 kph) although tracking maps show the storm remaining in the open Atlantic, far from land. Julia, too, was moving away from land, although a tropical storm warning was in effect for the southern Cape Verde islands as the storm moved past. Tracking maps show Julia becoming a Category 1 hurricane over the open Atlantic later in the week before dropping back to tropical storm intensity without nearing land. As of 5 p.m. ET Monday, its center was about 210 miles (335 kilometers) west of the southernmost Cape Verde Islands, but the storm was pulling away from the islands. Hurricane-force winds extended up to 50 miles (85 kilometers) from Igor's center, and tropical storm-force winds can be felt up to 195 miles (315 kilometers) outward, according to the Hurricane Center.
