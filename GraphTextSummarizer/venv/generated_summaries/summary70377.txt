Bus blast in Pakistan kills at least 17 A gruesome week Peshawar, the capital of Pakistan's volatile Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, has endured a violent week. Tackling religious intolerance and violence in Pakistan Sikander Khan Sherpao, senior minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, suggested the attack had been carried out by forces wanting to sabotage recent efforts by the national government to pursue peace talks with the Pakistani Taliban. Earlier this month, Pakistani officials announced plans to pursue peace talks with Taliban militants and withdraw troops from parts of the volatile northwestern region, which borders Afghanistan. Sunday evening, after a meeting of provincial officials, the creation of task forces to help maintain peace in Peshawar was announced. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is rife with Islamic extremists and has been the site of clashes between Pakistani security forces and militants.
