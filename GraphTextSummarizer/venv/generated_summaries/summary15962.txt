Chuck Grassley invitation Cole acknowledged the investigation is now examining the circumstances of missing emails, and a destroyed hard-drive, from former IRS official Lois Lerner.

Paul Gosar reminded Cole that he was a dentist not a lawyer, and tried to grill him over comments in February by President Barack Obama.
