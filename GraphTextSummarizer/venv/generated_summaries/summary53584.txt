The "red shirt" opposition protesters include supporters of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted in a bloodless military coup in 2006. Since Thaksin's ouster, Thailand has endured widespread political unrest that has pitted Thaksin loyalists against Abhisit's supporters. The protesters say that current Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva was not democratically elected and have demanded that he call new elections. In anticipation, the government has mobilized 50,000 security forces, said acting spokesman Panitan Wattanayakorn. Thaksin was the only Thai prime minister to serve a full-term in office and remains hugely popular.
