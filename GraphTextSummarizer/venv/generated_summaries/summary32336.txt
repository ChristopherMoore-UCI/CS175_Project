Security experts have long expressed concern about so-called clean skins -- potential terrorists who enroll in trusted traveler programs to avoid scrutiny during a terror mission. Under trusted traveler programs, travelers voluntarily surrender more information about themselves, giving the government more assurances of who they are. -- The Transportation Security Administration on Tuesday unveiled a "trusted traveler" program -- one meant to expedite screening at U.S. airport checkpoints, agency chief John Pistole said. "As with any initiative, we are testing this prescreening concept with a small passenger population at limited airports," he said at an aviation security conference in the Netherlands. "If proven successful, we will explore expanding the program to additional travelers, airports and airlines." All participants must be U.S. citizens who voluntarily release certain information about themselves. Delta passengers must be flying out of Atlanta and Detroit airports, and American Airlines passengers must be flying out of Miami and Dallas airports.
