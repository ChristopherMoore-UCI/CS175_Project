The New York City Opera received critical praise in the past for its world premieres of work including Robert Ward's "The Crucible" and Anthony Davis' "The Life and Times of Malcolm X." The company opened its current season on September 17 with the opera "Anna Nicole," and should it fail to raise the necessary funds by Monday, that could be the Company's last production. "We need the help of the people we were founded to serve to put on our season this year," Steel said, speaking to New York residents and opera fans everywhere. The company, dubbed "The People's Opera" by former NYC Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia, was founded on the principle that every New Yorker should be able to afford to go to the opera, Steel said. "If we don't raise the ($7 million) by the end of Monday the board is going to begin the process of bankruptcy," spokesperson Risa Heller told CNN on Friday. This year marks the 70th anniversary of the New York City Opera, which opened in 1943, making it the second opera house in NYC.
