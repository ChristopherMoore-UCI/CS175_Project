-- British lawmakers investigating a phone hacking scandal Tuesday asked media baron Rupert Murdoch, his son James and former News of the World editor Rebekah Brooks to testify before them, hours after former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown accused their newspaper group of illegally obtaining private information about him. Murdoch's News Corporation also encompasses Fox News, The Wall Street Journal, the New York Post and Harper Collins publishers. The accusations that journalists working for News International papers went after Brown were published Monday by rival outlet the Guardian. "Senior executives" of Murdoch's British newspaper company "will cooperate," News International said in a statement, without specifying who. Brooks has been promoted to chief executive of News International, and Murdoch has stood by her.
