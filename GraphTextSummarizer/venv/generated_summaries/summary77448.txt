-- Former "Desperate Housewives" actress Nicollette Sheridan slapped her lawyer in court Thursday to demonstrate how she claims show creator Marc Cherry hit her during a rehearsal. Sheridan lawyers Mark Baute, in his opening statement Wednesday, challenge the authenticity of those writers notes, accusing Cherry's defense of an "effort to backdate the decision" with a fake story that the character's death was planned months before the hitting incident. Cherry's lawyers argue show writers began planning Britt's demise in May 2008, four months before the alleged battery, as a way to shock viewers and raise ratings. Her wrongful termination lawsuit contends Cherry killed off Edie Britt, the sassy, blond woman Sheridan played, in retaliation for her complaints about being hit. Five months and 11 episodes later, Cherry informed Sheridan that Britt would die during a show taping the next day, ending her five years run on "Desperate Housewives.
