Long time rival Excelebration, whom Frankel beat by a comfortable five lengths at Newbury in May, had been given orders not to let Frankel open up ground. Astonishing Frankel won the Queen Anne Stakes, the opening race of Royal Ascot, in spectacular style on Tuesday, smashing a classy field by 11 lengths to reassert his claims to be recognized as the world's best racehorse. The fans have come in their droves to Royal Ascot this week to see another wonder horse, Black Caviar, the Australian superstar who will make her appearance here on Saturday. Once Tom Queally, Frankel's jockey, opened the tap there was no way any other horse was going to get close to Frankel, the giant bay increasing his lead with every one of his all-devouring strides. -- Frankel first, the rest nowhere.
