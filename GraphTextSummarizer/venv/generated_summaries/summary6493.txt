World Food Programme Executive Director Josette Sheeran acknowledged the dire need to get food supplies into southern Somalia, where the al Qaeda-linked militant group Al-Shabaab recently lifted a ban on aid agencies. The Saudi-based Organization of Islamic Cooperation hopes to bring in more aid groups under its umbrella, and an OIC delegation visited Mogadishu Wednesday to discuss delivery of more food and bridging the aid gap. Even though Mogadishu is one of the hardest places to get aid, people are flocking to the city in the midst of the worst food crisis in decades. "We are faced with hundreds of thousands of people on the verge of starvation but there is no central authority we can negotiate with to get access to those people," said Joel Charny, vice president for humanitarian policy and practice at InterAction, an alliance of U.S. aid agencies. It is exceedingly difficult to deliver aid in Mogadishu.
