Los Angeles Angels pitcher Nick Adenhart was among those killed in the crash in Fullerton, California, early Thursday morning. Fans gather around a memorial for Los Angeles Angels pitcher Nick Adenhart on Friday. "Major League Baseball is in mourning today upon the news of this tragedy that has taken Angels pitcher Nick Adenhart and two others," Selig said in a statement that accompanied the announcement. Authorities say he ran a red light and hit the car Adenhart was in, killing the pitcher, 20-year-old California State University student Courtney Stewart and law student Henry Pearson, 25. A fourth victim, 24-year-old John Wilhite, a former baseball player at California State, remained in critical condition Friday.
