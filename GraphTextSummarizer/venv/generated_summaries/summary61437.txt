Romero was the first person to be infected with Ebola outside West Africa in the current outbreak. She added that she was "willing to try, even if it means risking my life." Romero spent 30 days at the Carlos III Hospital in Madrid, the same hospital where she contracted the illness while helping to care for an infected missionary who had been brought back from West Africa. Authorities announced October 19 that tests showed that Romero no longer had Ebola, but she remained in the hospital while further tests were carried out and she recuperated.
