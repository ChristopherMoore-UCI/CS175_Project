Carrying on the work of Nelson Mandela It is Mandela's achievement as a universal icon that has always fascinated me most. Mandela said that prison gave him time to think about the times when he had failed to acknowledge people who had been kind to him. Mandela noted that there were qualities "in each one of us" that form the basis of our spiritual life and that we can change ourselves by observing our reactions to the unfolding of life. In an interview less than a year after he had stepped down as the country's first black president, Mandela shared with me reflections of how prison changed him. If Mandela has a global heir in the ongoing campaign against racism and the quest for human dignity it has to be Barack Hussein Obama.
