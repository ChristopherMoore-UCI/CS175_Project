Energy prices in America are by far the cheapest in the world, with Europeans paying more than double to fuel their cars and with natural gas costing four or five times as much in Europe and China. With 70% of everyday oil use going to transportation fuel, he said the impact of putting a much cheaper fuel such as natural gas into the market will be to bring the price of gasoline and diesel down. Pickens' plan is encapsulated in the Natural Gas Act, a bill with Democratic and Republican sponsors, that would provide tax credits to replace diesel-fuel burning truck engines with natural gas-powered engines; users of natural gas as a transportation fuel would pay fees that would make up for the lost government revenue. He said he still favors wind energy, which was a key part of the "Pickens Plan" he put forth in 2008, but the price of natural gas is now so low that wind projects can't compete economically, Pickens said. His method: He has a device that fuels his Honda Civic GX with natural gas from the pipes that serve his home.
