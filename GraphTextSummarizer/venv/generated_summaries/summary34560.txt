" Midgett, who used to work as a government auditor, wanted to make sure his discovery was salvaged, so he personally lobbied North Carolina state Sen. Marc Basnight. "History is the one thing we have that has a reasonable amount of certainty attached to it," said Joseph Schwarzer, director of North Carolina Maritime Museums. " Before the Corolla Beach discovery, the oldest shipwreck found along the state's coast was Queen Anne's Revenge, the presumed flagship of Blackbeard the pirate said to have run aground in 1718, according to the North Carolina Maritime Museums. The remains of the Corolla Beach wreck and some of its artifacts will be moved to the Graveyard of the Atlantic Museum on Hatteras Island, North Carolina. -- Ray Midgett hunts the Corolla beaches on the Outer Banks of North Carolina almost every day.
