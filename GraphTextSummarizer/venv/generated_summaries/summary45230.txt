I have not heard panic among businesses and city officials over the Disney announcement, despite the fact Disney World says it is the biggest single-site employer in the United States with 62,000. Like other cities, Orlando has seen big national chain closures like Linen-N-Things and Circuit City. Despite the downturn, Orlando officials believe their city has fared better than most. Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer will give his State of Orlando speech Wednesday, the same week the area's biggest employer could begin layoffs. Pom cut her four employees' hours instead of their jobs, lowered prices and extended hours to 24 hours on the weekends.
