At issue was whether a federal law blocking gun possession for those convicted of a "misdemeanor crime of domestic violence" should apply as well to someone convicted of a general misdemeanor, such as simple battery, which may have been committed against a spouse, child, or other relative. The Ginsburg-led majority, however, agreed with the government's position that Congress clearly wanted to include misdemeanor battery in domestic relationships, even if an abuser was not specifically convicted of that offense. The Supreme Court on Tuesday reinstated a federal ban on gun possession for people previously convicted of certain domestic violence misdemeanors. "The Supreme Court should follow the will of Congress and protect domestic violence victims and law enforcement officers who risk their lives stopping abusers," said Paul Helmke, head of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Handgun Violence. Hayes was charged with obstruction for lying about whether a gun was in the home, and with domestic battery, another misdemeanor.
