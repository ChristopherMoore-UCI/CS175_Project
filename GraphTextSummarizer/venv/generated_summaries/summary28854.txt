The unrest came shortly after Saudi state-run Ekhbariya television reported Monday that Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh had undergone two operations in Saudi Arabia and would return to Yemen after he recovers. The cease-fire deal followed two weeks of clashes between government and tribal forces in Yemen, where thousands of protesters have been pressuring Saleh to give up power since January. The fiercest clashes since anti-government demonstrations began in Taiz four months ago erupted overnight Monday between anti-government gunmen and members of government security forces, witnesses said. The official did not have an update on Saleh's prognosis, but did say it was "unclear if and when" he would be able to return to Yemen. Two opposition leaders in Yemen expressed support Monday for Hadi, the vice president who assumed temporary power when Saleh flew to Saudi Arabia.
