Burton worries about how inmates will deal with these new challenges and said she is constantly looking for new ways to help ex-offenders succeed. Burton ultimately got clean at a rehab facility in 1997 and realized she wanted to help other women offenders when they were released. In return, Burton asks that residents stay clean, attend 12-step meetings, and enroll in school, get drug treatment or find work. "Miss Burton made me want to change my life." Burton's program may be needed even more in the future. Amid her grief, she started smoking crack cocaine and ended up in prison -- beginning a pattern of addiction and incarceration that continued for years.
