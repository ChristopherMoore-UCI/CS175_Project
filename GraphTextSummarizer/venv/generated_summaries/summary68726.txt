The surge in children crossing the border has forced authorities to open three temporary shelters at military bases -- Lackland Air Force Base in Texas, Fort Sill in Oklahoma and Naval Base Ventura County in California. Children without parents have been streaming across the Mexico-United States border in unprecedented numbers. Hernandez said he formed an interagency committee led by first lady Ana Garcia to find the thousands of Honduran children living in temporary American shelters. Foreign Ministry spokesman Julio Lopez Tercero told CNN that the ministry, which is part of the interagency committee, plans to ask the U.S. government to allow children with parents in the United States to reunite in America. U.S. authorities estimate that between 60,000 and 80,000 children without parents will cross the border this year.
