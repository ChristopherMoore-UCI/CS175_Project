The build-up to the 2014 Winter Olympics has been blighted by concerns for safety but tennis star and Games Ambassador Maria Sharapova is convinced there is nothing to worry about. Despite all of this, Sharapova, who moved to Sochi at the age of two and went on to spend much of her childhood there, is expecting the Olympics to be a success. " Sharapova explained that watching the Olympics was a far bigger childhood memory for her than viewing any grand slam tennis competition, and revealed that figure skating and ice hockey were the sports she was most looking forward to following. Be it fears for security during the 18-day-long event or doubts about how gay people will be treated, there has been a sense of uneasiness surrounding those heading to Sochi. "Once I arrived here, I knew that all the athletes will feel extremely safe," the 26-year-old told CNN in Sochi.
