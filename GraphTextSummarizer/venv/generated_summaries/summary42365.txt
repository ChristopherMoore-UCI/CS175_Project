Retired Gen. Lino Cesar Oviedo died late Saturday night when the helicopter he was traveling in plunged to the ground in western Paraguay, officials said. READ RELATED: Paraguay gets cold shoulder from neighbors after impeaching president Franco declared three days of national mourning in honor of Oviedo, describing him as a "military hero" and praising his role in the February 3, 1989, coup that ended military dictator Gen. Alfredo Stroessner's 35-year rule. Investigators found the charred helicopter wreckage Sunday morning and discovered that Oviedo, his bodyguard and the chopper's pilot had perished, Paraguay's civil aviation authority said. "If they don't kill me, I am going to win the 2013 elections," Oviedo told Paraguay's La Nacion newspaper in 2011. Oviedo's sudden death in the heart of campaign season sent shock waves across Paraguay's political landscape less than three months before the presidential vote.
