The "court" told the commander that the fate of the other kidnapped Assyrians has yet to be decided by ISIS Sharia jurists. ISIS militants in northern Syria released 19 Assyrian Christian hostages Sunday, an activist group said. "ISIS has claimed for a long time to follow rules, and it claims that these Sharia courts will impose limits," he told CNN. "We in SOHR believe that the real number of people that had been killed by (ISIS) is higher than the number documented by SOHR because there are hundreds of missing and detainees inside the (ISIS) jails, loss of communication with about 1,000 men of al-Shaitaat tribe, (and) dozens of Kurds who have still been missing" since ISIS attacked the Syrian town of Kobani in September. "They can attempt to get credibility by showing that they follow rules and that they have some kind of transparent process that follows their particular implementation of Sharia law."
