" Suppression orders are relatively common in the state of Victoria, according to a recent study. In its annual report into the state of press freedom in Australia, the Media & Entertainment Arts Alliance referred to Victoria as "the suppression order capital of Australia. " "These laws are quite draconian," said Chris Nash, a professor of journalism at Monash University in Melbourne, and the former director of the Australian Centre for Independent Journalism. "If Assange ever comes back to Australia, you would expect that he would immediately be charged with breaking a suppression order." The report found that in the five years between 2008 and 2012, Victorian courts issued 1,501 suppression orders, including 281 in the Supreme Court.
