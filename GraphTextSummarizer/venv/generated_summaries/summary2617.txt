The original design -- which Alireza Taghaboni, lead designer at Next Office, claims also references traditional Iranian houses -- has earned the firm a nomination at the World Architecture Festival Awards. Traditional Iranian houses cope with these extremes by incorporating an airy living room for summer and a separate, cosy living room for winter months. Above a ground floor garage space and living quarters for a housekeeper, the top four floors comprise the home's communal areas. For the World Architecture Festival Award, the building will now go up against Vietnamese houses styled to become live-in plant pots, a concrete beach hut in Australia designed to withstand northern Queensland's tropical storms, and a Mexican villa that rises tree-like out of above its surrounding vegetation. The design was grounded in need rather than luxury, say Tehran-based studio Next Office, the architects behind the new building.
