Although the divorce isn't final, the couple has decided Jurica will raise his biological child, Cedric, and Tutera will raise his biological child, Cielo. After the two ended their relationship earlier this year, they reached a temporary custody agreement to raise their 2-month-old twins, a boy named Cedric and a girl named Cielo, separately. " Tutera and Jurica were united in a civil union in Vermont in September 2003. Tutera's ex, Ryan Jurica, discussed the controversial decision for the first time on HLN's Now In America. Jurica said it was Tutera's decision to split up the children, and he's still sad that this is the solution they've reached.
