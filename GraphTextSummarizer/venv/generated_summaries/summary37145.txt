-- A former porn actress who says she had a three-year intimate relationship with Tiger Woods posted text messages online Thursday that she says the golfer sent her last year. The Web site displayed 120 text messages purported to have been sent to her by Woods between July and October of last year. Woods publicly apologized for his extramarital affairs last month, but he has never disclosed the names of any of his lovers. At a news conference last month, which immediately followed Woods' televised apology, she called on the golfer to publicly acknowledge their relationship. The final series of texts suggest that the person communicating with Siwik-Daniels was upset with her because she was almost seen by the sender's agent during an encounter in early October.
