According to FDA spokeswoman Lauren Sucher, "The current level is in line with standards around the world, and FDA expects that properly manufactured milk products, whether made from raw milk or pasteurized milk, should not be affected. French cheese makers aren't the only ones on the front lines of the FDA's war on raw milk. Too bad for foodies, the FDA doesn't care that bacteria makes cheese. The food safety agency's concern is with the cheeses' two main ingredients: raw milk and bacteria. The FDA is testing for all kinds and giving out failing grades to cheeses that had too much of the non-toxigenic E. coli as well.
