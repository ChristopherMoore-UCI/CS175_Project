As a result, Kurdish Peshmerga forces sent reinforcements, including more troops and more military equipment to Kirkuk province and nearby disputed areas, and a standoff began between Kurdish forces and the Iraqi army. The attacks came a day after senior Iraqi security officials from the federal government and Kurdistan regional government agreed to form committees to find a solution to one of Iraq's most complicated issues: the disputed areas, including Kirkuk. The office of Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki announced Monday that an agreement had been reached between the central government and the Kurdistan regional government to pull Peshmerga and Iraqi army troops from Kirkuk and other disputed areas back their previous positions. An official with Iraq's Defense Ministry told CNN on Monday, on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue, that over the past three days, Iraqi army and Kurdish Peshmerga forces have sent reinforcements, including more troops and more military equipment around Kirkuk province and nearby disputed areas. The federal government formed the command a few months ago for military operations, including house searches, to maintain security, especially in disputed areas across the country.
