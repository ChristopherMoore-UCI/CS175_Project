If they start doubting the U.S. political situation, they will demand higher interest rates. We should also not forget the impact that U.S. rates have on the global economy. Currently the U.S. pays as much in interest as the total size of the economy of a medium-sized country like South Africa. Don't forget that almost 50% of U.S. debt is held by foreigners. If rates go up in the U.S. it is very easy to see a crisis for emerging markets as global money flows return to the U.S., where it gets a higher yield.
