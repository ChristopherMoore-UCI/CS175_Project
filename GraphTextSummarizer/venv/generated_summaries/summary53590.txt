Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, congressional Democrats to commemorate Mandela in South Africa Cruz is the only senator on the taxpayer-funded trip. When Cruz posted a note of condolence on his Facebook page last week, saying Mandela "will live in history as an inspiration for defenders of liberty around the globe," angry commenters blasted him for praising the South African leader, who died last week at 95. The December 10 service at the Johannesburg soccer stadium will feature U.S. political luminaries, including President Barack Obama and former Presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton. Cruz's dad is from Cuba but fled at the age of 18 and Cruz is a vocal critic of the Castro regime, especially of former President Fidel Castro. But then he said, "Good for him." "Sometimes the best way to be a profile in courage is by taking on the nut jobs," Feehery said, referring to the ugly comments Cruz got last week.
