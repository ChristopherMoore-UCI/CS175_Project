Allegations of sexual abuse by Catholic priests have spread across Europe, surfacing in countries including the Netherlands, France, Mexico, Italy, Ireland, the United States, Austria and Germany, home country of Pope Benedict XVI. " Cardinal Angelo Sodano, former Vatican secretary of state and dean of the College of Cardinals, did not specifically mention the sexual abuse scandal, but his remarks clearly referred to criticism leveled at church leaders. Bishop Georg Mueller admitted to having sexually abused an altar boy but said there were no other victims, said church spokesman Andreas Dingstad. Some have been critical of Catholic leaders including the pope, saying little action had been taken when he was a top Vatican official. Waves of victims have come forward, claiming they were victims of abuse by religious leaders and saying the church did little or nothing to stop it.
