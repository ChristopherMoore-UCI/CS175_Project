-- The body of a journalist who was hacked to death in southeastern Nepal was cremated Tuesday as businesses and public transportation in the town of Janakpur remained shut for a second day to protest the killing. Some of the assailants have ties to the Communist Party of Nepal, the largest party in Nepal's coalition government, according to New York-based Human Rights Watch. It asked the government to investigate the case and prosecute death threats against other journalists. During the decade-long civil war, Maoist forces under him carried out numerous attacks on journalists they believed were opposed to their cause, Human Rights Watch said. "Doing so will send a strong message that there will be no impunity for attacks against the media, nor for any serious crimes," the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights in Nepal said.
