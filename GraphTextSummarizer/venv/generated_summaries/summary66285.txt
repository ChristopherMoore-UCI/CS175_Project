While Vettel failed to make the final session on Saturday -- the second time in three race weekends so far the four-time world champion has suffered such fate -- championship leader Rosberg and 2008 titleholder Hamilton lined up for a shootout in Q3. Vettel has won the race for the past two years, but will start 10th on the grid after new teammate Daniel Ricciardo dropped from third in qualifying thanks to a 10-place penalty from last weekend's grand prix in Malaysia. Former Ferrari driver Felipe Massa will start seventh for Williams ahead of McLaren rookie Kevin Magnussen. Formula One has been criticized for becoming boring in recent years due to Sebastian Vettel's all-conquering Red Bull, but this season the Mercedes team has taken center stage following a raft of new rule changes. Hamilton, who won at Sepang after failing to finish the season-opener in Australia, will be ahead of Williams' Valtteri Bottas and Force India's Sergio Perez.
