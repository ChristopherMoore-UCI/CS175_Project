However, one woman who described herself as a Chinese person who was born in Hong Kong said, "Hong Kong people and Chinese people are basically the same. "We have a love-hate relationship with China," said Hong Kong entrepreneur Douglas Young, whose popular chain of stores selling furnishings and knick-knacks celebrates a unique Hong Kong style. "So I think there is nothing wrong with Hong Kong being a part of mainland China or being a Chinese city. Beijing has always promised to be hands-off, allowing the Hong Kong people to rule Hong Kong, but many still feel it has undue influence in local politics and in an electoral system that favors pro-Beijing candidates. All I am saying is that Hong Kong should maintain its differences in its regional identity." CNN asked people on the streets of Hong Kong what the difference was between Hong Kongers and the Chinese.
