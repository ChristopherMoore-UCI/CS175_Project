This week 33 years ago -- February 1, 1982, to be precise -- "Late Night with David Letterman" made its debut. If you were a celebrity who came on "Late Night" (his 1980s NBC show) or "The Late Show" (his CBS successor) simply to chat about your new movie or album or TV show, good luck to you. Letterman's final show will be May 20. Sometimes he used his guests for comedy bits, as when Steve Martin, allegedly on the set to promote a movie, deplored Letterman's questions and then had the Late Show Gospel Choir launch into a gospel song about himself. The talk show host announced in April that he was stepping down from "Late Night's" CBS successor, "The Late Show with David Letterman," in 2015.
