Brazil and Paraguay had been level on points at the top of the table of Wednesday's clash, and the visitors took the lead in the 25th minute when Salvador Cabanas's free-kick took a deflection off midfielder Elano and looped over Julio Cesar. Radamel Falcao Garcia netted the only goal in Medellin from close range in the 25th minute, scoring just his nation's seventh of the qualifiers as Peru crashed to an eighth successive defeat. The home side then went ahead four minutes after the interval with a scrappy goal as striker Nilmar scrambled the ball into the net after a fortuitous rebound off Paraguay's Julio Cesar Caceres when he tried to chest the ball down to Kaka.

Elano's Manchester City team-mate Robinho made amends with a superb volleyed equalizer four minutes before half-time from Daniel Alves' right-wing cross.
