The committee insisted it has legislative jurisdiction when it comes to the airline industry and its passengers, who help finance TSA operations through security fees. The committee said it has a responsibility to ensure that travelers, airport operations and U.S. commerce are not disrupted by TSA policies, procedures or operations. The full Transportation Committee is chaired by Florida Republican John Mica, who has been a tough critic of TSA -- whether led by Republican or Democratic administrations -- for its size, for long security lines at airports, and for screening policies he says have fallen short. But Pistole said he had no plans to attend, arguing the panel has no jurisdiction over TSA matters. He said TSA witnesses have testified at 38 hearings and provided 425 briefings for lawmakers during this session of Congress.
