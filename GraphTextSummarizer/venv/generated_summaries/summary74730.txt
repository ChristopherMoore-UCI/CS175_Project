For Oliseh, the 1998 World Cup was even better as he scored one of the goals of the tournament in a 3-2 win against Spain, though Nigeria would lose heavily to Denmark in round two. Oliseh helped Nigeria qualify for the 2002 World Cup, but was not selected for the finals. "Now it's more about team work, team dynamics, team schemes, things that are planned out. Oliseh's World Cup days may be long past, but come June and July he will be watching events in Brazil with avid interest. " While there have been many Nigerians and thousands of Africans to follow in Oliseh's footsteps in the 20 years since he made the move to Europe, African national teams have not developed in the same rapid manner.
