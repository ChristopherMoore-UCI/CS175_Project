The organization has documented incidents where soldiers say they were ordered to kill or torture protestors, went on looting rampages or witnessed other soldiers being shot or tortured for disobeying orders or desertion. One soldier said that during a protest in Damascus in April, a young conscript called Yusuf was shooting in the air and not at protestors. One man who says he served in the 4th Division said a brigadier general had instructed them to shoot at protestors in Damascus. The report, released Thursday, is titled, "By All Means Necessary," borrows the language allegedly used by officers as they issued orders to soldiers to put down protests. A soldier from the 9th Division recounted that on April 28 he was sent to a checkpoint to prevent protesters from marching on the capital, Damascus.
