Opinion: Gaza peace struggle drains me of hope What You Need to Know About the Israel-Hamas Blame Game CNN's Karl Penhaul reported from Gaza City; and Greg Botelho reported and wrote from Atlanta. " Al-Qidra, the Gaza health spokesman, said health care workers are struggling to deal with the relentless stream of dead and wounded. That includes a rocket that struck a neighborhood Thursday in Qiryat Gat, about 20 miles from Gaza, seriously injuring a man and setting a car afire, Israeli spokesman Mikey Rosenfeld said. And the animosity between Israel and Hamas, which controls Gaza, runs especially deep, with both sides accusing each other of putting each others civilians at risk. Almost immediately afterward, warning sirens went off around Israel -- with its military announcing later it had intercepted one rocket from Gaza, while two others landed in the Mediterranean Sea.
