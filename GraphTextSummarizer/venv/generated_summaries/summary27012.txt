The epitome of the state's exploitation of Brazilian football expertise was the repressive dictatorship's propaganda attempts to associate itself with the success of the Brazilian team in the 1970 World Cup finals. In this sense Brazilians are playing an important role in world football, not simply in their traditional role as brilliant players and passionate fans, but as protesters against and reformers of what many allege is a corrupt institution of global governance. In 1950, the last time Brazil hosted a World Cup, Brazilians seemed to conform more readily to the stereotype of festive, soccer-mad nationalists (still to be found in some international media). In 2014, Brazil's passion for football is still evident. Then-British Ambassador John Russell noted its importance as "football is the soul of Brazil."
