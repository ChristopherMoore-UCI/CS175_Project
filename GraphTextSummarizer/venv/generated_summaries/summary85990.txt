-- When her chance came, kidnapping victim Michelle Knight lit into Ariel Castro, the man who held her captive and raped her in his Cleveland home for a decade. Forensic psychiatrist Dr. Gregory Saathoff described the women's ordeal as a "complete and comprehensive captivity" and said when he first learned of Castro's crimes, he wrote, "The scope and magnitude of Ariel Castro's crimes is unprecedented." Ariel Castro's son: I won't visit dad in prison Wearing eyeglasses and an orange prison uniform, the shackled Castro characterized his crimes in a far gentler light than the book-length indictment handed down against him: "I'm not a violent person. Castro even claimed that no one cared enough about Knight to search for her after her after she disappeared.
