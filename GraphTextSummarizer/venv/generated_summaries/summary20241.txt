Instances of unwanted sexual contact and sexual assault increased by 36% in 2012, according to a report by the military's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office. "If you listen to the survivors of sexual trauma and sexual assaults," Gillibrand told CNN's Jake Tapper in an interview Wednesday, "they will tell you what needs to be done is the decision making has to be taken out of the chain of command in order to create transparency and accountability and have that decision maker be objective." During that hearing, victims of sexual assault testified to the backlash they faced from fellow service members and commanders after coming forward and the difficulties they had in securing mental health counseling. Subcommittee Chairwoman Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand is leading an effort to reform the way sexual assaults are addressed in the military and has proposed removing prosecutorial decision making out of the chain of command. The disqualifications were first reported by USA Today, which found that the troops involved were barred as a result of "infractions ranging from sexual assault to child abuse to drunken driving."
