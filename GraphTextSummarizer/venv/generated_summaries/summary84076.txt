-- A porn actress who was with actor Charlie Sheen in a New York hotel when, according to police, he became emotionally disturbed this week wants his probation on a Colorado assault conviction revoked because of the incident, her spokesman said Thursday. Christina Walsh, who has made adult films under the name Capri Anderson, will fly to Aspen, Colorado, on Monday to speak with Pitkin County officials about the incident, which left her "pretty shaken up," spokesman Kevin Blatt said. Walsh has not contacted anyone in the prosecutor's office about the incident or her plans to meet with them, according to Chief Deputy District Attorney Arnie Mordkin. Sheen's conviction there stemmed from his arrest last Christmas Day after his wife, Brooke Mueller, told Aspen police he threatened her with a knife at their holiday home. Without a criminal investigation -- which hasn't happened in New York -- a probation violation case could not be made, Mordkin said.
