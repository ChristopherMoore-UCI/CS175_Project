This weekend, as part of International Anti-Street Harassment Week, people from the United States to Australia plastered communities with portraits from Fazlalizadeh's "Stop Telling Women to Smile" series. Named for a self-portrait of Fazlalizadeh with the message "Stop Telling Women to Smile," the formidable portraits include sentiments meant to deter street harassment. "The way that it affects women and things they go through have pretty much the same theme: Women are out for consumption and for your enjoyment," Fazlalizadeh told CNN. Fazlalizadeh has spent the past year and a half traveling the country speaking to women and creating new posters based on their experiences of gender-based street harassment. In cities like New York, Washington and Chicago, women reported men groping or leering at them on public transportation.
