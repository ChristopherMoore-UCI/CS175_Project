The third "Night at the Museum" sees Ben Stiller return as a night security guard at the American Museum of Natural History. Williams starred in the family movie franchise from the start, portraying former President Theodore Roosevelt. After that, there's "Avengers: Age of Ultron" and the "Divergent" sequel "Insurgent" to look forward to in 2015 -- and both now have new trailers. If the trailer Marvel released in October didn't give you enough chills, James Spader's opening cackle as the psychotic villain Ultron will probably do the trick. "Secret of the Tomb" is the third movie in the "Night at the Museum" franchise, and it's one of the four completed projects Williams left behind when he died in August.
