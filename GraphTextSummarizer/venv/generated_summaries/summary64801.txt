Todd Weber, incident manager of the multistate outbreak for the CDC. -- Patients whose fungal tests are negative may still be at risk in a meningitis outbreak, as the fungus involved can be difficult to detect, federal health officials said Thursday. Exserohilum is new territory for health officials, as it's not typically seen, Weber told reporters Thursday. Cases of the non-contagious fungal meningitis rose to 170 in 11 states as of Thursday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. Patients who received the injections should remain vigilant for "at least several months after injection," Weber said.
