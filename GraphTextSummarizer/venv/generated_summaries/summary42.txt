The story teeter-totters between the exiled Thor crash-landing in New Mexico -- where he's immediately run over by Natalie Portman's storm-chasing astrophysicist, Jane -- and Asgard, where he vies with half-brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) to vanquish the Ice Giants (not a hockey team) and win the respect of their father (Anthony Hopkins, gamely trying to inject some Lear-like gravitas while modeling an eye patch and several bespoke bronze helmets). In Stan Lee's resurrection, his father, Odin, punished Thor's recklessness by condemning him to a double life as Dr. Donald Blake, a physician who would pick up the cudgel when evil threatened mankind. An unholy combination of a Vegas penthouse and Disney palazzo, Asgard is a computer-generated Valhalla with gold fixtures and diaphanous walls revealing Hubblesque views of the cosmos. It should hook legions of kids, who can look forward to years more Thor ­-- probably bigger and better ­-- in the future. "Thor" is on much safer ground here on Earth.
