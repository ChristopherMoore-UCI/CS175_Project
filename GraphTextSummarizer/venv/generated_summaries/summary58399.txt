On Tuesday, the women's team won its ninth crown by beating Notre Dame 79-58. Player of the year Breanna Stewart scored 21 points to lead UConn (40-0) while Stefanie Dolson tallied 17 points, 16 rebounds and seven assists. UConn moved one national title ahead of the University of Tennessee for the most women's championships. Connecticut is the only school to have won both men's and women's titles in the same year, having also done so in 2004. It was the first time two undefeated teams met in the national title game.
