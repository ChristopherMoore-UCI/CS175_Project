Clusters of small white flowers with a rich orange-blossom scent bloom from late spring to midsummer. For a head start, plant seedlings in spring, keep them moist, and deadhead flowers to encourage more. Camellia, with its glossy evergreen leaves and large cupped flowers, blooms when few other plants doâ€”in late winter to early spring. As American as fireworks in July, official state flowers honor the natural diversity of our country. A deciduous tree with glossy leaves that follow showy spring flowers, it grows to a modest 25 feet tall, making it a good candidate for a backyard orchard in warmer zones.
