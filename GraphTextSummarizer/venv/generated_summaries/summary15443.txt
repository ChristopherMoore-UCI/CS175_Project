"Last year, mainland China announced a ban on sharks fin at official banquets and Hong Kong also banned shark fin, bluefin tuna and black moss (at official functions). "Then China decided to destroy confiscated ivory and Hong Kong will follow next month. Cheryl Lo, a spokesperson for the World Wide Fund for Nature who is based in Hong Kong, told CNN she is "very happy" that the announcement comes with a long list of protected species. "We have lobbied against the selling of shark fin in Hong Kong for a long time with no results," said Lo. " Hong Kong will burn 28 tonnes of seized ivory on May 15, the largest stockpile to ever be destroyed.
