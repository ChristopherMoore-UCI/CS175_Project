Contrary to public opinion, rats can actually save lives -- Apopo's rats have actually saved thousands. Despite the creatures' reputation for thieving and spreading disease, Weetjens has proven that rats can be every bit as heroic as people. Rats also have the advantage of being too lightweight to trip off a mine (Apopo boasts zero casualties so far). Tanzania-based NGO Apopo, however, thinks rats make excellent gifts. Aside from those fatalities, however, Weetjens notes that one of the most detrimental influences of mine fields is the amount of land they take up. "[Affected] communities live in some kind of terror situation, where the most necessary, basic things -- like getting water and firewood or farming their land -- puts their life at peril.
