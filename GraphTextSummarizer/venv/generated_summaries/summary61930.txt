President Obama has racked up an impressive series of foreign policy victories and promises kept: He ordered a daring raid that resulted in the death of Osama bin Laden and has taken out scores of top al Qaeda leaders, including lead recruiter Anwar al-Awlaki. Polls show the public backs Obama's pragmatic, results-based approach to foreign policy. Mitt Romney originally built his argument against Obama's foreign policy by attacking the new START treaty -- an agreement supported by every living Republican secretary of state and our entire current military leadership. In addition, the field has tried to turn the phrase "leading from behind" into an overarching criticism of Obama's foreign policy. The candidates continue to take any position that will distance them from the president and allow them to sound tough -- but it's putting them out of step with military leaders and nonpartisan national security experts.
