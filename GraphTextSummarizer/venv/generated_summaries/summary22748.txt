When we have a few precious minutes of downtime, we fill it on our phones, swiping from email to Facebook to "Candy Crush" and back. "My sense is that so many of us are racing around these days, from text to phone call to Twitter to breaking-news update, that we never have time to collect ourselves, to direct ourselves towards what we love," Iyer told CNN in an email. One of the leading proponents of this movement is essayist and travel writer Pico Iyer, whose recent TED talk, "The Art of Stillness," has been viewed almost a million times. "It can restore our sanity and balance; it can remind us of what we really want to be doing -- and what we care most about," said Iyer, who was inspired in part by a woman he sat next to on a plane who ignored her seatback screen and sat quietly for 12 hours without talking, reading, sleeping or listening to music. Iyer believes his talk (and related book) have struck a chord with people who feel overwhelmed by the demands of the digital age.
