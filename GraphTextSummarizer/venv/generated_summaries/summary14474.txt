And I've seen other live orchestra performances with "Star Wars" images, but nothing like this -- I mean this really works, because it was edited specifically to bring out the emotion. Anthony Daniels, who has played and voiced the golden protocol droid "C3PO" in every film and most of the spinoffs, provides live narration -- and another reason for the "Star Wars" fans in the audience, especially those waving lightsabers and dressed as everything from sand people to Imperial stormtroopers, to cheer mightily, as they did the night I interviewed Lucas. But while he's enthusiastic about the new touring show "Star Wars In Concert," it wasn't his idea, and when I talked with him before the first Los Angeles performance this week, he kept giving the credit to others. George Lucas says he was "completely surprised" by "Star Wars in Concert. [Lucas calls over Howard Roffman, the president of Lucas Licensing.]
