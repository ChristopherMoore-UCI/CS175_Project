The suit said that the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services conducted an evaluation of the center in November and found a lack of supervision, which "allowed for inappropriate touching between minor students."

" When children are around 2, parents can discuss body parts and the differences between boys and girls, she said. Adults who come across children exploring their bodies in inappropriate ways should step in immediately and stop the behavior, she suggested.
