The U.S. government is scheduled to send another group of undocumented immigrants to Murrieta for processing on Friday, the union official for Border Patrol agents said. Many never show up and join the nation's 11 million undocumented population, says the National Border Patrol Council, the union representing Border Patrol agents. " Other protesters told CNN affiliate KGTV said they wanted immigrants to follow the legal process to enter the United States. Seventeen of the immigrants were taken to the Boulevard station in eastern San Diego County, Zermeno said. The buses instead took the 140 or so undocumented immigrants to U.S. processing centers at least 80 miles away, in the San Diego and El Centro areas, federal officials say.
