" When he worked with a revolving door of directors on Hollywood films, Gosling said, it wasn't satisfying. Winding Refn, like Gosling, was placed in a prime position to do "more of a Hollywood film" after the critical acclaim and commercial success of "Drive." He could have had his pick of projects, but instead he took a break for a few years, until he found a handful of films by auteur-type directors that would break convention and would mean something to him: "Blue Valentine," with director Derek Cianfrance (with whom he reteamed on this year's "The Place Beyond the Pines"), and "Drive." But then they had an "awful meeting," probably because Winding Refn had the flu, and Gosling wanted to get out of there as quickly as possible. But for Gosling, it was one way to put an end to any idea that he was just a Hollywood heartthrob (or sexy Internet meme), his pretty-boy face as bruised and beaten up as possible on the film's poster, a trademark of Winding Refn's.
