Dozens of Atlanta public school educators falsified standardized tests or failed to address such misconduct in their schools, Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal said a week ago. "I've read the investigative report from cover to cover, and nowhere does it identify anyone as saying I encouraged, directed or condoned cheating," Augustine said last week. He was unveiling the results of a state investigation that confirmed widespread cheating in city schools dating as far back as 2001. Investigators compared the results with test results from other Georgia schools and found that such patterns did not occur normally, Deal said. The principals and teachers accused of cheating will also be referred to the Professional Standards Commission to determine whether they will be allowed to keep their credentials, according to Davis.
