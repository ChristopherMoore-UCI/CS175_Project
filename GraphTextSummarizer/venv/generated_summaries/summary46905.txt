The lawsuit alleges qualified applicants were denied positions such as cashiers, as well as for various management positions. EEOC Chairperson Jacqueline A. Berrien said the federal agency will protect the rights of job applicants, and that "excluding qualified individuals from employment because of their race or ethnicity or in retaliation for exercising protected rights are fundamental violations." "The EEOC's allegations are contrary to our profound respect for and commitment to our team of experienced and knowledgeable associates, and we are determined to prove them wrong," Mike Rowland, vice president for human resources, was quoted as saying in the statement. The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas. The EEOC also believes that managers at some stores retaliated against employees who were in opposition to the discriminatory practices and in some scenarios fired or forced employees to resign.
