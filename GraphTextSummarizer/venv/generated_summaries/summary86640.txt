Zolisa Bodlani, one of the striking miners' representatives, and the National Union of Mineworkers said the workers have accepted the Lonmin mining company's offer of about 9,000 rand (about $1,084) a month for general minimum wage workers and about 11,000 rand (about $1,325) a month for rock drill operators. "No longer will the view that unions will continue to support the ANC uncritically be supported by evidence on the ground," Shubane told CNN on Tuesday. " South Africa has witnessed a vicious rivalry between two unions -- the dominant and established National Union of Mineworkers and the splinter Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union, which has been encroaching on the former's role. The National Union of Mineworkers is a close ally of the country's ruling African National Congress (ANC). Political analyst Khehla Shubane said the power of the ANC is perceived to rest on the power of unions.
