The veteran state prosecutor's relentless grilling of Pistorius -- on trial for the murder of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp on Valentine's Day last year -- has riveted people around the world to their TV sets, and has sparked a debate about whether Nel's no-holds-barred tactics have crossed the line. CNN legal expert Kelly Phelps says that while Nel's strategy -- to unnerve the accused and destabilize his version of events -- was valid, showing the world a bloody photo of Steenkamp was "unnecessary and gratuitous. On Wednesday Nel took the defense by surprise when he played a video, taken just months before Steenkamp's death, of Pistorius shooting a watermelon at a firing range with friends and describing the impact as a "zombie-stopper." It exploded," Nel told Pistorius, before showing the court -- and the multitudes around the world watching on live TV -- a grisly photograph of Steenkamp's wounded head, her hair soaked in blood and tissue from the impact of the bullet that tore through her skull. "I think he knows that the state's case is mostly circumstantial, and it was always going to rely heavily on cross-examining Pistorius," Phelps said.
