But it has not received much national television coverage compared to cases like Baby Lisa, the 11-month-old missing Missouri girl. Retired police officer and child advocate Paul Penzone told KPHO that he noticed the lack of national media coverage. That case has received daily national news coverage and has been featured on the cover of People magazine. In the first three days after the girl went missing, Glendale police wrapped up a grid search of her neighborhood and moved into the second phase of their investigation where they are following up on tips they receive from the public. She was last seen wearing a white t-shirt, blue jean shorts and pink sandals.
