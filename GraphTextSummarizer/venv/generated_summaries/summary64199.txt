" Gray, whom Cahall thanked in his speech for his "care, leadership and support," had some strong words for Westboro Baptist Church after the controversial congregation threatened to protest Woodrow Wilson for hosting a pride day. Both hands trembled nervously throughout the speech he struggled to deliver on Wednesday before the student body at Woodrow Wilson High School in Washington, D.C. Odd, since Cahall is the school's principal, and has spoken in front of these very same students countless times before. "I am a proud gay man that just happens to be the principal of Wilson High School," he said to thunderous applause. Cahall said that he was inspired to come out by openly gay professional athletes Jason Collins and Michael Sam.
