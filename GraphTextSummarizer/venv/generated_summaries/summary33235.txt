A senior adviser to President Barack Obama said it will be tough for someone like Jeb Bush, who hasn't campaigned for elected office in 12 years, to wage a national presidential bid in today's political climate, adding a comparison of the former Florida governor to a fictional ex-criminal from "The Wire." Critics argue that Bush will find himself behind other prospective candidates when it comes to maneuvering the fast-paced, social media-driven machine of modern campaigning. "Jeb Bush, it's been a long time since he's run for office. He made his big announcement this month on Twitter and Facebook, and plans to release an e-book as well as thousands of emails from his time as governor. The documents indicate that Bush was an avid fan of email and even responded to hundreds of constituents and job applicants himself.
