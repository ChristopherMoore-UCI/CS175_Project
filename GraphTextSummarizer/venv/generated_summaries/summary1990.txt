-- Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner was released from a Buenos Aires hospital Sunday, days after undergoing surgery there, state media reported. "The president is in very good spirits and due to her excellent recovery she will be released from the hospital," government spokesman Alfredo Scoccimarro told reporters. On Sunday, doctors said she must follow strict rest for 30 days and avoid air travel. The state-run Telam news agency reported that Fernandez left the hospital Sunday afternoon. Last weekend, doctors diagnosed Fernandez, 60, with a subdural hematoma and said she needed to take a month off of work.
