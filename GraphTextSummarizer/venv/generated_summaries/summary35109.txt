The attack comes 10 days after a bombing killed 23 Coptic Christians outside the Church of the Two Saints in Alexandria, Egypt, an attack that unnerved Christians and led to increased security. They base their theology on the teachings of the Apostle Mark, who introduced Christianity to Egypt, according to St. Takla Church in Alexandria, the capital of Coptic Christianity. About 9 percent of Egypt's 80 million residents are Coptic Christians. The religion is known for its rift with other Christians in the fifth century over the definition of the divinity of Jesus Christ. -- A policeman fatally shot a Christian man and wounded five other Christians Tuesday in an attack on a train in Egypt
