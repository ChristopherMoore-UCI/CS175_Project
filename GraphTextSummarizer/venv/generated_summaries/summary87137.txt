"There are many challenges for grandparents taking on grandchildren," Kaslow said. "Many grandparents are older when they take on grandchildren, so you may not have the energy you had as a parent in your 20s and 30s to be running around after toddlers. The unexpected demands of caring for grandchildren full time may have health consequences, Kaslow said. Kaslow said it is common for grandparents to feel the stress of financial demands when they're a parent the second time around. "It can be associated with more serious physical problems like elevated blood pressure or things that put you at risk for heart disease or stroke."
