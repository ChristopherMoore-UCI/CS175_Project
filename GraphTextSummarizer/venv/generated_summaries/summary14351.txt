In the southern Israeli town of Sderot, a frequent target of militant rocket fire from Gaza, Israelis marked the Gaza war anniversary with a release of balloons with "messages of hope" from Israeli children to children of Gaza, organizers said. Carrying Palestinian flags and signs calling for an end to "the Gaza siege" and "Israeli aggression," rally participants said they were trying to draw attention to the plight of Palestinians in Gaza. On the Israel side, Knesset member and United Arab Party Chairman Ibrahim Sarsour called the continued blockade of Gaza "an ongoing tragedy for the Palestinian people" and called for it to be lifted to give people "a chance to live in dignity." Thursday's march coincides with the first anniversary of Israel's 23-day offensive against Hamas, launched in an attempt to stop militant rocket fire into southern Israel. -- Hundreds of protesters from the Gaza Strip and Israel converged on both sides of the main border crossing Thursday in an organized rally to call for the end of the economic blockade of Gaza maintained by Israel and Egypt.
