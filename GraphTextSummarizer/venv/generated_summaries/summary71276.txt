Someone shot me with a pellet gun," the man, later identified as Xavier Hawkins, said in video recorded by CNN affiliate WJLA, before he knelt in obvious pain. A man dressed as Santa Claus and giving away gifts to needy children in Washington was shot by a pellet gun Tuesday in the midst of his rounds, according to police. Santa was right about what happened, D.C. Metropolitan Police Department spokeswoman Gwendolyn Crump said, adding that the preliminary investigation suggests the assailant did use a pellet gun in the attack. WJLA also reported Hawkins is planning to participate in the toy giveaway again next year and said he has already forgiven the attacker. "I just thank God that I'm alive," Hawkins told WJLA after his release from the hospital.
