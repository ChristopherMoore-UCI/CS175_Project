Let's see the American government use those against non-Muslims too." Asharq Al Awsat Tariq Al Hameed, writing in the Arabic newspaper Asharq Al Awsat, says: "Since the fall of the Mubarak regime, the real problem in Egypt has been having double standards with the street, which is moving without leaders of public opinion. The U.S. has increased embassy security worldwide after the assault that killed the U.S. ambassador to Libya, Chris Stevens and three other consular officials, and violent protests at U.S. embassies in Egypt and Yemen. "Unfortunately such [a] job is made easier by a very small minority of Muslims who advocate violence or the use of force to impose their views on others -- others here being not only non-Muslims, but also Muslims who do not agree with them, meaning the vast majority of the followers of the faith. "In the age of hatred that erases all logic, it is not a coincidence that a mosque has been desecrated in France, and Muslims in the U.S. have been warned of a 'holocaust'. "In Islam and for Muslims, nothing justifies violence and spilling blood of innocent people." Addustour
