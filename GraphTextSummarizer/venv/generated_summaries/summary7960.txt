Investigators had been looking into whether Walgreens had given people enrolled in government-run health programs -- such as Medicare, Medicaid and Tricare (for military families) -- $25 gift cards if they moved their prescriptions over to Walgreens' pharmacies, according to a Justice Department news release. -- Walgreens will pay governments $7.9 million in a settlement reached amid allegations the drugstore chain illegally paid kickbacks so that prescriptions would be transferred to its pharmacies, the U.S. Justice Department announced Friday. "This case represents the government's strong commitment to pursuing improper practices in the retail pharmacy industry that have the effect of manipulating patient decisions," said Stuart F. Delery, acting assistant attorney general with the U.S. Justice Department. Federal prosecutors from California and Michigan, the U.S. Justice Department's commercial litigation branch, the National Association of Medicaid Fraud Control Units and the U.S. Health and Human Service Department's inspector general participated in the joint investigation. The drugstore chain's advertisements typically noted that such offers didn't apply to those insured via Medicaid, Medicare and similar programs.
