The latest, promising data speeds equivalent to a standard broadband internet connection, is considered the fourth -- hence 4G. Although 4G coverage is still limited and, some critics argue, it may struggle to fulfil the ambitious claims of network operators, it is likely to make a difference to the millions of people who already channel great chunks of their lives through their mobile phones. As demand for 4G grows, networks will be looking to dedicate more frequencies to their coverage. A new generation of the cellular network -- already rolled out in many parts of Asia and the U.S. -- 4G promises to supercharge mobile internet connections across the UK and parts of Europe in the coming year. 4G phone operators have been able to increase network speeds by accessing a broader spectrum of transmission frequencies. Speed is the essence of 4G. Since global mobile networks began rolling out in the 1980s, a new generation of handsets has evolved roughly every decade.
