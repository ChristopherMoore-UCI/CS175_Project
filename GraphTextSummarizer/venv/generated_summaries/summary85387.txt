Each week this fall, whether it be the foot-fetish videos that apparently involve him and his wife or his constant barrage of brash talk, Ryan has been the most talked about figure in New York sports. He called his playoff matchup against future Hall of Fame quarterback Peyton Manning of the Indianapolis Colts "personal," then made the same statement this week about facing New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick on Sunday. "He's a sideshow to everyone outside of New York," Evan Roberts, a host of the sports-radio station WFAN, told his audience during a spirited debate about the pros and cons of Ryan's constant chatter. You won't get Bill Belichick to do that." Belichick, the three-time Super Bowl winner in New England, is the perfect contrast. "I don't have a whole lot to say, so let's open it up for questions," said Ryan, the man whose words have been the talk of professional football since he became the head coach of the New York Jets.
