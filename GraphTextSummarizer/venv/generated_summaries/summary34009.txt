A majority of New York City voters rated Mayor Bill de Blasio positively in a new survey conducted largely before the shooting of two NYPD officers this weekend that put de Blasio in the national spotlight. She leads Jeb Bush, the former GOP governor of Florida; Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie by anywhere from 26 points with Christie to 35 points with Paul. The mayor is underwater statewide, however, with 36% of New York state voters viewing him unfavorably, while 33% have a favorable view and another 29% say they haven't heard enough to decide. But the Quinnipiac poll showed that through Sunday New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, also a Democrat, was widely seen as the more influential of the two in the state, with three-fourths of respondents rating him as such. New York Sen. Charles Schumer, who is up for reelection this cycle, is also widely popular, with 62% of the state's voters viewing him favorably.
