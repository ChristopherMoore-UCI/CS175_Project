-- Troubled singer Amy Winehouse has been admitted to a London hospital after suffering a bad reaction to medication, her representative said Tuesday. The Grammy-winning Winehouse has suffered a string of health problems in recent years, many related to her battles with drug addiction. Winehouse won five Grammy awards earlier this year -- three for "Rehab," as well as Album of the Year and Best New Artist. Winehouse, 25, went to the private London Clinic on Sunday, said her spokesman, Chris Goodman. Another bad reaction to medication prompted Winehouse to enter a London hospital in July, but she was discharged the next day.
