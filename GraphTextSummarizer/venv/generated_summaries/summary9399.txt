Golf's greatest years By dominating golf as he did that season, Palmer continued a trend started by Vardon in the first year of the 20th century -- following in the footsteps of golf legends such as Bobby Jones and blazing a trail for the likes of Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods. Nicklaus, who had denied Palmer victory at the 1962 U.S. Open, was at the peak of his powers. That year Palmer went on to claim his second British Open title at Royal Troon -- "certainly one of my best Opens" -- as he finished 12 under par on the seaside links to win by six from Kel Nagle. Palmer believes the 36-year-old, who won his invitational tournament at Bay Hill last month to end a PGA Tour title drought dating back to 2009, "can return to his best" in 2012. But victories in six other PGA Tour events, as well as winning the Vardon Trophy (named after the famous English golfer Harry Vardon) for the U.S. circuit's low scoring average, rounded off an incredible year.
