-- Five Americans arrested in Pakistan on suspicion of plotting terror attacks claimed again Tuesday they are being tortured in jail. The five are identified as Ahmed Abdullah Minni, Umar Farooq, Aman Hassan Yemer, Waqar Hussain Khan and Ramy Zamzam. The five first claimed at a court hearing in January that they had been tortured in jail. They are accused by Pakistani authorities of being connected to terror organizations and plotting attacks. At that time Muhammad Ameer Khan Rokhri, the former defense lawyer for the accused, said the court ordered medical checkups for them.
