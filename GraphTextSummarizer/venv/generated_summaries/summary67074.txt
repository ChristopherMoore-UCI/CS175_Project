-- A California judge ordered Wednesday that two Fullerton police officers stand trial in the beating death last year of Kelly Thomas, a homeless man with a mental illness. Ron Thomas, the father of Kelly Thomas, told reporters after the ruling that the Fullerton Police Department "is full of good officers. "This is a hard thing to file, a case of this nature against police officers, because we have tremendous law enforcement in Orange County," Rackauckas told reporters. " Defense attorneys objected when Rackauckas continued his comments and started speaking of the "awesome power" with which police officers are entrusted. The prosecutor discontinued that line of argument and began addressing other topics after the judge told him: "The court does understand the powers that police officers have, and the level of trust that society places in police officers.
