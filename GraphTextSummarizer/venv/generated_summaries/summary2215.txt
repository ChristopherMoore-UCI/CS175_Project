In the state of Saxony, to the south, many areas remain under water, the European Commission said, and transport, electricity and water supply are still disrupted. Environmental campaign group Greenpeace said in a statement that although the dams should in theory withstand the rising water, a report published by the Hungarian Academy of Science last year suggested some toxic sludge could be washed into the water system through the ground water. Concern is also growing that the surging Danube might break into a reservoir containing toxic waste in Almasfuzito, near Komarom, potentially leading to water pollution. But aerial footage taken by CNN showed swaths of the outlying areas and beyond under feet of muddy brown water. As river levels drop, attention is now turning to the clean-up, said Czech fire service spokeswoman Nicole Zaoralova.
