South African police colonel J.G. Vermeulen took the stand to discuss marks on a cricket bat and a bent steel plate found in the bathroom door after the athlete shot model Reeva Steenkamp on Valentine's Day last year. Vermeulen told the court there were footprints consistent with police shoes on the bathroom door at one point and photos of this were shown. Pistorius, the first double-amputee to run in the Olympic Games, regularly wears prosthetic legs. Close-up photographs of the damaged door were shown in court, as well as scuffs on the autographed cricket bat, prompting a Tweet from former South African test cricketer Herschelle Gibbs: â€ He admits killing Steenkamp, 29, by shooting her through a locked bathroom door in his house.
