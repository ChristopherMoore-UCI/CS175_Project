The Netherlands play Moldova on Friday night before hosting Sweden on Tuesday. The Manchester City midfielder was involved in a tackle that broke the leg of Newcastle United's Hatem Ben Arfa in Sunday's English Premier League match at Eastlands. -- Nigel De Jong has been dropped from the Netherlands squad for their Euro 2012 qualifying matches against Moldova and Sweden. It is not the first time a tackle from De Jong has caused controversy after his high challenge on Spain's Xabi Alonso during the World Cup final. The 25-year-old was not shown a card for the challenge, nor did the referee deem it to be a foul, but Newcastle later confirmed that Ben Arfa had suffered a double fracture.
