Bogota Councilman Marco Fidel Ramirez said the video should be banned from Colombian airwaves because the smoking and the touching in bed violate a law that prohibits broadcast material that damages the "moral integrity" of children. "I think the message that Shakira is sending to the youth and children around the world is a message that sells a lifestyle and promotes a particular orientation, that in my opinion, does not reflect the views of most Colombians," Ramirez said. Asked if he would back the ban of dozens of other artists who depict sex, smoking or drinking in their music or videos, Ramirez said Shakira's case is different because so many children look up to her. Shakira does her trademark hip-shaking and gyrating in the video, but also shares scenes in bed with Rihanna and smoking cigars. She has a social responsibility, Ramirez said, to not repeat stereotypes of women in music.
