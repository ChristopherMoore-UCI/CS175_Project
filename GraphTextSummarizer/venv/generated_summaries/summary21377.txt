The daughter of General Aung San, a hero of Burmese independence, Suu Kyi has repeatedly challenged Myanmar's regime over the years. "A good communication system is essential to our endeavour to set up a people's network for democracy that will span the whole world," Suu Kyi said in a message on the site, which went live Sunday. Parliament began a day after opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy launched its first official website. The regime refused to allow international monitors to oversee the elections and would not allow international journalists to cover the voting from inside the country. -- Myanmar convened its first parliament in more than two decades on Monday in the capital, Naypyidaw.
