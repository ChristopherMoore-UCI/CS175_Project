-- Ireland's Kevin O'Brien scored the fastest century in cricket World Cup history to help his country claim a sensational three-wicket Group B victory over England in Bangalore. As well as O'Brien's remarkable innings, Ireland's victory marked the highest second innings run chase in World Cup history -- beating Sri Lanka's 313 against Zimbabwe in New Zealand in 1992 Speaking after collecting his man-of-the-match award, O'Brien -- who also played in Ireland's famous 2007 World Cup win over Pakistan -- said: "I don't think it's quite sunk in. Trott's score of 92 meant he joined team-mate Kevin Pietersen and West Indies legend Viv Richards in taking just 21 innings to achieve that feat. O'Brien reached the magical three figures in just 50 balls, smashing the previous best mark of 66 deliveries set by Australia's Matthew Hayden against South Africa in 2007.
