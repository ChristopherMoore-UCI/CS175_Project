Weeks published a report on the Liberian government's involvement in training child soldiers in 1998 and was then forced into exile in the U.S. Among the violence and tragedy, new leaders emerged, including youth activist Kimmie Weeks. At the age of 9, civil war entered Weeks' life. Since the war in Liberia he has dedicated his life to saving the country's children from war and its devastating long-term effects with Youth Action International. The experience of finding other children his age engaged in the fighting, and being so close to death himself, was a profound one.
