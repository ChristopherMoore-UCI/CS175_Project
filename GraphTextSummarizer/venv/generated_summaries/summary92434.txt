The San Francisco-based car service announced Tuesday via e-mail and blog that it will branch into helicopters, offering to whisk wealthy clients from the throngs of Manhattanites to the relative calm of the Hamptons. So why not take to the skies in an Uber Chopper? Uber, a service that dispatches cars for hire using mobile apps, is offering on-demand helicopters from Manhattan to East Hampton. " Though the service just began Wednesday and flights are not booked far in advance, Mohrer says he expects full flights, judging by the media buzz and feedback from clients. "It's a lot better than the three to four hours it can take [to drive] on a busy weekend," says Josh Mohrer, general manager of Uber New York. " For the New York City helicopters, Uber paired with Liberty Helicopters, a private company with several dozen choppers in the area.
