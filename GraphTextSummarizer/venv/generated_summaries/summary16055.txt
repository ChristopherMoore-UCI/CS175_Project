Meanwhile in the two Bundesliga fixtures played Sunday, mid-table Werder Bremen drew 0-0 with bottom side Braunschweig while Schalke are up to fifth on 31 points after beating 16th place Hamburg 3-0. Former Arsenal striker Gervinho put Roma back in front on the hour mark drilling a low shot through a crowd of players before Francesco Totti guaranteed all three points -- the veteran midfielder putting away a 83rd minute penalty following a foul on Greek international Vasileios Torosidis. Roma romped to a third successive league win on Sunday to close the gap with league leaders Juventus to six points. Adam Ljajic opened the scoring on the stroke of halftime tapping in Gervinho's cutback, but it wasn't long before Verona were back on level terms as Emil Hallfredsson slotted home four minutes after the break. Cote d'Ivoire striker Gervinho provided the attacking flair with a goal and an assist as Serie A's second placed side won 3-1 on the road at Hellas Verona.
