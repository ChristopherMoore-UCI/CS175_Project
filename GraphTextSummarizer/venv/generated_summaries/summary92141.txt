-- Insurgents were able to use a mass-market software program to view live feeds from U.S. military Predator drones monitoring targets in Iraq, a U.S. official indicated to CNN Thursday. But a U.S. official with knowledge of CIA and military UAV missions told CNN the drones used in Pakistan missions use encrypted feeds and are not vulnerable to hacking like the military drones used in Iraq. Before the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, it is believed Saddam Hussein was able to monitor drone feeds. The U.S. military and intelligence operations use pilotless drones in Iraq and Afghanistan both for surveillance and to fire missiles at targets. The Iraqis "located and downloaded the unencrypted satellite feed from U.S. military UAVs," a 2005 CIA report surmised.
