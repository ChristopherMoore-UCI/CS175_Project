About 10 suspected terrorists were "neutralized" -- which means killed or taken captive, according to the French military -- in the same operation, said Col. Gilles Jaron, another French military spokesman. He was killed Wednesday night in a French military operation, which was coordinated with Malian forces, in the Gao region in Mali, French military officials said. French troops killed a senior jihadist leader in northern Mali -- a man purportedly behind a number of high-profile attacks and kidnappings, and ambitious and brazen enough that the United States had issued a $5 million reward for him -- the French military announced Thursday. "One of the things that proves he was a senior chief (in the group) is that when he got killed ... he was accompanied by a dozen (fighters) who were also ensuring his security," French Defense Ministry spokesman Sacha Mandel said. A month later, the group, also known as MUJWA, abducted three aid workers from a refugee camp in western Algeria.
