QPR's website said Leicester City forward David Nugent and QPR captain skipper Clint Hill did their best to chase away the rodent, before play resumed. But that's what happened on Saturday at a second-tier English football match between Queens Park Rangers and Leicester City at Loftus Road in London. Squirrels seem particularly fond of the Loftus Road grass -- in March 2012 one turned up when QPR played Everton in an English Premier League game. -- Stoppages due to injuries and fouls are routine in football matches, but it's not often squirrels stop play. The grey squirrel invaded the pitch during Leicester's 1-0 win, forcing the game to be stopped for a couple of minutes.
