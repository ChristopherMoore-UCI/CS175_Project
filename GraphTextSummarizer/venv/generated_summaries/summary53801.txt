The bomber did not have permission to fly under 12,000 feet because of the presence of U.S. drone aircraft at lower altitudes. What started as a battle with insurgents on a hillside descended into a tragedy after failures in equipment and communication protocol, according to a Pentagon report released Thursday. Meanwhile, at 12,000 feet, a pilot flying the B1-B Lancer scanned the area with night-vision goggles, looking for infrared strobes worn by soldiers to broadcast their presence. Bomber mistakes soldiers for enemy To tackle fire better from insurgents, a team on the ground split up at the request of Staff Sgt. A friendly fire incident that killed six soldiers in Afghanistan, including five Americans, was a result of botched communication and a series of other errors, the Pentagon said.
