The two parents and children, ages 4 and 7, were found dead in an Erie home around 11 a.m. Saturday, said Erie Police Lt. Tom Eberlein. Erie, in western Pennsylvania on the banks of Lake Erie, is about 100 miles from both Buffalo, New York, to the northeast, and Cleveland, Ohio, to the southwest. Several neighbors told CNN affiliate WICU that they heard gunshots around 9 a.m. and then again about an hour later. A bullet also grazed the ear of a 2-year-old in the house, and the toddler was sent to an area hospital, said Eberlein. "They were a happy family, never seen them argue or nothing," Olivia Shultz, a neighbor, told WICU.
