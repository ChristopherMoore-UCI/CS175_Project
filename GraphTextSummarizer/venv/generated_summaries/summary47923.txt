The wide avenues of Havana became a colorful mosaic of the faces and flags of throngs of Cuban people -- 600,000 of them, according to state media -- as people gathered to commemorate International Workers' Day, or May Day, on Sunday. But if mood and turnout at the parade were predictable, it was precisely because "Cuban workers are told by the government to march on May 1, and then afterwards, the Cuban government decides what the people were marching for," said Tomas Bilbao, executive director of the online Cuba Study Group, a site dedicated to the opening and reform of Cuba's society and economy. Two days ago, Cuba's state-run Granma predicted that today's parade would be a "brilliant culmination of the popular mass participation of workers and people in the open and democratic process of discussion" that yielded the recent announcement of economic changes following the Sixth Party Congress of mid-April. (President) Raul Castro has encouraged people to debate what measures should be taken," Bilbao said of the possibilities of real reform. Less than two weeks ago, Cuba's Communist Party held its Sixth Party Congress -- its first in 14 years -- and announced that it had approved drastic changes, including term limits for its top leaders, the gradual elimination of the ration card system, the purchase and sale of housing and cars, and massive layoffs, which the president has said will exceed one million.
