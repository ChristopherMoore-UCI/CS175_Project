Walker held off a challenge from Democratic businesswoman and Madison school board member Mary Burke, keeping hold of the governor's office in a state that typically votes for Democratic presidential candidates. -- Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker won re-election Tuesday, according to a CNN projection, positioning the conservative hero for a potential shot at the Republican presidential nomination in 2016. The Republican governor became a conservative rock star in 2010 when he successfully pushed a "budget repair" bill that stripped most state workers of their collective bargaining rights and slashed education spending by more than $1 billion. Walker survived, offering Republicans a massive confidence boost that their favored policies could be winners even in blue-tinted Great Lakes states like Wisconsin. Walker complained in the days before the election that national Republican groups hadn't done enough to shore up the seat.
