-- Conservative columnist and former CNN "Crossfire" co-host Robert Novak has died after a yearlong battle with cancer, his family said Tuesday. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, said Novak had "the kind of keen insight that can only be gained through years and years of dedication to a craft." "He was a Washington institution who could turn an idea into the most discussed story around kitchen tables, congressional offices, the White House and everywhere in between," McConnell said in a written statement. Jim Walton, president of CNN Worldwide, said the network was saddened by the death of "a journalist of the old school, hard-working, practical and passionate about our profession." "From its earliest days and for some 25 years, Bob shared generously with CNN and with CNN viewers his authority, credibility, humor and towering presence," Walton said in a statement.

Veteran Democratic consultant and on-air sparring partner James Carville said Novak "had the best sources in the Republican Party," making his weekly column a must-read for political insiders.
