-- Hip hop star Snoop Dogg faces a drug charge after border agents searched his tour bus along the same stretch of a west Texas highway where singer Willie Nelson was busted in 2010, a Texas sheriff said. The west Texas prosecutor who handled Nelson's case had suggested Nelson, a treasured icon in the Lone Star state, could pay just a $100 fine if he'd serenade the court with his 1975 hit "Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain." Snoop Dogg, whose real name is Calvin Broadus, "freely admitted" that three prescription bottles filled with marijuana cigarettes were his, a statement from the Hudspeth County, Texas, Sheriff said. Willie Nelson settled his November 2010 Hudspeth County pot bust with a plea deal that reduced his marijuana possession charge to possession of drug paraphernalia and imposed a $500 fine. "You can bet your ass I'm not going to be mean to Willie Nelson," Hudspeth County Attorney C.R. "Kit" Bramblett told CNN at the time.
