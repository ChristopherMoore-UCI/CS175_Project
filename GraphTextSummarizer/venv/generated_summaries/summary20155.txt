-- California Superior Court Judge Michael Pastor ruled Thursday that two autopsy photos of Michael Jackson can be submitted as evidence during the upcoming trial of Dr. Conrad Murray, a person inside the courtroom told CNN. Murray  told investigators he was trying to wean Jackson off propofol in the  last days of his life, but that he used it along with other  drugs to help the pop star sleep that last morning. But he did say that Jackson's former business manager, Tohme Tohme, must testify in Murray's trial. The defense  claims that the singer's dermatologist, Dr. Arnold Klein, injected  Jackson with powerful painkillers dozens of times in the last months of  his life, unknown to Murray. Jury selection in Murray's trial began last month and will continue into  early May.
