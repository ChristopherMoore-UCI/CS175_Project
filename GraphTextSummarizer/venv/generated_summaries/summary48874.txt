Starting today, any link users click on Facebook will be checked against Websense's database of sites that might contain malware or be used for "phishing" of the user's credit card or other personal information. "By providing real-time protection from malware, spyware, inappropriate content, data leaks, and spam, we make it safe for people and businesses to use the web," said Websense chief technology officer Dan Hubbard. Often, users who click bad links will be infected with malware that causes them to, in turn, share the bad link with their friends. The site is teaming up with Websense, a San Diego, California-based Internet security firm, to warn users when they're about to leave Facebook for a site that might be trying to steal their personal data. If a site shows up on the list, a page will pop up warning users and asking them whether they'd like to go back, get more information or proceed at their own risk.
