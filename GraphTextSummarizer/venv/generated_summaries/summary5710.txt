The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights has expressed deep concern about this new penal code and has stated unequivocally that the Brunei law violates international law and human rights. These "kill-a-gay" laws or laws that allow the brutal whipping of women for abortions violate international law and have no place in civilized society. On Tuesday, I spoke at a rally organized by the Feminist Majority Foundation to demand that the sultan of Brunei immediately rescind the new law that includes the stoning to death of gay men and lesbians and the public flogging of women. We built a strong, diverse, unrelenting movement against the Taliban and helped Afghan women rally against gender apartheid. We have also joined with LGBT rights groups and other women's right groups to protest this draconian new penal code.
