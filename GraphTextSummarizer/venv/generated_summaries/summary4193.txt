Police said 45-year-old Wang Gui lost his temper after accusing another resident of stealing 200 yuan from him, the Xinhua news agency reported. Wang had been sent to the nursing home because he suffered a stroke and had no one to take care of him, according to Xinhua. Early Friday morning, Wang set fire to the home in the northeast city of Hailun, authorities said. Staff members at Lianhe Senior Nursing Home tried to calm Wang down. Their ages ranged from 45 to 87, the Hailun public security bureau told Xinhua.
