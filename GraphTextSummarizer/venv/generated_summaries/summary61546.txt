Â» In a lengthy response, FEMA said it already had identified the same shortcomings, had taken steps to upgrade its logistics systems and was on track to improve other systems in the coming months and years. -- Even as FEMA rushes sandbags, generators and pumps to the flooded Midwest, a government report questions the agency's ability to distribute relief supplies effectively during major disasters. The system also does not provide information about goods shipped to FOSA locations by other agencies, such as the Army Corps of Engineers. But FEMA's logistics systems do not track disaster goods from initial shipment to final delivery, Skinner said.
