Often sighted as a likely successor to billionaire Wynn, Taiwanese-born Chief Operating Officer Chen oversaw the opening of luxury gaming, hotel, and retail complex Wynn Macau, in 2006. " In its first year Wynn Macau quadrupled its annual revenue from $1 billion to $4.5billion, under Chen's stewardship. One of Asia's 50 most powerful businesswomen, according to Forbes, Chen has worked her socks off to become the second in command at Wynn. "When we first came to Macau, the scene was more about gaming," Chen told CNN's Kristie Lu Stout. Luck or no luck, gaming was not the direction Chen or her parents saw her career going, when she graduated from New York's Cornell University in 1989.
