Earlier drilling by scientists from multiple nations produced ice cores that contain trapped atmospheric gases, which scientists have used to measure changes in the concentration of carbon dioxide over time. University of Hawaii oceanography professor David M. Karl said areas of those cores that were near the lake -- accreted ice, or ice derived from the lake itself -- contained a few viable bacteria that became active under incubation. Bell said former Vice President Al Gore cited Vostok ice cores in the 2006 documentary "An Inconvenient Truth," about the threat of global climate change. When the ice above the lake was breached, lake water was sucked up into the bore and froze, the Russians said. The effort was designed so that when the ice sheet was breached, lake water was drawn upward a short distance.
