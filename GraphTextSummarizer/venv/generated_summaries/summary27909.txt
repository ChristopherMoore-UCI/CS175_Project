Amazon isn't revealing much about its motivation for entering the game market, saying only, "We know that many Amazon customers enjoy playing games -- including free-to-play social games -- and thanks to Amazon's know-how, we believe we can deliver a great, accessible gaming experience that gamers and our customers can play any time." The free Facebook game is the first from its Amazon Game Studios, a new department at the e-commerce giant that was also unveiled Monday. Players can stock up on game currency -- a dollar buys you five units of "cash" currency, and $100 gets you 660. Yet another social game isn't much of a threat to Zynga, but Amazon has the firepower necessary to become a legitimate competitor, thanks to its large network of customers with active accounts. And since games are big business, there are options to spend real money on in-app purchases.
