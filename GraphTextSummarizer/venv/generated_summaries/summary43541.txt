"We have no comment on any purported affiliation between Mr. Levinson and the U.S. Government," CIA spokesman Chris White said. "But months after Levinson's abduction, e-mails and other documents surfaced that suggested he had gone to Iran at the direction of certain CIA analysts who had no authority to run operations overseas," the Washington Post story says, citing officials. But all the while, in public statements, the U.S. government continued to deny any ties between Levinson and the CIA -- work that, according to the AP and Washington Post reports, was done off the books. Source: CIA apologized to family CNN's source said that David McGee, a family friend who used to be a federal prosecutor in Florida, helped find the documents that proved Levinson's CIA connection. After Levinson's disappearance, the Washington Post and AP reported, CIA officials initially downplayed his ties with the agency and said he did not go to Iran for the agency.
