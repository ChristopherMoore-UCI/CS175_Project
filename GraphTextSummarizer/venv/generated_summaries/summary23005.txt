I entered in 1958, and at that time, the Army was fully integrated, the most integrated institution in American society. Most of the young men didn't have role models at home. If I could snap my finger and do one thing, I would make sure that every young American boy or girl, but especially African-American [children], have a responsible, caring adult in their lives. You've got to act like responsible fathers. This is not why Rosa Parks rode in the back of the bus or why Martin Luther King Jr. and all of his colleagues marched.
