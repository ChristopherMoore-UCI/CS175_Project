"We were worried, if the handsome growth we had been experiencing year-on-year would be halted," says, Steingrimur J. Sigfusson, Iceland's tourism minister. "If things go on for a number of years, in addition with growth of 10 to 15%, tourism will be Iceland's industry number one, in terms of foreign currency earnings," he says. At least we were close enough to cause all this trouble for the aviation industry." Despite an initial dip in visitor numbers, Iceland returned to double digit travel growth by late 2010. The Arctic winter may be long and dark but one light still shines bright in the land of the midnight sun -- Iceland's booming tourist trade. Key to meeting these ambitious targets is the successful promotion of Iceland's pristine natural beauty -- its rural hinterland is famed for its spectacular volcanoes and natural hot springs -- as well as its potential as a business and aviation hub.
