Check out Fitzroy's Gertrude Street and Brunswick Street and South Yarra's Chapel Street and Greville Street for cool, kooky, elegant and vintage finds, respectively. There are also magnificent art deco edifices, like the Manchester Unity building on Collins Street and the nearby T&G building at the junction with Russell Street. Hit the Queen Victoria Market or smaller South Melbourne Market if you prefer to pick through stalls piled high with junk and treasures rather than browse shop windows. Sure, there's good fashion shopping in the city center -- notably Bourke Street, Collins Place and Swanston Street -- but much more eclectic offerings are just a tram-ride away. The "laneways" of the CBD are the place to gallery-browse -- head for Flinders Lane and Little Collins Street, then just follow your nose -- and eyes.
