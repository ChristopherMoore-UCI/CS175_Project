Then, on Monday night, BART officials temporarily opened and closed downtown subway stations to stem the threat of spreading protests, with police officers in riot gear standing at the Civic Center station. The website for the BART Police Officers Association was broken into Wednesday morning, and the names and phone numbers of its entire membership were also posted publicly on the Internet, BART spokesman James K. Allison said. Last Thursday, protestors tried to organize a public demonstration, but BART officials cut off cell phone signals at some subway stations "as one of many tactics to ensure the safety of everyone on the platform," officials said. We are deeply troubled by these actions." Meanwhile, protestors are planning to hold demonstrations next Monday at BART's Civic Center subway station, and transit system officials are planning to beef up security, Allison said. After the transit system's shut down cell phone signals, Anonymous threatened in a news release and related Twitter pages that it would make a cyberattack Sunday on the BART website.
