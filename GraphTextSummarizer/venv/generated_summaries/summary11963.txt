Whatever their motivation, thousands of daredevils from across the globe were on the streets of Pamplona, Spain, on Sunday testing their nerve by sprinting through the city streets in front of six huge, charging bulls. Yet the legendary, centuries-old  Running of the Bulls in Pamplona -- part of the annual San Ferm√≠n Festival -- has attracted more and more tourists to this small, northern Spanish city in recent years. There's no longer a practical need to herd the bulls through the city streets to the bull ring in the center of town. On the first day of this year's bull run, among the thousands of runners, only four were treated for injuries. The frenetic race is maintained because it's fantastic publicity for Pamplona, as well as one of the world's most memorable tests of bravery and agility.
