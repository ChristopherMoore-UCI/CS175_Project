Sebelius called the full implementation of reforms under the 2010 Affordable Care Act a new era in health insurance, noting they mean no denial of coverage for pre-existing conditions or other discriminatory practices such as charging women more than men. -- More than 2 million people have signed up so far for health coverage under Obamacare Starting the new year in Obamacare limbo Under the reforms, Americans will be required to have health coverage or face a fine. Sebelius said Tuesday that another 3.9 million people were eligible for coverage through expanded Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program, but she was unable to specify how many have become new enrollees. Anticipating possible problems in the enrollment system, Sebelius also advised in her blog post that "if you thought you enrolled in health coverage but aren't showing up in the system, call your insurance company directly."
