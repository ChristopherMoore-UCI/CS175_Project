Goals from full-back Danny Higginbotham and striker Mamady Sidibe made it 2-0 at halftime, then Blackburn defender Christopher Samba was sent off for a second yellow card before Matthew Etherington wrapped up victory on 67 minutes. The Dutch striker headed home Steven Gerrard's corner from close range in the 55th minute, and Everton struggled to break down their rivals' determined defense before also being reduced to 10 men when South Africa midfielder Steven Pienaar received his second booking in time added on. The hosts appealed in vain for a late penalty when midweek hat-trick hero Jermain Defoe was brought down by Villa midfielder Stiliyan Petrov, then his strike partner Peter Crouch missed with a back-heeled attempt from close range in time added on. Loan striker David Nugent opened the scoring before debutant defender Danny Fox doubled the lead, while substitute Ilan pulled one back for West Ham late on after fellow new signing Mido hit the post. Roberto Mancini's City pulled one back five minutes when Emmanuel Adebayor scored from close range after a corner by Stephen Ireland, but the visitors could not equalize despite bringing on new signing Patrick Vieira for his debut.
