But critics slammed it as an effort to disenfranchise poor, minority and disabled voters It "attacks democracy at its core" by making it harder for eligible voters, the American Civil Liberties Union of North Carolina said. "This bill will bring North Carolina in line with the majority of other states that already require voter ID." Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act required some states with a history of voter discrimination to get "precleared" by the federal government before making any changes to voting laws. In the past two years, at least 11 states have approved laws requiring voters to show identification at voting booths. "A measure that restores confidence in our election process and ensures voters are who they say they are is a no-brainer -- and nearly three-quarters of North Carolinians agree," said Senate President Pro Tempore Phil Berger.
