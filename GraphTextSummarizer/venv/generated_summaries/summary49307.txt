Space planes will radically lower launch costs leading to new applications, new industries and new jobs. American history proves that smart, focused action by the U.S. government can jump start entire new industries that open new frontiers -- from western railroads, to the air, to the Internet - and that is exactly where we are today in space. The growth in demand will lead to even higher flight rates, lower costs and new opportunities. NASA's Office of the Chief Technologist concluded that America has the basic technology to build space planes now. Space planes are the transcontinental railroad of our generation.
