Menu's legal name is Summum Bonum Neffer Menu, although the piano teacher professionally still goes by Sue Parsons. About 1,500 people from across the globe, and from many different religions, have requested these mummification arrangements through their local funeral homes, said Ron Temu, a licensed funeral director and longtime Summum practitioner. " Summum practitioners "believe in one source," Menu said, "but we just don't label it as God. "A lot of people are so tired of being told how they have to worship," said Su Menu, 58, who has subscribed to Summum's teachings for more than 30 years. Menu estimated that "hundreds of thousands" of people across the globe have studied Summum's teachings, which are broadcast online, "but once they learn the meditations, they're free to go live their own lives."
