In the Mexican version, co-produced with Warner Brothers International Television Production, "the drama has become tropical without losing its essence," Mexico's state-run Notimex news agency said Thursday, citing Torres. Mexican producer Pedro Torres released details this week about his plans for "Gossip Girl Acapulco," a revamped Spanish-language version of the U.S. show, which ended its six-season run on the CW Network late last year. If cast photos released by the show's producers are any indication, the show's characters have different names, but similar looks to their U.S. counterparts. The show won't hit the airwaves until later in the year, but the Mexican version of Gossip Girl is making her presence known -- where else? -- Gossip Girl is heading south of the border.
