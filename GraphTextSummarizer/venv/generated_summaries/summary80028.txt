"Bret's fight to stay conscious during the hemorrhage and get to the emergency room" was key to saving his life that night, said Dr. Joseph Zabramski, the head of the medical team treating Michaels. Zabramski and his team will talk more about Michaels' illness and recovery at a news conference at the hospital on Tuesday. A statement published on Michaels' official website earlier in the week said his band might resume its concert tour as soon as May 26 "provided there are no further complications." Michaels, 47, was the lead singer for the '80s glam-metal "hair band" Poison. His sister Michael Sychak told HLN's "Issues with Jane Velez-Mitchell" that Michaels was watching television at his home near Phoenix when he was stricken by an excruciating headache on the evening of April 22. -- Bret Michaels' "sheer will to live" kept him alive long enough last week to allow doctors to stabilize his condition after he suffered a massive brain hemorrhage, his neurosurgeon said Friday.
