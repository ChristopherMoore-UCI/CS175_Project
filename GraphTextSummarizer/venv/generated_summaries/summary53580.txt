Hugh Hefner's Playboy Mansion was a gilded cage for former Hef companion Holly Madison. Some of Madison's revelations won't be news to anyone who's ever read about the recent life of Hefner, the Playboy founder, whose most recent marriage was to Crystal Harris in 2012. Former spouse Kimberley Conrad described Hefner as "very controlling," and he's a man of routine. In her new memoir, "Down the Rabbit Hole," Madison -- one of the stars of the Playboy-centered E! reality series "The Girls Next Door" -- says that living in the mansion wasn't all sex and good times. "Life inside the notorious mansion wasn't a dream at all -- and quickly became her nightmare," the promotional material states, according to Us Weekly.
