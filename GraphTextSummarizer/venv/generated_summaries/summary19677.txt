Evan Williams and Biz Stone co-founded Twitter and Blogger, so they know about blogging, both long and short form. Medium is the latest product out of their Obvious Corporation, which incubated Twitter in its early days, and the duo has a grand vision for the blogging tool, elucidated in a long announcement post by Williams. Rather, you're whisked away to their Twitter profile, where you can scan for links to Medium posts they've created. Posting privileges are limited to a chosen few for the time being, but anyone can make an account, using their Twitter handle, to browse and vote on posts. Medium is a new blogging tool for people who feel constrained by Twitter and overwhelmed by Blogger or Tumblr.
