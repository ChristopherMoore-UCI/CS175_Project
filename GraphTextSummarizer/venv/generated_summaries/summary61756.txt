The UN estimates as many as 300,000 people have been killed and almost 3 million people have been displaced from their homes since a conflict began in 2003 in Darfur, a region of Sudan along the border with the new nation of South Sudan. Widespread atrocities have occurred during fighting between Sudan's government forces and militias and other rebel groups.

An unidentified armed group ambushed a water convoy on its way to a regional headquarters of the joint African Union-United Nations peacekeeping force, a U.N. statement said. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called on the government of Sudan to apprehend the attackers.
