The Socialist candidate is Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba, 60, who served under Socialist Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez and most recently under Zapatero, rising to the positions of deputy prime minister and interior minister. -- Spain's Socialist Prime Minister announced Monday the dissolution of parliament in order to hold early elections on November 20, which polls indicate the opposition conservatives will win handily during Spain's deep economic crisis. He told supporters over the weekend that the elections during this crisis are among the most important in Spain's 30 years of democracy following the death of the long-ruling dictator Francisco Franco in 1975. " "I have great confidence in Spain," Zapatero added. Rajoy has been criticized for not revealing detailed plans of how to get Spain out of its crisis, especially at a time when financial markets have battered Spain.
