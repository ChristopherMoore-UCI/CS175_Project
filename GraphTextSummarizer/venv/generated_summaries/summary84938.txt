Pope Francis is of Italian descent, but he was born in Buenos Aires in 1932. The largest Catholic archdiocese in the United States, it was until recently under the control of Cardinal Roger Mahony. It's why, in East Coast cities like Boston or New Haven or New York, for generations the Irish voted for Irish candidates, and the Italians for Italian candidates.
