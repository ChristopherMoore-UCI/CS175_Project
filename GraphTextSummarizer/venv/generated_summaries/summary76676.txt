The success of British car makers is echoed by U.S. car makers which are expected to report their first profits since 2004. Industry analyst Paul Nieuwenhuis said that while many customers bought luxury cars "by the meter" -- that is to say they care more about the image than the machine -- modern Rolls-Royce cars were exceptional vehicles. Reid added that companies such as Nissan, BMW Mini and Honda had good plants in the UK that were building desirable cars. " Nieuwenhuis, director of the Centre for Automotive Industry Research at Cardiff Business School, said Britain had a global reputation for building luxury cars. Despite the closure of the last British-owned volume car maker, Rover, in 2005, the country is now building near-record numbers of vehicles while the proportion of cars exported is the highest ever.
