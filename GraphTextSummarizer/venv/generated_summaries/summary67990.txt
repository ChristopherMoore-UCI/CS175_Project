The Transportation Security Administration alerted local law enforcement agencies that are responsible for external security around airports, but officials said the possible threat is not necessarily aviation-related. One official said it focused on parts of California where officials stepped up security, a U.S. official said. "Over the last few months, we have made a number of security adjustments, including enhanced screening at select overseas airports and increasing random searches of passengers and carry-on luggage on flights inbound to the U.S., reflecting an evolving threat picture," the spokesman said. He said the DHS added layers of security to the Electronic System for Travel Authorization. The FBI is investigating a possible ISIS-inspired terrorist threat in the United States, law enforcement officials said Saturday.
