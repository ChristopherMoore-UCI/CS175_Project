New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio issued a severe weather warning and hazardous travel advisory for Monday. "New York City could see a wintry mix of precipitation just in time for the morning commute with a possibility of sleet and ice," and Boston will "get another round of wintery weather with new snow accumulations from 10 to 12 inches," he said. "The streets will stay plowed and passable so people will be safe and secure," Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel promised at a news conference Sunday. "For anyone leaving Super Bowl parties, you're going to have to be ready to be careful at that point," said de Blasio. We would expect a lot of icing on our roads and sidewalks -- up to a quarter inch of ice in some places, and a lot of that would happen in the early morning hours, so we'd want people to be very, very cautious tomorrow," he told reporters.
