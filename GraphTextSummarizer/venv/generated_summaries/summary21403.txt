In a rare and candid interview, CNN's Robyn Curnow spoke to Nelson Mandela's wife of 10 years, Graca Machel, to find out more about the man from the person who arguably knows him the best. We met in life at time we were both settled. He didn't have much opportunity to do those things that a parent a father does to read stories to child. Here, Machel reveals that Mandela's courageous and eventful life has left him with only one regret. Madiba (Mandela) was not given the opportunity to bring up his own children.
