The discovery comes 11 days after authorities found the body of young Juliani Cardenas, the boy who Rodriguez allegedly swiped from his grandmother's arms on January 18. A homicide warrant had been issued for Rodriguez in connection with Juliani's death while authorities searched for him, Sheriff Adam Christianson said. She said she never thought Rodriguez, who is the father of her unborn child, would harm Juliani. A California water authority employee saw the body, believed to be that of Jose Esteban Rodriguez, at about 8:30 a.m. on Saturday. Authorities determined the body was that of an adult Hispanic male with clothing and a physical make-up matching that of Rodriguez.
