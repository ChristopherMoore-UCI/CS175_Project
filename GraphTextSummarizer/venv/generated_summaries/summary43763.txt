-- Two airmen on a U.S. Air Force F-15 Eagle died when the plane crashed in eastern Afghanistan early Saturday, the U.S. military said. " A spokesman for the governor of Afghanistan's central Ghazni province, who goes by the single name Jihangir, confirmed that a U.S. plane crashed in Ghazni's Nawur district before dawn. A U.S. Air Force F-15 Eagle similar to this one crashed Saturday in eastern Afghanistan. The two-man fighter went down while it was conducting military operations, another source, Lt. Col. Reid Christopherson, said earlier. The Afghan official said the plane crashed in Ghazni, some 160 kilometers west of the town of Ghazni, between the communities of Qaracha and Bahari.
