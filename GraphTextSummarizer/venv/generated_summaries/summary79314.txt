With so little space available, demand so high and restrictions that limit the height of new housing units, developers have been forced to get creative when constructing new properties. Homes such as Malkani's sell for roughly $4,000 per square meter ($371 per square foot). Those with the means, such as Rewal and Malkani, however, expect to see more growth in their respective investments as the New Delhi population increases further. Improvements in the surrounding area and investments in local services meanwhile have helped make the neighborhood a more desirable place to stay, Malkani revealed. Nearby districts such as Lajpat Nagar (where a two-bedroom house sells for $300,000) and Nizamuddin (where a similar property can go for $950,000) have witnessed a similar surge in prices.
