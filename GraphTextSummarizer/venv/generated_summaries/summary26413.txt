The grandfather of protest -- or riots, depending on your perspective -- Gandhi deeply deplored violence. I believe in the power of protests to confront the ugliness of inequality and injustice with the beauty of people peacefully coming together and simply but strongly demanding change. Because black people and poor whites weren't even allowed to vote in the early days of our Union, slavery could only be ended through protest. Indeed, people in the United States and across the globe are feeling increasingly impotent in the face of the growing power and wealth of Wall Street, dimming the rest of our prospects for a prosperous future. Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, black and white Americans launched protests and outright revolts against the system of slavery.
