To get the shots of Disney attractions that he needed, Moore, his crew and actors had to board the rides -- repeatedly. " Moore consistently beat the odds to get his movie made and into theaters: first by eluding Disney security, then earning a spot in the Sundance Film Festival (where the film premiered in January) and ultimately finding a distributor willing to risk the wrath of the Walt Disney Company. So why would Disney ever allow Moore to shoot his movie inside Disneyland and Disney World? Paying Disney back Disney hasn't filed suit against Moore despite his ample use of the company's copyrighted images (no doubt concluding a lawsuit would only increase public awareness of "Escape From Tomorrow"). In Moore's vision, jolly Disney characters become fearsome ghouls; an epidemic of "cat flu" threatens to sicken visitors; an undercurrent of sex runs through this place meant to stand for innocent family fun.
