Halderman told Letterman in a proposed script that his "world was about to collapse around him" unless he received $2 million, Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau said. Morgenthau said Letterman gave Halderman, a producer for the CBS news magazine "48 Hours," a $2 million check Wednesday, and Halderman deposited it in a bank account in Connecticut. According to the indictment, Halderman waited outside Letterman's Manhattan home at 6 a.m. September 9 to deliver the letter and other materials. Halderman said he needed to "make a large chunk of money" by selling Letterman the "screenplay treatment," Morgenthau said. The letter asked Letterman to meet with Halderman that day to make a deal, Morgenthau said.
