-- A police chief who allegedly used a false identity to buy as many as 192 houses in cities in China's southern province of Guangdong has sparked outrage on social media amid a growing scandal over corrupt officials amassing fortunes on the inflated property market. The high-profile cases have captured the public imagination in a country where national identity cards limit the number of apartments a person can own -- part of a policy to cool China's rampant property market. The case follows other high-profile instances of high-ranking officials using fake IDs and their positions to speculate on China's overheated property market. On Monday, police arrested Gong Aiai -- a bank official from a rural bank in China -- who allegedly built a real estate empire worth at least $160 million using fake IDs and graft. "(I) finally realized that in China, properties are forever in the hands of a tiny number of people," a user of China's Twitter-like Sina Weibo was reported as saying.
