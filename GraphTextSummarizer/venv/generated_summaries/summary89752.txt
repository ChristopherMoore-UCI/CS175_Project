A man has been arrested for making threats against Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, law enforcement officials said Thursday. The FBI and U.S. Capitol Police said Sherbow made threats against the Hawaii Democrat this month that were "deemed credible. According to the Hawaii Reporter, Sherbow, a former resident of Hawaii, sent an e-mail to the FBI threatening to decapitate Gabbard. " Officials would not describe the nature of any statements allegedly made by Sherbow involving the congresswoman, and court documents remain under seal. Mexican authorities turned Sherbow over to FBI agents in San Diego, where he is expected to have a court appearance on Friday.
