Because those numbers are still so high, Robinson sometimes wonders if all her work to end violence against women here has been a waste of time. State surveys show 37% of women will face sexual violence; and 59% will suffer from threats, domestic abuse and/or sexual assault. That was in the late 1970s, shortly after Robinson -- a fiery 63-year-old who looks like the Alaska version of Reba McEntire -- moved to Juneau, Alaska, to escape an abusive husband who, at different points over years, held a gun to her head, beat her and, one time, sexually assaulted her. -- It started when a friend handed her the book "Scream Quietly or the Neighbors Will Hear," about violence against women. That's when she started letting women stay in her tiny houseboat, which she rented because she couldn't afford a home in picturesque Juneau.
