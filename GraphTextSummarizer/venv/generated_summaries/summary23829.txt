Salehi said the meeting was intended to also revive Syria's anti-Israeli position in the region. His remarks came after Iran hosted a meeting between the Syrian government and opposition forces in Tehran Sunday with representatives of different opposition and political groups. Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei blasted certain foreign countries for equipping "terrorists" in Syria and said the only way to settle the crisis is to prevent the shipment of arms to the rebels, the Iranian government-controlled FARS news agency reported. Khamenei said that the "arrogant powers want to weaken and annihilate Syria as main ring in the chain of resistance through arming terrorists in the country," FARS reported. Al-Khatib is a former cleric of the historic Umayyad Mosque in Damascus and is a respected figure in Syria.
