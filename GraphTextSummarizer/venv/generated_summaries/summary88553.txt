-- A man convicted of murdering three men who answered a Craigslist ad to work on an Ohio cattle farm was sentenced to death Thursday morning, Summit County Court Bailiff Brian Scheetz said. In March, a jury convicted Beasley on 26 counts of aggravated murder, kidnapping, aggravated robbery and unanimously recommended that he be sentenced to death. After answering the online ad for work on a 688-acre property in eastern Ohio, the South Carolinian in November 2011 told a deputy sheriff how he'd met with two males, and then drove toward Stock Township. A judge in Summit County accepted a jury's recommendation that Richard James Beasley should die for the crimes. Would-be victim Scott Davis apparently was in Beasley's cross hairs, too.
