"Mostly the challenges are spreading the idea to travelers, that it is really worth it to step a bit from your comfort zone while traveling and try out this new concept of spending a few hours at local homes in Asia." PlateCulture says hosts have been tested and approved by staff or company ambassadors in different countries. Thanks to some enterprising minds, dozens of home kitchens and dining tables in Southeast Asia have opened up to travelers wanting a taste of the local cuisines. Travel, eat, share Founder Reda Stare says she was inspired to start the company by her own experiences of dining in local homes while traveling in India. The goal of the company is to "help travelers in all countries across Asia to experience being in a local home, eating homemade food and feeling like you've been a part of something authentic and special," Stare says.
