The official scoffed at the idea that Vazquez was any more dangerous or deadly than other alleged cartel hit men. He was arrested together with a woman, Nancy Ortiz, who police said was selling drugs with Vazquez. That's because Monterrey and its surroundings are an area disputed by rival drug cartels. From 2010 to the present, an average of 108 people have been killed each month in the state of Nuevo Leon, according to official statistics. The young man confessed to 45 killings, security officials said, and has been implicated in 34 other slayings between 2011 and this year.
