The 11-year-old girl said her father, pediatrician Melvin Morse, would hold her face under a running faucet causing the water to shoot up her nose, according to Delaware State Police. Pauline Morse, the girl's mother, apparently witnessed the abuse and failed to stop it, police said. " Morse has written on near-death experiences among children, authoring a 1991 book called "Closer to the Light." Authorities were first alerted to allegations of abuse in July when they went to Morse's Georgetown home. -- A Delaware doctor and his wife were arrested this week after their daughter told authorities that she was punished by "waterboarding," police said.
