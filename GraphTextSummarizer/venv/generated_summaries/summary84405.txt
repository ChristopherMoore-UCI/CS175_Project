-- Carlos Sainz is closing on his first Dakar Rally car title after extending his lead with victory on Tuesday's 10th stage in the South American event. The Spaniard, who led last year's race before crashing out on the 12th stage, was 10 minutes and six seconds ahead of Volkswagen teammate Nasser Al-Attiyah of Qatar after triumphing on the 238-kilometer leg from La Serena to Santiago. "Eighty kilometers after the start we caught up with Nasser," Sainz told the race's official Web site. Al-Attiyah finished the day in fourth as he lost one minute and 40 seconds to Sainz, but was still more than 18 minutes ahead of third-placed American Mark Miller in another Volkswagen. It was the two-time world rally champion's first stage win in this year's event and the 16th of his career, and leaves him in prime position to win with three legs to go.
