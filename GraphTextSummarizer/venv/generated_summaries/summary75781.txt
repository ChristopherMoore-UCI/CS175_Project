Following the Lac-Megantic catastrophe, the Federal Railroad Administration and the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration issued a safety advisory and announced an operation to conduct unannounced inspections and testing of crude oil that shipped by rail. "The large-scale shipment of crude oil by rail simply didn't exist 10 years ago, and our safety regulations need to catch up with this new reality," NTSB Chairman Deborah Hersman said in a statement. Crude oil shipment by rail has increased over 400% since 2005, the NTSB said, citing figures from the Association of American Railroads. "While this energy boom is good for business, the people and the environment along rail corridors must be protected from harm." Forty-seven Lac-Megantic residents died and the town's center destroyed when an unattended train  hauling oil descended down a grade, derailed, and erupted in fire. But the NTSB said it "remains concerned the practice of mischaracterizing the packing groups of crude oil shipments may allow shippers to avoid" security requirements.
