" Police Chief Todd Schmaderer tried to distance his agency from the controversy in a statement issued Tuesday, saying that the union's website and Facebook page are separate from those of the Omaha Police Department and that he has little authority over the public statements of union members.

" Wells said union members have turned the video over to the department's child victim unit, which will work with child-welfare agencies to investigate the circumstances. "I strongly disagree with any postings that may cause a divide in our community or an obstacle to police community relations." Hamilton said the statement was too little, too late. Just another day on the Internet -- until the police union in Omaha, Nebraska, posted the clip on its website to highlight what it called the "cycle of violence and thuggery" the community faces.
