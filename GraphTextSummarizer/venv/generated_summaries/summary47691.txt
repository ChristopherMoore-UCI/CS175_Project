The governor's drought emergency, which included the entire state, won't help ranchers much because the measure allows water agencies to move water from northern to southern California, unless those cattlemen are located in a benefiting water district, Oldfield said. The exact financial impact of the historic drought in California -- as well as a moderate to extreme drought throughout the American West -- has yet to be calculated by state and federal officials or farming and ranching associations. That's because a historic disaster is unfolding: California is facing perhaps its worst drought since record-keeping began a century ago, California Gov. Jerry Brown proclaimed this month. It's another 70-degree day in central California. Winter is California's wet season, but it hasn't rained on Kelly's ranch in unincorporated Tivy Valley, near Sanger, since December 7, 2013.
