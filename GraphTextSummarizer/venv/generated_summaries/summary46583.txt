-- Former New Zealand cricket star Chris Cairns won a libel action in London Monday against ex-Indian Premier League (IPL) chief Lalit Modi, who had used Twitter to accuse him of match fixing. Mr Justice Bean, who heard the case without a jury, said that Modi had "singularly failed" to provide any credible evidence that Cairns was involved in match fixing. Meanwhile in Test action Monday, Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene scored an unbeaten 168 to rescue his side against England in Galle. Cairns, 41, took Modi to London High Court over an "unequivocal allegation" of match fixing on Modi's Twitter blog in January 2010. For Cairns, the ruling came as a "great relief," saying the allegations had undermined his achievements of scoring over 3,000 runs and 200 wickets in Test cricket.
