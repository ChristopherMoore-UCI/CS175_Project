But Iraqi leaders have agreed that the government will begin talking with U.S. officials about leaving U.S. forces inside Iraq on a training mission. -- Muqtada al-Sadr, the Iraqi Shiite cleric who has been staunchly opposed to the American troop presence in his country since the occupation began last decade, warned against the prospects of a "challenge" with any U.S. forces that stay in Iraq. The U.S. military maintains that the Promised Day Brigade and other Shiite militias are backed by Iran, a charge Tehran has long denied. An increase in attacks in recent months against American troops has been blamed on Shiite militias, including the Promised Day Brigade. But Al-Sadr has ratcheted his anti-American rhetoric up in recent months, raising concerns about an increase in violence as Iraq weighs an extension to the U.S. presence.
