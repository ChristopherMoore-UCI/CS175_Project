According to accounts from the victims and witnesses, the incident happened shortly after Atlanta police dispersed a large group of young people who had been attending a party at a club near downtown Atlanta. The suspects include a 16-year old male whose name is not being released because of his age and two brothers, Zantavious Sanchez Scott, 20, and Jarquez Scott, 19, MARTA police said. All three suspects live in Atlanta and are being held on charges including aggravated assault, aggravated battery and robbery by force, MARTA police announced Monday. "We are continuing our investigation into this unprovoked and senseless act," said MARTA Police Chief Wanda Dunham. The attack happened April 16 as the two Delta employees rode a southbound train toward Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, police have said.
