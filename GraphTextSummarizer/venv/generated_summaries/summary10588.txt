I was able to perceive colors just as well as people with color vision. I started to have favorite colors and I started to dream in color. Then I realized that the human visual system is not very impressive: you can't actually see many colors; there are many more colors around us that the human eye can't detect. The result, with further collaborations with Peter Kese and Matias Lizana, is an electronic eye: a color sensor between my eyes connected to a chip installed at the back of my head that transforms color frequencies into sound frequencies that I hear through my bone. I actually come from a world where color doesn't exist; I was born with achromatopsia, I was born completely colorblind.
