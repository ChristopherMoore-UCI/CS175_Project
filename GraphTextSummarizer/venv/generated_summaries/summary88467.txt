-- A jury in Arkansas convicted evangelist Tony Alamo on Friday of 10 federal counts of taking minors across state lines for sex, according to the court in the Western District in Arkansas. Authorities in September charged Alamo, the 74-year-old founder and leader of Tony Alamo Christian Ministries, and raided his 15-acre compound near Texarkana, Arkansas. Evangelist Tony Alamo was convicted of all 10 counts against him and will be sentenced later. The Southern Poverty Law Center says Tony Alamo Christian Ministries is anti-Catholic and a cult. Between March 1994 and October 2005, Alamo transported five girls younger than 18 across state lines for sex, according to the indictment.
