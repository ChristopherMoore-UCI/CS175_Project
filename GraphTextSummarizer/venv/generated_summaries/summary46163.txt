-- Gunmen attacked Christians worshipping on a Nigerian university campus on Sunday, with witnesses reporting multiple explosions and gunfire. Professor A.B. Baffa said he was at home on the campus of Bayero University in the city of Kano when he heard the gunfire and explosions. Britain's Foreign Office said it had received reports of an explosion and gunfire at Bayero University and that the incident may be ongoing. The gunmen began their attack around 8:30 a.m., targeting a lecture hall normally used by Christians for Sunday services, journalist Salihu Tanko reported from the scene. The attack happened while the university is on a break, so most of the students are not on campus, Tanko said.
