Demonstrators  in Hofuf, a city about 300 kilometers (185 miles) east of the Saudi  capital of Riyadh, began their march after Friday prayers, two activists told CNN . -- Hundreds turned out in two Saudi Arabian cities Friday to protest on what had been billed as a "day of rage," according to activists, though a planned demonstration in the Middle Eastern nation's capital failed to materialize. But by Friday night, about 200 people were out demonstrating near Qatif, according to a Shiite activist. Three demonstrators were arrested by Saudi security forces, the activists said. Saudi security forces were out and observed them, but there were no apparent arrests as the march ended peacefully.
