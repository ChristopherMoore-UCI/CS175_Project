Federer and Nadal net $2.6 million in Zurich charity clash "Both of us are very happy that we can finally have this event and raise a lot of money for these kids. -- World number one Rafael Nadal has avenged his two recent defeats to Roger Federer with a victory over his rival in a charity match in Madrid, Spain. The contest, named the "Joining Forces For the Benefit Of Children" match, attracted an all-star crowd to the Caja Magica, including Spain's Queen Sofia. Wednesday night's clash was the second of two exhibitions aimed at raising money for the pair's foundations, with Federer winning Tuesday's contest in the Swiss city of Zurich. It was the third time in the last month that the world's top-two male tennis players have met and Nadal's first victory in that period, after Federer won in Switzerland and at the ATP World Tour Finals in London, England.
