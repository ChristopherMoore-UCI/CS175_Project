The Earth, though 4.5 billion years old, is a newcomer, said John Mather, senior project scientist on NASA's next-generation James Webb Space Telescope. NASA's assembled panelists said, if they follow this map of stars, they're certain to find a multitude of new planets. Spotting Earths Finding small planets, ones the size of Earth, is challenging, in part because they produce fainter signals, said Dave Gallagher, director for astronomy and physics at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, who likened it to spotting a firefly beside a searchlight. That was the consensus of a panel on the search for life in the universe held at NASA headquarters Monday in Washington. The planet-hunting Kepler probe, launched in 2009, finds planets by looking for dips in the brightness of a star as a planet transits, or crosses, in front of that star.
