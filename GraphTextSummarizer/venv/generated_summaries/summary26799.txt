The incident began at 11:44 a.m., when Rodriguez entered the business' eighth-floor reception area, said Lt. Louis Tanzi, violent crimes section commander for the Orlando Police Department. Tanzi said other employees of the architectural and engineering firm where the attack occurred have described Rodriguez as a "disgruntled former employee." "Rodriguez felt the people at RS&H were hindering his efforts to obtain unemployment benefits," it adds. As police were disabling the car, Rodriguez appeared at the window of the residence, his hands in the air, and surrendered without incident, the affidavit says. Asked by a reporter why he allegedly committed the crime, Rodriguez, escorted by police, said, "They left me to rot."
