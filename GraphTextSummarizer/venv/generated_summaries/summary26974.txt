Engaging a rarely used power, House Oversight Chairman Darrell Issa announced his committee will vote next Thursday on whether to hold former IRS official Lois Lerner in contempt of Congress for refusing to testify about the agency's targeting of conservative organizations. After a House vote to find Lerner in contempt, the process would leave Republicans' hands and go to the U.S. attorney for Washington, who would be directed to call a grand jury. "I believe Lois Lerner waived her Fifth Amendment privilege," Issa said in a hearing last June. Lerner ran the IRS division that determined tax-exempt status for nonprofit organizations. "Documents and testimony point to Lois Lerner as a senior IRS official responsible for conduct that deprived Americans of their rights to free speech and equal protection under the law," wrote the California Republican in a statement released Thursday.
