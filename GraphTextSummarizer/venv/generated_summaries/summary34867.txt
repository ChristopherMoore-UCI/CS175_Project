Later, Storm hosted CBS News' "Early Show," where she transcended sports and interviewed newsmakers such as Barack Obama and George W. Bush. "Thanks to all the great nurses at Westchester burn unit" who have "been to my house every day for the last couple of weeks helping me be here today," Storm said. Storm, who was born with a port wine-stain birthmark underneath her left eye, founded a charitable organization that helps children with debilitating and disfiguring vascular birthmarks.
