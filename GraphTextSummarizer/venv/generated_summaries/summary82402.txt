After six fashionable years of Carrie, Samantha, Miranda, and Charlotte's adventures on TV, the iconic HBO comedy series found new life — twice — with two big-screen adaptations, both written and directed by series exec producer Michael Patrick King. During our chat with King about the revival chances of his other HBO show, The Comeback, the conversation of course veered into Sex territory. Four years later, Sex and the City hit movie theaters and raked in $152 million at the domestic box office, with critical reviews split right down the middle. " EW: Michael Patrick King talks the future of 'The Comeback' "The great gift or riches or luck is that I worked on two shows that were so full that they spilled over into people's lives and the characters were rounded enough that you could still wonder where they are," King says, adding that Sex and the City is still thriving on TV, especially as alternative programming (HBO marathoned the series on Super Bowl Sunday).
