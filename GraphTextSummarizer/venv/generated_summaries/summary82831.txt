He launched a Facebook page last week called Protected Travels. Vietnamese authorities have released very little information about the cause of death for Bowerman and Huynh. The travelers' stories are just the latest in a string of mysterious tourist deaths in Southeast Asia. A frequent traveler himself, Von Seth had a large network of international acquaintances whom had never heard about this series of mysterious deaths and expressed concern. Other media reports linked Bowerman's and Huynh's deaths to the 2009 deaths of Jill St. Onge and Julie Bergheim, who had similar symptoms in adjacent rooms at the Laleena Guesthouse on the island of Phi Phi.
