Teenage Riot, which resulted from our time at the protests, is a five-part film looking at the riots, their significance and the strange combination of students, schoolkids, gangs, anarchists and police that made up the clashes that would define the most violent period of political upheaval in this country since the '80s. The protesters would not be students, either; they would be armed gang members, willing to "wipe out a whole constabulary" of police. It was a fun place to be "kettled" midwinter, and we watched as kids burned bus stops, held impromptu grime raves, smashed the windows of the treasury and were beaten up by police. At the end of 2010, VBS attended a series of violent student demonstrations in London.
