Some critics, including experts on radiation, call the government's clean-up efforts "meaningless" and say that using high pressure hoses simply spreads the radiation. They perform repetitive tasks -- wiping down buildings with damp cloths, and using high pressure hoses to clean drainage systems along the streets. Today, however, it is essentially a ghost town, evacuated after the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant just 25 miles (40 kilometers) away following the Tohoku earthquake in March 2011. While former residents can return to Iitate during the day, it's still an eerie scene -- children's toys lie abandoned in yards, bicycles rust on front porches and only an occasional truck passes through its quiet streets. Workers are also clearing a layer of top soil in Iitate, as well as the numerous other affected areas of Fukushima prefecture.
