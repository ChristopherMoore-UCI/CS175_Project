Most positive reaction to Syria airstrikes comes from Obama's critics Administration officials are confident in the prospects of a U.S.-backed resolution that would compel nations to try to stop citizens from leaving to fight for terror groups. Here is a timeline of the major events leading up to U.S. action in Syria: • August 2012: President Obama lays out a "red line" in the Syrian conflict, saying that the use of chemical weapons would "change his calculus" on Syria. Obama described its members as "seasoned al Qaeda operatives in Syria," and U.S. officials said the group was plotting attacks against the United States and other Western targets. The U.S. said Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain and Jordan had joined in the attack on ISIS targets near Raqqa in Syria. • September 2013: Congress is reticent to endorse U.S. military action in Syria.
