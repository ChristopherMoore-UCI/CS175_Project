The series of paintings, which are said to part of a "visual journal" made by the singer during his travels through Japan, China, Vietnam and Korea, have been compared to famous photos by well-known photographers such as Henri Cartier-Bresson and LÃ©on Busy. Real people, real street scenes, behind the curtain scenes, live models, paintings, photographs, staged setups, architecture, grids, graphic design. "The most striking thing is that Dylan has not merely used a photograph to inspire a painting: he has taken the photographer's shot composition and copied it exactly," wrote Dylan critic Michael Gray in a post on his blog, Bob Dylan Encyclopedia. While some fans in the Dylan-centric online community "Expecting Rain" have voiced concern about the songwriter's highly derivative visual art, others have argued that "quotation" is a part of the tradition of art. Dylan has, in his way, been forthcoming about using photographs in his paintings.
