Early puberty in girls is a growing public health concern because studies have shown that girls who start puberty earlier are more likely to develop breast and uterine cancer later in life. Girls in the United States are entering puberty at earlier ages than they have in the past, a new study reports. This finding, which has been reported in other studies, suggests that soaring obesity rates among children may be contributing to the rates of early puberty. Although the rate of early puberty among black girls in the study (23 percent) was higher than that observed in the early 1990s (15 percent), the increase was not statistically significant. In that study, which included about 4,000 girls in the United Kingdom, researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that mothers who had their first period before age 12, smoked during pregnancy, and were pregnant for the first time had daughters who entered puberty sooner than other girls.
