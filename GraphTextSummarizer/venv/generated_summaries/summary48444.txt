Ivan Cameron, six, passed away early Wednesday, the UK's Press Association reported a Conservative Party spokesman as saying. "I know that the whole house will want to express their sorrow at the death of Ivan Cameron," Brown told lawmakers, according to The Guardian. -- The disabled young son of UK opposition leader David Cameron has died. The spokesman said that Ivan, who suffered from cerebral palsy and severe epilepsy, was taken ill overnight and died at St Mary's Hospital, Paddington, central London early Wednesday morning.
