Any organization doing such surveillance should apply the police norms of probable cause, due process and oversight to population surveillance activities. Spying on foreign governments is what the NSA is supposed to do. According to NSA documents published in Glenn Greenwald's new book "No Place to Hide," we now know that the NSA spies on embassies and missions all over the world, including those of Brazil, Bulgaria, Colombia, the European Union, France, Georgia, Greece, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Slovakia, South Africa, South Korea, Taiwan, Venezuela and Vietnam. We know who foreign government officials are and where they're located: in government offices in their home countries, and embassies abroad. Both involve security, but just as the NSA's traditional focus was governments, the FBI's traditional focus was individuals.
