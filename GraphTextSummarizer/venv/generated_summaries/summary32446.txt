"At her core, Kamala is just a 16-year-old girl, exploring the many facets of her identity when she is suddenly bestowed with super-human powers that send her on the adventure of a lifetime," Marvel Comics Editor In Chief Axel Alonso said. Ms. Marvel will be "true-to-life, something real people could relate to, particularly young women," writer G. Willow Wilson said. Kamala Khan, a fictional New Jersey teenager, transforms into Ms. Marvel in the debut of Marvel's new monthly series in January, the comic book publisher said. Comic book fans meet Ms. Marvel, Marvel Comic's first Muslim-American superhero. Kamala uses her powers to become like her idol, Captain Marvel, which "challenges the very core of her conservative values," Marvel's announcement said.
