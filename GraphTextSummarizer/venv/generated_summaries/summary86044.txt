The executive producer of Shark Week, Michael Sorensen, points out that Discovery aired three disclaimers for "Megalodon," including that "none of the institutions or agencies that appear in the film are affiliated with it in any way, nor have approved its contents." Additionally, the network warned that "certain events and characters in this film have been dramatized," and that "legends of giant sharks persist all over the world; there is still debate about what they may be." Discovery billed the special, "Megalodon: The Monster Shark That Lives," as taking viewers "on a search for a massive killer great white shark responsible for a rash of fatalities off the coast of South Africa." David Shiffman, a doctoral student studying shark ecology and conservation at the University of Miami's Abess Center for Ecosystem Science and Policy, told Nat Geo that he wouldn't expect this kind of programming from Discovery. On Sunday, the network kicked off its popular predator-infested extravaganza, Shark Week, with the premiere of a dramatized special that explores the existence of prehistoric sharks called megalodons. "With a whole week of Shark Week programming ahead of us, we wanted to explore the possibilities of Megalodon," Sorensen said.
