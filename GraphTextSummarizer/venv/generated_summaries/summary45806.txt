The failure to file criminal charges against Wilson, of course, should not be seen as a vindication of Wilson, the Ferguson police force or police officers generally. It now appears likely that Darren Wilson, the police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, who shot and killed Michael Brown, will never face criminal charges for his actions. How can better training of officers, more diversity in police forces and community policing make our communities safer? How do white police officers behave in largely minority communities? There is much more work to do, regardless of what happens to Darren Wilson, or any other individual.
