Tobacco giants suing FDA over warning labels mandate Several other lawsuits over the labels are pending in federal court, part a two-decade federal and state effort to force tobacco companies to limit their advertising and settle billions of dollars in state and private class-action claims over the health dangers of smoking. FDA reveals bigger, graphic warning labels for cigarette packages The Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids said it believed the appeals court ruling was wrong on science and the law. The Department of Justice has sent a letter to House Speaker John Boehner saying it will not ask the U.S. Supreme Court to review a federal appeals court ruling that blocked new graphic warnings on cigarette packages. The word and image warning labels would have covered half of the cigarette packs sold at retail outlets and 20% of cigarette advertising. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration instead will "undertake research to support a new rule-making consistent with the Tobacco Control Act," the FDA said in a written statement, meaning the agency will have to create new warning labels to comply with the 2009 law.
