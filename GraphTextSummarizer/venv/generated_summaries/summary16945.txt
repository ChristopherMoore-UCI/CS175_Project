Despite Hall's successes at Middle Georgia and Northwest Florida, he wasn't quite up for the task of playing NCAA ball. But through the diligence and tenacity that has been a signature of the No. 9-seeded Shockers' historic run into the Final Four (they're the second-lowest seed to ever make it this far), Hall has demonstrated he was game for a comeback. You can ask the No. 2-seeded Ohio State Buckeyes about it -- that is, if they're willing to talk after Hall's six swatted shots helped the Shockers sink the favored Big Ten opponent last weekend. When coach Scott Moe heard of the development, he told Hall he could return to Middle Georgia, the Journal-Constitution reported. That upset came two days after a 72-58 dismantling of the LaSalle Explorers -- on the back of Hall's 16-point, eight-rebound, three-block performance -- and a week after the Shockers lived up to their name by edging out the Gonzaga Bulldogs, one of the tournament's top-seeded teams.
