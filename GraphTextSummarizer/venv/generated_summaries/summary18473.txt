" Neil deGrasse Tyson on "Cosmos" debut "One of our mission statements in 'Cosmos' is to present science with all of its glory and the majesty and the mystery and the wonder -- the things we all take for granted as children," Tyson said on Sunday's "Reliable Sources." "I'll be eagerly tuning in for future episodes," wrote the Los Angeles Times' Jennifer Ouellette, praising Tyson as "affable" and "engaging" and noting the debut episode's lively use of ideas -- such as the "powers of 10" -- that could turn to clich√© in other hands. Its "ship of the imagination" -- a vehicle to take viewers through wonders large and small -- now has a new captain, astronomer Neil deGrasse Tyson, but the reaction to the show's debut shows that entertaining, informative science never goes out of style. Tyson told CNN's Brian Stelter that one of the ideas behind "Cosmos" is to reignite "that flame of curiosity in us all. Tyson acknowledged that he's bothered about the debate between science and religion that's became a mainstay of political campaigns and op-ed pages.
