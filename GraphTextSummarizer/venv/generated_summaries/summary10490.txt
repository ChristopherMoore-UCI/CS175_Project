"Starting actually from the 'Ocarina of Time,' the developers were more eager to make more sophisticated movements of the sword competition." Eiji Aonuma, who directed his first "Zelda" a decade ago and produced the most recent game, has said he expects future games in the series to use the type of precise sword controls from "Skyward Sword." The realistic swordplay in "The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword" for the Wii console will become central to the series, according to Nintendo executives who produce the games. "We make it so that you can feel as if you have actually shot the arrow with your bow." "Skyward Sword" is not the first "Zelda" game for the Wii. Adding realistic sword movement to "Skyward Sword" appears to be a winning formula. "When we look at today's fighting games and many other games, sometimes we have to feel it's rather difficult for us to realize the perfect balance between what you are actually doing with your hand against what you can see and realize or reproduce on your TV set," Miyamoto said.
