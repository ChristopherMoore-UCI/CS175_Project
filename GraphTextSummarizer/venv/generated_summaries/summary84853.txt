A visitation was set for Hewlin at Burr Funeral Home in Chardon ahead of Tuesday's funeral Mass, the same day accused shooter T.J. Lane heads back to court. Authorities say Lane, 17, is charged with three counts of aggravated murder, two of attempted aggravated murder and one of felonious assault. Prosecutor David Joyce filed charges against Lane in juvenile court. His parents had both been charged with domestic violence against each other, according to court documents. The defendant's next court appearance will be Tuesday, and a hearing scheduled for March 19 will discuss a motion to transfer his case to an adult court.
