Fort Hood victims feel betrayed A U.S.-born citizen of Palestinian descent, Hasan had been scheduled to deploy to Afghanistan before the killings. -- Crime-scene testimony dominated Tuesday's proceedings in the court-martial of admitted Fort Hood gunman Nidal Hasan, with an FBI agent describing the "chaotic" scene of the 2009 massacre. Prosecutors allege the devout Muslim had undergone a "progressive radicalization," giving presentations in defense of suicide bombings and about soldiers conflicted between military service and their religion when such conflicts result in crime. Hasan, an Army psychiatrist who was paralyzed by a police bullet during the rampage, admitted at the start of the trial August 6 that he opened fire in the processing center where soldiers were being prepared for deployment to Afghanistan and Iraq. Special Agent Susan Martin, a member of the team that collected evidence from the processing center where Hasan is accused of killing 13 people and wounding 32, said seven bodies were visible from the moment she walked in the door.
