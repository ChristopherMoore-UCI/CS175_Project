Winder police went to the home of the brothers' father on Monday, acting on information from Pensacola police, Winder Police Chief Dorsey said. William and Christopher Cormier are being detained as the investigation continues, and the twins are known locally for their traveling and playing poker, said Winder Police Chief Dennis Dorsey. In the yard, police unearthed a body in a plastic storage container that had been encased with concrete, Dorsey said. An autopsy was being conducted Tuesday to determine if the remains belong to former crime reporter Sean Dugas, 30, of the Pensacola News Journal, who has been missing since August 27, said Pensacola Police Capt. Twin 31-year-old brothers have been arrested on an accusation of concealing the death of another person, said police in Winder, Georgia, where the body was found.
