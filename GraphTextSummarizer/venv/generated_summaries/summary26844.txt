Mogadishu's Aden Abdulle International Airport -- which was essentially out of commission prior to 2010 following years of civil war, in-fighting and a reign of terror brought on by Al Qaeda -backed terrorist group Al Shabaab -- has been expanding. For ordinary people, as well as UN peacekeepers, flying domestically is really the best way to go," says Christos Shepherd, head of business development and start-up airlines at aviation consulting firm Mango Aviation Partners. Al Shabaab was forced out two years ago, allowing some local businesses to reopen and Aden Abdulle to beef up its security, which is currently under the purview of the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM), the Somalia Civil Aviation and Meteorology Authority, the Somali police, the Somali National Security Agency, and SKA International Group -- the consulting firm charged with the airline's renaissance. Last month, Air Uganda started flying three times a week to Mogadishu, and last year, Turkish Airways became the first major commercial airline to service the Somali capital in over 20 years. African Express cites 90% occupancy, and Turkish Airlines says the load factor is increasing.
