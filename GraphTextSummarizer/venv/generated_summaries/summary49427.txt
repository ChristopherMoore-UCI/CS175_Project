Nowadays, capturing video is far easier (whether you use a video camera, a digital still camera with video capability or even a cell phone), as is the sharing: YouTube has proved that millions of folks have learned to upload video to a computer and instantly e-mail a link to family and friends. Whether you use a video camera, a digital still camera with video capability, or even a cell phone, capturing video has never been easier. While YouTube remains a popular venue for sharing vacation videos, Web sites specifically targeting travelers are also springing up. Although Zoom And Go claims to have the largest collection of travel videos on the Internet (more than 14,000), the clips are rarely longer than a minute, providing just a cursory glimpse of a hotel lobby or a tourist destination. Travelistic also doesn't restrict who can post videos, so some material on the site comes from tourism promoters.
