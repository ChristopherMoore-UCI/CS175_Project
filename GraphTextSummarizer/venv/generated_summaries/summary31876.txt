Town officials said Monday night Gov. Robert Bentley was crucial to the effort. Hallmark and Keith Morrow, Hackleburg's only doctor, told CNN Monday night the announcement may eventually draw new employers and convince others that hadn't started rebuilding to do so. Nancy McCarley, who co-owns the Panther Mart convenience store, likened the excitement Monday night of residents in their 50s and 60s to kids on prom night. "It feels like the weight of the world has been lifted off your shoulders," said Hackleburg Police Chief Kenny Hallmark. The announcement by VF Corp. elicited joyous responses by Hackleburg, Alabama, residents -- many of whom honked their horns -- and on Facebook pages that had followed the developments.
