My main concern for the newest nation in the world is not tribalism or corruption -- though they both exist, it's the fact that we are still at war with the National Congress (NCP) of Sudan, the governing official party of Sudan, and this needs to be permanently addressed before moving onto smaller issues. While we were beginning the countdown to independence the NCP, which is headed by Sudan President Omar Hassan Ahmad Al Bashir, raided Abyei and forced innocent people from their land. I was born into Sudan's civil war and before I could read or write I was using an AK47 in the conflict between the Muslim north and Animist/Christian south over the land and natural resources. The Republic of South Sudan is still a baby; our leaders should be willing to take small steps towards developments and not move too fast. To do this we need to work together with world powers while ensuring that the resulting plans hold the interests of South Sudan at heart.
