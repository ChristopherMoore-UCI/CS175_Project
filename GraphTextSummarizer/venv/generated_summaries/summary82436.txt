-- German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble is visiting Athens on Thursday for the first time since Greece received its first bailout three years ago, hours after the Greek parliament voted through a bill paving the way for thousands of public sector jobs to be cut. A total of 15,000 are expected to be out of work by the end of 2014 to comply with the requirements of Greece's lenders, the International Monetary Fund, European Union and European Central Bank, which are asking for a slimming down of Greece's inflated public sector. His visit also comes a day ahead of a European Union deadline for Greece to meet targets before it gets its next round of bailout money. On Tuesday, Greek unions called the country's fourth general strike of the year so far, bringing many public services to a halt. Many Greeks believe the private sector has suffered a disproportionate amount during the crisis in order not to shed public sector jobs.
