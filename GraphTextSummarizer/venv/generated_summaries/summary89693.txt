After his suspension by the BBC, Clarkson changed his Twitter profile to "I am probably a presenter on the BBC2 motoring show,Top Gear." However, it said the programs would be rescheduled and that all other live dates would "run as scheduled." Hall said the BBC would "look to renew 'Top Gear' for 2016" and that he had asked BBC controller Kim Shillinglaw to "look at how we put out the last programs in the current series." MacQuarrie said Clarkson made a number of attempts to apologize over subsequent days and had reported the incident to BBC management. Last week, Clarkson launched into an expletive-filled rant at a charity auction in north London, verbally attacking his BBC bosses. According to the BBC website, Clarkson is credited with changing the face of modern motoring journalism.
