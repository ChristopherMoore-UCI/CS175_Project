Cooper and Schave have made it their job to compile details on those who have killed or been killed while staying at the Cecil. Not an ordinary hotel Schave and Cooper have theories about why the Cecil's past has been so sordid. Jack Unterweger worked as a journalist covering Los Angeles crime for an Austrian magazine in 1991 when he moved into the Cecil. Helen Gurnee, in her 50s, leaped from a seventh floor window, landing on the Cecil Hotel marquee on October 22, 1954, Cooper said.
