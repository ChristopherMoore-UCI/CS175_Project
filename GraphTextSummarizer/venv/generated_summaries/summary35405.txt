Review: 'Hercules' needs better Dwayne Johnson Ben Affleck will be a great Batman, Adam West says CLICK HERE to Try 2 RISK FREE issues of Entertainment Weekly © 2011 Entertainment Weekly and Time Inc. -- Three years ago, director Luc Besson tried to do prestige, directing an Oscar-bait biopic about Burmese political dissident Aung San Suu Kyi titled "The Lady." On paper, "Lucy" is nothing more than a standard Milla Jovovich action movie, but Besson amps it up by going way past the recommended dosage of cinematic insanity. It didn't work out for anyone, but at least Besson is back where he clearly feels more at home: stylized violence punctuated by surreal chaos. The whiplash imagery and frenetic editing give the audience a contact high of sorts—was that a freakin' dinosaur?—transforming what should be ridiculous into genuine bizarro excitement.
