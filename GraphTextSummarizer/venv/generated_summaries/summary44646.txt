-- Officials in Mexico's Chiapas state postponed classes Friday for more than 1 million students in an effort to avoid a resurgence of H1N1 flu, which has sickened thousands throughout Mexico this year. Parents were previously advised to keep their children out of school for seven days after the end of a fever caused by H1N1. In Mexico City, officials shut down all bars, theaters and public gathering places and limited restaurants to take-out orders. Chiapas Education Secretary Javier Alvarez Ramos and state Health Secretary James Gomez Montes said classes will start August 31 for middle and high school students and September 7 for elementary pupils, the state-run Notimex news agency said. The first cases of H1N1, also called swine flu, were confirmed in Mexico in April.
