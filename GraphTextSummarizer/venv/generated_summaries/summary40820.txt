Although the initial police report said it was decided that the "contact was incidental," the complaint alleged that it was sexual battery because Ray J did "unlawfully touch an intimate part" of the woman for the "specific purpose of sexual arousal, sexual gratification and sexual abuse." The vandalism, battery and resisting arrest charges stemmed from what happened after police arrived at the hotel. The singer-reality TV star was charged last month with four misdemeanor counts of sexual battery, vandalism, resisting arrest and battery. Norwood "became belligerent with the valets and refused to leave," despite repeated requests by hotel security, the police statement said. Ray J Norwood pleaded no contest to trespassing to settle charges that he grabbed a woman's buttocks, smashed a police car window and spat on a cop, a prosecutor said Thursday.
