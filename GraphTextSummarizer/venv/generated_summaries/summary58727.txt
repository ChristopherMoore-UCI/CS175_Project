Durrant said Delta has refunded the fee to transport Ty, and workers are still diligently searching for the dog, including in Los Angeles-area shelters as Ty was microchipped, according to Ramano. Ramano said he booked Ty on the October 31 Delta flight from Los Angeles to Tampa because he would be in Florida for several weeks and didn't want to leave his best friend behind. A Delta representative told CNN that the airline is doing everything it can to aid in the search for Ty. At the time of the adoption, Ramano was homeless and bouncing from motel to motel. He's like my best friend," Ramano said of the 6-year-old dog, whom he rescued last year from a shelter in North Hollywood.
