Astro Teller, head of Google Glass development at Google X research labs, admitted as much. Google is moving to fix the basic issues that dogged Google Glass by making product improvements, utilizing eyewear expertise, including a leader with fashion  experience, and taking advantage of a big gun for strategic guidance -- But, in one sense, it treats consumers like guinea pigs: a company such as Google invents a test product such as Google Glass, throws it into the marketplace and asks people to actually pay (in Google Glass' case: $1,500) for the privilege of beta testing their unfinished brainstorm. "Glasshole" was the word people invented to describe Google Glass wearers. The team looked inside Google to the technology they could produce, to make Google Glass, and they didn't fully understand what value Google Glass would play in people's lives.
