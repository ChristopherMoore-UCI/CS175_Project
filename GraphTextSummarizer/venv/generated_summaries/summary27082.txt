NBA charges Sterling, schedules June 3 vote NBA commissioner: League will oust Sterlings Silver said on Tuesday he is confident the league will be able to force the Sterlings to sell the franchise for violating the NBA constitution, though the new commissioner would prefer they sell the team without the league's pushing. The Times reported that the NBA document it obtained accuses the billionaire real estate investor of trying to persuade V. Stiviano to tell a league investigator she altered the recording and it wasn't Sterling making racist remarks on the audio. While the NBA states in document that the Sterlings went to dinner after the scandal broke and Shelly Sterling appeared to defend her husband from media charges of racisim, O'Donnell explained that it was Donald Sterling's birthday. The wife of Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling claims the two are just business partners and denies she was involved in the team's response in the hours after racist comments by her husband were released online, Shelly Sterling's attorney said Wednesday. According to the story, the NBA alleges Sterling and Stiviano met on May 2, about a week after the recording containing racist remarks was released by TMZ and just before Stiviano was interviewed by Barbara Walters on ABC.
