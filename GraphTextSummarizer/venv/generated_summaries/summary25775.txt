"I can't believe it," O'Connor said in in a speech at the Boys & Girls Clubs of America's national conference in San Diego on Wednesday. On Wednesday, O'Connor announced an expansion of that program to include the Boys & Girls Club of America, which has almost 4,000 clubs serving 4.1 million youngsters. -- Retired Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, the first woman to sit on the U.S. Supreme Court after 191 years, is crusading to reverse what she says is an alarming decline in America's knowledge of democracy and announced an initiative Wednesday to educate children across the country. "Many states around the country are no longer teaching or requiring civics education for young people," said O'Connor, 82. Asserting that democracy is not inherited at birth but rather learned in school, O'Connor founded the educational nonprofit group iCivics in 2009 to secure America's governance and prepare the next generation of citizens and leaders.
