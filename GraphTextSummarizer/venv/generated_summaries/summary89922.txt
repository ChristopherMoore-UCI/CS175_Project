When asked to respond to Middleton's comment, Morgan said, "How long has Mr. Middleton been a law enforcement officer? "How would anybody feel getting shot?" Still visibly angry, Roy Middleton, 60, sat down with CNN for his first television interview since sheriff's deputies mistook him for a car thief and shot at him 15 times in his driveway, outside his own car. At this time Mr. Middleton was a suspect at that time. Escambia County sheriff's deputies were responding to a neighbor's 911 call when they arrived in Middleton's Pensacola neighborhood early in the morning on July 27. According to Sheriff David Morgan, Middleton did not respond to their commands and kept going into and out of the car.
