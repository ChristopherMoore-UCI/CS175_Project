It's time for Apple to "step up or shut up" when it comes to launching new products, according to brand expert Jonathan Gabay. The rumors, whether true or not, are "typical Apple" before a big earnings report, according to Gabay, who is an author and speaker on brands. " Gabay said the pressure is mounting on Apple boss Tim Cook -- who took over as chief executive officer in 2011 following the death of Jobs, the company's founder -- to come up with a product that will inject life back into the company. The company's stock price has dropped 40%  over the past 10 months and in April Apple announced that earnings fell year-over-year for the first time since late 2003. The Wall Street Journal reports that Apple is experimenting with iPhone screen sizes larger than the current four inches while also trying out larger iPads with a gigantic 13-inch display.
