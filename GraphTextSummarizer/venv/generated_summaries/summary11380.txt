Andre Johnson was severely injured in April after he severed his penis and leaped from the second level of a building in North Hollywood. Johnson said he hadn't spoken out on the incident before because "People perceived me as crazy, so I never wanted to speak wholeheartedly on the matter." Doctors weren't able to reattach the penis, he told E!. " Johnson performs under the name Christ Bearer and his group Northstar was affiliated with the Wu-Tang Clan. "Yes, I was using drugs that night, but I was in complete control," he said. He told E! that he was under the influence of drugs at the time but insisted that he knew what he was doing.
