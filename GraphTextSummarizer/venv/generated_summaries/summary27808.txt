World leaders have already pledged to fight the rise of protectionism, and it will be on the APEC agenda as leaders look to U.S. President Obama to help forge global agreements. I think probably the most concrete thing we'll see out of APEC this week is a recommitment to free trade and the importance of free trade. Now, it's only fitting really that APEC gathers here this year to talk about the critical issue of global trade. U.S. Army Major Nidal Malik Hasan, a 39-year-old psychiatrist assigned to Darnell Medical Center here at Fort Hood, has been charged with 13 specifications of premeditated murder. He wants APEC to move faster to liberalize trade, but his key concern is protectionism.
