A Japanese diplomat was wounded when armed men tried to kidnap him in the Yemeni capital of Sanaa on Sunday morning, three Interior Ministry officials said. The Japanese embassy in Sanaa confirmed the attempted kidnapping and said the diplomat is being treated for minor wounds in a Sanaa hospital. While kidnapping has long been a problem in Yemen, with tribes often using foreign nationals as a bargain chip in their dealings with the central government, the past 24 months have proven even more dangerous for foreigners. Al Qaeda has been running kidnapping bids for well over a year, targeting foreigners. The attackers fled the scene, the Yemeni Interior Ministry said.
