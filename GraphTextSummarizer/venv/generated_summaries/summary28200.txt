" Steven Allen Adams, the West Virginia Watchdog managing editor who also works for the conservative-leaning Public Policy Foundation of West Virginia, cited an unnamed source who said Manchin was the target of the probe. The statement came after West Virginia Watchdog, a state chapter of the nonprofit Franklin Center for Government and Public Integrity, reported the subpoenas are part of a federal grand jury investigation into work done at the Governor's Mansion in Charleston. -- The Department of Justice served the state of West Virginia two subpoenas this week, the governor's office said late Friday, adding that they had "not been informed that Governor [Joe] Manchin or any other state employee is under investigation." West Virginia Watchdog asked for contracts and records for businesses that have done work at the mansion. Manchin's office said in a written statement that neither of the two subpoenas "was directed to Governor Manchin or the Governor's Office" and that "no individual" in his office was served.
