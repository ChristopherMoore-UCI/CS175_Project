Bachmann said she is not disappearing and vows to keep fighting for America, a thought I'm sure makes Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus cringe. "I fully anticipate the mainstream liberal media to put a detrimental spin on my decision not to seek a fifth term," Bachmann said in a nearly nine-minute video in which she announced that she is not seeking re-election. The fact is, the brand of spitfire politics Bachmann, Palin et al. employ is usually not patient or intelligent. Bachmann looks forward to future, but not in the House Bachmann said it was worse than Watergate, and no, she presented no evidence to support such claims. In another example of what has become the norm for conservatives who become annoyed by facts, Bachmann pointed a finger at the so-called mainstream liberal media and not at her former national field coordinator, Peter Waldron, who filed an ethics complaint.
