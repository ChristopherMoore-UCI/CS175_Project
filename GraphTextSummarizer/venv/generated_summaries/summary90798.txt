Amy Davis stepped in as city clerk; she knows Hampton, having worked as the clerk once before. The battle for the 89-year-old city's survival began in February with the release of a scathing audit that read like a textbook of municipal malfeasance -- finding 31 violations of local, state and federal codes, along with allegations of nepotism, double-dipping and personal use of city property. Only later did someone come up with the idea that there was plenty of easy money to be made from catching speeders and writing tickets, just like neighboring cities Waldo and Lawtey were doing. He and other city officials suspected it would be bad. 2011 was Hampton's bumper year for tickets -- and it was the year Van Zant was caught by Hampton's radar guns.
