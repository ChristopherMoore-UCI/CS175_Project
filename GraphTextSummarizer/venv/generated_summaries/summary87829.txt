Sergio Cabral, the governor of Rio de Janeiro state, declared three days of mourning for the victims, while state-run Agencia Brasil reported Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff expressed her solidarity with the people of Rio de Janeiro, "especially with the families of those who were affected by this catastrophe. Four people died and 22 remained missing after the collapse of three buildings in the historic center of Rio de Janeiro, Mayor Eduardo Paes said Thursday, according to CNN affiliate TV Record. The buildings were  just steps from the emblematic Municipal Theater, where U.S. President Barack Obama gave a speech last year. When I looked up, I saw the top floors falling," maintenance worker Julio Cesar de Oliveira Brandao said. Witnesses told Band TV that neighboring buildings swayed, as if there had been an earthquake.
