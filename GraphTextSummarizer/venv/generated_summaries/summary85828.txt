U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Saturday that "we need to close ... gaps" with Iran in talks about its nuclear program, adding that those negotiating with Iranian officials "are deeply committed to ensuring that Iran does not obtain a nuclear weapon." Iran faces a March 24 deadline to reach a deal about its nuclear program. Iranian minister: Some consider peace an 'existential threat' Officials in Tehran have publicly insisted they want a nuclear program for energy purposes, not to create atomic weaponry. Kerry said one thing all members of the P5+1 group -- which consists of the United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom and France, plus Germany -- agree on is that it's imperative Iran doesn't develop nuclear arms. Iran's prepared to take the steps to answer the questions that the world has a right to get answers to," Kerry said. Speaking in Paris alongside French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius, Kerry said progress has been made "but there remain gaps, divergences."
