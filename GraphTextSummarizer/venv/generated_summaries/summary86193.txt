-- Grammy-winning music producer Phil Spector, 69, has been moved to a California prison to serve his sentence of 19 years to life for killing actress Lana Clarkson, corrections officials said. Phil Spector will serve time at the California Substance Abuse Treatment Facility and State Prison. It functions like a general population yard, Thornton said, "but it is for inmates with safety concerns, such as celebrities, gang dropouts or those whose crimes make them a target of other prisoners. Spector is not the first celebrity to serve a sentence at the facility south of Fresno; actor Robert Downey Jr. served time there in 1999 for probation violation of a drug charge. Although it is in Corcoran, it is a separate facility from Corcoran State Prison, where Charles Manson is serving his life sentence.
