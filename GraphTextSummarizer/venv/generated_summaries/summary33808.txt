Because supernovae change brightness very quickly compared with galaxies (months compared with billions of years for galaxies), we quickly diverted the Keck telescope from our intended targets to SN2014J. Our galaxies will look the same another night, but the supernova won't. Careful observations of Type Ia supernovae across the universe were essential to measuring the expansion history of the universe over billions of years. But space is also huge, and there are billions of galaxies. The reason Type Ia supernovae are special is their uniformity. The "supernova" (as such stellar explosions are called) was a special, rare "Type Ia" -- the kind that led to the Nobel-worthy discovery of dark energy.
