The lawyers have claimed that authorities based the indictment on testimony from Tina Watson's immediate family and a sole Helena, Alabama, investigator, saying of the witnesses "none could offer more than emotional testimony and hearsay. " The doctrine of double jeopardy -- which says that a person cannot be tried or punished twice for the same crime -- does not apply in Watson's case, according to established legal precedent, legal experts have said. Glascow noted that Tina Watson's father, in a sworn statement, said Watson asked her to maximize her life insurance and make him a beneficiary shortly before their wedding. David Gabriel "Gabe" Watson is scheduled to face murder and kidnapping charges on May 23 in an Alabama courtroom, court officials said. Then, in late November, Watson was arrested in Los Angeles after a grand jury in Alabama indicted Watson on two counts -- murder for pecuniary gain and kidnapping where a felony occurred, authorities said.
