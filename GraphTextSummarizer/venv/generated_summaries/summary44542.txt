An 18-year-old suspect in Tuesday's bus-stop shootings that wounded seven people in Detroit, Michigan, surrendered to authorities Wednesday, police said. " Detroit Police Chief James Barren said Jamall Turner is one of two suspects in the shootings, which occurred at a bus stop near Cody High School after summer-school classes had ended for the day. On Tuesday, police took another person into custody in an arrest that was not related to the shootings, "but we believe that the arrested individual may shed light on the bus-stop shooting," he said. Deputy Police Chief James W. Tolbert said three of the victims remained hospitalized Wednesday with wounds that were not life-threatening. He said police believe that semiautomatic handguns were used.
