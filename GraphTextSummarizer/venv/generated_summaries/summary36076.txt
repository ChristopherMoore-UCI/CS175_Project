Even though oil has not flowed from the well site since July 15, seven Panhandle counties including Escambia, Santa Rosa, Okaloosa, Walton, Bay, Gulf and Franklin are to remain under an extended state of emergency in order to qualify for economic aid under state and federal disaster guidelines. -- Three weeks after BP plugged its crippled Macondo oil well in the Gulf of Mexico with cement and mud from above, crews are "fishing" for pieces of drill pipe that need to be removed from inside the well's blowout preventer before crews can move on to the "bottom kill" -- the permanent fix for the well. Seven Panhandle counties -- Escambia, Santa Rosa, Okaloosa, Walton, Bay, Gulf and Franklin -- are to remain under an extended state of emergency in order to qualify for economic aid, Crist's office said in a statement. Thad Allen, the man in charge of the government response to the Gulf oil crisis, said Wednesday that the "fishing" operations had been delayed by a buildup of hydrates -- chemicals that form at low temperatures and high pressures toward the sea floor -- that temporarily jammed the cap that trapped oil in the well starting on July 15. BP definitely plans to remove at least two smaller, cut pieces of pipe, but the status of a third, longer piece of drill pipe is unclear -- and that will affect how crews proceed, Allen said.
