"I believe that Pablo Neruda was murdered, because Pablo Neruda was a very relevant figure in history, as much in this country as in the world," Araya told CNN Chile earlier this year. But the results haven't stopped skepticism from one member of Neruda's family, who told CNN Chile that he's still pushing for answers about what caused the poet's 1973 death. Neruda died on September 23, 1973, just 12 days after a right-wing military coup ousted socialist President Salvador Allende and brought Gen. Augusto Pinochet to power. "No relevant chemical agents that could be linked to Mr. Pablo Neruda's death have been found," the report said. Last week's report from a team of scientists said investigators found "no forensic evidence" to support that Neruda had been killed by anything other than natural causes.
