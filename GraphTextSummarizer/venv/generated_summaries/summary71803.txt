He famously left his first team, the Cleveland Cavaliers, via free agency in 2010, teaming up with Heat star Dwyane Wade and fellow free agent Chris Bosh in Miami. The world of social media buzzed Tuesday with speculation about where he might end up, the excitement fueled by the recent decision of James' buddy, Carmelo Anthony of the New York Knicks, to also try free agency. The Miami Heat star and four-time league MVP has decided to exercise his contract's early termination option, meaning he'll be a free agent July 1, a source close to him told CNN's Rachel Nichols on Tuesday. James' move would set up the 29-year-old star for a possible departure from Miami, where he has played the last four seasons, reaching four league finals and winning two championships. James is a rarity, an athlete so dominating that his personality transcends the sport.
