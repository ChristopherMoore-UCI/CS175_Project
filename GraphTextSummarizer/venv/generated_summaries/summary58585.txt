The African Union this year urged the court to delay war crimes proceedings against Sudan's president, saying a decision allowing genocide charges harms efforts to bring peace to Darfur. To counter the rebels, Sudanese authorities armed and cooperated with Arab militias that went from village to village in Darfur, killing, torturing and raping residents, according to the U.N., Western governments and human rights organizations. The court has issued two warrants for al-Bashir's arrest for his alleged role in a five-year campaign of violence in Darfur, in western Sudan. United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said through a spokesman that it was up to countries that are party to the court "to live up to their obligations as they see fit." "Of course he said repeatedly that... there are charges that have been put forward by the prosecutor for the International Criminal Court and these charges are very serious," Ban's spokesman, Martin Nesirky, said Wednesday. -- The president of Sudan, who is wanted by the International Criminal Court on allegations of war crimes and genocide, arrived Wednesday in Chad, Sudanese state-run Shorooq TV reported.
