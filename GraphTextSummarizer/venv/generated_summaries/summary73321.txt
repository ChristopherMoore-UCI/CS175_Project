Landrieu campaign spokesman Fabien Levy would not say why specifically Sullivan was replaced. "As Senator Landrieu has done in all of her races, she is bringing on some of her long-time and trusted advisers to assist during the last month of the race to lead us to victory on November 4.," Landrieu campaign spokesman Fabien Levy told CNN in an email. Ryan Berni, who ran her brother New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu's reelection campaign earlier this year, is now leading the reelection bid, and Landrieu also rang her former chief of staff Norma Jane Sabiston to advise the campaign. -- With less than a month until Election Day, Sen. Mary Landrieu is changing her reelection campaign's leadership. Current campaign manager Adam Sullivan will stay on as a senior adviser to the campaign. That seems unlikely according to the latest CNN/ORC poll, that showed her support stood at 43%, with Rep. Bill Cassidy coming in a close second with 40%.
