The fact that libraries don't charge late fees on overdue e-books isn't a big deal, she said. In the future, she expects new "Netflix models" for books to emerge, where libraries pay monthly fees to publishers, perhaps, and can lend out as many copies of a book as their patrons would like.

That's good for forgetful types, who can stash books away from weeks or decades before remembering they've borrowed them.
