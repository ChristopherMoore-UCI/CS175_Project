"These veterans served our country in time of war, but have waited three to eight years to receive the disability benefits which they've earned for their service," said Bart Stichman, co-executive director of the veterans advocacy group. He spent 14 months at war and returned home with a diagnosis that has become all too common for Iraq and Afghanistan veterans: post-traumatic stress disorder. Under the terms of a class-action lawsuit settlement announced Friday by a veterans advocacy group, those veterans will now receive lifetime disability benefits. Some were receiving benefits but will now receive higher compensation. Martin, a single father, was told he could no longer serve in the military due to his PTSD, but "was separated from the military without retirement benefits and a low disability rating, well below what the law stipulated," the veterans group said.
