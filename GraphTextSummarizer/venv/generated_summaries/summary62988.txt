Gans said many people believed this election's turnout would shatter the 2004 mark because of the high amount of early voters, including African-Americans and younger voters, who historically vote in lower numbers. Democrat Barack Obama's campaign is credited with building a sophisticated organization at local levels in key states that energized voters to register and to stand for hours in line to cast early ballots. -- Americans set a record for number of votes cast in this presidential election but failed to make history with the percentage of voter turnout, experts said. Twenty-two of those states and the District of Columbia reported an increase in voter turnout this year, the center said. McDonald, who also produced projections of voter turnout, estimated Friday that 130.9 million ballots were cast by 61.5 percent of Americans who were eligible to vote.
