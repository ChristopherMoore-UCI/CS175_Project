-- National Museum of American History Curator Peter Liebhold describes the day several years ago he spent going through shipping containers filled with debris from United Airlines Flight 93 as "overpowering," even though more than a year had passed since September 11, 2001, when the plane crashed into a field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania. But, they always worked through an intermediary so that those affected would be comfortable turning down their requests and would not have to say no face to face. Liebhold said that during the height of their collecting, he and his colleagues also communicated with family members and others affected by the attacks, to ask for other items related to September 11. "Every United Airlines plane over the exit door has a small American flag painted into the fuselage and we found the red-and-white stripes of the flag," Liebhold said. " More than 50 9/11 artifacts collected by curators from the American History Museum will be on display in a special exhibition called "September 11: Remembrance and Reflections."
