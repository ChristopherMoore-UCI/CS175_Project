The list of skills that participants will be learning include fire lighting, emergency shelter building, knife skills, remote medical trauma, rappelling, tyrolean traverses, extreme weather survival and white-water rafting down the Zambezi River. And of course, no Bear Grylls-branded survival course would be complete without a "Gross Eat" challenge -- lucky participants will be foraging for grubs and rodents. Designed by the "Man vs. Wild" host, the new African course is slated to launch January 2014 and will be run by a team of ex-military/ex-marine survival experts, all of whom have worked with Grylls on the "Man vs. Wild" TV shows and have backgrounds in mountaineering and other outdoors expertise. Professional adventurer/survivor/"gross eats" expert Bear Grylls announced the expansion of his Survival Academy into Africa. The Survival Academy currently runs courses in the United Kingdom and the United States teaching advanced and beginner self-rescue skills to outdoor adventure enthusiasts.
