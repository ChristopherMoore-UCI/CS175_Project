Despite these eye exercises, rates of myopia in urban China have soared to nearly 90%, according to recent studies. "China has among the highest rates of myopia and it's the only country in the world that does eye exercises, so it's probably not working all that well," said Congdon. As people age, they can become at higher risk for severe eye disorders such as high myopia, glaucoma (optic nerve damage), cataracts (clouding of the lens) and retinal detachment. But researchers say there are serious implications of such high rates of myopia among young people. In China, students have been mandated by its education ministry to perform daily eye exercises.
