In Switzerland children enjoy an annual visit from a dynamic Christmas duo: Samichlaus -- Swiss-German for "St. Nick" -- and the black-clad henchman Schmutzli, his sidekick. Bavaria and Tirol -- two traditional regions of Germany and Austria -- are great for Christmas traditions. I was in Nurnberg producing a TV program about traditional European Christmas celebrations. But as Germans had a hard time getting their mind around baby Jesus giving gifts, the Christmas gift-giver gradually morphed into a sweet girl who was still called the Christ child (or Christkind). In southern Germany, a lovely angel named the Christkind charms wonderstruck children.
