Last week, Mexican Attorney General Eduardo Medina Mora said officials had found safety irregularities at the ABC day care center in 2005. ABC day care officials denied Monday ever being told of safety problems. In addition, she said, the government has not conducted any investigations to see if other day care centers are safe. Critics point to cozy business relationships between the owners of the ABC day care and government officials. The crowd chanted "renuncia, renuncia" ("resign, resign") toward the office of Sonora Gov. Eduardo Bours Castelo.
