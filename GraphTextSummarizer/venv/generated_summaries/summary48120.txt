HAYES: Back in the nation's capital, a memorial honoring Dr. Martin Luther King is scheduled for completion later this year. As Samantha Hayes reported yesterday, Americans all across the country took part in community service projects and honored Dr. King's legacy. In Atlanta, not far from King's childhood home, family members laid flowers at the gravesite where King and his wife Coretta Scott King are buried. It's for students who do well in high school and go to college in state. Amounts vary, but some students can get up to $6,000 a year for tuition, fees and books at any eligible Georgia university or technical school.
