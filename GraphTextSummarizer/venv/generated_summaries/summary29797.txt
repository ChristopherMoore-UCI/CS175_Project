-- Northern Michigan University officials say the situation "is under control" after a telephone threat against students, faculty and others prompted a lockdown of the Marquette, Michigan, campus Wednesday morning. The Marquette Area Public Schools also sent students and staff home, interim superintendent Debra Veiht told CNN. Cindy Paavola, the university's director of community relations, said campus police took the threat seriously, thus prompting the administration to close the university as a precautionary measure. The administration closed the university at 8:20 a.m. Wednesday after campus police learned of a telephone caller who had earlier threatened to attack NMU. University officials locked down all buildings so no one could enter or leave, and told students living on campus to stay in their dormitories.
