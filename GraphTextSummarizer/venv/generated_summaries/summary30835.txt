Imagine if TMZ or Twitter was around when Marilyn Monroe was singing to President Kennedy or if smart phones were available to capture video of Mickey Mantle getting drunk in bars and picking up women. The first is the brave civil rights soldier who risked his life working side by side with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. At least for little while. The next to have their nice and shiny public persona ripped apart, doused with gas and set on fire -- done in by the always lethal combination of private shortcomings and stupidity. Heroes aren't supposed to do bad things.
