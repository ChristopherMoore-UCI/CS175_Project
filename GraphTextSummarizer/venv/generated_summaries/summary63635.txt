"CSI: Miami" (CBS: 10.8 million, 2.5): Viewers don't really crave and holler for a real ending on procedural crime dramas like they do for serialized shows like "Fringe." -- More than any year in recent memory, the survival of shows this season did not hinge on ratings. "GCB" (ABC: 7.4 million, 2.6): Diving in the ratings, and ABC has several similarly soapy dramas like "Nashville" and "Mistresses" ordered for next season (ABC's new trailers here) that could improve on these numbers. The ratings on "Alcatraz" keep sinking while the show, unlike other J.J. Abrams-produced dramas, wasn't hugely engaging for viewers. (And, yes, "Miami" cut for age/expense/ratings; "CSI: NY" is slightly younger, and helping hold the fort on tough Friday night).
