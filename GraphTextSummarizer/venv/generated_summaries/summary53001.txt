She described the mother, who gave police permission to search around her home and car, as cooperative. Other than the boy's mother and his 4-year-old sister, no one has reported seeing the toddler in the past two weeks, according to police spokeswoman Carla Iafrate. Search-and-rescue experts brought in to assist told police they do not believe the boy got out of the car and wandered off, according to Johnson. According to police, Sky Metalwala's mother said she ran out of gas in Bellevue, just east of Seattle, leaving the toddler in the car while she took her 4-year-old with her to get help. Julia Biryukova, the mother, said the young boy was gone when she returned to the vehicle about an hour later, according to police.
