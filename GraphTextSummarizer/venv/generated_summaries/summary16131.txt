The Wimbledon champion had lost his third round match at the Montreal Masters last week on his return to the circuit after his historic triumph, but made no mistake here. Fellow American Stephens shocked World No.3 Maria Sharapova Tuesday at the hard court tournament in Ohio where top billing is shared with the ATP event. He was joined in the third round by top seed Novak Djokovic, who beat Juan Monaco of Argentina 7-5 6-2. Twelve-time grand slam winner Rafael Nadal is also safely through after a straight-forward 6-2 6-2 defeat of world No. 100 Benjamin Becker. Fifth seed and defending champion Li Na recovered from a slow star to eventually beat American wildcard Lauren Davis 4-6 6-1 6-1, while No. 4 Agnieszka Radwanska won 10 games in a row to overcome Uzbekistani-born American Varvara Lepchenko 6-4 6-0.
