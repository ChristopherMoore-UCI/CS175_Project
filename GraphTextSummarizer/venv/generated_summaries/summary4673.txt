Since then, Big Boi has put out two solo albums -- 2010's "Sir Lucious Left Foot: The Son of Chico Dusty" and 2012's "Vicious Lies and Dangerous Rumors" -- while Andre 3000 contributed to singles by other artists and recently portrayed Jimi Hendrix in the biopic "All Is By My Side." Earlier this year, Andre 3000 and Big Boi appeared together on a remix of Frank Ocean's "Pink Matter," as well as a remix of T.I.'s "Sorry." Billboard's sources say there have been "some conversations" between Big Boi and Andre 3000, while another says it's "all systems go." The members of OutKast will reportedly end their hiatus next year at Coachella, according to Billboard. Around that same time, Big Boi tweeted with regard to Ocean's album, "Dre didn't want an Outkast Record Coming out on anybody else LP." But Andre was quick to dispel any inclination that it was an Outkast reunion.
