Judd: My mother owned a gallery and directed a college of art, and I spent my whole life in art classes. As the recycling coordinator for Santa Fe, to promote a weekend-long exhibit of recycled art, I threw together a little outfit made of bubble wrap. Her newest creation is "The Environmental Steward-ess," a 1940s air hostess suit sewn from leather seat covers donated by sponsor Delta Air Lines. I researched the super-heroine Wonder Woman, created in the 1940s -- the same era this type of suit was worn by Delta stewardesses -- by a psychologist to provide a strong role model for young girls. In college, I got a degree in art and sociology.
