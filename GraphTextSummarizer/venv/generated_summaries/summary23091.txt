Yemen has poured thousands of troops into a battle with al Qaeda fighters in two southern provinces amid new airstrikes that killed a dozen of the militants Thursday, security officials said. Yemeni warplanes have been bombarding al Qaeda hideouts all week in a series of U.S.-supported airstrikes on the southern provinces of Lahj and Abyan. On Tuesday security officials said at least 38 militants had been killed in 48 hours of continuous airstrikes, three of which had unspecified U.S. involvement. Three raids on Thursday killed 12 jihadists and destroyed large weapons caches near Jaar, in Abyan, with no losses among government forces, three security officials told CNN. Meanwhile, the government has put thousands of troops into the effort to flush out the al Qaeda fighters and tighten security in the surrounding areas, the officials said.
