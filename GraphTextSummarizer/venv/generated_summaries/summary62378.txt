The hijacking occurred earlier on Saturday when the Istanbul-bound Atlasjet Airlines flight from Cyprus was forced to make an emergency landing in southeastern Turkish city of Antalya after the hijackers claimed to have a bomb. Turkish Interior Minister Osman Gunes said one of the hijackers was Turkish while the other had a Syrian passport but may have been Palestinian, Reuters reported. Witnesses said the incident started shortly after the flight had taken off from Ercan airport in Turkish-recognized Northern Cyprus when two men from the back of the plane rushed to the front and tried to break open the cockpit door. I shouted 'hijackers' to warn the other passengers but most of them were asleep," he said. Antalya Governor Alaaddin Yuksel told reporters that one of the men had claimed to be a member of al Qaeda, Reuters reported.
