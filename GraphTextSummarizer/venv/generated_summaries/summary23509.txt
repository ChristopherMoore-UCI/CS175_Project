But IRS spokesman Dean Patterson called preventing identity theft "a top priority" for federal tax collectors and said, "we are committing significant resources to address the challenges posed in protecting taxpayers' identity information." "We have established a special unit dedicated to resolving tax issues incurred by identity theft victims and special tracking codes to monitor returns and prevent further fraud," Patterson said in a written statement. Some victims don't learn about identity theft until the IRS questions them about income in their name. " Baucus, who led a hearing into the issue in 2008, said other taxpayers don't learn that they are victims of identity theft until years later. "Potential identity theft victims can contact the IRS if they suspect fraud."
