But Redemption, like so many hospitals in Liberia, is closed or partially closed out of fear that Ebola patients will infect health care workers. "It's an outrage that children are dying of diseases, like measles, that are preventable and treatable." Even after death, Ebola -- a disease her son says she never had -- haunted Kanneh. Health care services, weak before Ebola, barely exist; vaccination rates, for example, have plummeted. Those aren't a typical symptom of Ebola; they're a complication of high blood pressure, which Kanneh had suffered from for years. Next, Kamara drove to ELWA Hospital, but learned it only takes Ebola patients.
