Tens of millions of the worm-like larvae have appeared in the northern part of the country, where they are destroying green crops like cabbage and collard greens and contaminating the water supply, Liberian Information Minister Laurance Bropleh told CNN Wednesday from the capital of Monrovia. There are also indications the bugs have spread to neighboring Guinea, Sierra Leone and Ivory Coast, Bropleh said. The infestation is "quite alarming," said Winfred Hammond, the FAO representative in Liberia. "The plague is being described as Liberia's worst in 30 years," the FAO said. -- Liberia's president has declared a state of emergency after hordes of ravenous caterpillars infested the country.
