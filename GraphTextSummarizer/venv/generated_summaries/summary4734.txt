There is no better example than the criticism being hurled at President Obama for the killing of Osama bin Laden. Had the attempt failed, Obama would have faced the same kind of political and policy disaster that confronted President Jimmy Carter after his helicopter rescue attempt of the Iran hostages crashed in April 1980. Naturally, Obama and his staff have capitalized fully on bin Laden and will continue to do so all the way to November. Instead of trying to diminish the accomplishment, Republicans would be better off conceding the point, congratulating Obama, and making the argument that the bin Laden mission was the exception that proves their contention that the president has failed to do what he promised in other spheres. Now President Obama is being reproached for taking too much credit for the success during his re-election campaign.
