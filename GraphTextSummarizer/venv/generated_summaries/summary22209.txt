31 children killed after bus catches fire in Colombia Overpass fires shut down Southern California overpass FedEx truck crashes into students' bus in California -- A tour bus crash with a big rig and two vehicles in California early Wednesday killed four people and injured nearly two dozen others near the Arizona border, according to the California Highway Patrol. "The pipes subsequently caused some of the vehicles to crash into them in the eastbound lanes and it appears they could have rolled into westbound traffic which is where the bus was traveling," Terri Kasinga of Caltrans told the TV station. The tour bus was traveling westbound on I-10 from El Paso, Texas, to Los Angeles and had just made a stop in Phoenix, the highway patrol told the affiliate. A truck carrying metal pipes jackknifed around 2 a.m. Wednesday on Interstate 10 near Blythe, sending the load across the highway and apparently into the opposite lane of traffic, where the tour bus was traveling, the station reported.
