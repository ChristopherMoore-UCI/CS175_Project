Al Mansour hopes that Wadjda will help to change attitudes to both women and films in Saudi Arabia. " Al Mansour said she is a judge in the Saudi Film Festival currently being held by Rotana Studios, but that the films are being shown on television because they are not allowed in movie theaters. It is a Saudi/German co-production, produced by the Berlin-based Razor Film Produktions with backing and support from Rotana Studios, launched by the Saudi Prince Al Waleed Bin Talal. Haifaa Al Mansour has just directed one of the first feature films ever to be made in Saudi Arabia. The film, called "Wadjda," after its protagonist, is billed as the first to be filmed entirely in Saudi Arabia with an all-Saudi cast.
