The two-minute video did exactly what it was intended to do: launch Weiner 2.0, promoting him as an earnest family man bursting with energy, ideas and promise, and offering to lead New York City as its chief executive. To most New York politicians, such obsessive media attention would be considered a gift from the gods.
