" How would you feel about your child using Google Glass at school? There's a long list of reasons why the most intriguing device in tech just isn't ready for school: Glass is expected to be more widely available toward the end of 2014, but the $1,500 price tag is a significant barrier for schools and teachers. "The possibilities are endless as more applications are developed for the device and as Glass gets into the hands of more teachers and students," said Kathy Schrock, a former librarian and technology consultant who serves on the board of International Society for Technology in Education. When a New Jersey high school student had to miss school for medical reasons, chemistry teacher Marc Seigel asked the student's friend to wear Glass during science labs and broadcast them to her in a Google+ hangout. An online group for Glass Explorers in Education lets users share similar stories and pose questions to the group of 612 members.
