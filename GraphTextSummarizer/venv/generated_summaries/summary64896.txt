-- Sony Computer Entertainment is making a big play in internet-connected hand-held gaming with a 3G-enabled PlayStation portable system and smartphone game platform unveiled Thursday. Called PlayStation Suite, the software will work on Android devices approved by Sony, which will probably include phones and tablets from Sony Ericsson. Other games include "Uncharted," "LittleBigPlanet" and "Wipeout." Games come on memory cards, and some can be downloaded directly to the device. PlayStation phones and the upcoming PlayStation hand-held, with its built-in 3G service, will have a major focus on social networking features, Sony said. Sony is doing away with the mini discs it pushed with the original PlayStation Portable.
