(Mashable)  -- The Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) has teamed up with Facebook to reduce the amount of hate speech and anti-gay bullying that goes on around the internet. Facebook Public Policy Communications Manager Andrew Noyes wrote in an email today that Facebook "intends to work closely with GLAAD and other LGBT organizations on future initiatives." Still, the largest online destination for many beleaguered gay teens and young adults is Facebook -- ironically, one of the platforms where hate speech, though prohibited, is unfortunately still carried out. Members of the gay community reached out to GLAAD recently when a Facebook page created to remember the victims of anti-gay bullying who had committed suicide was flooded with hateful, violent and derogatory remarks and images. Today, Facebook announced that they're making new efforts to respond quickly when hateful speech violates the terms of service and needs to be removed.
