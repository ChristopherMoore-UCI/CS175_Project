Old Jewish Cemetery, Prague It's a curious thing to stand on a city street and look up -- way up -- to spot the cemetery. Spread over 210 acres, and divided into elegant streets and boulevards, the Cementerio General has massive tombs designed to resemble Mayan temples, Venetian palazzos and other grand structures â€” they're so huge, you might start to wonder whether any living family members could be inside, too.
