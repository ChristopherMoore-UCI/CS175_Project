The European Union Naval Force Somalia is a multinational task force with the mission to escort merchant vessels carrying humanitarian aid of the World Food Program and vessels of the African Union Mission in Somalia. -- The hijacking of a container ship in the Indian Ocean Friday afternoon is evidence of a "constantly expanding area of pirate activity" off the Africa coast, military officials said. Pirate attacks have become a frequent hazard for sailors off Somalia, which has had no effective central government since 1991. Despite a crackdown by an international naval flotilla in the region, pirates managed to seize 35 ships in the region between January and September, according to the International Maritime Bureau, which monitors attacks. The mission is "to protect vulnerable ships in the Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean and to deter and disrupt piracy," it said.
