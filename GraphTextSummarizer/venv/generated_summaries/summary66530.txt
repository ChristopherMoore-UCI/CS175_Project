A timeline released by the state Department of Corrections details what occurred after Lockett's execution was abruptly halted and a shade was lowered, blocking the view of witnesses. -- Between 5:27 p.m. and 6:18 p.m., he is examined by a phlebotomist, who examines his arms, legs and feet for appropriate veins to administer drugs. The doctor's answer to both questions: "No." Lockett's attempted execution was carried out Tuesday at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester, where he had been housed following his conviction and death sentence for shooting Stephanie Nieman and then watching as two others buried her alive in 1999. There is nothing in the timeline that echoes the statements of witnesses, primarily journalists, who said 16 minutes into the execution Lockett was writhing in pain and appeared to be conscious. Other reporters -- including Cary Aspinwall of the Tulsa World newspaper -- claimed that Lockett was "still alive," having lifted his head while prison officials lowered the blinds, blocking the view of the proceedings.
