At this year's South by Southwest Interactive Festival, considered a sort of mashup of the Super Bowl and spring break for the tech elite, Austin startup accelerator Capital Factory is launching a contest to "move your company to Austin. He's been nicknamed the "Austinpreneur" for his efforts to to nurture Austin startups and attract new ones. The winning company will receive a package of prizes worth around $100,000 donated by Austin area businesses. This year over 25,000 people from all over the world are traveling to Austin for networking, demoing products, and to find out what's next in tech. "We were once bootstrapped ourselves, so our goal is just to offer some resources and advice to other companies that want to make it happen in Austin," he said.
