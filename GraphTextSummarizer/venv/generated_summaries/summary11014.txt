"Immediately after the earthquake and tsunami we, as a team, wondered if we should, and could, continue to play soccer," the team's coach, Makoto Teguramori, told CNN. "The disaster in Sendai region has inspired the players, staff, and the entire Vegalta Sendai club with great performances and results," explained Afshin Ghotbi, the American-Iranian coach of Shimizu S-Pulse, who had only been in charge for one game before the March 11 disaster struck. When the notoriously passionate fans of Vegalta Sendai, a small, understated soccer club playing in Japan's J-League, stood before their team as they took on Kawasaki Frontale, they unfurled a large banner for the world to see. "We have been determined to be the symbol of hope for the entire Tohoku Region [the northeast region of Japan's Honshu island] and to lead and encourage the reconstruction efforts with our strong performance," added Teguramori. Sendai, and its football club, were devastated in Japan's earthquake and tsunami.
