According to CNN daily counts, the number of unidentified bodies recovered in Baghdad also dropped in August, to 428 from 612 in July and 563 in June. Using figures collected from Iraqi Interior, Defense and Health ministries' records, the Interior Ministry said 1,773 civilians were killed in August, up from 1,653 in July. The U.S. military has tangled with his forces in Baghdad's Sadr City and in southern Iraq and, through the years, his political clout across Iraq's Shiite heartland has grown. Twenty-one Iraqi soldiers were killed in August, compared with 79 in July and 31 in June. The number of people described as insurgents who died in August was 472; up from 428 in July and 416 in June.
