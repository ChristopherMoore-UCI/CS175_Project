Panamanian authorities detained Dino Bouterse at Tocumen International Airport outside Panama City and handed him over to U.S. authorities, the Central American nation's foreign ministry said Friday. In a statement Friday, Suriname's foreign ministry acknowledged Bouterse's detention but said the reasons for it were unclear. A federal grand jury indictment alleges that Bouterse, 40, "caused a suitcase containing 10 kilograms of cocaine to be transported from Suriname into the Caribbean" in July. Bouterse brandished an anti-tank weapon during the alleged trafficking operation, prosecutors said in a statement Friday. He is the son of Desi Bouterse, a former military strongman who was elected president of the South American nation in 2010.
