" Full coverage of Haiti earthquake Since the fall of the Duvalier dictatorship in the 1980s, Haiti has created many civil society organizations and groups, but none has been particularly strong in the midst of political and economic turmoil, said Sophie Perez, the country director for the humanitarian agency CARE, which has worked in Haiti since 1954. In Baussan, a village near Léogâne, about 30 miles west of Port-au-Prince, the Scouts lined up to distribute essential hygiene items trucked in by CARE. Yestin, like many of Haiti's almost 10,000 Boys and Girls Scouts, decided to contribute her share to the earthquake relief effort. "It is important to involve young people right from the start," Perez said. And yet not one among them had been unscathed by the terrible tragedy that befell Haiti on January 12.
