The tournament brought more than 309,000 visitors to South Africa and generated more than $520 million dollars in added revenue to the tourism industry, South African Tourism Minister Marthinus van Schalkwyk announced. Schalkwyk said that pre-tournament fears that the long travel distances, high airline ticket costs and fear of crime would deter travelers from coming to South Africa turned out to be unfounded. Fans from other African nations made up the biggest share of visitors, at 38%, while nearly a quarter were from Europe. -- South Africa's tourist industry happily blew its own vuvuzuela Monday, reporting a half-billion dollars in receipts from hosting this year's FIFA World Cup matches. "I can today say without a doubt that the success of the event will reverberate for many years to come," van Schalkwyk said in a statement announcing the final tally.
