Al-Shabaab, which has pledged allegiance to al Qaeda, controls much of southern Somalia and portions of Mogadishu. Members of the Ahlu Sunna Wal Jama militia -- showing off their power by brandishing a small arsenal of light and heavy weaponry -- denounced Islamic militant group Al-Shabaab during a press conference in the capital, Mogadishu, and announced their support of the AU's decision to add at least 2,000 more troops to the 6,000-strong force targeting such groups. The group said the attacks were in retaliation for Uganda's troop contribution of the AU's peacekeeping operations in Somalia, known as AMISOM. -- A Somali militant group wanting to rid the war-torn country of an al Qaeda-linked movement welcomed Saturday the African Union's decision last week to expand its peacekeeping presence in the country. The AU patrols just a few streets in Mogadishu and protects facilities belonging to the weak central government, including the presidential palace.
