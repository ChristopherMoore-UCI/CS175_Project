A Western intelligence source said there could be as many as 20 terrorist sleeper cells of between 120 and 180 people ready to strike in France, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands. The gunman eventually surrendered and the hostages emerged with no injuries, according to France Bleu, which is part of the country's public broadcasting group. A man with a handgun entered a post office outside of Paris early Friday afternoon before reportedly surrendering and releasing his hostages unharmed. This is a hot topic in France after last week's deadly attacks. The incident in Colombes, a community about 10 kilometers northwest of the French capital, began at about 12:45 p.m. (6:45 a.m. ET) and was over two hours later.
