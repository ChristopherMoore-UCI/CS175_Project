The Northern Irishman split from his fiance, tennis star Caroline Wozniacki, earlier in the week, but registered a one-under par round after recovering from an awful 38-shot (three-over-par) front nine to join Sweden's Henrik Stenson and Paraguay's Fabrizio Zanotti in a tie for fifth at five-under-par. " World number 142 Lowry took advantage of Bjorn's difficulties with a 2-under-par round of 70 to draw level with the Dane. Scott battled back from a poor opening round and nervy front nine on day two to make the Colonial cut at one-under-par. The Australian is six shots behind leader Brice Garnett, however, who leads the way on seven-under-par. The Dane scored eight birdies and an eagle on Thursday to card a course record 62 but a level-par round on a soggy Friday allowed Lowry to draw level atop the leaderboard.
