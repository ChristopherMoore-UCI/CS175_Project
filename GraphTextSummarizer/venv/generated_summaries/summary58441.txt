On every ship, Carnival says, workers have installed a second emergency backup electricity generator, which will keep important passenger systems running, "including toilets elevators and food service equipment in the highly unlikely event of a loss of main power." Now outfitted with new emergency power capabilities and additional fire safety technology, the ship is fully booked with 3,350 passengers on a four-day voyage to Cozumel, Mexico, Carnival says. The ship sets sail on its first cruise since February's engine fire left it adrift in the Gulf of Mexico, with more than 4,200 passengers enduring power outages, overflowing toilets and food shortages. February's fire turned the ship into a high-profile news story as passengers aired their outrage and complaints via phone and e-mail, as well as Twitter, Facebook and other social media. A few days later another ship, Carnival Dream, lost power and some toilets stopped working in St. Maarten in the eastern Caribbean.
