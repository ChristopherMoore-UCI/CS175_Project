Since 2006, when it was pushed out of northern Uganda, it has largely operated in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Central African Republic. Invisible Children aimed to make Kony a household name and drum up global support to end the murders, rapes, abductions and other abuses committed by the LRA. Now, after more than five years of peace in Northern Uganda many wonder if the online movie highlighting Kony's crimes is too late. The LRA terrorized Uganda in a brutal campaign against the government and civilian population. Kony first unleashed his fury in eastern Africa more than two decades ago and is wanted for crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court.
