The trade fair, now in its 13th year in the Polish city of Kielce, is officially called the International Exhibition of Church Construction, Church Fittings and Furnishings and Religious Art. " Renewable energy is also becoming increasingly popular to heat church properties, according to Mocho≈Ñ, not least ancient cathedrals which, because of their cold stone, high Gothic arches and vast planes of stained glass windows, are some of the most notoriously cold places in many European cities. Globally the industry is worth an estimated $4 billion and runs from big ticket items like expensive musical instruments such as church organs to simple wooden rosary beads, which can sell for as little as a few dollars. Poland's SacroExpo is one of the largest trade fairs of its type in the world, hosting displays of everything from bells to church alarm systems and evangelical multimedia. Other items include electric candles, automatic church bells and even heated pews.
