Frank Torres, director general of Nissan Motor Iberica, told CNN lowering labor costs were an achievement for Nissan Barcelona and for Spain itself -- making it an increasingly competitive location for manufacturing and exporting cars. It's this logistical innovation that has enabled Nissan Barcelona to cut costs by as much as 30%; and for an industry that accounts for 10% of Spain's industry, this is a crucial part of Spain's long haul to recovery. This agreement would not have been possible had it not been for Nissan's negotiation of new working practices with Spanish trade unions. Torres said the company needed to make logistical savings to stand out from other automakers and Nissan manufacturing hubs, it needed to make savings on the ground. But labor market reforms are not enough to make Nissan Barcelona competitive on the global stage.
