Edward Blakely, the czar of New Orleans recovery effort, appreciates the work from Leary's foundation and volunteers. Volunteers from the union are now working shoulder to shoulder with New Orleans firefighters. New Orleans is in a tough situation, according to Blakely. -- New Orleans has yet to rebuild a single fire station more than two years after Katrina destroyed or damaged 22 of the city's 33 firehouses. Under city law, he said, there has to be enough money in city coffers to pay for a project before construction starts.
