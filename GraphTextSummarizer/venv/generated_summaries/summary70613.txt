It kept the 18-year-old two points ahead of Schild in the slalom standings, while Hofl-Riesch now has the same advantage over previous leader Tina Weirather in the race for the overall World Cup title. Marlies Schild claimed the 35th World Cup slalom victory of her career in Lienz to take sole ownership of the record from Switzerland's Vreni Schneider. Meanwhile, Aksel Lund Svindal moved 195 points clear in the men's World Cup with the 25th victory of his career in Sunday's downhill in Bormio. It also put the 32-year-old behind only compatriot Annemarie Moser-Proll's 36 downhill titles for the most in any World Cup discipline. The Norwegian, third at the Italian course last year, finished 0.39 seconds ahead of Austria's defending champion Hannes Reichelt.
