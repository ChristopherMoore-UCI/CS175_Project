The first responders we have been reporting on and reading about as the old year nears its end have given new meaning to "above and beyond the call of duty": The officers who sped to Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, and encountered what no person should ever have to see. This December there has been a phrase that has been much in the news: First responders. We have all been inspired and stirred this year by the valor of the real first responders. But, by following the spirit of their example, we can set a goal for the new year that is about to begin -- for those blank pages of life that await. To try to do better -- to close the cover on the scratch-outs and unsatisfactory scrawls of the previous part of one's life and, having learned from what went before, to start over on a clean set of pages.
