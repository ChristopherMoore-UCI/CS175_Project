-- The Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, as much a holiday tradition as turkey, football and dinner table debates, celebrated its 85th anniversary with a host of new floats and balloons that began making their way down New York City's streets Thursday morning. "It's amazing to see them come to life," Amy Kule, the parade's executive producer, told CNN affiliate WABC. He joins a 41-foot-tall Julius the monkey; an eagerly-anticipated newcomer, "B," a pointy-toothed, stitched-face creation from filmmaker Tim Burton; and the Aflac Duck Balloonicle -- a balloon on wheels. Forecasters predict sunny skies and 10 mph winds, good news for the predicted 3.5 million people along the parade route. Another 50 million are expected to watch from home as more than 1,600 cheerleaders, two dozen floats, 11 marching bands and, of course, Santa Claus saunter by.
