The public corruption and bribery convictions of former Alabama Gov. Don Siegelman and HealthSouth CEO and founder Richard Scrushy will stand after the Supreme Court rejected their separate appeals Monday. Dozens of top business and government leaders had been accused of improperly withholding their "honest services" from constituents and shareholders, a violation of federal law dealing with fiduciary responsibilities. A jury found the governor had named Scrushy to a state regulatory board in exchange for $500,000 in campaign donations. The lottery effort failed, and Scrushy was charged with helping cover the debt from the lottery campaign with the half-million dollars, partly in return for favorable treatment in government contracts. Scrushy was eventually forced out after the trial and subsequent lawsuits from investors and shareholders.
