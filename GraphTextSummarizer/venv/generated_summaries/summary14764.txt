Old mental health records for the chief suspect in the 2001 anthrax attacks suggest Bruce Ivins should have been prevented from holding a job at a U.S. Army research facility in Maryland, according to a report from a panel of behavioral experts commissioned by the Department of Justice. Ivins was accused by the FBI of allegedly being behind the mailings of anthrax that killed five people in 2001. Last month, the National Academy of Sciences issued a report that supported the FBI's scientific basis linking Ivins to the form of anthrax used in the attacks. Censored details include information that could identify friends, co-workers and mental health professionals who encountered and counseled Ivins during his career. Probing into otherwise confidential medical records was authorized by a sealed order in 2009 from U.S. District Court chief Judge Royce Lamberth.
