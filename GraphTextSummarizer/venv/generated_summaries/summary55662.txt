Famous writing teacher Donald Murray quotes the Roman poet Horace: "Nulla Dies Sine Linea," Latin for "Never a Day Without a Line" of writing. In an interview with The Washington Post, poet Maya Angelou argued that these were not King's exact words and that, out of context, they made a humble preacher look like "an arrogant twit." I know of no written standards for historical inscriptions, but the unwritten ones could come down to these two: 1) Quotes from the dead should never be taken out of context; 2) Quotations should reveal the honored character in the proper light -- or a better light. Without that opening conditional clause, it does seem that King is embracing the role of drum major rather than acquiescing to it. To get a feel for the presence and status of drum majors, check out YouTube videos of auditions for that honored position.
