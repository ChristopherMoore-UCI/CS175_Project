President Barack Obama might be trying to distance himself from MIT economist Jonathan Gruber who has drawn heat for saying the "stupidity of the American voter" was a key factor in passing the President's signature health care law, but in 2006 then-Sen. Barack Obama said he pulled ideas from the academic "liberally. Obama on Sunday dismissed Gruber as "some adviser who never worked on our staff" and insisted his administration and other proponents of the law never misled voters about the legislation. Gruber netted nearly $400,000 for the year-long job spent modeling the impact of proposals that would later be shaped into Obama's signature health care law. " Speaking at a Brookings Institution event the same day as Gruber, Obama praised him and other academics as "some of the brightest minds from academia and policy circles, many of them I've stolen ideas from liberally," according to a video reported Monday by The Washington Free Beacon. Democrats have tried to extinguish the scandal that flamed after a half-dozen years-old videos of Gruber surfaced in recent weeks in which he suggests advocates of the law exploited "the lack of economic understanding of the American voter" and said "people are too stupid" to understand the nuances of the law and its language.
