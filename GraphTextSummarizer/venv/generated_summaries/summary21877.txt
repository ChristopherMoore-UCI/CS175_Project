More on CNNGo: 10 of the world's most loved airports Dalian International Airport is the biggest airport in northeastern China and the fourth busiest in China (by international passengers). To entertain waiting passengers, Dalian International Airport recently recruited a squad of cheerleaders to perform kicks, jumps and splits in the airport's main hall. -- While some Chinese travelers storm the tarmac when flights get delayed, others might wish their flights never take off -- assuming they're flying from the northeast China city of Dalian. Amid a current boom in aviation in China, flight delays are becoming a major sticking point for travelers in the country. The cheerleading show is part of the airport's effort to "bring more convenience to passengers in the summer-autumn air season," said Zhen Qun, an airport official.
