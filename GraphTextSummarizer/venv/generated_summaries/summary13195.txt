An unlocked phone also allows you to travel overseas and take advantage of lower service prices from local carriers. Those prices aren't incredible if you're used to buying your phones through major wireless carriers at subsidized prices, but compared to most unlocked phones, the Nexus 4 is cheap. Buying the phone unlocked means you can bring it to certain wireless carriers in the United States and save a lot of money on service. Rumor has it that a new Nexus phone, dubbed the Nexus 5, is coming soon. But with lower prices on the Nexus 4, Google seems to be girding itself for the arrival of a cheaper iPhone, supposedly called the "iPhone 5C." Like the Nexus 4, Apple's phone could be aimed at customers who want an unlocked, off-contract handset without spending gobs of cash.
