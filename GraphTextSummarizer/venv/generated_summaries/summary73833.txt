Kiriakou said he was able to quickly verify Zubaydah's identity by sending a picture of his ear to CIA headquarters in Virginia. CIA operative John Kiriakou, who helped plan the raid, rushed to the scene. Iraq played a prominent role in Kiriakou's CIA career, most notably his role in supporting the U.S. policy to go to war. "Al Qaeda people started driving by the hospital just opening fire on the hospital," Kiriakou said, and a Pakistani security officer quickly arranged for a helicopter to transfer Zubaydah to a military base. Once on the base, Kiriakou used a sheet to tie the comatose Zubaydah to his bed and then stood watch.
