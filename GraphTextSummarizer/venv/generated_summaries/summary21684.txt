The 32-year-old Norwegian has said that he acted alone and has not pleaded guilty, acting National Police Chief Sveinung Sponheim said Sunday. Doctors at Oslo University Hospital Sunday were treating 31 patients injured in the terror attacks, 18 of whom were critically or seriously injured, Oslo University Hospital spokesman Jo Heldaas told CNN. The man behind a pair of bloody terror attacks in Norway is set to appear in court Monday, his first such appearance since authorities say he killed at least 93 people by setting off an explosion and gunning down people at a youth camp. Authorities are also still trying to determine how many people died in the Oslo bombing, where the explosion badly damaged several government buildings as well as the majority Labour Party office. Authorities allege that he killed seven by setting off a car bomb outside government buildings in Oslo on Friday, then went 20 miles and killed at least 86 more by ambushing an island political youth retreat.
