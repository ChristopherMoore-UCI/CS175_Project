"There are changes in many gut and brain hormones after bypass surgery and other operations for weight loss," said Dr. Ann M. Rogers, director of Penn State Hershey's Surgical Weight Loss Program. Gastric bypass surgery, sometimes called bariatric surgery, divides the stomach into a small upper pouch and a larger pouch that's unused, physically shrinking the stomach's capacity to hold food. Although gastric bypass hypnosis may help some people lose weight, experts say there are other benefits gained from the real surgery besides a smaller stomach size. Kirsch found a connection between longer treatment time and results, suggesting that the impact of hypnosis increases with time, and may be a useful tool for weight loss maintenance. There are also other types of weight loss hypnosis -- some focus on retraining the brain to simply eat healthier or less.
