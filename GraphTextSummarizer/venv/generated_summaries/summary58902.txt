The result proved a difficult pill to swallow for Red Wings winger Marian Hossa.

We're going to get our names on the Cup, and we'll get our day with it," Penguins head coach Dan Bylsma told their official Web site. The Penguins celebrate with the Stanley Cup after claiming a narrow game seven victory at Detroit. The Pittsburgh Penguins have won the Stanley Cup for a third time after a pair of second-period goals by Max Talbot gave them a narrow 2-1 victory over the Detroit Red Wings in the deciding game of the best-of-seven series.
