The first commercial spacecraft to return from a low-Earth orbit landed in the Pacific Ocean Wednesday about 500 miles off the coast of southern California. "This is the first in a new generation of commercial launch systems that will help provide vital support to the International Space Station and may one day carry astronauts into orbit. The successful mission marked the first time a commercial firm recovered a spacecraft from a low orbit -- a feat performed by only six nations or government agencies: the United States, Russia, China, Japan, India and the European Space Agency. The landing was also the first flight under NASA's Commercial Orbital Transportation Services program to develop commercial supply services to the International Space Station. "These new explorers are to spaceflight what Lindbergh was to commercial aviation," Bolden said.
