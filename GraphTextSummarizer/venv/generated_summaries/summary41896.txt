American student Knox and her former boyfriend Sollecito were convicted of the killing in 2009 and are now fighting to have the verdicts overturned. He and Knox say they were at Sollecito's house on the night Kercher died, not the villa the two girls shared. Curt Knox, Amanda Knox's father, said the language used by the lawyer "was extraordinarily hard to listen to." "What I find very hard to believe is how this person can start calling her that when he's never even talked to her, never met her," Curt Knox told CNN's Brooke Baldwin on Monday night. -- The lawyer for Meredith Kercher's family showed photos of the British murder victim's bloodied body Monday, pointing out multiple stab wounds, as he urged an Italian jury not to overturn the murder convictions of Amanda Knox and Rafaelle Sollecito. Pacelli sought to portray Knox as sexually promiscuous and a difficult roommate as he fights for damages for Patrick Lumumba.
