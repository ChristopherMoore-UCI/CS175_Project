Before signing on to "How I Met Your Dad," Gerwig was building a career mainly in indie film, including standouts such as "Lola Versus," "To Rome With Love" and 2012's "Frances Ha," which earned the actress a Golden Globe nomination. According to Deadline Hollywood, the creative team behind "HIMYD" was so intent on landing Gerwig that "the studio is willing to move production of the series to New York for her after the pilot, which will be shot in Los Angeles. In its official description, CBS describes Gerwig's character as "a female Peter Pan who has never grown up and has no idea of where she's going in life." Created by Carter Bays and Craig Thomas, "HIMYM" centers on Josh Radnor's Ted and his friends as Ted recounts through a series of flashback stories how he met his future wife. -- "Frances Ha" star Greta Gerwig is your new Ted.
