The tips that continued through June came as a result of a joint drug investigation, codenamed "Surfing Coke," that saw Hong Kong customs authorities partner with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and U.S. Customs and Border Protection to combat drug trafficking, Lee said. The drug operation began in April when the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration began tipping Hong Kong authorities to the arrival of containers from South America, Lee said. Hong Kong customs officials visited three South American countries where they met with their respective counterparts during the investigation, trips that were aimed at "enhancing the mutual anti-narcotics cooperation and intelligence exchange," Lee said. Three people, described by Lee, as "local men" were arrested in connection with the seizure, which occurred Wednesday and was made public Friday. The Customs Drug Investigation Bureau of Hong Kong seized 649 kilograms (about 1,425 pounds) of cocaine from a shipping container that arrived from Ecuador, Lee Cheung-wing, the head of the Custom Drug Investigation Bureau, said in a statement released Friday.
