-- Showtime made it official Thursday that "Dexter's" eighth season will be its last one, while teasing fans with a video clip from June's season premiere. The clip posted online "gives fans a sneak peek into the mindset of Dexter and Debra Morgan after LaGuerta's death in Season 7," Showtime's release said. "'Dexter' redefined the genre, by taking the anti-hero to new heights and pushing the boundaries of the television landscape," Showtime chairman Matthew Blank said. "Dexter paved the way for the next generation of award-winning hit Showtime series, and its cultural impact will be felt for years to come. " Showtime is adding a new original series, "Ray Donovan," to replace the popular "Dexter," Moonves said.
