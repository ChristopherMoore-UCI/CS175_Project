Giselle Esteban, 27, was arrested in Union City, California, Wednesday, Lt. Roger Keener of the Hayward Police Department told reporters. Evidence -- including blood stains, security camera footage, cell phone records and DNA found on a shoe -- led to Esteban's arrest "for the murder of Michelle Le," Keener said. "At this point she is still missing and we will fight to bring her home every day until we have her with our family again," cousin Krystine Dinh told reporters after police announced Esteban's arrest Wednesday. As part of that search, Keener said, they found Le's DNA on one of Esteban's shoes. Esteban was arraigned on Wednesday afternoon and was listed as an inmate in an Alameda County jail without bail.
