Jihadist social media: Decapitations, appeals for wives Like no conflict before, the Syrian war, the prime focus of the world's jihadists, is being discussed, disputed -- and waged, in its propaganda aspects -- on social media. This development has led to the spectacle of the U.S. government publicly bickering with jihadists and their ideological fellow travelers on social media, debating Syria, the War on Terror, "the clash of civilizations" in 140-character bursts. The initiative, already active across Twitter, Facebook and YouTube, would look to branch out to other social media where jihadists were active. In recent years, the U.S. State Department has launched social media efforts to engage jihadists and their sympathizers online, contesting their claims with the intention of dissuading potential converts to Islamic extremism. In this way, social media has become a prime conduit for motivating budding extremists to take up arms.
