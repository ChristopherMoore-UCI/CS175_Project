According to data from 2008 and published in Social Science Research last year, white women who were surveyed are more likely to approve of interracial relationships for others than themselves, while white men are more likely to personally engage in such relationships. "The Bachelor" has set the tone for how women and people of color are portrayed on every dating show -- on network TV and cable, alike, said Jennifer L. Pozner, the author of Realitybitesbackbook.com. And for a decade, "[ABC and creator Mike Fliess] have done everything they can to create an on-screen America that looks like the segregated South in the '50s," Pozner said, adding, "It's as if [the network] is afraid they could lose advertisers by showing interracial dating." Calling "The Bachelor" "light and fluffy entertainment," Bradley Jacobs, a senior editor at US Weekly, said, producers are "probably not interested in getting their hands dirty in some kind of interracial romance." People are increasingly becoming more accepting of interracial relationships, Samuels said. This indicates that the presence of people of color in ABC programming is acceptable so long as there is no exhibition of actual romance between non-whites or whites and people of color."
