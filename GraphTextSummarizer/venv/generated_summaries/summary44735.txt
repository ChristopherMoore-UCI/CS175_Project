Among the other findings of the report: -- With the exception of video games, parents think more positively than negatively about the impact of media (TV, computers and mobile devices) on children's reading and math skills and their creativity. Parents rated video games as more likely to have a negative effect on children's academic skills, attention span, creativity, social skills, behavior and sleep than any other medium. Second, the survey challenged the notion that the dominant pattern in most households is children pleading for screen time while parents try to limit it. An overwhelming majority (78%) of parents say their children's media use is not a source of family conflict, while 59% say they are not worried about their children becoming addicted to phones, tablet computers or gaming devices. "Today's parents (of young children) grew up with technology as a central part of their lives, so they think about it differently than earlier generations of parents," said Northwestern's Wartella in a press release.
