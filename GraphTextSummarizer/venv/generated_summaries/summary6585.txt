"Boko Haram have taken over Damboa where they erected their flags after the attack that forced all residents to flee," said Sheriff Mohammed. "We lost 46 people on Thursday through Friday in Damboa and the gunmen pursued people who fled to nearby Fori and Kwairi villages where they killed 20 more," Sheriff Muhammad, a spokesman for the Damboa local authority, said. But 50 militants were also killed that day, leading residents such as Ahmed Buba to think they had returned to exact revenge. Scores of fighters armed with rocket-propelled grenades, explosives and guns descended on the town of Damboa early Thursday evening, residents and officials said. " Boko Haram launched an offensive against Damboa's military base and police station July 4 that left six soldiers and five policeman dead, according to Nigeria's defense ministry.
