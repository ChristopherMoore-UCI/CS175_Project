"We have been overwhelmed," said David Pysden, CEO of Unified Weapons Master, referring to the response from martial artists who have seen the suits. "You look at the popularity of combat sports in video games -- the public loves seeing people fight with weapons," he said. He said they're currently in talks with several production companies about broadcasting a tournament of weapons masters using the suits. "We know the damage that would have occurred to an unprotected competitor if they weren't wearing the suit, and we can display that in real time," Pysden said.
