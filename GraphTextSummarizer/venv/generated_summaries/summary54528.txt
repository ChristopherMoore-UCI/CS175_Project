The new Indy figures are sure to get fans drooling at Comic-Con, and here are five more toys that should fly off shelves on Preview Night. -- "Back to the Future" Hot Wheels vehicle Fellow toy giant Mattel also has a major presence on the convention floor, and this year the company is offering fans their very own "Hot Wheels" version of a Delorean from the movie "Back to the Future." Whether you're there to relive a part of your childhood or celebrate genre entertainment in the present, fans can usually find at least one thing that they're dying to part with their hard-earned money to get, and in the age of fan conventions, companies continue to tailor their special-release toys like these to what the geek crowd wants. Fans of both franchises really like it when we do this type of mashup." -- Voltron This year, Mattel will be introducing its very first Voltron figure at the Con, for those who look back fondly at the anime character from the 1980s (recently brought back on a current NickToons series). "This figure makes Voltron at the same size with other figures that collectors may have." Best of all, Voltron comes with his blazing sword. Last year's "Dexter" bobblehead was a hot seller for smaller toy company Entertainment Earth.
