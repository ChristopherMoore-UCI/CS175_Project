Scientists: To save Great Barrier Reef, kill starfish Researchers say most of the damage was wrought in recent years by a succession of powerful cyclones. Scientists are investigating the possibility of inducing a natural disease in starfish "by injecting them with a nutrient broth that encourages a naturally-occurring pathogenic bacteria," Oliver said. "We can't change the weather so storms and bleaching are something that will take a much more concerted action at an international level, however we may be able to do something about crown-of-thorns, either through direct action on the outbreaking populations or by doing things like improving water quality, which has been shown to have a link to causing outbreaks in the first place," Oliver said. To date, the GBR has lost fewer corals to bleaching and diseases than many other regions in the world, but bleaching mortality will almost certainly increase in the GBR, given the upward trend in temperatures," the report warned. Australia's environment minister has conceded that years of neglect have contributed to a devastating drop in coral coverage on the Great Barrier Reef along the country's north eastern coast.
