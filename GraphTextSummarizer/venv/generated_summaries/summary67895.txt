A discussion of high finance and companies that ship jobs overseas passed without a mention of Bain Capital, a topic that had dominated the Obama campaign's messaging for months and seemed to have done Romney real damage in key swing states like Ohio. Heading into Wednesday, majorities of Americans in virtually every major poll predicted President Barack Obama would come out on top in this year's presidential debates. At a time when most surrogates were competing in the traditional expectations-setting limbo contest that always precedes presidential debates, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie predicted that Mitt Romney, seasoned veteran of roughly 20 debates within the past year alone, would prevail. Connecting with the viewer: 'Romney was able to out Obama' Obama's answers were long and winding, featuring more than their fair share of provisos and to-be-sures, even a bit hesitant. Not only did Romney put Obama on the defensive, at times, the president seemed to put himself there, raising and responding to conservative attacks that hadn't yet been mentioned.
