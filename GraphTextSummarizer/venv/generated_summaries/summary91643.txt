Hear the guitar in action Bermeister says that when European settlers arrived in South Africa, they brought with them oil cans, which locals transformed into musical instruments "Some turned them into drums; some turned them into bass guitars; and some turned them into what's called a ramkiekie," says Bermeister -- a ramkiekie is an early-style four-string guitar that features an empty oil can as its body. "The idea of the oil can guitar is very much a South African thing," explains Roy Bermeister, chief executive of Township Guitars. A Cape Town-based company is crafting eye-catching electric guitars out of re-purposed oil cans, striking a chord with music fans around the world. A few weeks later, clutching his creation, he met up with Bermeister at a popular Cape Town cafÃ©. Indeed, the company says its hand-built creations have caught the eye of many guitar lovers, including some of the world's most renowned musicians.
