"The bands and artists have a standing invitation to visit any of our parks to see firsthand or to speak to any of our animal experts to learn for themselves how we care for animals and how little truth there is to the allegations made by animal extremist groups opposed to the zoological display of marine mammals," Gollattscheck said. "While we're disappointed a small group of misinformed individuals was able to deny fans what would have been great concerts at SeaWorld," Gollattscheck said. -- SeaWorld's "Bands, BBQ and Brew" concert series may be down to just food and beer soon as Trisha Yearwood joins the list of artists canceling shows.
