" In the meantime, while these issues sort out, Google also announced this week that it's making it easier to integrate Google Wallet into mobile web payments. Any credit cards or other payment information you've saved in Google Checkout will be available in Google Wallet. At the recent Open Mobile Summit, Google VP of Payments Osama Bedier observed: "Merchants adopt new payment models because they increase sales. Typing on mobile phones is a notorious hassle, and mobile Web users often abandon their online shopping carts when they reach the point of entering payment information. If you log in to your Google Checkout account now, you'll be notified that you've been switched over to Google Wallet.
