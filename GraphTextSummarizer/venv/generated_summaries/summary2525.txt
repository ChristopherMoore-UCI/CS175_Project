-- Argentina's Supreme Court has upheld a ruling that will decriminalize abortions in cases of rape. In its ruling, the Supreme Court clarified that Argentina's Constitution and human rights treaties would not allow such a prohibition in cases of rape. As interpreted, in addition to cases of mental incapacity, the law only permitted abortions in some instances in which the mother's life was at risk. A lower court ruled in March 2010 that an abortion was permissible in cases of rape, but that decision was appealed to the nation's highest court. However, there were contradictory interpretations by lower courts throughout the country, and these interpretations, in some cases, said that women who were raped are only permitted an abortion if they are mentally challenged or demented, which is what the statute says," said Alvaro Herrero of the Association of Civil Rights.
