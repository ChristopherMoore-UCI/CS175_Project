The protesters, many of them Kurds, are calling on the Turkish government to take tough action against ISIS, and to allow Turkish fighters to go across the border and fight ISIS militants. "Police used tear gas and water cannons to disperse pro-Kurdish protesters across the country who had set up barricades, set fire to buses and cars and attacked police with fireworks and stones," the semi-official Anadolu news agency reported. As ISIS militants seem poised to take the strategic city of Kobani at the Turkish-Syrian border, violent protests have broken out in Turkey, leaving some demonstrators dead. The death toll has reached 19, Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said Wednesday. He wants a no-fly zone and a safe haven area established, and has called for the arming of opposition groups in Iraq and Syria.
