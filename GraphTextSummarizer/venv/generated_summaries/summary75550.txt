Gisele Bündchen and husband Tom Brady welcomed a baby boy on Tuesday night. Bündchen, 29, and New England Patriots quarterback Brady, 32, were married in a private ceremony in February in Los Angeles. Brady has a 2-year-old son, Jack, with actress Bridget Moynahan. He also told reporters happily, "I didn't get much sleep last night," USA Today reports. Brady had said earlier this month that he was aware of the baby's gender, but that Bündchen preferred not to know.
