-- China, the United States and three Middle Eastern nations carried out the most executions last year, rights group Amnesty International said Wednesday, but a global trend toward ending the death penalty persisted. The number of executions in the Middle East last year, almost all of them in Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Yemen, was "a cause of great concern," it said. Amnesty International Secretary General Salil Shetty said the "regression" seen in some countries last year was disappointing -- but that it did not change the overall trend. Eighty people were sentenced to death, the second lowest total since executions resumed in 1976. "Methods of executions included beheading, hanging, firing squad and lethal injection," Amnesty International said.
