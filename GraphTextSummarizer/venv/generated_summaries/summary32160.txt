"Nonetheless, Mrs. Jackson's court victory does not comfort her grieving over the loss of her beloved son Michael Jackson." Katherine Jackson and Joe Jackson attend the funeral for their son on September 3 in Glendale, California. She told CNN that the family was aware of people posing as Jackson children with Twitter accounts. Burt Levitch, another Jackson family lawyer, has said they have questions about possible conflicts of interest and the fitness of John Branca and John McClain, who were named as executors in the will the singer signed in 2002. "We now hope to resolve the outstanding administration matter, without further costly litigation, in the best interests of the beneficiaries, which are Mrs. Jackson and her grandchildren," the attorney said.
