A fight has broken out between two of the most prominent members of the Republican Party: Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul. Studies have shown how federal spending has grown more dramatically under Republican presidents, including Ronald Reagan, than Democrats. In an op-ed for Breitbart News, Paul took a shot at Cruz, without actually naming him, when he wrote, "I will remind anyone who thinks we will win elections by trashing previous Republican nominees or holding oneself out as some paragon in the mold of Reagan, that splintering the party is not the route to victory." Republican legislators have been as skillful at pork-barrel politics as anyone from the other side of the aisle. If Republicans can't find some alternative and the primaries revolve around  the tension between Ted Cruz and Rand Paul, Democrats will be in excellent position to retain the White House in 2016.
