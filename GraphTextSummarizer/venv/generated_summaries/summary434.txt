The bottom line, Juarez says, is that she's a radical candidate with radical ideas for a better Mexico. At a recent campaign stop in Guadalajara, Juarez shook hands with voters and high-fived one supporter. So far Juarez has posted the two billboards in Guadalajara, Mexico's second largest city and also one of the most conservative. When Juarez realized her bid for office was off to a slow start a few weeks ago, the leftist candidate quickly decided she was going to be transparent with voters in a way they didn't expect. The candidate says it's her way of giving voters in Mexico a wake-up call.
