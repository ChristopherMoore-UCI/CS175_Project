And at the same time a fellow called Oscar Newman wrote a book called "Defensible Space", which was an attack on what was then the standard -- Corbu [Le Corbusier], high rise public housing -- which turned out to actually dynamite a number of projects in this country -- in Chicago, St Louis. That was a huge huge learning experience and that was a kind of a rehearsal for then doing this Farallones Institute -- Integral Urban House at Berkeley -- which Fine Homebuilding magazine called "the birth of green", which was a nice thing to say because it wasn't particularly pretty! She did an evaluation of public housing projects. I think he's good because of anyone doing larger buildings he's one of the ecological pioneers who's really thinking about them in a climatic sense. I talk about second generation ecological design where we have a much higher level of integration.
