Barcelona had to take a loan of $200 million after struggling to pay player wages last month, and -- after signing Spain striker David Villa for $50 million -- sold defender Dymtro Chygrynskiy to Shakhtar Donetsk and let high earner Thierry Henry join New York Red Bulls. A new audit by accounting firm Deloitte revealed that the Catalan giants actually made a loss of €77.1 million ($100 million) for the 2009-10 season, Faus said in a statement on the Barca website on Tuesday. The new board's goal is to bring economic excellence alongside sporting excellence," Faus said. The previous board had announced the club was €11 million ($14 million) in profit up to the end of last month, when president Joan Laporta stood down to be replaced by Sandro Rosell. Meanwhile, Spanish rivals Real Madrid have allowed highly-rated young fullback Marcos Alonso to join English club Bolton.
