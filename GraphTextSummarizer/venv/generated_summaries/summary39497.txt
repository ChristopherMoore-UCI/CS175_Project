His main challenger wasn't playing partner Rickie Fowler but friend and Ryder Cup comrade Sergio Garcia, of Spain, who charged round the first 10 holes in five-under par. A par back into the wind on the 17th was secured with a delicate chip from right of the green and though Garcia duly made birdie on the final hole, McIlroy knew the Open was all but his. McIlroy offered further encouragement with a dropped stroke at 14 but a run of four consecutive pars, albeit on a tricky stretch of the course, frustrated Garcia -- still searching for his first major at the 63rd time of asking. Garcia took two shots to get out of a green side bunker on the 15th and McIlroy made a birdie on the 16th to stretch his lead to three. While Fowler never managed to get within striking distance -- three late birdies helping him clamber back into joint-second -- Garcia ensured the threat of McIlroy running aground remained constant.
