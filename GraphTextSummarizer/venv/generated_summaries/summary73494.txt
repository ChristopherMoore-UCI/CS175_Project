The former North Charleston police officer is charged with murder in the death of 50-year-old Walter Scott. During the stop, three officers -- including Slager -- pulled Wilson out of his car. Scott was black; Slager is white. "Based on the facts revealed thus far, it does not appear South Carolina's death penalty provision applies in this case because there are no statutory 'aggravating circumstances' present," Scarlett A. Wilson, who is the chief prosecutor for the Ninth Judicial Circuit in the state, said on her Facebook page. In the first recording, an unidentified officer talks to Slager about what might happen.
