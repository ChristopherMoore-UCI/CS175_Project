After 19 years of marriage, Chris Rock has filed for divorce. Malaak is Malaak Compton-Rock, the mother of Rock's two girls, 12-year-old Lola Simone and 10 year-old Zahra Savannah. "After much contemplation and 19 years of marriage, Chris and I have decided to go our separate ways," Compton-Rock said in a statement, People reported. In his comedy acts, Rock has been brutally incisive about marriage -- as he is about all other issues. "This is a personal matter and Chris requests privacy as he and Malaak work through this process and focus on their family," his representative said in a statement Sunday.
