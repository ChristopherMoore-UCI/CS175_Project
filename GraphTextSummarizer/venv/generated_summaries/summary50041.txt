Ten other American Front members, including alleged leader Marcus Faella, are set for trial next month, while two co-defendants have entered guilty pleas. According to police, Faella was planning to stage provocative disruptions at Orlando City Hall and at a Melbourne, Florida, anarchist gathering that included members of skinhead groups. -- Florida prosecutors dropped charges against a husband and wife accused of training for a race war as part of a white supremacist group, their attorney said Monday. According to police, Faella's group watched videos training members in fighting and the use of AK-47s and other weapons at a St. Cloud, Florida, compound, which the affidavit said is ringed with barbed wire and protected by pit bulls and firing positions facing the driveway. Jennifer and Mark McGowan were charged with violating a Florida law against participating in paramilitary training by taking part in target practice and hand-to-hand combat training with others in the American Front.
