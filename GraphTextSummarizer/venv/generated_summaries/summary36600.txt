The new storm crashed into the area barely a week after Sandy, which Cuomo said Thursday had inflicted $33 billion in damage to New York state and $50 billion to the region. " Thursday's temperatures were in the mid-40s in much of the New York, New Jersey and Connecticut communities that were ravaged by Sandy, which killed 111 people in the region, knocked out power to millions and flooded large swaths of the heavily urbanized area. New Jersey, where Sandy made landfall October 29, put similar rules into effect last week in 12 counties. Sandy swamped her home with 4 feet of storm surge last week. -- Authorities imposed gasoline rationing on motorists in New York City and Long Island on Thursday, a day after a nor'easter added to the woes of a region still grappling with the damage left behind by last week's Superstorm Sandy.
