Marc J. Randazza, a Las Vegas-based First Amendment attorney, wrote in an op-ed for CNN that the NBA is private club and can punish Sterling as it sees fit.

Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling is banned from the NBA for life. Some who have followed Sterling over the years say he had shown this side before and the leaked audio led to public outcry too loud for the NBA commissioner to ignore. Have Sterling's First Amendment rights been violated?
