"The fact that they killed (bin Laden) was significant, but they also demythologized him," said Thomas Mockaitis, author of "Osama bin Laden: A Biography." "I never thought this night would come, where we would actually capture or kill bin Laden. But perhaps the most talked about pieces of evidence from last year's raid have yet to see the light of day: photos of a dead bin Laden. They also found some homemade videos, including one that shows a graying bin Laden, wrapped in a blanket, watching himself on a small television. Al Qaeda had been pretty much degraded, but (bin Laden) was still on the run.
