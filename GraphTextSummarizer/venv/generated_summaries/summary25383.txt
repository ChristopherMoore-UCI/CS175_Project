The conflict over Kashmir dates back to 1947, after Britain relinquished control of the Indian subcontinent, giving birth to modern India and Pakistan. India says that Pakistan lends support to separatist groups fighting against government control and argues that a 1972 agreement mandates a resolution to the Kashmir dispute through bilateral talks. -- Five Indian soldiers were killed in an attack on the Line of Control in Indian-administered Kashmir early Tuesday Tuesday's ambush came close on the heels of the Indian army's operations against militants infiltrating into the Indian side of Kashmir, resulting in the deaths of 13 militants last week. Indian Defence Minister AK Antony told parliament the ambush was carried out by approximately 20 "heavily armed terrorists along with persons dressed in Pakistan army uniforms."
