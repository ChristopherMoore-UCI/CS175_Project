"This is what Joseph Goebbels would have done, and this has got to be honest and accurate." While only parts of "Nation's Pride" are seen in "Inglourious Basterds," Roth said Tarantino will likely include the complete film as a bonus on the DVD. -- Quentin Tarantino's new movie "Inglourious Basterds" comes with a film inside the film, a Nazi propaganda movie promoting the glory of Germany's Third Reich. Watch Tarantino talk about how "Nation's Pride" was made Â» Roth, well known for his R-rated horror flicks such as "Hostel," said while growing up as a Jewish boy in Boston, Massachusetts, he never dreamed he would make a Nazi propaganda film. "Stolz der Nation" -- which translates into English as "Nation's Pride" -- was produced true to the style of Joseph Goebbels, Adolf Hitler's propaganda minister, but by Eli Roth, the director-actor who also plays one of Tarantino's "Basterds" known as the "Bear Jew." Eli Roth and Brad Pitt star in "Inglourious Basterds."
