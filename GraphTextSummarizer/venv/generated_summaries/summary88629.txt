A seven-member crew aboard space shuttle Atlantis is headed to the Hubble Space Telescope to make repairs. Watch Atlantis launch for Hubble mission Â» "I'm going to put my spacesuit on, next stop: Earth Orbit!!" -- It's not quite the achievement of a lunar landing, but astronaut Mike Massimino made Twitter history with a 139-character post to the micro-blogging site -- the first person to do so from space. Another astronaut, Mark Polansky, is posting Twitter updates as he prepares for the next planned space shuttle mission to the International Space Station. With the tweet, Massimino kept his promise to file updates from the space shuttle Atlantis as it readies to repair the Hubble Space Telescope.
