For all of these reasons, serial killers, when eventually discovered, are often captured because of luck -- bad luck on their part and terrific luck for the rest of us. Despite the challenges that serial murder cases pose for homicide investigators, there are certain strategies that can maximize the chances of solving a case, even when the trail grows cold with passing years. In television dramas like CBS' "Criminal Minds," serial killers are apprehended swiftly and surely. There is an element of self-selection: Only those perpetrators who possess the right level of skill, street savvy or cunning can remain at large long enough to amass a large victim count and, therefore, achieve the status of serial killer. Serial killers generally dispose of their victims' bodies in remote or otherwise hidden places -- a river, a wooded area, or even in large garbage bags tossed in trash bins.
