David Godwin, who said he watched a movie and drank Jack Daniels whiskey with Bales and another soldier, Sgt. Bales, who served three tours of duty in Iraq before being sent to Afghanistan, may have been suffering post-traumatic stress disorder, Browne said. Bales acted with "chilling premeditation" and was "lucid, coherent and responsive" when he left the remote outpost and went from house to house, gunning down villagers, Lt. Col. Joseph Morse, the Army's prosecutor, told the court. "Nothing really justifies killing women and children in a noncombat situation," Bales' attorney, John Henry Browne, told CNN earlier. That person will decide which, if any, charges Bales will face at trial and also whether prosecutors will pursue the death penalty in the case.
