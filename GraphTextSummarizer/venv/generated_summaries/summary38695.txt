The pine nuts were ingredients in several prepared foods sold at Wegmans, including Caprese salad and asparagus with pine nuts, the agency said. At least 43 cases of salmonellosis in California, Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Virginia are linked to the pine nuts, the FDA said Friday, citing the Centers for Disease Control. Consumers are urged to check their homes for the nuts purchased at Wegmans stores between July 1 and October 18, and either throw them away or return them to Wegmans for a refund, the FDA said. -- The Wegmans supermarket chain is recalling 5,000 pounds of Turkish pine nuts because of possible salmonella contamination, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said. The agency warned consumers not to eat the nuts, offered for sale in unlabeled plastic bulk containers at Wegmans stories, or any food items, such as pesto or salads, that have been made using them.
