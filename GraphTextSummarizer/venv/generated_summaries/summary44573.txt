As we all celebrate the success of the Rosetta mission, those of us at the SETI Institute will continue into the fourth decade of the Institute's existence in pursuit of our mission -- understanding the origin of life on this planet and finding evidence of it on other worlds. Institute scientists also investigate whether strange life may inhabit other nearby worlds. While searches for signs of intelligent life have been ongoing for more than three decades with no detection, we have barely scratched the surface of such a quest. While the discovery of intelligent life elsewhere in the universe is similar to the end of a well-written novel, appreciation of that ending is greatly enhanced when you read the other chapters in the book. The SETI Institute's mission is to explore, understand, and explain the origin and nature of life in the universe.
