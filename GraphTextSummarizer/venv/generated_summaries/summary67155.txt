Matthew Smith, executive director of rights group Fortify Rights, said extremists were "using social media as a platform to spread hateful anti-Muslim rhetoric and in some cases to incite violence. Outbreaks of anti-Muslim violence have occurred elsewhere in the country. "The authorities haven't done nearly enough to stem the rising tide of anti-Muslim sentiment, and in some cases the government is contributing to its growth, lending public support to extremists and inflammatory draft legislation while failing to protect at-risk Muslim communities." However, one positive sign was that activists in Myanmar were beginning to stand up against online hate speech and racial violence, he said. Anger against the Muslim tea shop owner, a Muslim, had escalated after Wirathu had circulated a report of the alleged rape on his Facebook page, and called for a harsh government response to "jihadist Muslims."
