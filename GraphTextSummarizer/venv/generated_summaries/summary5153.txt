In Virginia, the state Department of Transportation has already exceeded its $10 million snow removal budget by $3.4 million, CNN affiliate WRIC reported Sunday. "I can't believe it's March and it's still snowing," Betsy St. John, from Brunswick, Maryland, told CNN affiliate WHAG. In New Albany, Indiana, where salt is now in short supply, the city has shifted to a product called IMIX, which combines natural sand and calcium chloride, CNN affiliate WAVE reported. "We've got about 2,600 workers on the ground ready to go just as soon as the trouble begins," David Lewis, a spokesman with Entergy Arkansas, told CNN affiliate KATV. Schools in parts of North Carolina are closed as the storm is expected to bring sleet and possibly snow later Monday, according to CNN affiliate WRAL.
