" To compensate for the loss of spin from the rough, tour players may use softer balls, which spin more but do not travel as far. Despite pressure from some players and golf equipment manufacturers, the U.S. PGA Tour has decided to go along with the rule change, meaning U.S. PGA Tour competitions, including the U.S. Open, will feature the club restriction from next year. "At the moment players are getting a lot of spin on the ball so I think it will make people play better," he said. That could favor players who already use the softer ball -- including Tiger Woods. Research by the USGA has shown that U-shaped grooves allow top players to generate much more spin when playing the ball out of the rough, making the ball come to a quick stop on the green.
