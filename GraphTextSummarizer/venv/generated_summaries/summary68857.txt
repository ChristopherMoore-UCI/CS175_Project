Demand that your youth sports programs have ACL prevention programs. Although boys and girls are at risk for ACL injury, post-pubertal girls are at least four times more likely to tear their ACL than boys. Famous athletes such as quarterback Tom Brady and alpine skier Lindsey Vonn have come back after ACL surgery, so how bad can it be? When I see young athletes who tear their ACL, one of the first questions their parents ask is: What could we have done to prevent this? ACL injury is a buzz word among athletes.
