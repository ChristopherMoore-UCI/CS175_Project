Tens of millions of Social Security recipients will see their bank accounts jump by $250 starting Thursday, when the government began sending out checks and transferring funds for a one-time boost coming from the stimulus bill passed in February. "This is a point in time where some of the first big chunks of stimulus money is actually going into the economy," Astrue said. "Approximately half of them will be out in the next day or two," Social Security Commissioner Michael Astrue told CNN Thursday. Meanwhile, there is vigorous debate over how stimulus payments will be spent in tough times. The money will arrive in the same way that each person receives regular Social Security or Supplemental Security Income funds.
