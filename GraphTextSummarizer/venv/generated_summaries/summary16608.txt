NEW YORK (Reuters) -- Soon-to-be-jailed celebrity socialite Nicole Richie said she is pregnant by her boyfriend, singer Joel Madden of the rock band Good Charlotte. Nicole Richie tells Diane Sawyer she is pregnant by boyfriend Joel Madden. The waif-like daughter of singer Lionel Richie pleaded guilty Friday to driving under the influence of drugs and was sentenced to four days in jail. "I have a responsibility and it's something that I did wrong, and if I could personally apologize to every single person that has lost a loved one from drunk driving I would," Richie said. Because of a 2003 DUI conviction, Richie had faced a mandatory sentence of up to a year in jail if found guilty in a trial but instead submitted her plea.
