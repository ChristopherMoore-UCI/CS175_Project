Brighthaupt testified that he had seen Stern giving Smith illegal drugs, which contradicted public statements he made in the months after Smith's death. Sadow pointed to an October 10, 2007, interview by CNN's Larry King in which Stern accused Brighthaupt of stealing photos of Smith and selling them to tabloids. Howard K. Stern, right, companion of Anna Nicole Smith, is one of three people charged in the case. Before her son's death, Smith was a happy, normal person, Brighthaupt said. Brighthaupt described Smith as "manipulative" when she wanted something.
