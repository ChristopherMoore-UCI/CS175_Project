Premier Wen Jiabao this week also ordered railway authorities, who had planned to invest over $400 billion into new projects in the next five years, to conduct thorough safety inspections on all high-speed rail lines both in operation and under construction, state-run Xinhua news agency reported. "It is important that we integrate our effort in pursuing speed, quality, efficiency and safety with the understanding that safety always comes first." Railway officials later blamed design flaws in the rail signal equipment as the culprit. " Zhao, a long-time critic of China's high-speed rail plans, said slower trains would improve safety and cut operational cost, benefiting both operators and passengers. The news came on the heels of a Chinese government announcement to slow down bullet trains nationwide and halt approval for new construction, amid increasing public scrutiny on the country's railway safety following a crash last month that killed at least 40 people.
