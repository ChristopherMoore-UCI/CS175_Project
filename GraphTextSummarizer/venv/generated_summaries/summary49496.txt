-- Possible tornadoes cut a wide swath through north Texas on Wednesday night, killing at least six people and injuring more than 100 others, officials said. " There were reports of homes in Granbury being flattened with people inside, Hood County Judge Darrell Cockerham said. The National Weather Service warned that a mile-wide tornado reported by spotters had shifted its track and was moving "right at the city of Cleburne," a community of about 15,000 people in north Texas. Hood County Sheriff Roger Deeds said six people were killed when the powerful storm struck a Habitat for Humanity neighborhood in the area. The National Weather Service also said 32 counties in Texas and four in Oklahoma were under a tornado watch until 1 a.m. CT.
