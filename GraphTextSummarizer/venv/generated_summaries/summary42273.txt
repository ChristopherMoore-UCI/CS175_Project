The news release said they chose to carry out the operation in Algeria because the country's president, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, had allowed French military forces to cross Algerian air space in attacking Mali. The Westerners, accompanied by Algerian security forces, were en route to In Amenas Airport when they were attacked early in the morning by a group of no more than 20 people, the official, Diho Weld Qabliyeh, told Algerian state television. The incident may be linked to France's military support for the government of nearby Mali, according to reports from the region. The source said the abductors were demanding that members of their group being held prisoner be released and sent to northern Mali. But the real number of U.S. hostages could be as few as three, two U.S. officials said Wednesday.
