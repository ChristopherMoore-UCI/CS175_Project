A male used Carlesha Freeland-Gaither's ATM card at 6:01 a.m. a bank in Aberdeen, Maryland, about a 75-mile drive southwest from the Philadelphia street where she was forced into a car on Sunday night, Philadelphia police Chief Inspector Dennis Wilson told reporters. -- Two days after a Philadelphia woman's abduction was captured on video, police say they have a lead across the state line: Someone used her bank card Tuesday morning in Maryland. But he said surveillance video showed a male "similar" to the man who police say dragged and abducted the 22-year-old woman Sunday night. Investigators aren't sure whether she knew her abductor, though there's no indication on the Philadelphia surveillance video that she did, Wilson said. We just want Carlesha returned to us safely," her grandmother Ana Mulero said at a news conference with Wilson in Philadelphia.
