Ferrari have absolved driver Felipe Massa from any blame after he crashed out of the Monaco Grand Prix, saying the collision was caused by car failure. "The best news to come out of the Monaco weekend is that Felipe is fine," said Ferrari team boss Stefano Domenicali. The Brazilian, who suffered serious head injuries in an incident at the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix, crashed twice in two days at Monte Carlo's demanding street circuit. When Massa collided with the barriers at the first corner during final practice on Saturday, Ferrari blamed the accident on driver error. The season resumes in Canada next month and Domenicali said the team were steeling themselves for a season of ups and downs.
