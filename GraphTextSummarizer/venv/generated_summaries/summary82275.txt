Dramatic video of a stunt pilot buzzing a Texas runway -- narrowly missing two people -- has prompted the Federal Aviation Administration to investigate the incident, authorities confirmed Thursday. FAA spokesman Lynn Lunsford said Thursday the agency is investigating the incident. A CNN phone call to Newburg was not immediately returned, nor were e-mails to the motorcycle stunt team. The Smoking Gun is owned by Turner Broadcasting, which also owns CNN. The pilot, identified as Jason Newburg, previously had an FAA waiver to do aerobatics at the airport, but the waiver expired in November, an FAA source -- who requested anonymity because of the ongoing investigation -- told CNN.
