But when Jeter will join the list of past Yankee greats remains a mystery that most New Yorkers aren't looking to unravel just yet. But the Tigers on Thursday swept the Yanks, whose hitters largely struggled throughout the post-season with a measly .188 playoff batting average, raising questions about the team's penchant for aging stars and amplifying calls to develop the next generation of Yankee greats. A virtual shoo-in for Major League Baseball's Hall of Fame, Jeter last year became only the 28th player in baseball history -- and the first Yankee -- to reach the 3,000-hit mark. -- Longtime New York Yankees icon Derek Jeter underwent surgery Saturday in Charlotte, North Carolina, to mend the left ankle he fractured fielding a ground ball in the 12th inning of what was the beginning of his team's post-season collapse. Rivera, baseball's all-time leading career saves leader (608), hit the dirt in agony while shagging fly balls during a practice session in Kansas City, leaving the Yankees to fill his shoes with a younger though surprisingly proficient pitching staff.
