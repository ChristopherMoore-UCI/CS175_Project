The four laborers were sleeping in an under-construction building that the plane crashed into, said Pervez George, a spokesman for Pakistan's Civil Aviation Authority. The pilot appeared to deliberately bring the plane down in a less densely populated residential area in order to save lives, Masood Raza, a Karachi district government official, told CNN affiliate GEO News in Pakistan. The plane arrived in Karachi on Saturday from Fujairah, United Arab Emirates, George said. The cargo plane took off at 1:45 a.m. (3:45 p.m. Saturday ET) from the Jinnah Karachi International Airport for Khartoum, Sudan, and went down a few minutes later in the Gulistan-e Johar section of Karachi, an area where many Pakistani naval officers live. Firefighters, rescue personnel and area residents rushed to the scene, with jet fuel fanning the large flames and huge plumes of smoke.
