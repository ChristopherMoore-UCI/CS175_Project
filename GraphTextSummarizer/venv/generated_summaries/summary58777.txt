-- Vice President Joe Biden and Republican vice presidential contender Paul Ryan plowed fertile ground in terms of policy and politics during their debate -- now the question is whether the presidential candidates can reap what was sown. In doing so, Biden helped set up President Barack Obama to further those arguments during the second presidential debate on Tuesday in New York, political experts say. Political analysts say Biden also helped re-energize Democrats, whose spirits might have flagged after Obama's lackluster performance in last week's debate. "Ryan was also surprisingly strong on foreign policy, holding his own against a man far more schooled in the subject. Biden aggressively pressed Ryan on Thursday to defend his ticket's positions on everything from Medicare to trimming the nation's debt to the way forward in dealing with Iran.
