Comey also said police agencies around the country are now getting FBI training to do cyber investigations. -- A possible threat posed by thousands of westerners who have been drawn to Syria by the ongoing civil war has become a top worry among counter-terrorism officials in Europe and the United States, FBI Director James Comey said Friday. Comey said his agency was working with police around the country to try to help them respond to, and possibly thwart, mass shootings. The comments came in a meeting with reporters at FBI headquarters that covered a number of topics. As more crime moves from the street to online, more victims of theft could be helped by local police who are trained to do such investigations.
