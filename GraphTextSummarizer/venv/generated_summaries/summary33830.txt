Despite the many questions surrounding a reported altercation between Solange Knowles and her brother-in-law Jay Z, you wouldn't know it based on how the rapper and his wife Beyonce are acting. A recent surveillance video which appears to show the singer, fashionista and younger sister of Beyonce attacking the "Magna Carta Holy Grail" rapper has not only sparked an avalanche of memes, but also much speculation as to what led to the alleged incident, initially reported by TMZ, in the first place. According to Us Weekly, such behavior as what allegedly happened inside The Standard Hotel elevator is nothing new for Beyonce and Jay Z. As crisis communications expert Howard Bragman told CNN, "Jay Z and Beyonce have all the money and power in the world, and they couldn't keep it under wraps apparently. So close that Knowles has written hit songs for her sister, including "Upgrade U." But despite the pair's shared love of music and fashion, Beyonce told the New York Times in 2012 that there was one area her younger sister refused to bend on.
