The F-16Cs assigned to the Tulsa Air National Guard collided during a training mission near Moline on October 20, 2014, during an air combat maneuver training mission. The student pilot's plane had "significant damage to the right wing," but he was able to land at Tulsa International Airport in Oklahoma. When two fighter jets met in midair over Kansas last year, it turned one to wreckage and clipped a wing off the other, destroying $22 million in government property. The report said that private property was not significantly damaged. Pictures released by the U.S. Air Force show one jet lying in pieces in a field, while the other jet was parked in a hangar with half the right wing missing and damaged parts lying on the floor.
