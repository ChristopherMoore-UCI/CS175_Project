The fatalities -- three Interior Ministry officials and a child -- included the director of the Falluja police intelligence department, the deputy police chief of the Garma police station, the police commissioner and a 7-year-old boy, police said. The children -- brothers -- were playing when the vehicle drove by carrying the four police officials, who had attended a funeral in eastern Falluja and were returning home when it detonated, police said. The wounded included a 5-year-old boy and a police official, police said. The report of the blast came after bombings in three Iraqi cities over the previous day killed five people and wounded several others, police told CNN. Over a two-hour period in and around the capital, Baghdad, on Wednesday, three attacks wounded several people, police said.
