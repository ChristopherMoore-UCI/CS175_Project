The airlines, which merged last year to become the world's largest carrier, said the sick calls began Tuesday, largely impacting the airports in New York and Newark, New Jersey, said airline spokeswoman Megan McCarthy. The recently merged Continental and United Airlines canceled 24 flights Wednesday due to pilot sick calls, which occurred as United Continental Holdings is negotiating a collective bargaining agreement with the pilots, an airline spokeswoman said. Wendy Morse, chairman of the United Master Executive Council of the Air Line Pilots Association, made that remark as shareholders gathered for an annual United Airlines meeting. Morse said that without an agreement with pilots, "the company will never be able to achieve the full benefits of the merger. "Until an agreement is reached, this merger cannot be considered anything close to a success," Morse said in a statement in June.
