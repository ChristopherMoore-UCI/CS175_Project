-- Most horses at this month's World Equestrian Games could clear the water jumps. Journey required a special pass to head inside venues with Collier, hence becoming the first accredited canine in World Equestrian Games history. Driving is the sport to pick if you want to see horses navigate water. Step forward Sweden's Rolf-Goran Bengtsson, who clattered into a fence on his own ride (Casall Ask) then had to watch Dutchman Jeroen Dubbeldam horse whisper his way to a clear round on the same horse. The most visually appealing of those tests is the marathon, in which the driver and horses must face a time trial across a course involving miniature mazes, lakes, hills and other hazards.
