Moreover, private and public research institutions from Cornell to Ohio State University rely partly on NASA grants to support their graduate students, post-docs, and other staff in STEM fields. Behind the scenes, largely invisible to the public, are many of America's best scientists and engineers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, NASA centers, and research facilities who work on these missions to make space exploration possible. If we end the Cassini or the Curiosity mission, it would be a crisis not just for science but for America's leadership in STEM. In other words, NASA funding not only expands the frontiers of our knowledge, it also trains the next generation of STEM leaders in our country. And NASA has put plans for future missions to the outer solar system on ice, despite efforts by the planetary community to plan cost-effective and exciting opportunities.
