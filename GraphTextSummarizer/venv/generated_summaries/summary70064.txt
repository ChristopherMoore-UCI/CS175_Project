The pattern would repeat in 2012 when North Korea seized Kenneth Bae, an American whom Kim Jong Un sought to leverage into concessions. Their anger is justified, but the decision should surprise no one: There is a long history of rogue regimes seizing hostages against the backdrop of diplomacy to extract concessions, humiliate the United States or signal unease. North Korean leader Kim Jong Il used the episode to solidify the position of his third son and designated successor, Kim Jong Un. Whenever the United States tries to use diplomacy to bring rogue regimes in from the cold, it faces hostage crises. But the use of hostages to extract concessions or dampen the enthusiasm surrounding reconciliation is part of a consistent pattern.
