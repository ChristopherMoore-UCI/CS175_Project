In cases involving classified information, courts must apply a law called the Classified Information Procedures Act or CIPA, which lays out a painstaking, multipart process allowing intelligence experts a chance to redact certain documents. Kim's lead lawyer, Abbe Lowell -- who has represented some of Washington's most famous defendants including former Sen. John Edwards and former "super-lobbyist" Jack Abramoff -- also tried to get more information to help his client. -- Lawyers for a former State Department contract worker accused of leaking national secrets to a Fox News reporter are questioning whether search warrants in the case were properly obtained and may ask a federal judge to throw out evidence seized with the warrants. Lowell told Kollar-Kotelly that the intelligence community had imposed so many constraints on the flow of information that Lowell is not even allowed to utter the name of the reporter involved or the news organization because the government considers it classified information. Lowell is seeking to get the government to determine whether hundreds of pages of information that may be relevant to the case will be kept classified or declassified.
