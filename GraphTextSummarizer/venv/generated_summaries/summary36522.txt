-- A Marine who used his Facebook page to criticize President Barack Obama has been discharged, a Marine Corps spokesman said Wednesday. The board found Stein violated rules limiting political conduct by service members. Nearly 30,000 people "like" Stein's Armed Forces Tea Party page. Facebook members responding to news of Stein's discharge Wednesday were largely supportive. While the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution protects the free speech rights of ordinary citizens, a Defense Department rule prohibits service members from engaging in some forms of political activity.
