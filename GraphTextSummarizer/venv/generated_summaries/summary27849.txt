-- Police in southern New Zealand nabbed a would-be burglar after they posted security camera images of him trying to break into a safe on the popular social networking site, Facebook. In November, Facebook helped a seafood restaurant owner in Melbourne identify five customers who dined on oysters, trout and expensive wine and then bolted without paying the US $323 bill. Facebook, the Web's most popular social networking site, allows users to create personal profiles. The waitress suggested the restaurateur look through her friend's list on Facebook. The police department created its online presence on the site just two months ago, said Constable Sean Drader.
