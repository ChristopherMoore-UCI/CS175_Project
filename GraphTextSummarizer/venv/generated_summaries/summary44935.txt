-- Former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair, who left office last June, has taken up a part-time job with a Wall Street bank on an estimated $1 million salary. Before his re-election in 2005, Blair had vowed to serve a full third term, but political infighting within Labour ranks culminated in a political coup that prompted him to leave office early. His predecessor as prime minister, John Major, took a position with the Carlyle Group, a private investment house, as did former U.S. President George H.W. Bush. "We operate our business all over the world, and Tony Blair will bring our leaders and clients a unique and invaluable global perspective that is especially critical in turbulent times like these," said Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of the company, in the statement. Advisory jobs such as the one Blair has accepted are popular among former world leaders.
