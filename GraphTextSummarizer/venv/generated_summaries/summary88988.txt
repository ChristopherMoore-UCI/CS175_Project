The pact also seemed a promotional effort by Los Angeles officials to drum up film productions for Hollywood, he said. -- Hollywood and India's Bollywood have signed a historic cooperation pact that will have the world's two leading film industries working together in areas from production to distribution to content protection. Los Angeles officials appeared to be seeking film productions to replace those that have moved to other states or countries where costs are cheaper, he said. Already we have seen significant collaboration in technology between Hollywood and South India, and we will soon see collaborations in production," Suresh said. The event was attended by Los Angeles Mayor Anotonio Villaraigosa as well as many of Hollywood's and Bollywood's industry elite.
