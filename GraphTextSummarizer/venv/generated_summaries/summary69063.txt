The symmetry of a planetary nebula is usually disturbed -- for example, by the way its star spins or if there are multiple stars in the system. White dwarfs are small, dense and hot, and they cool down over billions of years. It is more luminous than our sun, and its ultraviolet radiation gives a glow to the ring of atmosphere that has been cast out.
