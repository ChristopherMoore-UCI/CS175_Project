Cepelova will next play German Andrea Petkovic, who beat young Canadian sixth seed Eugenie Bouchard 1-6 6-3 7-5 in Saturday's opening semifinal. -- They are former Olympic doubles champions, but Switzerland's "dream team" of Roger Federer and Stanislas Wawrinka suffered another Davis Cup disaster on Saturday. Andrey Golubev, who upset Wawrinka in Friday's singles, teamed up with debutant Aleksandr Nedovyesov to triumph 6-4 7-6 (7-5) 4-6 7-6 (8-6) in match lasting just under three hours in Geneva. The 27-year-old is ranked 76th in singles and 126th in doubles. The defending champion Czech Republic team marched into the last four after sealing an unbeatable 3-0 lead against Japan in Tokyo.
