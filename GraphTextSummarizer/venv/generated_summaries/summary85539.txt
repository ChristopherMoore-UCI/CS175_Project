Simon and Glass are working on a project to compare the "emotional well-being" of U.S. parents versus parents from 21 other developed countries. Both Simon and Glass say parents in the U.S. often lack the proper support, child care and assistance to raise a child. The authors of this study say as children mature, they require less care and stress for parents -- and can become a source of support for moms and dads. "Research shows women in our country often lose out financially and in career advancement once they become a parent -- because the U.S. does not have the type of work policies to properly support families and child care, like other developed nations," said Glass. In fact, other studies suggest that having children can have a negative impact on happiness.
