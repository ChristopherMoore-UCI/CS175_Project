"We are thrilled by the prospect of bringing to Nashville a family focused entertainment center with one of the pre-eminent theme park owners and operators in the country," said Colin V. Reed, chairman and chief executive officer, for Gaylord Entertainment. The new 50/50 joint venture between Gaylord Entertainment Co. and Dollywood will be developed on a 114-acre site for a family entertainment zone across from the Gaylord Opryland Resort and Convention Convention Center. Parton, who turned 66 on Thursday, told CNN's Brooke Baldwin that "we are going to be bringing more family entertainment into Nashville." The park will provide a mix of high-energy water activities for the summer season and designated snow activities for winter play. The park will be similar to the Snow Mountain attraction at Stone Mountain Park near Atlanta, according to CNN affiliate WKRN.
