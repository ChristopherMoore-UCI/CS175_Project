All Israeli leaders are legitimate targets because Israeli soldiers killed Palestinian children and women, and they entered Al Aqsa mosque and attacked Palestinians, said Sami Abu Zuhri. The military and police said they also uncovered an intended gun and car attack on the Jewish West Bank settlement of Gush Etzion. The indictment sheet says the plot was hatched in August during Operation Protective Edge -- an Israeli military assault against the Hamas military wing in Gaza, designed to stop Palestinian rocket attacks into Israel. The Israeli military said Friday it arrested three Palestinians from the West Bank and charged them in an alleged plot to assassinate Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman. Lieberman has a home in a West Bank settlement.
