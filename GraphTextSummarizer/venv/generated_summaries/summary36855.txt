Knies is hopeful that soon the world will embrace solar power as the leading source of energy. Gerhard Knies, co-founder and coordinator of TREC, a network that promotes renewable energies When he retired from his research into particle physics in 2001, Knies was concerned that the planet's impending energy crisis was not being solved. "My guess is that solar energy will be 40 to 70 percent of the total energy consumption, 30 to 60 years from now," he said. The network, which has members from six European and ten Middle Eastern and North African countries, encourages countries to work together to harness the power of the sun to bring clean energy to the world -- and they think they've found a way to do it. -- Dr. Gerhard Knies is the coordinator of TREC, the Trans-Mediterranean Renewable Energy Cooperation, a network of around 50 experts in renewable energies and sustainability.
