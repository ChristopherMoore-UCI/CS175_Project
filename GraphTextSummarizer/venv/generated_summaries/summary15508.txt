Elsewhere in Germany, Borussia Dortmund ensured they would finish the Bundesliga season in second position after twice coming from behind to draw with fourth placed Bayer Leverkusen. In Italy, Napoli drew 0-0 away to fifth-placed Inter Milan meaning one more victory will guarantee Rafa Benitez's side a spot in next season's Champions League qualifying stages. Leverkusen remain in fourth position, four points behind third-placed Schalke who play tomorrow against Borussia Monchengladbach, themselves chasing a Europa League place. In winning at Ajaccio, however, Monaco moved 11 points clear of third-placed Lille, all but confirming automatic qualification to the group stages of next seasons Champion's League. Real are next in action on Tuesday as they look to protect their slender one goal lead over Bayern Munich in the second leg of the Champions League semifinal.
