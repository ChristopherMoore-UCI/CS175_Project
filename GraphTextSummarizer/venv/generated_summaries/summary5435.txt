-- When 34-year-old Puspanahtan Subramaniam was leaving his home in Kuala Lumpur to board Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, his two young children didn't want him to go. That is all I hope for," said Gurusami Subramaniam, who is waiting in agony for updates on the missing plane that carried 239 people, including his son. He says he worked 20 years as a security guard to put his son through college. They clung to his legs and refused to let go until the IT specialist promised to bring them chocolates and presents when he returned from his trip to Beijing, said his father. Subramaniam hardly sleeps, he says.
