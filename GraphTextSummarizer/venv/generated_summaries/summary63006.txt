"At the end of the day, studios are always very wary of content protection, and making sure what content they do provide can't be abused or copied illegally" notes Andrew Muirhead, the director of innovation at Lufthansa Technik, a subsidiary of Deutsche Lufthansa. Front and center is Row 44, an in-fight internet provider that has recently added live TV and video-on-demand to the list of services it offers airlines. " Air Baltic seems to be atypical; Southwest Airlines, which charges passengers $5 to enjoy live TV, has witnessed an uptick in their revenue (though they declined to disclose how much). "You're going to see a lot more cases where airlines will opt not to invest in an imbedded in-fight entertainment system, and will say, 'let Samsung or HP do the investment,' in terms of letting people bring in their own devices," says John LaValle, CEO of Global Eagle Entertainment (of which Row 44 is a subsidiary). By comparison, he notes, portable devices "can be put up fairy quickly, and can be changed quickly without a big investment."
