The brothers must navigate wave after wave of soldiers, whacked-out cultists and creepy creatures created from Alma's mind. While the action is pretty linear, there are detours in which you can search for hidden weapons and ammo, psychic link gathering locations, and an Alma doll, which scores big points when found. "F.E.A.R. 3" (Day 1 Studios, Warner Bros. Interactive) continues its franchise's story of a family in conflict as two brothers work together to track down their psychically enhanced mother, Alma, who is about to give birth. You can work together with your teammates to survive waves of enemies emerging from an advancing fog, or be possessed by Alma and try to take over your former teammates. "F.E.A.R 3" is a well-made first-person shooter that will challenge players with intelligent enemies and compelling battles.
