-- NASA said Wednesday that it is collaborating with recording artist Mary J. Blige to encourage girls and young women to pursue careers by studying science, technology, engineering and mathematics -- collectively known as STEM. In addition to being prepared to deliver NASA content to middle school students this summer, they will have the opportunity to support the NASA academy's fall academic session as student aides for grades one through nine, it said. A public service announcement featuring shuttle astronaut Leland Melvin and Blige will begin running this week on NASA TV and on the agency's website. The NASA program, part of the president's Educate to Innovate Campaign, started this summer with the aim of engaging middle school students in science-related activities during the summer break. "Mary's presence can help NASA make the STEM message more appealing to these communities and increase the pipeline of underrepresented students going into these disciplines," he said.
