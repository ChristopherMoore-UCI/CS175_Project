During the concert, Harrington left her friends to use the restroom, Virginia State Police spokeswoman Corinne Geller said Wednesday, and when she did not return they called her on her cell phone at 8:48 p.m. "We will stop at nothing until she is found," Harrington's father, Dan Harrington of Roanoke, Virginia, told reporters Wednesday. Harrington's purse, with her identification and cell phone inside, was found the following day in an overflow parking lot near the arena, Geller said. There are restrooms inside the arena, Geller said, and police do not know how or why Harrington got outside. At about 9:30 p.m. that night, witnesses reported seeing a person matching Harrington's description walking on a nearby bridge, Geller said.
