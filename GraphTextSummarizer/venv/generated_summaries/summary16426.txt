Nelson said, "I consider myself lucky to have achieved a lifelong dream of mine to publish my first book; a serious, generational nonfiction book on the lives of accomplished black women in America living in this new 'Age of Michelle Obama.' She agreed, saying the research for her book showed that a man was not intimidated by accomplished black women; that men want someone with a great personality, who will treat them with respect and who will leave the baggage behind.
