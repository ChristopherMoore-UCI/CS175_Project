"Here's a situation where, you know, it should have been readily apparent to anyone that there were plenty of qualified women but they had to make this special effort." Socarides gave Romney points for trying to hire women but said in doing so, "Romney demonstrates that he's living in another world. Obama said his administration's Affordable Care Act gives insured women free contraception coverage and asserted that Romney "feels comfortable having politicians in Washington decide the health care choices that women are making." Romney reacts to frenzy over 'binders' comment Romney pushed back, calling the president's statement "completely and totally wrong." Romney campaign surrogate Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tennessee, said one reason more women may be looking to vote for Romney is because of his economic message. A USA Today/Gallup poll conducted last week showed Romney had closed the gap with women and was within one point among women who are likely voters, 48% for Romney and 49% for Obama. But there is a lingering perception behind the comedic Internet takes on Romney's "binders full of women" response and pre-emptive advertising aimed at women that he is disconnected from the day-to-day issues facing that critical group of voters.
