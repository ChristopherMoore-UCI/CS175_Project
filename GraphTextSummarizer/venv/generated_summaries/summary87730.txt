The four major networks —ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC — currently have no plans broadcast it, most instead airing their fall finales — a choice one Hispanic advocate called a "double standard" aimed at President Obama. "The fact that they're not doing the same for President Obama speaks of a double standard," he said.
