-- U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates flew into Iraq on Monday to oversee a change of command of American forces. Gen. Ray Odierno will take over command Tuesday from Gen. David Petraeus, whose 20-month term in Iraq saw a significant decline in violence with the deployment of additional U.S. troops. Gates said the cooperation between Iraqi security forces and coalition forces was responsible for the improvement in security, according to the statement, and al-Maliki praised the successes of the Iraqi armed forces. U.S. forces are in "mission transition," Gates said Monday, with some troops going home and others backing up Iraqis. "The challenge for Odierno is how do we work with the Iraqis to preserve the gains we've already achieved and expand on them even as the number of U.S. forces are shrinking." Odierno is expected to set the stage for an eventual U.S. withdrawal.
