Titles such as "Diablo III" and "Guild Wars 2" are drawing legions of players to their computers to play games, pushing the limits of towers and laptops. Razer, a high-performance gaming hardware manufacturer, wants to let gamers skip the tower entirely and go straight to its laptop, pushing its hardware to meet the needs of those players with the newly redesigned Razer Blade. Tan said his team listened to what players said they liked, and what they didn't, when putting together a new design revealed last week at gaming convention PAX Prime. For those gamers who already purchased the gaming laptop, Razer is offering a $500 "thank you" toward the purchase of the new Blade. Several third-party vendors have signed up with Razer to design apps specifically for the Switchblade and gaming.
