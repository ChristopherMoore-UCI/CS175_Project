Orange County District Attorney Jim Woodall told CNN that he's thinking about withdrawing fraud charges against ex-UNC professor Julius Nyang'oro. Wainstein told the board that his team had been briefed by the criminal investigators and that Crowder and Nyang'oro were interviewed, "thanks in large part to the efforts and assistance of Orange County District Attorney James Woodall Jr." Wainstein also said that his team has collected and searched 1.5 million e-mails and documents from more than 30 people, including faculty, athletic administrators at UNC. Woodall said his decision was based on great cooperation from Nyang'oro in the criminal investigation and the latest UNC-commissioned inquiry, this one being conducted by former Homeland Security adviser Ken Wainstein. Whistleblower and former reading specialist Mary Willingham, along with former athletes, have also publicly said there was systematic cheating in the classes and that the Athletic Department used the paper classes to keep athletes eligible when they would have otherwise failed. Woodall said he thinks it is better for the community to have Nyang'oro's cooperation -- to understand why, how and when the paper classes began and who had knowledge of them -- than to have a criminal prosecution move forward.
