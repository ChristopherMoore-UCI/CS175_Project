You see children playing, sleeping or sitting on everything from road construction sites to private home construction. But child advocates say this is one step toward child labor continues a cycle of poverty and is simply dangerous for children. The scene is repeated on construction sites throughout the city, and by no means is this just on sites related to the Commonwealth Games. Miller says by law the children should not be on construction sites, while they are not normally paid by the contractors, the older children often end up doing work for free just to help their parents. "What you see at constructions sites, all kinds of hazardous materials," activist and urban planner Dunu Roy said.
