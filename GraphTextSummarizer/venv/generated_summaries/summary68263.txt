Speaking at a televised news conference, the club's general affairs manager, Jan van Halst, urged fans not to come to the stadium to see the damage as it might hinder the work of emergency responders. FC Twente also made its first appearance in the Champions League, a major European tournament, last season. Building work was being carried out on the roof above the stands at the FC Twente soccer club's De Grolsch Veste stadium. The club, founded in 1965, finished second in the top Dutch league, the Eredivisie, last season, having won it the year before. Sniffer dogs are being used to search for any others who may be trapped in the wreckage, Moniek Eberhard in the mayor's office for the town of Enschede told CNN.
