Noting that it's not a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty or the Missile Technology Control Regime, North Korea said it "has a right to conduct as many nuclear tests or missile launches as it wants in the event that the supreme interests of the state are infringed upon." Meanwhile, senior Obama administration officials said a high-level U.S. delegation is going to Asia for a series of "intensive consultations" on what North Korea's increasingly alarming behavior means for American security alliances in the region. North Korea has been negotiating over its nuclear program with the United States, Russia, China, Japan and South Korea in six-party talks. North Korea test-fired a short-range missile Friday off the country's east coast, a South Korean military source said. A visit to North Korea South Korean and U.S. forces were placed on their second-highest surveillance alert level Thursday, the joint forces announced. "Additional intelligence assets, including personnel, will be deployed while reconnaissance operations over North Korea will increase," South Korean defense spokesman Won Tae-jae said, according to Yonhap.
