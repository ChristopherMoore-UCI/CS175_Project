-- A fortnight after Japan's Kei Nishikori became the first Asian man to play in a grand slam final in the Open era -- going down in straight sets to Croatia's Marin Cilic at Flushing Meadows -- he sat down with CNN in Hong Kong to talk the U.S. Open, his new-found stardom and the impact his new coach Michael Chang has had on his game. I spend more time with him on the court, more practice and more training -- that's why I could play seven matches in the U.S. Open, even though I played two (that went to) five sets. To make that U.S. Open final, you had to get past Novak Djokovic in the semis. You've been coached by former French Open champion Michael Chang since January. So I hope I can get leadership and this will help for sure in Asia to go to finals in grand slams.
