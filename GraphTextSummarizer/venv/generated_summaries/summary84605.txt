That sent the vehicle bouncing across an uneven median, Arizona Department of Public Safety Officer Carrick Cook said. Other passengers jumped to their feet, subdued the attacker and helped the driver stop the bus in the median, just seconds before it would have barreled head-on into other vehicles, police said. " Police said they believe the attacker was Maquel Donyel Morris, 25. No immediate public statement was made on Morris' behalf. I think the officer (at the scene) said it was about 6 feet from going into oncoming traffic.
