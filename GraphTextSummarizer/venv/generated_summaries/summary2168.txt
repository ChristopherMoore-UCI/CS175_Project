Sudan's Commander Abdullah Al-Matari called for enhanced military ties with Iran and said the establishment of marine security was a priority for both nations, IRNA said. "These visits by Iranian navy warships to Sudan come in the framework of routine exercises by navy forces of friendly nations," Col. Khaled Saad al-Sawarmy, the official spokesman for the Sudanese armed forces, told CNN. They arrived less than a week after a weapons factory in Khartoum was bombed, killing two people, in what Sudanese officials said was an airstrike by Israel, Iran's foe. The last such visit came at the end of October, when a pair of Iranian warships spent four days docked in Port Sudan, according to Sudanese state media. " The two ships are a destroyer and a helicopter carrier, Iran's state-run news agency IRNA said.
