Residents in Fargo and Moorhead are busy building sandbag dikes along the river's edge. Authorities from Connecticut, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island and West Virginia said they each had one storm-related death. Last year, the river rose to a record 40.8 feet at Fargo. "We have every contractor we have in the area on a 24-hour shift, preparing dikes, hauling dirt, delivering sandbags," Fargo Mayor Dennis Walaker said. Last week, warm weather and rain melted snow south of Fargo and Moorhead, Minnesota, causing the Red River to swell as it flows north.
