Chapman, 55, is serving a sentence of 20 years to life in prison for the shooting death of Lennon outside Lennon's New York City apartment on December 8, 1980. He has served 29 years of his sentence at the maximum-security Attica Correctional Facility, where he is held in a building with other prisoners who are not considered to pose a threat to him, according to officials with the state Department of Correctional Services. The last time Chapman was up for parole, in 2008, the New York State Division of Parole issued a release saying Chapman's request was denied "due to concern for the public safety and welfare." Yoko Ono, Lennon's widow, in previous years has submitted a letter requesting that parole be denied. -- John Lennon's killer, Mark David Chapman, is up for parole for the sixth time, just months short of the 30th anniversary of the former Beatle's death.
