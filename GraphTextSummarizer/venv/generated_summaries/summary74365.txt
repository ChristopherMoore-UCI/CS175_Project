The problem today is that through word and deed, it seems like every elected member of our government is going out of his or her way to illustrate to young people that government does not matter, that the fundamental challenges of our time are better left for others. By eschewing regular participation in electoral politics, young people are making the choice to serve their community and country in other ways, namely through volunteerism. As members of America's largest generation, the millennials, young voters certainly made their mark on U.S. politics when they turned out in force and paved the way for Barack Obama to win the Iowa caucuses in 2008. In fact, if that vote had taken place only among caucus-goers over 30, Hillary Clinton would have won Iowa (and likely would be president today). Meanwhile, the number of young voters who believe that elected officials seemed to be motivated by selfish reasons has increased from 54% in 2010 to 62% today.
