-- France has too many foreigners and is not integrating them properly, President Nicolas Sarkozy said in an interview on French television. Last year, a controversial French law went into effect banning Islamic face coverings in public places. And he said if he won a second term he would "celebrate with those I love -- my wife and daughter." Issues surrounding immigration and integration have troubled French politicians for years. France places a premium on national identity, pressing the population to put "Frenchness" before religion or national background. He faces a strong challenge from Francois Hollande of the Socialist party and a range of candidates from smaller parties, including the far-right Marine Le Pen.
