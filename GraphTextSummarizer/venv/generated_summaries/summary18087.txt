"We are seeing a double to quadruple increase in the number of children with respiratory infections," says Dr. Andi Shane, hospital epidemiologist at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta. U.S. 'ill-prepared' for a pandemic, feds say More than 10 states around the Midwest and Southeast have reported seeing similarly high numbers of hospitalizations for children with severe respiratory illnesses. The CDC doesn't require state health departments to track these types of infections, since they are usually dealt with at home and patients recover with a little TLC. Children's Healthcare, like most hospitals around the nation, tests samples from children with respiratory illnesses to determine if they have a viral infection. Nineteen of the 25 samples sent from Children's Hospital Colorado were EV-D68, said Dr. Christine Nyquist, medical director of infection control.
