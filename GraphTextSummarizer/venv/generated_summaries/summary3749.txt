The B.A.A. and Fleming acknowledge that the upcoming marathon is going to be considerably larger than previous years: "We know that since April 15 the demand in the running community and those around Boston has increased. Isabelle Goosen, who participated in the 2013 Boston Marathon and was half a mile away from completing the race before the attack, told CNN that she is excited to finally finish the race she started last year. -- The Boston Athletic Association is providing an additional 9,000 spots in the 2014 Boston Marathon to accommodate runners who were unable to finish last year's race because of the terror attack bombings. " Another addition to next year's race will be the planting of 100,000 daffodils along the marathon's entire route, according to Diane Valle, who began the group Marathon Daffodils. "We hope the communal act of planting together will strengthen Boston Strong and will add a bit of hope and rebirth." The April 15, 2013, double bombings near the finish line killed three people and injured at least 264.
