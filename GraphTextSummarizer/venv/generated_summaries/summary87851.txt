Flights destined for Newark Liberty International Airport in northern New Jersey were arriving more than four hours late on average, the FAA reported around 4 p.m. ET on its website. -- A winter storm blasting the Northeast caused significant headaches for travelers on Friday, including long delays at several airports, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. Significant delays were reported elsewhere in the region as well, including about 2Â½ hours at both New York's LaGuardia airport and Boston's Logan airport. By 9 p.m., for instance, most Northeast airports were experiencing only minimal delays. One exception then was LaGuardia, which still was experiencing 2Â½-hour backups on arriving flights, according to the FAA.
