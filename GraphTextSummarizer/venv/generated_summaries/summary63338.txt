Dozens of people have been killed over the last few weeks in fighting between Syrian security forces and protesters who are speaking out against their government. All that data sent anonymously, ultimately to advertisers, focused on reaching people likely to buy certain products or watch certain shows. President Obama has said he's open to this idea, and some experts think it could give rebels help in fighting government forces. A mission that started with preventing attacks from the air is now focused, not even two weeks later, on destroying targets on the ground. The strategy has shifted, and now the U.S. forces are focused on refueling planes, jamming communication and striking Gadhafi forces.
