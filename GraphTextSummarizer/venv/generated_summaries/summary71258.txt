While Woods ended a 30-month wait for a PGA Tour title at the Arnold Palmer Invitational in March, he then struggled to maintain that form as he finished 40th at the Masters, missed the cut at Quail Hollow and then tied for 40th at the Players Championship. Levin, still seeking his first PGA Tour win, carded 75 to tie for fourth with compatriot Daniel Summerhays (69). Late lapses cost Tiger at Memorial "I've been very proud of what I've done so far and I feel like I've got a lot of years ahead of me," said Woods, who raised his hopes of a first major win since 2008 at this month's U.S. Open at San Francisco's Olympic Club. Tiger Woods tied Jack Nicklaus on 73 PGA Tour victories after sinking a sensational chip from off the green late in the final round of the Memorial Tournament on Sunday. He has had to defend himself from criticism over the work he is doing with coach Sean Foley to rebuild his swing, but if Woods needs evidence of a turning point in his fortunes then he will look no further than the 16th hole at Muirfield.
