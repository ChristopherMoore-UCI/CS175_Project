Teenager Shiffrin was excited to relegate Maria Hoefl-Riesch and Tina Maze into the minor places, but absolutely thrilled to get an early Christmas present, whom she quickly named Rudolph. I remember being five years old and Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer was my favorite song," she told the official World Cup skiing website. For Shiffrin, the reindeer was the icing on the cake after a superb performance, keeping the red World Cup leaders' bib she earned last season. Fellow skiing superstar Lindsey Vonn of the United States also claimed a four-legged prize after winning a race in Val d'Isere in France, opting for a cow rather than the prize money. She won't be taking the reindeer with her on her travels, but will meet Rudolph again when she returns to the Finnish ski resort of Levi for further races.
