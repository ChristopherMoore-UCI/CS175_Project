Words of praise Malaysia's government has been widely criticized over its handling of the search for missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 and disclosures of its investigations. The search for the missing Malaysia Airlines plane will be entering a new phase that will use private contractors and may cost about $60 million, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said Monday. But on Sunday, U.S. President Barack Obama had words of praise during a visit to the southeast Asian country. "That discussion has begun in Malaysia and around the world, and we'll see what improvements might be recommended to continue improving aviation security. The U.N. organization said among the safety recommendations in the report is a suggestion by Malaysia that the aviation world needs to look at real-time tracking of commercial aircraft.
