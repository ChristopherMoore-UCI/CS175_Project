The episode title was "Where'd the Money Go?" Flanked by two of her three daughters, including her then-15 year old who counted 100 pairs of shoes in her own closet, Lorenz got a televised dose of reality from the mustachioed host. Her turnaround began in November 2004, when -- with debt amounting to about $50,000, Lorenz said -- she appeared on "Dr. Phil." Ever since her hometown of Fort Myers, Florida, earned the distinction of having the highest rate of foreclosures in the country, Lynette Lorenz has spent the bulk of a year away -- 1,200 miles away -- from her home and her husband. Homesickness drove her back to Florida in July, where she found the Fort Myers economy in even worse shape and jobs even tougher to come by. Tony and Lynette Lorenz pose, in more financially secure times, for a picture the night before their 2004 wedding.
