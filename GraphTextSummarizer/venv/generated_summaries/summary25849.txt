Police identified the victims as driver Maria Gonzalez, 45; Jocelyn Gonzalez, 10; Maria Nunez, 39; Niely Rosario, 7; Marly Rosario, 3; Jacob Nunez, 85; and Ana Julia Martinez, 81. The vehicle was traveling at a high speed, said FDNY Deputy Chief Ronald Werner. "Police determined that a 2004 Honda Pilot traveling southbound on the Bronx River Parkway in the left lane had struck the center median, crossed over three southbound lanes and struck the curb, causing the vehicle to become airborne and continue over the guardrail and fall approximately 59 feet down into a wooded area inside of Bronx Zoo property," the New York Police Department said in a statement. " The area where the vehicle fell is adjacent to where the zoo's trams are parked, Werner said. The crushed vehicle came to rest in overgrown brush, Werner said.
