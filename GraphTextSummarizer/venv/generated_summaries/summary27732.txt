Ghana earned a semifinal clash with hosts Equatorial Guinea after dispatching a disappointing Guinea 3-0 in the Africa Cup of Nations Sunday. Bony at the double Sunday's other quarterfinal saw two goals from new Manchester City signing Wilfried Bony lift the Ivory Coast to a 3-1 victory over Algeria. Gervinho added a late third on a counter attack at the death as Ivory Coast revenged an extra time defeat by Algeria at the same stage of the 2010 Africa Cup of Nations. There was still time for Yattara to complete a miserable evening for his team after recklessly hacking down Asamoah Gyan in stoppage time and earning a deserved red card. To the dismay of his teammates and Guinea supporters, he sliced it into the path of Kwesi Appiah, who added the second just before halftime.
