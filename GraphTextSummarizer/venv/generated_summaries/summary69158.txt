Both the produce safety commission and U.S. PIRG feel, however, that their agencies are under threat from Congress relaxing safety standards, as a result of toy lobbying groups. While U.S. PIRG -- a non-partisan consumer advocacy group -- does not test every toy sold in stores, it takes random samples and has them laboratory tested to check for acceptable levels of toxic substances or other hazards. "So much has been done in the name of toy safety, from government and industry, so consumers should feel quite comforted that what they find, has been found safe," said Lawrence. U.S. PIRG doesn't identify which countries are the biggest culprits with using toxic materials in the manufacture of toys. According to U.S. PIRG, "over 400 children died from toy-related injuries" between 1990 and 2010, and more than half of those choked.
