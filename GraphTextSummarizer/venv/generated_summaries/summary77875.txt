He said the Army must adapt so that young officers with diverse experience and accomplishments are rewarded with promotions and that it must "re-think the way it deals with the outstanding young leaders in its lower and middle-ranks. Gates remarks contrasted with some in America who are pushing for the U.S. military to take a more active role in other places like Libya, where huge groups of protesters are trying to overthrow the government of Col. Moammar Gadhafi. But he said he is confident that future engagements involving the Army will less likely include head-on clashes of large mechanized armies. Gates encouraged the future Army officers to look outside the armed forces for experiences that will make them better soldiers and leaders. He said that the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have created a group of highly-experienced, battle tested young officers who too often leave the Army just when it needs their skills and knowledge the most.
