Speaking Tuesday in Warsaw, Poland, President Barack Obama said that Bergdahl had not then been interrogated by U.S. officials because he is still undergoing medical care. McHugh's comments Tuesday followed those of Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Martin Dempsey, who stressed that questions of Bergdahl's conduct is separate from the effort to recover any missing U.S. soldier. Bergdahl will remain at that U.S. Army medical center in Germany until he completes treatment, a U.S. defense official there told CNN. Also, many soldiers in Bergdahl's platoon said attacks seemed to increase against the United States in Paktika province in the days and weeks following his disappearance. According to firsthand accounts from soldiers in his platoon, Bergdahl -- sometime before he was set to go on guard duty -- shed his weapons and walked off an observation post with nothing more than a compass, a knife, water, a digital camera and a diary.
