Police have identified the man whose shooting of another man outside a store in Naples, Italy, was captured by a surveillance camera, the Italian news agency ANSA reported Saturday. Police said they knew of no motive for the killing, which took place in the poor neighborhood of Rione Sanita, where Camorra, the name for organized crime in Naples, is strong. A source who was not identified publicly said the killer was a man in his 30s from Naples' northern Sanita district who had recently left the city. A police spokesman said Camorra has been blamed for about 60 killings this year in Naples and its surrounding county. A third man seen in the video was thought to have been an accomplice, but he told Il Mattino newspaper that he had nothing to do with the killing.
