"I found out that people struggle to understand and most people never can imagine that motorsport can come to Africa or to Nigeria." Adeshokan, who recently appointed veteran British motorsport executive John Wickham as team manager, says that right now there is a "50-50" chance for NRE to be ready for the GT3 race in Moscow in early September. Called Nigeria Racing Eagle (NRE), the team says it hopes to compete at major motor racing events over the next few months, including the FIA GT3 series and sports car endurance races. London-based entrepreneur Ribi Adeshokan has entered his country into the lavish and highly-competitive world of car racing and has ambitious plans to drive African motorsport and build a multi-million dollar racing industry on the continent. "The idea of a racing team called Nigeria Racing Eagle is to use African drivers and gradually develop African mechanics and engineers," he says. "One of the key pillars of this project is not just about putting together a racing team -- it's about introducing motorsport to West Africa and that means we have to create circuits, we have to create series and, most importantly, we have to create drivers," says Sam Collins, NRE's lead driver.
