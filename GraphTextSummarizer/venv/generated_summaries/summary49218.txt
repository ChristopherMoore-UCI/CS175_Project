Gardner, a registered sex offender, is scheduled to be arraigned Wednesday, according to San Diego County district attorney's spokesman Steve Walker. "There is strong likelihood that we have found Chelsea," San Diego County Sheriff William Gore said at a news conference. The last reported sighting of the high school senior was at school Thursday, according to sheriff's department spokeswoman Susan Plese. -- Hundreds of people gathered Tuesday night for a candlelight vigil outside a San Diego, California, church in honor of a teenage girl missing since Thursday. The vigil was held just hours after authorities said they found human remains in an area where they had been searching for 17-year-old Chelsea King.
