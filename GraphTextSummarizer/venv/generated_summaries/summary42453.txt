-- A television station in Hong Kong has been fined for airing a report in July that suggested former Chinese President Jiang Zemin had died, regulators said Tuesday. According to a report in the South China Morning Post, ATV senior vice-president Kwong Hoi-ying repeatedly pressed the station's news department to run the report, telling them he had received reliable information about Jiang's death. Death rumors spur reflections on Jiang legacy Jiang also saw the peaceful handover of Hong Kong from Britain to China and that of Macau from Portugal, while repeatedly threatening to use military power against Taiwan if it declared independence. "ATV accepts the Broadcasting Authority's ruling, but reserves agreement on some of the points outlined by the Authority," the station said in a statement received by CNN Tuesday.
