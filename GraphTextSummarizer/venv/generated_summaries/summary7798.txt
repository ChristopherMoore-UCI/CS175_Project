Thus making a quick switch from organs supplied by death row inmates to a system based on altruism will be tough without a major shift in attitudes -- something the head of China's transplant system acknowledges. To plug the shortfall, China has relied overwhelmingly on organs from death row prisoners. The country launched a voluntary donation scheme in 2010 but between that year and 2013 only 1,448 people donated organs -- a drop in the ocean compared with around 300,000 people in need of organ transplants each year. " China said on Thursday it would end the harvesting of organs from executed prisoners on January 1 and while the move has been welcomed by human rights groups, it's hard to see how China can wean itself from the controversial practice if the views of people like Zhou are anything to go by. Last month, local officials in southern China were found to have bought and sold dead bodies to fulfill cremation quotas in a "body snatching" scandal across two provinces.
