ISIS has published what it claims is an interview with Abaaoud and says that he escaped to Syria, the counterterrorism official told CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank. One line of inquiry being looked at is whether Abaaoud tried to fake his own death last year while fighting with ISIS in Syria so that he could disappear off the radar screen of Western intelligence services. Belgian officials are aware of the claims that the suspected ringleader fled to Syria, the official said, but they cannot confirm that is where he is. Belgian investigators believe Abaaoud, rather than dying on the front lines, traveled to Greece and suspect he was communicating by phone from there. Abdelhamid Abaaoud, a Belgian-Moroccan ISIS fighter, is believed to have been the head of the terror cell that was in a deadly shootout with police during a January 15 raid in the Belgian town of Verviers.
