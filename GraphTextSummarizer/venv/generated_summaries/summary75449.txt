But Morsy, who was elected as president with 52% of the vote last year, retains a substantial support base, which has congregated at rallies in places like Nasr City in Cairo. CNN senior international correspondent Ben Wedeman, a former Cairo bureau chief who has been covering the crisis, said one protester at a pro-Morsy rally had told him he felt demonstrators would stay there "until Mohamed Morsy is once again president of Egypt." El-Sisi said Adly Mansour, head of the country's Supreme Constitutional Court, would replace Morsy as interim president and Mansour was sworn in on Thursday. The military's actions have been decried as a coup by Morsy supporters but celebrated as a "correction" and an expression of the popular will by his opponents. Morsy, a Western-educated Islamist aligned with the Muslim Brotherhood movement, had rejected an ultimatum delivered by the military to resolve the crisis within 48 hours, creating a stand-off with the military, the most powerful institution in the country.
