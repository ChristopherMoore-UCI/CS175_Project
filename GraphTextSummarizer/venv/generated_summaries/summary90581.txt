" Official government statistics show a steady increase in foreign tourists arriving in Macedonia from 99,000 in 2001 to almost 262,000 last year. Regardless of personal opinions of the project, Skopje 2014 and other infrastructure investments do appear to be helping Macedonia to attract foreign tourists. "This is the first year when Skopje received more tourists than Ohrid, the leading tourism destination of Macedonia. Starting from last year, the number of nights spent in Macedonia has increased." Nikolovski said there had been a 25% increase in foreign tourists visiting Macedonia in the first seven months of this year, compared with the same period last year.
