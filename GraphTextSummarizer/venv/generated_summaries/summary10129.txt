The Pakistani government, the U.N., the World Bank, and other international organizations have set an April 2013 deadline to come up with a plan to provide education to all of Pakistan's school-aged children by the end of 2015. Former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown marked the occasion here on Friday by delivering a petition to the Pakistani government with one million signatures calling on Islamabad to enroll every Pakistani boy and girl in primary school. The U.N. says Pakistan spends seven times more on the military than on primary education. The United Nations has declared November 10 as Malala day to honor the 15 year-old Pakistani activist who was shot in the head one month ago by the Taliban, which wanted to silence her campaign for education. A Population Council report this year said Pakistan spends less public money on education than any other south Asian country.
