It is the first gun Mandela owned and the first weapon linked to the anti-apartheid fight in South Africa, Wolpe said. A scramble to find the gun has sparked a frenzy among collectors, historians and Mandela fans. During the interview, Mandela indicated that he buried the pistol, ammunition and the uniform at the site in case there was a raid at the house, according to Wolpe. "Obviously, it would be totally inappropriate to ask him for help now," Wolpe said of the ailing 92-year-old Mandela. Mandela and the military wing of the African National Congress used the secret location -- now Liliesleaf Farm -- to plan the toppling of the South African apartheid government.
