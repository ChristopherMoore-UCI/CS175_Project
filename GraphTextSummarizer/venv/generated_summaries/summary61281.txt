He said: "The bailout deal will hit hard on them and this will lead into a serious problem, but I am afraid that more banks in other European countries will face similar issues." The Union of Arab Banks, headquartered in Beirut, Lebanon, was setup in 1974 to foster cooperation between Islamic banks and support those in the region. But Youssif said he is not in favour of shifting towards Islamic finance without fully understanding all the aspects of Islamic banking. Youssif said: "I think the Gulf banks will take the lead, spearheaded by banks in Saudi Arabia, UAE and Qatar respectively." He said: "It is not only about laws and Islamic banking products; there should be an appropriate environment and solid follow up and control from the central bank."
