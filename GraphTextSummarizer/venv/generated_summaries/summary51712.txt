Johannes Mehserle was convicted of fatally shooting Grant in the back on New Year's Day in 2009 as he lay on a platform at the Fruitvale BART Station in Oakland, a case that is recounted in the award-winning movie "Fruitvale Station." Coogler wrote the film, which stars Michael B. Jordan, Octavia Spencer, Kevin Durand and Chad Michael Murray. It went on to win the award for Best First Film at the 66th Cannes Film Festival. The case has continued to draw interest and questions, with first-time director Ryan Coogler tackling the story in the independent film "Fruitvale Station" that was released this year.
