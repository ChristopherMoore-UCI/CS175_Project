Regardless of your opinion on their design, there's no denying Wenlock and Mandeville's impressive social media credentials. But maybe that's just the response from an "older, stuffier generation," as Wenlock and Mandeville co-designer Grant Hunter told CNN. But I don't think they've pulled it off completely," Mark Sinclair, deputy editor of London design magazine, Creative Review, told CNN. The pair were designed by marketing agency Iris and named after the Shropshire town of Much Wenlock, which helped inspire Pierre de Coubertin to launch the modern Olympics, and the Buckinghamshire village of Stoke Mandeville, where the Paralympics were founded. Described as everything from "a drunken one-night stand between a Teletubby and a Dalek," to having "just the right balance of digital zeitgeist and cheeky playfulness," it seems people still aren't quite sure what to make of London 2012's mascots.
