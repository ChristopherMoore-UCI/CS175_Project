A recent study by the Chicago Alliance Against Sexual Exploitation conducted among johns in Chicago, Illinois, found that 41 percent of them said John School would deter them from buying sex, compared with 92 percent who said being placed on a sex offender registry would scare them from re-offending. John School models in other communities may differ. Brett Beasley, with Nashville's Health Department, educates men arrested for trying to buy sex about STDs. The thinking is: Women won't stop selling sex until men stop buying. The FBI's 2007 Uniform Crime Report lists about 78,000 arrests for prostitution and commercialized vice, but experts say those numbers are extremely conservative because many sex workers and johns aren't caught.
