Caterham used crowd funding to raise enough cash to race in Abu Dhabi but that is not a realistic funding option for a full season, which costs at least $70m. Meanwhile, the administrators for Marussia are focused on generating funds through next week's auction to pay the team's creditors. The plight of the Marussia team gives motorsport collectors and F1 fans a unique chance to get their hands on some amazing pieces of F1 kit. While the online auction of Marussia assets presents a chance to buy some very special Christmas presents for the F1 fan in your life, the team will be hoping for some festive good cheer -- and a last-minute buyer. It is understood that an investor was close to finalizing a deal to buy Marussia on the eve of the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. There is also a chance to buy driver Max Chilton's race suit and a collection of team shirts and baseball caps.
