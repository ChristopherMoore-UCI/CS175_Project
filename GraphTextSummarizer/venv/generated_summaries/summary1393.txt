-- Investigators found "widespread cracking" on the skin of a Southwest Airlines Boeing 737 that made an emergency landing in Arizona after a hole opened on top of the aircraft during flight Friday, a National Transportation Safety Board member said Sunday. NTSB member Robert Sumwalt told reporters. Representatives from the NTSB, the Federal Aviation Administration, Boeing and the airline organized into teams to investigate the aircraft's structure, metallurgical aspects of the plane, flight data recordings and its maintenance records, Sumwalt said. The cracking would likely not be visible during routine inspections, but could have been seen when the plane underwent major maintenance and was disassembled in March 2010, Sumwalt said. As of Sunday afternoon, 19 planes were returned to service after "intense inspection," the airline said in a statement.
