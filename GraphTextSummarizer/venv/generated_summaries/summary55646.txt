-- Michael Adebowale, 22, has been charged with murder in the hacking death of British soldier Lee Rigby earlier this month on a London street, Metropolitan Police said late Wednesday. Rigby's fiancee, Aimee West, told Britain's Press Association on Wednesday night that she's "extremely proud" of him and "devastated" by his death. Her comments came in a statement to the news service issued through the Metropolitan Police; while police didn't relay that statement to CNN, they did confirm that they'd passed on West's remarks to the Press Association. The killing of Rigby, who had served as an infantryman in Afghanistan and Cyprus, in the southeast London district of Woolwich shocked people across the United Kingdom. He was one of two people -- along with a 28-year-old man whom family, friends and acquaintances have identified as Michael Adebolajo -- arrested after being wounded in a confrontation with police after the May 22 attack.
