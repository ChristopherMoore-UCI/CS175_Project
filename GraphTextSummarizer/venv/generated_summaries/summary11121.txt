Ever since Empress Wu Zetian sent a pair of panda bears to the Japanese emperor around A.D. 700, China's public face has been represented by the furry goodwill ambassadors, who even forced a smile from Richard Nixon. One showed a gaggle of cubs eagerly descending a slide in what looked like panda day care. Then we went online and found videos of tourists, somewhere in China, embracing pandas. Today, we noticed upon arrival in Shanghai, you don't see dour Mao nearly as much as Jingjing, the flower-crowned cartoon panda that's one of the Beijing 2008 Olympic mascots, and just the first in the parade of pandas that adorn China's storefronts, advertising, clothing, and vibrant cell-phone-charm industry. My girlfriend, Ronni, and her twin sister, Marina, rented a documentary on panda bears.
