-- Manchester City have given another signal of their intent to wrest the English Premier League title back from neighbors Manchester United with the signing of Brazilian Fernandinho. City finished a distant second to Manchester United in the race for the Premier League title and the club sacked manager Roberto Mancini last month. His last cap for Brazil came in a friendly with Bosnia and Herzegovina back in February 2012 but he has not featured under new national team coach Luiz Felipe Scolari. Fernandinho, 28, has five caps for his country and has played in the last eight European Champions League campaigns for the Ukrainian club. We've been talking with Manchester City for four months.
