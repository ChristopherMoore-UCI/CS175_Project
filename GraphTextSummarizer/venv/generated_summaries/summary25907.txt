The protests prompted President Traian Basescu to call for an inquiry into discipline problems at the ministry. -- Romanian Interior Minister Vasile Blaga resigned Monday, three days after thousands of policemen rallied outside the presidential palace protesting a 25 percent pay cut. Blaga called his decision to leave a "resignation of honor," adding he can not accept that the whole ministry is to be blamed for the actions of some protesters, which he called mistakes. But Blaga said Monday the actions of 6,000 policemen cannot impugn the 150,000 employees who make up the ministry. The next day, the prime minister also dropped police officers from his detail.
