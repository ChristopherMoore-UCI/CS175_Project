Valencia showed little of the form which saw them dispatch Villarreal 4-1 last week and aside from a deflected David Silva shot which went close and a David Navarro header offered scant threat in attack. In other matches on Sunday, Tenerife held third-placed Valencia to a 0-0 draw while Real Mallorca went fourth on goal difference ahead of Deportivo La Coruna after claiming a 1-1 draw at Espanyol. -- Goal machine Cristiano Ronaldo scored two first half goals in quick succession to power Real Madrid to a 2-0 win over Malaga in the Bernabeu, but also earned his second red card of the season. Ronaldo's strikes all but sealed victory for Real by halftime, but he blotted his copybook with a flying elbow earning him his marching orders in the 70th minute, his second dismissal this season. Pablo Osvaldo gave Espanyol the lead just after halftime with Bonja Valero equalizing from the spot in the 80th minute.
