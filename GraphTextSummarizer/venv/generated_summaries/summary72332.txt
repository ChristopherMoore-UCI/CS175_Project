Ban said he was assured by Kai Eide, the top U.N. official in Afghanistan, that Afghan President Hamid Karzai has instructed his Interior Ministry to provide strengthened security, and he said the United Nations will also take necessary measures to beef up security -- in other areas of the country as well as Kabul. He also urged the Afghan government to engage in politically conciliatory dialogue with many ethnic group leaders and regional country leaders. "This is a sad day and very difficult day for the United Nations," Ban said, condemning the "shocking and shameless act and the terrorists who committed this crime" and noting that the incident is a reminder of how tough the U.N. job is in Afghanistan. -- The United Nations is reviewing its security procedures after an attack on a private guesthouse in central Kabul killed five U.N. staff members Wednesday. The second round of the presidential election -- a runoff between Karzai and Abdullah Abdullah -- comes after a first round marred with complaints of fraud, and the polling has led war critics to question whether the United States and other nations should invest their money and lives in a country where the government appears corrupt.
