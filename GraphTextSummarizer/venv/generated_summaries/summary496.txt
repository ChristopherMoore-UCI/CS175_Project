-- Racist abuse on social media shows no sign of diminishing in European football after British police launched an investigation into abusive tweets sent to Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli. "The issue has been escalating and we urge fellow social media users to assist in bringing this type of abuse to the attention of the authorities by reporting directly to True Vision." "During the 2013/14 season, 50% of all complaints submitted to us from across the game related to social media abuse," added the Kick It Out statement. "A large number of social media users alerted us to the messages by tweeting our official account and we have since reported this via True Vision -- the police's online reporting facility. In an interview with CNN in 2013, Mario Balotelli -- then an AC Milan player-- vowed to walk off the pitch if he was racially abused at a football game.
