Activision CEO Eric Hirshberg said people want to be able to do things in video games they can't do in real life, but for first-person shooter games, there should be a limit. Driving games have also been creating more realistic cars and applying more accurate physics to movements. Mo-cap, as it is less formally called, is a video process of tracking movements by placing markers on real actors to record their motions. French developer Quantic Dream started down this path in 2010 with "Heavy Rain," a noir-thriller game featuring characters that nearly resembled human actors. While, in a way, it's like shooting a movie, the interactive nature of video games means developers have to plan for many different player actions.
