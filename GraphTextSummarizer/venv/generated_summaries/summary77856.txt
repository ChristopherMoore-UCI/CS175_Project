Penned by "Knocked Up" star Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg when they were still in high school, "Superbad" has what screenwriting gurus call a "quest" narrative: through a combination of chance and opportunism, Seth (Jonah Hill) and Evan (Michael Cera, from "Arrested Development") are entrusted with securing the alcohol for an end-of-term party. In "Superbad," Michael Cera (left) and Jonah Hill (right) go in search of a teen's holy grail: booze and sex. The hilarious film offers a younger skew on what must be labeled the Apatow house brand of touchy-feely sex comedy -- in other words, more extreme profanity and juvenile gross-out gags. Meanwhile, Seth and Evan gamely try to parlay a traffic accident into hard booze. The male sex organ and its potential applications are contemplated endlessly, inside and out, with Seth and Evan turning ideas over in their minds with the same mixture of curiosity, creativity and awe scientists dedicate to quantum physics and basketball fans reserve for the career of Steve Nash.
