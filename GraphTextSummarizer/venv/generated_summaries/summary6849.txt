Ahmed, a naturalized United States citizen who was born in Pakistan, waived his right to a jury trial so he could make the statement during closing arguments. Before closing arguments, Defense Attorney Jack Martin argued the case should be dismissed. During Martin's motion for dismissal, Ahmed stood and made an objection to his attorney's arguments. Martin wrapped up his case earlier Thursday after calling just two witnesses, Ahmed's older sister and his father. Martin said Ahmed moved to a suburban Atlanta neighborhood with his family when he was 12.
