A search of Mingo County court records show no criminal arrests or civil cases involving Maynard. It took two shots to kill Eugene Crum around noon Wednesday, as he sat in a parking lot near the Mingo County courthouse. His legacy will live on, Mingo County officials say. "The flame that Sheriff Crum sparked cannot be extinguished," Mingo County Prosecuting Attorney C. Michael Sparks said in a statement read at Thursday's press conference in Williamson. The man he allegedly killed, 59-year-old Eugene Crum, had been a county magistrate and a special investigator for the prosecutor's office before becoming sheriff in January.
