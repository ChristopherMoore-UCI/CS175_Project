When computer scientists talk about the possible threat to humanity from superintelligent AI, they don't mean the Terminator or Matrix. In the AI optimist camp, futurist and Google director of engineering Ray Kurzweil also sees intelligent machines precipitating human extinction, of a sort, only in Kurzweil's telling, humanity is not exterminated but subsumed into a superintelligent machine. Others are skeptical that AI will ever reach human levels of intelligence and cognition, let alone surpass it. For those anxious about AI, current efforts to develop self-correcting algorithms ("machine learning"), coupled with the relentless growth in computer power and the increasing ubiquity of sensors collecting all manner of intelligence and information around the world, will push AI to human and ultimately superhuman intelligence. In that event, AI researchers like Keefe Roedersheimer see a less inspiring finale: "All the people are dead."
