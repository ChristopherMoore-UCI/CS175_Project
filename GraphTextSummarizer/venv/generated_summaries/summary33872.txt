He also has said he is not trying to win the Tour of California but is riding in support of teammate Levi Leipheimer, who has won the race twice and leads this year's event. The bikes disappeared hours after the first stage of the nine-day Amgen Tour of California, in which Armstrong and the team are competing. Leong said the man who turned in Armstrong's bicycle "is not a suspect at this time" and did not ask about a reward offered by Armstrong's team for its return, he said. The bike is one of three believed to have been stolen Saturday from a trailer used by Armstrong's team, Astana, while the trailer was parked behind a Sacramento hotel, Leong said. By checking the serial number, "we were able to confirm that the bike was, in fact, Lance Armstrong's bicycle," said Leong, who added that the bike appeared to be in good condition.
