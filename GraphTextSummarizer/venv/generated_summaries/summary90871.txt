Delhi police officials said they too were on high alert after the blasts and were receiving regular updates from Jaipur on developments in the investigation. The state of Rajasthan, where Jaipur is located, was placed on alert, local officials said. Motorcycles, pieces of which were found at nearly every bomb site, appear to have been used in the attacks, said Rajasthan Home Minister Gulab Chand Kataria. The bombs exploded within about 500 meters (0.3 mile) of each other in Jaipur's old city, which is frequented by tourists. Another struck near a market area inside Jaipur's walled city where tourists and locals frequent restaurants and shops.
