No injuries have been reported and no homes have been damaged as of Saturday afternoon, according to Chios police. Mavros Volia beach, or "Black Rocks" beach, is usually brimming with tourists and Greek visitors from the mainland during August, with the small road that leads up to the beach packed with rental cars and motor bikes. The island is frequently plagued with fire in the summer months, mostly because of the combination of strong winds, and hot, dry weather, especially in August. While the island of Chios is not as popular as Mykonos or Crete, it still relies heavily on the mostly European tourists who visit in July and August every year. On the island of Chios however, tourism is the more immediate issue worrying residents.
