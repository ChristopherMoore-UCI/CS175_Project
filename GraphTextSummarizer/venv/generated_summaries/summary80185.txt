The family is waiting for word from the Justice Department before a deal is finalized, said Richard Schuler, the lawyer for the family of anthrax victim Robert Stevens. Stevens, a photo editor for supermarket-tabloid publisher American Media Inc., died five days after testing positive for inhalation anthrax in October 2001. A February report by the National Academy of Sciences concluded that it could not reach a "definitive conclusion" about the source of the anthrax, which federal agents said had been linked to a sample from Ivins' laboratory. The family sued the government for $50 million in 2003, arguing that the military laboratory in Maryland that was identified as the source of the bacterium should have had tighter security. The FBI eventually blamed the attacks on a civilian scientist at the Army's biological research laboratory at Fort Detrick, Maryland.
