In contrast, it was a slow start for Valentino Rossi, a seven-time world champion in the sport's premier class, who finished the Thursday session in 10th place and the same again in Friday's first run. The 26-year-old Australian led the pack at Thursday's first practice session at Losail, and was also fastest at the first of two runs on Friday. Ducati's American rider Nicky Hayden, another to have won the championship, finished third on Thursday -- while Honda's Andrea Dovizioso was in that position after Friday's opener. -- World motorcycling champion Casey Stoner is determined to show he is still the man to beat in 2012, having set the early pace ahead of the MotoGP season's opening race in Qatar on Sunday. The Italian rider will be hoping to make a comeback after a disappointing 2011 season, his first with Ducati after a long period of dominance at Yamaha.
