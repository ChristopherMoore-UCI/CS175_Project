-- The United States and Venezuela don't agree on many foreign policy issues, but both countries say a newspaper report claiming that Iran is building a missile base in the South American nation is not credible. According to Die Welt, Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad signed an agreement in October that included the development of a common medium-range missile. In the wake of the questions raised by the report, Venezuelan Foreign Minister Nicolas Maduro described the allegations as an "extravagant lie. The goal, the paper reported, is to protect Venezuela from air attacks. " "There is an international war machine against the prestige of Venezuelan democracy, against the prestige of the Bolivarian Revolution," Maduro said, referring to the country's social revolution.
