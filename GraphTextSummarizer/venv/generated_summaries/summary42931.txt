" Klein disputed the argument by Dr. Conrad Murray's lawyers that he addicted Jackson to Demerol in the months before his death, saying he used only low doses of the painkiller while repairing Jackson's collapsed nose and jawline. Klein said he was angry about Jackson's death under Murray's care. " Murray's defense contends Jackson became addicted to Demerol through frequent visits to Klein's Beverly Hills dermatology clinic in the months before his death. Murray was unaware of the addiction, and therefore unable to understand why he could not help Jackson sleep, the defense contends. But medical records of Jackson's visit to Klein's Beverly Hills clinic were introduced as evidence.
