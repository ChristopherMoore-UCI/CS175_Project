Barcelona's arch-rivals and reigning champions Real Madrid kept pace with a 4-0 win over Real Zaragoza but they remained eight points adrift of the leaders. Roberto Soldado and Nelson Valdez scored the goals to inflict a first defeat of the season on Atletico. Bayern were coming off their shock 2-1 home defeat to Bayer Leverkusen last Sunday but showed no ill effects as Germany midfielders Bastian Schweinsteiger, Thomas Mueller and Toni Kroos all scored in an easy victory. Second-placed Atletico Madrid lost 2-0 to Valencia in the late game to fall three points behind Barca. The Argentina international striker snapped his goal drought against Juve with a coolly taken penalty and then scored the second when Gianlugi Buffon could only parry out a shot by substitute Freddy Guarin.
