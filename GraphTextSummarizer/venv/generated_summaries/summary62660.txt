-- LeBron James is going home to Cleveland Thursday night wearing a Miami Heat jersey, and no less an authority than the basketball-loving president of the United States predicts a rough night. He recently urged Cavaliers fans to be classy when James arrives home Thursday, according to NBA.com. Just to make sure the court is safe for King James, the Cleveland Cavaliers say they will beef up security at Quicken Loans Arena, NBA officials have said. Former NBA great Kevin McHale agreed that James has more to fear from the fans than the Cavaliers themselves. He led the Cavaliers to the NBA finals in 2007, where they lost to the San Antonio Spurs, but never reached the finals again, despite Cleveland management bringing in supporting stars such as Shaquille O'Neal and Antawn Jamison.
