Guardians was a $170 million gamble for Marvel that featured unfamiliar characters and an untested lead actor, Parks and Rec favorite Chris Pratt, who stars with Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, and the voices of Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel. It's also the seventh best opening in history for a non-sequel (or sixth if you count Marvel's The Avengers as a mega-sequel), outpacing other superhero series debuts such as 2011's Thor ($65.7 million) and 2011's Captain America: The First Avenger ($65.1 million). Age of Extinction ($100 million) and Marvel's Captain America: The Winter Soldier ($95 million).
