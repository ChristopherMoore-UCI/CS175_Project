One millisievert per year is an internationally-recognized nuclear factory guideline for exposure to radiation by the general public, according to Dr. John Leung, radiation expert and physics professor at the University of Hong Kong. When Pieter Franken visited Hong Kong one of the first things he did was measure the level of radiation in his hotel room. The drive revealed that Hong Kong had a constant level of radiation that hovered around 0.2 microsievert per hour for an annualized dose of 2 millisieverts. "Your risk of having cancer is increased for 4 to 5% per sievert of radiation your body absorbs," explained Leung. To reduce everyday levels of radiation Safecast suggests opening doors and windows to ventilate rooms.
