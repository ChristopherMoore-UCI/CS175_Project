It turned out to be a bit of a commercial for Seinfeld's "Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee." Something having to do with Seinfeld's Web series "Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee"? Since a fan tweeted a picture of Jerry Seinfeld and Jason Alexander outside Tom's Restaurant, which served as a stand-in Monk's on the hit NBC show "Seinfeld," there has been buzz about what it could mean. The pair bantered about a friend's Super Bowl party and a discussion ensued about "over cheering" football games. On that show, Seinfeld often sits down for a chat with fellow comedians and celebs.
