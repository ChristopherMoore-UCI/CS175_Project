An ESPN report in June named Braun as one of more than a dozen players facing suspension due to a scandal involving performance-enhancing drugs. Braun said Thursday that feelings of anger and self-righteousness fueled his public comments after the arbitrator's decision in February 2012. "I felt wronged and attacked, but looking back now, I was the one who was wrong," Braun said Thursday. Faced with a 50-game suspension, Braun appealed the decision, and an arbitrator overturned the suspension on what some, including the chief executive of the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency, said was a technicality. Braun did not specify which drug he used, but his suspension came after baseball's investigation into Biogenesis, the now-defunct Florida clinic accused of providing performance-enhancing drugs to baseball players.
