Much like the Food Network, HGTV (which stands for Home and Garden TV) has made stars of its hosts and has additional properties, such as HGTV Magazine, which showcases its content. " "A real loss - so sorry for his friends and family - the show is my favorite HGTV show," one commenter wrote on Facebook, while another fan tweeted "Paul Walker and NOW Bill Beckwith who's next." -- As one of the stars of HGTV's "Curb Appeal," Bill Beckwith had a solid fan base. Chip Wade, host of HGTV's "Elbow Room," told Atlanta Magazine during a recent interview that "HGTV is a wholesome network" that doesn't "fabricate drama." "[The network's] bread and butter is people leaving it on all day," he said. With shows like "House Hunters," "Love It or List It" and "Curb Appeal," the niche network appears to appeal to everyone, from those who love to rehab on the weekends to home dwellers dreaming big when it comes to their abodes.
