Rodriguez filed the lawsuit in New York's Southern District court against Major League Baseball and the union in an effort to get back on the field next season. -- Lawyers for New York Yankees third baseman Alex Rodriguez have until Friday to respond to a letter from the Major League Baseball Players Association seeking a dismissal of Rodriguez's lawsuit claiming the union did not adequately represent him. The players union, which represented Rodriguez in his arbitration proceeding, claims in the letter that the "union's forceful advocacy" was demonstrated by the reduction of his suspension from the 211 games sought by MLB, among other things. Rodriguez, 38, is fifth on MLB's list of all-time home run leaders, just six homers behind Willie Mays. In a four-page letter addressed to U.S. District Judge Edgardo Ramos, dated Thursday, the union asked the court to throw out the claim against the union because Rodriguez "does not allege facts sufficient to overturn the [Arbitration] Award" and failed to provide evidence of a breach of the union's duties in representing him.
