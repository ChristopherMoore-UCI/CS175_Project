The exact wording of the Pledge has changed several times since Francis Bellamy wrote it; each change was reflective of contemporaneous concerns about the meaning. Sharp asked Bellamy to compose a Pledge of Allegiance to the flag. Daniel Sharp Ford, the owner of a magazine called Youth's Companion, was on a crusade to put American flags in every school in the country. As part of the campaign, Sharp gave an assignment to a member of his staff: Francis J. Bellamy, who was an author, a  minister and an advocate of the tenets of Christian socialism. The stiff-armed salute was for other people, in countries far away.
