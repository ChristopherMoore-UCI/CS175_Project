-- Bernard Hopkins erased the legendary George Foreman from the record books when he became boxing's oldest world champion with a points decision over Canadian Jean Pascal to win the World Boxing Council (WBC) light heavyweight title. Foreman had claimed claimed the title the year before when he knocked out Michael Moorer in the 10th round to win the IBF and World Boxing Association (WBA) heavyweight crowns on November 5, 1994. Hopkins built up a big points lead through the middle rounds, but came under pressure in the closing stages as the 26-year-old Pascal rallied with home support. " Hopkins (52-5-2) is 24 days older than Foreman was when his fellow American defended the International Boxing Federation (IBF) title against Germany's Axel Schulz in 1995 with a split-decision victory. Hopkins, who is 126 days beyond his 46th birthday, won the unanimous verdict of the judges after 12 rounds in the Bell Centre arena in Montreal Saturday night.
