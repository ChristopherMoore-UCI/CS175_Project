As if to check off the "we did everything we could" box, say couples counselors, President Obama and congressional leaders from both parties met to show that they met -- even though earlier this week, Obama told Hill leaders they needed to be "ready to talk solutions." As expected, the meeting produced no breakthrough and Friday night President Obama formally began the process of implementing the forced budget cuts he and Congress have been criticizing for weeks. Spending cut politics: DÃ©jÃ  vu all over again "They've lost sight of the big picture because they're so determined to be right and to win the argument, and that's what happens with couples," said Sharon Rivkin, a California-based marriage counselor and author of "Breaking the Argument Cycle." Obama: 'I am not a dictator, I'm the president' Instead, for the past few weeks, all sides -- the White House and Congress, Democrats and Republicans -- have done nothing but squabble like a dysfunctional married couple about who is responsible for the bad policy that is the forced budget cuts, all while avoiding dealing with the real issues. "And I think that's what we see between the president and the speaker." Obama and Boehner and both political parties seem to be suffering from another affliction Puhn sees in struggling couples. You can check off your list (that) you did couples mediation, but clearly nothing could possibly be accomplished."
