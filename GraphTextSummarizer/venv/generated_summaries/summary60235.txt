Robbins was taken to Illinois on Tuesday for a court hearing on unrelated weapons and drug charges, according to the Indiana Department of Correction. Steven Robbins, 44, convicted of a 2002 murder in Indianapolis, was freed Tuesday because of an error by Chicago court and security officials. "For reasons yet unknown, the offender was released by Illinois authorities," the Indiana Department of Correction said. -- A convicted murderer was on the loose Friday morning after he was mistakenly released from custody in Chicago. "The sheriff has ordered an investigation into the facts and circumstances regarding his court appearance and release from custody," the Cook County Sheriff's Department said.
