Brodsky said she hoped to include Afghanistan, but that became impossible because of the threat of violence and social barriers. "The Final Inch" is a testament of the health workers around the world laboring to make polio the second globally eliminated disease behind small pox, Brodsky said. The film focuses on "the final stages of a 20 year initiative" to eradicate polio around the world, Brodsky said. Although it has been 50 years since the United States developed a vaccination for polio, millions of children abroad remain unprotected. This year, there have been 26 recorded cases of polio around the world, compared with 46 people who were infected with polio last year.
