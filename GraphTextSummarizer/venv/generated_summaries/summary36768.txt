This week, residents of Jianshe village in Sichuan Province took delivery of blocks of money worth 13 million yuan ($2.1 million) in year-end bonuses they had earned from a rural co-operative scheme. Unfortunately, the scheme only allows investors who are members of Jianshe village. Chief villager, Jin Hongyuan, told local media he moved the money inside the village committee office after transporting it from the bank on Monday. Villager Jin Ou, who collected the most dividends from his investments, was delighted to finally get his hands on 300,000 yuan ($49,000) in cash. -- Farmers from a village in southwest China literally turned a multimillion dollar windfall into a wall of cash.
