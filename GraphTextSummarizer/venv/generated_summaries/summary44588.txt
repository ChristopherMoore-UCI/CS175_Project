-- Oscar Pistorius killed Reeva Steenkamp on Valentine's Day last year. The defense is likely to rely on three types of experts to support Pistorius' story: Ballistics Pistorius fired four shots. Roux said the defense ballistics expert would show that the order of shots was different, and that Pistorius fired the four shots in two quick bursts -- two "double taps." Mangena said it was "impossible" for the pattern of wounds on the body to be the result of two double taps, ultimately leaving Roux sighing dismissively and promising that his ballistics expert would explain. That's a direct contradiction of Pistorius' story that they were in the bedroom by about 10 p.m., her doing yoga and him watching television, and that they went to sleep after she finished her yoga. Pathology Pistorius threw up repeatedly as Gert Saayman, who performed the autopsy on Steenkamp, described the devastating wounds Pistorius inflicted on her.
