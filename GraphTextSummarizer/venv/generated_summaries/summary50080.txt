Phil Mickelson finished the day at 10-under-par alongside Jason Day while Louis Oosthuizen, Henrik Stenson, Ryan Palmer and Miko Ilonen are tied for fifth position at nine-under-par. Adam Scott scored a fine 66 to leave him tied at seven-under par with Lee Westwood, Hunter Mahan, Kevin Chappell and Jim Furyk. He bogeyed eight and then once again showed guile to par the ninth when he overshot the green. At this stage Day, Fowler and Palmer had clawed McIlroy back to tie for the lead at 10-under-par. And his big-hitting game seemed made for the tender greens in Louisville that had been softened by early morning rain.
