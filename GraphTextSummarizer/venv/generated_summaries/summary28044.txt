It's true that airline computers and electronic control systems allow pilots to fly "hands off" beginning soon after takeoff, continuing through the flight route and -- in very rare cases -- all the way through touchdown. They were the pilot, co-pilot and a flight engineer who managed pressurization, heating, fuel and pneumatic systems. " As MIT's Hansman explained it, pilotless airliners would simply be the end result of the current evolution of flight deck staffing. "That was a little-known part of the software that no airline operators or pilots knew about." Of course, most passengers never experience that kind of emergency. In one, pilots would fly airliners by remote control from "cockpits" on the ground -- just as pilots currently fly Predator military drones over Afghanistan and along the U.S.-Mexican border.
