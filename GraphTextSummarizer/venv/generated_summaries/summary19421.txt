-- The word Friday on a homicide investigation into the death of a man whose body was found less than a mile from the home of Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez was the same from authorities and from Hernandez -- no word at all. Hernandez has played three seasons for the Patriots, averaging 58 catches per year. Nearly a dozen Massachusetts state police officers entered Hernandez's home Tuesday evening, CNN affiliate WCVB reported. The 27-year-old Lloyd, a semi-pro football player, was found dead less than a mile from Hernandez's expansive home in North Attleborough. "It has been widely reported in the media that the state police have searched the home of our client, Aaron Hernandez, as part of an ongoing investigation," attorney Michael Fee said.
