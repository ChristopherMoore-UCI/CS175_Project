The four biggest recipients of Syrians registered as refugees or awaiting registration are: Lebanon -- 716,000 Jordan -- 515,000 Turkey -- 460,000 Iraq  -- 168,000 Government ministers from those four countries will meet with the UNHCR in Geneva Wednesday in an effort to generate greater international support for dealing with the refugee exodus. Wissam Tarif, executive director of the human rights group Insan, which is building a refugee camp in Lebanon, encouraged residents in neighboring countries to open their homes to refugees as prospects for housing them become thinner. The organization said that in Jordan, 70% of refugees live in urban areas rather than in camps, which makes it harder for aid agencies to find and help them. "Syria has become the great tragedy of this century -- a disgraceful humanitarian calamity with suffering and displacement unparalleled in recent history," said Antonio Guterres, the United Nations' high commissioner for refugees. The British Red Cross suggested that the U.N. figure for the total number of refugees may well be too conservative. "To have reached this landmark figure of 2 million registered refugees is shocking, but the true figure is likely to be higher," said Pete Garratt, a disaster manager for the British group.
