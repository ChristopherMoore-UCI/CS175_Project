The floods come at the worst possible time for Sochi with the International Olympic Committee coordination committee making its final visit to the city before the Games, which start on February 7. Streets and homes were flooded Tuesday with Irina Rossius, the press secretary for Russia's Emergencies Ministry, forced to admit that a state of emergency was still in effect, according to Russian state agency, RIA Novosti. "The exceptional weather conditions in Sochi have not impacted the visit of the IOC coordination commission that is in Sochi from Sept 24 to Sept 26," read a statement sent to CNN by the IOC.
