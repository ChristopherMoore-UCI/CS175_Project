The sea journey from Tacloban City took roughly 24 hours, in a ship normally used for naval transport. -- Nearly 3,000 survivors of Typhoon Haiyan disembarked from a Philippines naval ship in Cebu Friday, carrying the few possessions they could take with them. They said they could not get access to food or water and feared people were ransacking homes. Evacuees said they were relieved to have left Tacloban City, which they described as "dangerous" and even "hopeless." Asuncion's niece, eleven-year-old Misheiguel Cahuday, said she was sad to abandon her home in Tacloban City, but she understood the dangers and was trying to embrace the future.
