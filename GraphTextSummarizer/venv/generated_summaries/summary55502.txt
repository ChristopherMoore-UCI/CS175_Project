"Refloating stranded whales is a difficult and potentially dangerous job, so it's important we have the right people on the ground tonight trying to get these whales back to safety," said Andrew Lamason, the department's services manager for Golden Bay. The spit forms the top of Golden Bay, which is known as a stranding hotspot because of its protruding coastline, gently sloping beaches and system of currents. Surrounded by oceans rich in marine life, New Zealand has one of the highest stranding rates for sea mammals in the world. Conservationists are racing to try to save more than 170 whales stranded on a remote beach on New Zealand's South Island. The department's staff, helped by 140 volunteers, were planning to try to refloat the giant mammals as the tide rose Friday evening, it said.
