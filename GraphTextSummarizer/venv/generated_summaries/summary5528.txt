Vettel has been booed on the podium several times this year -- no doubt in part due to the Malaysia incident when he ignored team orders and passed Webber for victory -- but he celebrated at Yas Marina Sunday as he did in India last weekend on clinching a fourth straight title, with wheelspins. While Vettel began from the pit lane in similar circumstances last year to finish third, Raikkonen -- who is joining Ferrari next season after a pay dispute with Lotus -- started with the tailenders and a ding with a Caterham ended his hopes of repeating his 2012 success in the race. While Webber bounced back from yet another poor start to ensure a 15th 1-2 for the team -- he has only won once from nine poles -- Vettel motored clear once again while his rivals scrapped for minor placings. Two-time world champion Fernando Alonso remained second in the drivers' championship behind Vettel after coming home fifth, working his way up from 10th at the start, while teammate Felipe Massa was eighth. "The start wasn't great," said the 37-year-old, who held off Mercedes' third-placed Nico Rosberg and Lotus' Romain Grosjean in fourth.
