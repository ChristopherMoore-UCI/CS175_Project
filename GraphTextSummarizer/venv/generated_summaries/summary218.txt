A friend of Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev pleaded guilty Thursday to charges in connection with removing a backpack and computer from Tsarnaev's dorm room after the bombing. Tazhayakov knew the identity of the suspected bombers -- Tsarnaev and his older brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev -- before the public found out, allegedly texting Kadyrbayev: "I think they got his brother," hours before the public knew their names or their relationship to one another. Kadyrbayev told his friends that he believed Dzhokhar Tsarnaev "used the Vaseline 'to make bombs,' or words to that effect," an indictment against him reads. Kadyrbayev was charged with four counts including obstructing justice and conspiracy for allegedly throwing Tsarnaev's backpack into a dumpster after discovering it contained fireworks with gunpowder, and removing a jar of Vaseline and a computer thumb drive. The government said Tsarnaev texted Kadyrbayev after the bombings and told him he could go to his dorm room and take what he wanted.
