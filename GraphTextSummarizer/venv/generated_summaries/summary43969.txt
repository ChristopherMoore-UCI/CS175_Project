Terri Horman told investigators that she last saw Kyron the morning of June 4 as he walked down the hall toward his second-grade classroom at Skyline Elementary School. In divorce filings, Kaine Horman has said he believes that Terri Horman "is involved in the disappearance of my son Kyron. DeDe Spicher is a friend of Terri Horman's who stayed with her after Kaine Horman filed for divorce shortly after his son's disappearance and moved out of the family home. " "Our goals are to expand the search for Kyron and to bring him home as quickly as possible," said Desiree Young, the mother of missing Kyron Horman, who was last seen June 4. Police have not named a suspect in the case, but intense scrutiny has been placed on Kyron's stepmother, Terri Horman.
