"The U.N. counts a number of additional event types that ISAF does not include in its definition of security incidents, such as cache finds, arrests, assassinations, intimidation, and others," according to a statement Thursday from the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force. -- NATO says a new report by the United Nations that points to a spike in violence in Afghanistan differs from the alliance's tally because "security incidents" were defined differently. "The south and southeast of the country, particularly around the city of Kandahar, continued to be the focus of military activity and accounted for approximately two-thirds of total security incidents," the report says. The U.N. report, from the office of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, says security incidents in 2011 are up 39% over the same period last year. But a rash of recent high-profile attacks and assassinations have raised questions about the country's overall level of security, particularly as coalition forces are drawn down.
