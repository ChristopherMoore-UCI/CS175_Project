-- One person died and one person was wounded when an apparent altercation led to a shooting at a Seattle-area bar, police said Monday. "We have to talk to quite a few witnesses, so we're working with some of the witnesses who were closest to the situation," police spokeswoman Carla Iafrate told reporters. Bellevue police said there were about 600 people in the bar, and nearby officers immediately responded to reports of the shooting. Bellevue police said a 30-year-old man from Seattle was killed but did not identify him. No players were injured in the incident, which occurred just after 1 a.m. PT Monday.
