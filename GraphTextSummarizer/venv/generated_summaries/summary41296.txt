Liam McNamara, Assistant Keeper of the Ancient Egypt & Sudan collection at the Ashmolean, hopes the museum's redeveloped Ancient Egypt and Nubia galleries, which open to the public Saturday, will showcase the reality of ancient Egypt and help dispel some of the myths surrounding the ancient civilization. The Ashmolean Museum is one of the leading centers for the display and study of ancient Egypt and Nubia (modern-day Sudan). "The reality of ancient Egypt is equally as exciting as some of the bizarre myths that have been created around it and hopefully the new exhibits at the Ashmolean will inspire the next generation of Egyptologists," he said. Its collection contains a number of artifacts excavated by the so-called "fathers" of modern archaeology, including Sir William Matthew Flinders Petrie and Francis Llewellyn Griffith, who were working in the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries. The cause of Djeddjehutyiuefankh's death is unknown, but, said Norman, there was no sign of broken bones.
