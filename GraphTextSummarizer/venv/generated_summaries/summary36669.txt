Asad said it was clear the lawyer for the ISI, who was present when the postponement was announced, had not brought the seven detainees to court as ordered. But attorney Tariq Asad told CNN the court had delayed the hearing until Friday because other proceedings took up much of the day. The ISI blamed the 29-year-old's death on natural causes. The ISI denies any role in their deaths and holds to its claim that they died of natural causes. Her son, Abdul Saboor, was one of the four men who died while in the custody of the ISI, the family claims.
