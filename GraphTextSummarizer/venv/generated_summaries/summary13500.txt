When an auto executive was asked why his top-selling vehicle -- often compared to vanilla ice cream -- remained so popular, he pointed out that although some people may find vanilla ice cream boring, a lot of people like it. Not so Jay Leno, whose final "Tonight Show" is Friday. "Without fail, Leno's show fills an hour and kills an hour," wrote The Associated Press' Frazier Moore in a recent column on Leno's "Tonight" legacy. David Letterman, who watched Leno receive Johnny Carson's "Tonight Show" desk but never Carson's blessing, has long been touted as the King of Late Night's true successor with his CBS show. But the show, also beset by infighting between Leno's then-executive producer and NBC brass, suffered in the ratings, often finishing behind Letterman's CBS "Late Show," which premiered in 1993.
