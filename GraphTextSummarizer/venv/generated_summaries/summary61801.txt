Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro told a CNN reporting team Friday that it could continue reporting in the South American country, a day after the government revoked or denied press credentials for CNN journalists. While the journalists were asked to leave, CNN International and CNN en Español continue to broadcast in Venezuela. " Hours later, government officials notified seven journalists for CNN International and CNN en Español that their press accreditation had been denied or revoked. "CNN has reported both sides of the tense situation in Venezuela, even with very limited access to government officials," CNN said in a statement, adding that at the time its credentials were revoked, CNN was seeking an interview with the president. If they do not rectify things, get out of Venezuela, CNN, get out," Maduro said, to applause from his pro-government audience.
