Head for a comic book store, where you can generally find figurines, collectable action figures and specialized merchandise as well as comic books, graphic novels, DVDs and manga. For example, if the comic book geek in your life has a good relationship with the local comic shop purveyor, they might have an established wish list of comic books from certain authors or artists. They're not a one-star-fits-all kind of crowd, explained Brittney Dempsey, office manager for NASA's online Space Store. Fans of some sci-fi or fantasy television shows may also be part of the comic book fan culture, since many shows, such as "Buffy the Vampire Slayer," "True Blood," "The Walking Dead" and "Firefly," continue and develop story lines in comic book format. "Japanophile" geeks crave stories and characters that are different from American comic books and animation, said Colette Bennett, editor-in-chief of Tomopop.com, a blog about Japanese toys, collectibles and fan culture.
