The state argued in its appeal that it already provides equal marital rights and benefits to same-sex couples in New Jersey with civil unions, saying any federal benefits or rights deprived to partners in civil unions fall on the shoulders of the federal government, not theirs. "This is a historic moment for all loving and committed couples in New Jersey," said Mike Premo of New Jersey United For Marriage. But in her ruling on Thursday, Jacobson said the inability for partners in civil unions to access federal marriage benefits violates New Jersey's constitution. Superior Court Judge Mary Jacobson denied the state's motion to stay her September 27 ruling that civil unions were insufficient because they hindered federal benefits. A New Jersey judge rejected the state's appeal to halt same-sex marriages on Thursday, clearing the way for couples to marry later this month.
