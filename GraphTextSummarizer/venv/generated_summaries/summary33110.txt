The building was boarded up in the front but the back was open, leading firefighters to think that homeless people may have sought shelter there, Hoff said. Hoff identified those killed as Corey Ankum, who had been with the department less than two years, and 12-year veteran Edward Stringer. None of the injuries was life-threatening, said Fire Commissioner Robert Hoff in an afternoon news conference. The fire in the building's northeast corner had been brought under control, Hoff said, and firefighters were working on hot spots and "looking for homeless or vagrant people" when the collapse occurred. "There are things that happen when buildings are aged, and that could have been one of the contributing factors in this case," Hoff said.
