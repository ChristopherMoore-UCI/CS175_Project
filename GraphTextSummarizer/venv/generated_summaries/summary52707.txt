"I mean, [Liberace] was Las Vegas," museum director Tanya Combs said. Low attendance is the primary factor in the decision to close the museum, Liberace Foundation President Jack Rappaport said. Rappaport feels that the megaresort style of the new casinos of Las Vegas -- with high-end shopping, an abundance of restaurants, shows and other museum-type attractions -- gives tourists everything they could need. In addition to establishing the museum in Vegas, Liberace set up a foundation to provide scholarship money to students of the arts. But there will be no more camera-wielding visitors oohing and aahing over Liberace's rhinestone-studded piano, complete with matching costume and Roadster.
