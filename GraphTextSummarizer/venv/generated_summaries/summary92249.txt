"If you listen closely to the performance video, you can make out some of Spears' vocals under Sia's more charactered voice," Colin Stutz writes for Billboard. Some fans of Britney Spears are accusing the singer of lip-syncing to her song "Perfume" during her Las Vegas show. Billboard points out that Sia -- best known for her hit song "Chandelier" -- is credited as one of the writers of "Perfume." In reviewing the show for the Los Angeles Times, writer Mikael Wood points out that  the singer's show appears to take its title, "Piece of Me," literally. According to gossip site Oh No They Didn't, Spears' mouth is moving but the audience is mostly hearing singer Sia's version of the track.
