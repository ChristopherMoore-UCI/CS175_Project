-- High school athletic director Brian Bordainick felt like he'd been shot when he learned the crushing news about his "9th Ward Field of Dreams" project. Coach Shyrone Carey, left, and athletic director Brian Bordainick are rebuilding a once-dominant football team. " But four years after the storm, Carver students on the 65-acre campus are still struggling to learn without the benefit of permanent classrooms. A perennial football powerhouse, the team re-formed after Bordainick arrived at Carter in 2007, his first year in the Teach for America program. The architect was Steve Dumez, design director for Eskew+Dumez+Ripple, who agreed to help, despite Bordainick's preposterous plea.
