The proceedings marked a year since the tragic death of MotoGP star Marco Simoncelli in a freak accident at Sepang. Spain's Dani Pedrosa kept up the pressure on championship leader Jorge Lorenzo with victory in a rain-hit Malaysian MotoGP Sunday. Pedrosa passed pole sitter Lorenzo midway through the 20-lap race at Sepang which had to be shortened to 13 laps because of the appalling conditions. Pedrosa's teammate, the reigning world champion Casey Stoner of Australia, finished third, returning to the podium as he recovers from a ankle injury sustained in a crash in the U.S. round at Indianapolis. It was the third straight success for Honda's Pedrosa, but each time Yamaha's Lorenzo has occupied second place to limit the damage.
