Mexican international Hernandez, nicknamed 'little pea' strode on to a Darron Gibson pass before beating visiting goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey for his last minute clincher at Old Trafford. In other League Cup action, Premier League Wigan beat Swansea 2-0 and Birmingham saw off the challenge of third-flight Brentford in a penalty shoot out. It was Bebe's first goal since his surprise summer signing for United from Estrela Amorada. Hernandez had been introduced as a late substitute for Bebe, but not before the young Portuguese find had put United ahead early in the second half. But Wolves threatened an upset with George Elokobi muscling his way through to level from a corner, while the returning Stephen Hunt saw his shot clip the top of the crossbar as United wobbled.
