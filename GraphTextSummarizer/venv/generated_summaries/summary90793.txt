The Blue Devils apparently like playing in Final Fours in Indianapolis, home of the NCAA. The Kentucky Wildcats' bid for perfection ended Saturday night at the hands of the Wisconsin Badgers, who rallied for a tough 71-64 victory in the NCAA men's basketball Final Four at Indianapolis. The Blue Devils, of the Atlantic Coast Conference, found baskets inside as the 6-foot-11, 270-pound Okafor powered for points around the basket. If Duke wins Monday night, it would tie Indiana and North Carolina for third-most NCAA championships with five. The confidence gained in getting defensive stops led to the desire for Duke players to drive the lane instead of shooting three-pointers.
