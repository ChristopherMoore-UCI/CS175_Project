North Korea has said the South provoked the attack, which also left 18 people injured, because shells from a South Korean military drill landed in the North's waters. The six countries are China, Russia, North Korea, South Korea, Japan, and the United States. North Korea warned Tuesday that the military drills by the United States and South Korea could lead to "all-out war any time." -- South Korea's spy chief said Wednesday that there is a high chance that North Korea will attack again following a strike last month that has led to renewed tensions on the peninsula, the Yonhap news agency reported. This comes after South Korean President Lee Myung-bak warned this week that North Korea would face severe consequences if it launched another military attack across its southern border.
