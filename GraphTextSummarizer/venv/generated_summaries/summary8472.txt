Stephens lost in the first round last year and has not won a match in three attempts at her home grand slam. " The 23-year-old will next face U.S. Open champion Sam Stosur of Australia, who beat 79th-ranked American teenager Sloane Stephens. The German 10th seed, who lost to Stosur in the New York semifinals in September in her best grand slam achievement, ended the hopes of 21-year-old Croatian Petra Martic as she won 6-3 7-5 on Court Suzanne Lenglen. She will lose the top ranking if Rome champion Maria Sharapova can reach the final in Paris for the first time in her career. And last year in Miami it was the same.
