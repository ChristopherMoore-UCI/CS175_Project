As the Thursday deadline neared, hotels and other pool operators nationwide unleashed a torrent of calls and letters to industry associations and politicians, saying the rule threatened to close pools from coast to coast. But in recent months, there has been widespread confusion about what sort of pools are required to make the change, whether pools must install permanent lifts or can use cheaper portable lifts and whether one lift could service more than one pool. The Justice Department said Thursday it is delaying for 60 days a new law that requires all public pools to install "lifts" or provide other means to make pools accessible to disabled individuals. That language seemingly gives wide latitude to pool operators. It also said the government is requiring a separate lift for every pool, greatly increasing the costs to facilities with numerous pools.
