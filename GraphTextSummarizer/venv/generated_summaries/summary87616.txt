The dancer -- Karima El Mahrough -- was 17 years old at the time of the alleged sexual encounter with Italy's Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, according to prosecutors in Milan. El Mahrough said that following the arrest she was visited by dancer Michelle Oliveira and regional lawmaker Nicole Minetti, whom prosecutors have tried to link to the allegations against the prime minister. El Mahrough said Minetti then called Berlusconi "to explain how things went," handing her the phone "so that I could thank him." Berlusconi, 74, denied allegations surrounding his relationship with El Mahrough as well as his alleged abuses of power, arguing that his phone call to police was a case of mistaken identity. But little is known about the dancer whose involvement in the scandal helped catalyze demonstrations against Italy's premier and his penchant for dinner parties attended by "pretty girls," according to local media reports and accounts by lawmaker Minetti.
