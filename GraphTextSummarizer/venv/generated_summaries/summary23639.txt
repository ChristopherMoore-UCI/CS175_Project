A Russian plan to deactivate Syrian weapons has bogged down, with the Syrians gaining extensions and more extensions. And there's an emerging pattern to this passivity: all four of these cases -- Iran, Syria, the Russian invasion of Crimea and Venezuela -- involve governments in which Obama tried to engage in dialogue. Iranian generals and Hezbollah militias stiffened Syrian government forces and turned the tide of war -- a war that has to date claimed perhaps 150,000 lives -- and generated the largest refugee exodus in postWorld War II history. By that measure, the United States has seldom provoked more trouble than it is provoking today. So, along with the Organization of American States, we call on the Venezuelan government to release protesters that it's detained and engage in real dialogue.
