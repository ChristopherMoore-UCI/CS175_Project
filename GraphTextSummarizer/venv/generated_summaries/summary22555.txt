-- Turkish security forces barricaded the commercial center of Istanbul in an attempt to stop May Day celebrations from taking place in the city's iconic Taksim Square. The governor's office also justified the ban, arguing that May Day rallies would hurt Istanbul's image as a tourist destination. For decades, May Day, or International Workers Day, has been a day of tension between leftist Turkish labor unions and security forces. Police fired plastic pellets and used tear gas and water cannon in an attempt to disperse May Day demonstrators who tried to defy the ban and reach the city center. "In Taksim vehicular and pedestrian traffic is intense and the area has great tourism potential with 24/7 tourist hotels, so negative developments in this area would negatively impact the country economy, tourism potential and the marketing image of our country.
