Several participants recommended Al Jazeera English to non-Arabic speaking friends so they discovered alternative points of view in the Arab world. It broadcasts in Modern Standard Arabic, the modern literary lingua franca which spread in the 1920s as the intelligentsia of the Arabic speaking world sought to modernize (Arabic dialects are so numerous as to be mutually incomprehensible.) While on the one hand Al Jazeera is suspected of fundamentalist Islamic links, on the other some Arabic speakers in Europe denounce it as a mouthpiece of the U.S. For example, one Arabic speaker from Stockholm cited the huge U.S. air base in Qatar as a reason for distrusting the channel. But Al Jazeera is part of a trajectory of modernization of media in the Arabic world.
