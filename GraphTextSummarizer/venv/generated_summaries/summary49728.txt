Pundits promptly took to their columns comparing the cold, unfeeling Queen Elizabeth -- who left her children behind as she took off on a six-month tour -- to Diana who defied convention and broke with tradition by insisting on taking a then nine-month-old Prince William to Australia and New Zealand in 1983. -- Britain's Duke and Duchess of Cambridge leave Britain on their three-week visit to New Zealand and Australia this weekend with their baby son Prince George. Jumping ahead 30 years, Diana did indeed insist on taking William on her six-week tour of Australia and New Zealand. After a brief photo call, William and his nanny were whisked away to Woomargama, a working sheep and cattle ranch in southern Australia. On landing in Alice Springs there was not a marching band or honor guard to be seen, simply a few local officials who frankly were more interested in seeing baby William.
