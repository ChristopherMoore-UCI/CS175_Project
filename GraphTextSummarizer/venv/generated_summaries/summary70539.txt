Maria Sharapova drove away a top of the range Porsche sports car for the third straight year in Stuttgart after battling back to beat Ana Ivanovic in the final Sunday. Sharapova, who is a brand ambassador for the sponsor, took match point with her 34th winner and was clearly delighted to continue her dominance at the German event. She's just a great player, and that's what happens when you play against great players in big matches like this. "I had quite a slow beginning to the year, but me and my team have been working hard to get in the position to win titles again, and I'm so happy to be able to do it in Stuttgart," the Russian told the official WTA website. He hit 19 winners to leave Giraldo with few opportunities to show his best in a one-sided match.
