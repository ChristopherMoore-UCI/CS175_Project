Romney is a Mormon and he has passed this way before: Four years ago, the first time he ran for president, he made a speech to address concerns, rumors, and political analysis of his religion in a speech. Explain it to me: Mormonism Ron Brownstein, editorial director of the National Journal, points out that Romney ran poorly among evangelical Christians, especially in the South, in 2008. "In all the Southern states, he never topped out above 20% of the votes among evangelical Christians; only 11% in the critical state of South Carolina," Brownstein said. On Friday, Robert Jeffress, a Southern Baptist minister, introduced Texas Gov. Rick Perry at at a gathering of social conservatives, calling Perry a genuine follower of Jesus Christ, as opposed to another candidate Jeffress could and did mention in a later interview. "I think Mitt Romney is a good, moral man, but I think those of us who are born-again followers of Christ should always prefer a competent Christian to a competent non-Christian like Mitt Romney," Jeffress told CNN's Jim Acosta.
