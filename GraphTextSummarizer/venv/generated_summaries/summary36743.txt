Earlier, screeners with the Transportation Security Administration noticed something suspicious in a passenger's carry-on luggage, said airport spokesman Michael Conway. Wayne County Airport Authority spokesman Scott Wintner later said the device was removed from the north terminal, allowing operations to be restored. The passenger carrying the suspicious item was not under arrest but was being detained, Conway said. -- A terminal at Detroit Metropolitan Airport was evacuated for about two hours Monday morning due to concerns over a suspicious device. The larger terminal continued normal operations, he said.
