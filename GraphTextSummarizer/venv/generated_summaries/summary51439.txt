March 26 Search aircraft spotted three objects drifting in the sea, Australia officials say. The advantage is the search moves closer to the Australian coast, making the area easier for planes to reach. But search teams aren't able to locate them on subsequent passes, officials add. That leaves the southern arc: it stretches from Indonesia to the southern Indian Ocean. Experts wonder whether the two objects were part of the junk swirling in a vast Indian Ocean gyre, or rotating currents.
