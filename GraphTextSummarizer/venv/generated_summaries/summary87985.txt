Maduro canceled his plans to travel to New York and attend the U.N. General Assembly last week because of what he said were plots to physically harm him there. He has made at least 11 such accusations since the beginning of his presidency, CNN en EspaÃ±ol reported last week. Gabriel Reyes, a Venezuela-based political analyst, told CNN en EspaÃ±ol last week that there could be another motivation behind the accusations. The recording comes nearly seven months after authorities announced Chavez's death from cancer and just a few months before municipal elections in the politically polarized South American country. Both Chavez and former Cuban leader Fidel Castro often made such claims, he said.
