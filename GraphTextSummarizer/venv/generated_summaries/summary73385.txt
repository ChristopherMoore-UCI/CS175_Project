State troopers who went to Deeds' home found Gus Deeds suffering from a gunshot wound and were unable to save him, state police said Tuesday. -- Sheriff's deputies had been called to the home of Virginia state Sen. Creigh Deeds a day before the fight that left his son dead and the veteran politician with multiple stab wounds, investigators reported Wednesday. But Dennis Cropper, executive director of the Rockbridge Area Community Services Board, said that Austin Deeds had been released because no psychiatric bed could be found for him across a wide area of western Virginia, the newspaper reported. The following morning, Deeds was stabbed multiple times during a fight with his 24-year-old son, who then shot himself with a rifle, according to autopsy results state police disclosed Wednesday. Deputies responded to a "nonemergency call for assistance" at Deeds' home in Millboro, in the rural western part of the state, on Monday, Virginia State Police said.
