Ruseva is adamant she left Maria in Greece because she was too poor to feed her but did not sell her or receive any payment. " The Rusevs are being investigated by Bulgarian police on suspicion they sold Maria for illegal adoption. The couple were a world away too from Maria, the blond toddler found during a police raid of a Roma camp in Greece. Defense lawyers for Greek couple Salis and Dimoupolou say their clients met Ruseva face-to-face. Ruseva said she and her husband left for Greece in 2009 to look for farm work.
