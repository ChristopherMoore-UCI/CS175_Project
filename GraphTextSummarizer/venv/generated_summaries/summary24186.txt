The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee will unveil a new television ad in the Bayou State on Thursday that hammers Cassidy for favoring increasing the age at which retirees can collect Social Security benefits to 70. In Louisiana, Republican Bill Cassidy is running to retire Democratic incumbent Mary Landrieu. "When it comes to seniors, Congressman Bill Cassidy has a plan: Raise the retirement age for Social Security and Medicare to 70," the narrator grimly states. The Cassidy campaign, meanwhile, accused Landrieu of trying to "have it both ways" when it comes to Social Security, pointing out that the Democrat previously expressed support for the Simpson-Bowles deficit reduction report that would have gradually raised the retirement age. A CNN/ORC survey released last month found Landrieu leading Cassidy 43 percent to 40 percent among likely voters, with the other Republican candidate in the race, Rob Maness, pulling nine percent.
