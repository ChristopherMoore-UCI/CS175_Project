"I publicly retract my statements about Conor Oberst, and sincerely apologize to him, his family, and his fans for writing such awful things about him," Faircloth wrote. Joan Faircloth sent a notarized statement to Oberst's lawyer Monday recanting what she wrote online starting last December. A woman who accused Bright Eyes singer Conor Oberst of raping her when she was a teenager a decade ago now says she made the story up.
