Knowing that ransom payments to designated terrorist groups are illegal, KfR specialists will quickly pass insured situations involving terrorist groups to government authorities -- and the outcomes are rarely as favorable as those that can be achieved via expert negotiation. Following the G8 Summit, and notwithstanding the fact that in 2009 the U.N. reminded Member States of their obligation to prevent the payment of ransoms to terrorists under Security Council Resolution 1904, the Security Council passed a further resolution in January 2014 calling upon Member States "to prevent terrorists from benefiting directly or indirectly from ransom payments. Payment of ransoms to terrorist organizations for the safe return of citizens is thus entirely contrary to the blizzard of national and international laws and norms that have emerged. Kidnap-for-ransom is an increasingly widely-used tool by terrorist groups. Furthermore, the procession of gruesome beheadings visited on American and British hostages by ISIS in 2014 suggests that, in the knowledge that the U.S. and UK will not pay ransoms, captured citizens from these two countries are far more likely to be murdered in the pursuit of propaganda.
