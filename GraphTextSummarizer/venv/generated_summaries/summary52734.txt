Bill Clinton not persuaded by Iran on nuclear weapons The world is at a "historic juncture" now that Marxist systems are virtually gone and "capitalism is bogged down in a self-made quagmire," he said, which could allow for other nations to "play a more active role" in global decision making. An "arms race and intimidation by nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction by the hegemonic powers have become prevalent," he added, noting that Iran has now found itself under threat. He also sought to contextualize recent violence in the region after an anti-Islam film spawned protests and attacks against U.S. diplomatic facilities across the Middle East and North Africa. Japan will "fulfill such responsibility in accordance with international law," he said, calling for greater adherence to the "rule of law" by other nations. He said Iran was committed to peace, though he also accused world powers of double standards in pursuing an arms race.
