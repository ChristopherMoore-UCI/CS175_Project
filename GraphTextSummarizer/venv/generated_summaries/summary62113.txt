Republican Rep. Ed Royce of California, who chairs the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and Republican Rep. Matt Salmon from Arizona, chairman of the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee, traveled to Tecate, Mexico, on Saturday to meet with Tahmooressi. Tahmooressi is now on his third attorney, Tijuana-based lawyer Fernando Benitez, said his mother, Jill Tahmooressi. " Now in El Hongo Penitentiary in Tecate, Mexico, about an hour and a half east of Tijuana, Tahmooressi is said to be doing well, according to his family. But more than 80 days since he was first imprisoned, Tahmooressi's defense still has not submitted evidence to the court to counter the prosecutor's evidence, his mother told CNN. " Tahmooressi was initially held in Tijuana's La Mesa Penitentiary for the first month.
