For 27-year-old Kate Pope, the popular beach travel destination on the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula felt like just that after Hurricane Odile hit Sunday night. Pope had traveled to Cabo San Lucas from California for a bachelorette celebration with her sisters and friends. On Thursday afternoon, an emergency message from the U.S. Embassy advised U.S. citizens in the area to go as soon as possible to the airport in San Jose del Cabo, where the State Department was working with U.S. and Mexican carriers to arrange flights. It took Elizabeth Vasquez of Concord, California, days to hear from her daughter after Odile pounded Puerto Los Cabos. On Thursday, Lisa Vasquez and her fiance Tomas were back in the United States at a Dallas airport trying to get a flight home to California.
