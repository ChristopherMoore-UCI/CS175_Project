After Iran threatened to shut down the Strait in 2008, oil-rich Abu Dhabi decided to leverage Fujairah's strategic location on the Indian Ocean with unimpeded access to the seas to reach clients in Asia. Srinivasalu said Fujairah has something those in Asia and Europe don't: plenty of oil in its neighborhood. China, Japan and South Korea are Abu Dhabi's top three importers of UAE crude. With rising demand from Asia, and two thirds of proven reserves sitting in the region, the UAE will continue to up the ante with more spending. The game changer was a decision by the UAE government to build a $3 billion, 240-mile oil pipeline from Abu Dhabi's Habshan field into Fujairah, with a capacity of 1.5 million barrels a day.
