Speaking at the Discovery Invest Leadership Summit in South Africa, Gore interjected the following aside into his speech: "Not to mention the new iPhones coming out next month. Gore, of course, is a heavy-hitter at the company who's done a lot of work on making Apple products more sustainable and reducing his carbon footprint. That may not sound like a huge blunder -- after all, the fact that the iPhone 5 is going on sale at some point next month currently ranks as one of the world's worst-kept secrets. That would be the most famous member of the board: Nobel laureate and former U.S. Vice President Al Gore. It is possible that he was referring to multiple copies of the iPhone 5, but that seems unlikely -- especially as we've been hearing rumors for months of a lower-cost, lower-memory version dubbed the iCloud iPhone.
