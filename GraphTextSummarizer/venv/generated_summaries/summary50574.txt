Tthe 61-year-old NASCAR team owner has been motoring on with his plans to build his brand new Haas F1 Team from scratch to join the grid in 2016. " Haas was at the Italian Grand Prix, where rumors also swirled about the concept of F1's major marques -- the likes of Ferrari, McLaren, Mercedes and Red Bull -- running three-car teams, an idea that would potentially see minnows like the Haas F1 Team knocked off the grid. Having started his own NASCAR team in 2003, Haas joined forces with three-time Sprint Cup champion Tony Stewart to form the successful Stewart-Haas Racing team in 2009. American entrepreneur Gene Haas is a great believer in the adage "you've got to speculate to accumulate." The agreement means the Italian marque will supply the Haas team with hybrid engines and gearboxes as well as general technical support.
