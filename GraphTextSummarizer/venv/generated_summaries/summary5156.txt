Although there haven't been many huge underwear breakthroughs since the introduction of boxer briefs in the early 1990s (and even those are sort of a throwback to the union suits favored by pre-1930s men), boxers and briefs found their way onto the financial pages in early 2008. They lacked the support that drawers and union suits had offered, so men weren't crazy about them. Cuts became tighter and sexier, and underwear designs became flashy, loud, and often humorous. Boxer shorts weren't an immediate success as underwear, though. The postcard depicted a man in a bikini-style bathing suit, and "apparel engineer" Kneibler had an epiphany: couldn't this type of swimsuit be converted into underwear?
