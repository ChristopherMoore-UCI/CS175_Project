Ramsey Nouah: I usually like to unwind by playing my sports: I like to play squash a lot, and I love adventure so basically when I'm not working I like to do crazy things, the things that people would least except that I'd want to do like skydiving ,bungee jumping, mountain climbing, all of those things. Ramsey Nouah: I think it's a public service kind of thing that everyone is beginning to think that "OK, we can make a change" ... and most of my colleagues are thinking, "if people believe in me that I can do it then I can make it happen." So it's a long thing, unlike how we just used to do cheap movies and it was like quick -- people could actually tell most of our stories from the beginning, they could tell the end already. I want that to change, hence I don't do too many of them movies anymore, but the cinema movies are now coming out and when that starts to come out then it would give room to people getting more from the movies. Ramsey Nouah: There have been several phases in Nollywood, like in everything in life.
