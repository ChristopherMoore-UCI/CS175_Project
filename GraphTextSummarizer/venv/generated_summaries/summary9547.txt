-- British authorities told CNN Wednesday they are examining a home video that shows singer Amy Winehouse smoking something in a glass pipe minutes after she is heard saying she had just taken six tablets of the anti-anxiety drug Valium. The tabloid said the 19-minute video was shot Friday in Winehouse's East London home. Winehouse received six nominations for next month's Grammy Awards, including record and song of the year for "Rehab" and best album for "Back to Black." A Grammy-nominated singer, Winehouse's alleged battle with drugs have garnered constant headlines. Winehouse's husband, Blake Fielder-Civil, is currently behind bars in London on charges of perverting the course of justice following a bar fight.
