A bogey on the 11th saw Watney trail again and after both men bogeyed the 12th it was left for Mickelson to hold his nerve in the closing holes. -- Phil Mickelson fought off a nasty virus and his co-overnight leader Nick Watney to land the WGC-CA Championship on the Blue Monster Course at Doral. Jim Furyk provided the last-day challenge to the leaders with a closing 67 for 16- under, with India's Jeev Milkha Singh fourth at 14-under and England's Oliver Wilson tied fifth with Colombia's Camilo Villegas after a brilliant closing 66. " The lead had changed hands three times between Mickelson and Watney over the front nine with Watney holing in a chip at the ninth from 80 feet to stay in the hunt. Both men hit fine shots to the closing par-four hole, with Watney's putt coming up agonizingly short.
