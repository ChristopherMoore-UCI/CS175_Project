This is strange given the usual excitement around elections in Turkey, the historic importance of this poll, and the exceptionally high level of socio-political tensions in recent years. Success in local politics paves the way for success in national politics, as Turkey's political Islamists have shown time and again over the past two decades. Where would this scenario leave those who feel increasingly alienated, stifled and marginalized in Erdogan's new Turkey? Erdogan understands power and pursues it like no other politician in Turkey's modern history. This might also explain the somber mood around many of his opponents, who seem to believe that having come so close to realizing his long standing ambition of becoming Turkey's first popularly elected president, Erdogan will not let the opportunity slip.
