Romney, who, Newt Gingrich likes to say, once ran to the left of Sen. Ted Kennedy, has scrambled in the past year to get to the right of Rick Perry, Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum. As Romney now takes his dangerous promises and disregard for the middle class to New Hampshire on Tuesday, then South Carolina and beyond along the primary campaign trail -- and, he hopes, into the general election -- he's weighed down by heavy baggage. He has repackaged the same policies that caused the financial crisis -- mistakes like making the middle class pay for tax breaks for the wealthy and big corporations and letting Wall Street write its own rules so big bankers can make millions while gambling with everyone else's economic security. It would mean less responsibility for everyone to do their fair share, but more families losing their jobs and their homes. Indeed, Romney and his allies spent nearly $150 for every caucus vote he received in his eight-vote victory.
