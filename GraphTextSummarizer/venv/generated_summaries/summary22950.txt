The antivirus company Symantec said in 2007 that 80 percent of attacks on Web sites happen in the same way as the attacks on the EU and Ahmadinejad sites: through loopholes that allow hackers to upload scripts to change Web sites. And hacking of government Web sites, for security intelligence or just for a global joke, isn't as uncommon as you might expect. Instead of seeing his photo on the new European Union site, launched this week as Spain took over the presidency, visitors were greeted by Rowan Atkinson's comic character of Mr. Bean. "The reality is, this is sort of the 21st century form of a street protest, except [hackers] have a global reach, and these leaders are being embarrassed in a very public, global way," said Danny McPherson, chief security officer and security expert at Ann Arbor Networks. And now, after the hack on the EU Web site, bloggers and commenters around the world have piled on, saying the task may be hefty for Spain, which couldn't keep its new site safe from a cyberattack for a week.
