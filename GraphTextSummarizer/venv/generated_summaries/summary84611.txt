People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals has offered a reward for information leading to the capture and arrest of the people behind what it calls a "heinous act" of cruelty. -- A video apparently showing a young woman throwing live puppies into a river has sparked outrage across the Internet. Users of the 4chan.org site have been in the news recently for identifying the person behind a similar incident involving a British woman caught on a security camera throwing a cat in a trash can last week. "Animal abusers are cowards," PETA Manager Martin Mersereau said in a news release announcing the $2,000 reward. It is still widely available online and has gone viral, with sites such as LiveLeak.com registering more than 1.3 million views of the footage.
