Amine El Khalifi made a brief appearance in federal court and waived his right to have a preliminary hearing and to contest his detention. El Khalifi allegedly told an undercover FBI agent and another man assisting law enforcement that he intended to use the MAC-10 to "shoot people before detonating the bomb." Mohamed said he believes FBI informants frequent the mosque where he and El Khalifi pray and that the Moroccan man was entrapped by law enforcement. U.S. officials said El Khalifi had been closely monitored since early December and that the public was never in danger. El Khalifi allegedly thought he was working with al Qaeda but a man referred to in court documents as "Yusuf" was an undercover agent.
