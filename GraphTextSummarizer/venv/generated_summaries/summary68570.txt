-- India's most famous sportsman Sachin Tendulkar will retire from cricket after playing his 200th Test match, he announced Thursday. We respect his decision to retire although many of us can't imagine an Indian team without Sachin." Tendulkar, a right handed batsman, will go down in history for his incredible run scoring feats, including a record 15,837 runs to date in Test matches, over 2,000 more than his closest rival, former Australian captain Ricky Ponting. Fittingly, Tendulkar helped the Mumbai Indians franchise win this year's IPL title and also played a key role as India won cricket's World Cup on home soil in 2011. If Tendulkar achieved that feat it would be his 52nd in Tests and all of India will be hoping he can reach the magic three figures just one final time in his farewell matches. It will bring down the curtain on a glittering career which has seen him score a record 100 centuries in Tests and one day internationals since making his debut for India in 1989.
