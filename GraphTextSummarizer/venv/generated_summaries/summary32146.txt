Outside in the parking lot, food and other donated items piled up as San Bruno residents chipped in to help their neighbors. Gov Abel Maldonado said he has written a letter to the California Public Utilities Commission, seeking information on gas pipelines across the state, including their age, inspection dates and records. San Bruno Police Chief Neil Telford said five people were still missing. " "I'm betting in San Bruno most people didn't even know the pipeline was under their neighborhood," he said. "We are not hear to determine liability or blame, but we are here to determine the cause of the accident," National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) Vice Chairman Christopher Hart said.
