Surely that myth will be extinguished should Messi lead his country to its first World Cup triumph since 1986 -- and the signs are increasingly encouraging. But it was frustrated in its attempt by a Bosnia team, which despite already being unable to qualify for the knockout phase, appeared determined to go out of its first World Cup in style. "Messi is one heck of a player," Nigeria coach Stephen Keshi told reporters. A draw would have been enough to take Nigeria through to the next stage for the first time since 1998 but the Africans struggled to contain a rampant looking Argentina. Nigeria, paired with Argentina for the fourth time in the World Cup, suffered narrow defeats in each of its previous three fixtures against the South Americans.
