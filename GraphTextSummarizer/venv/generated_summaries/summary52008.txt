In a speech Friday in Tampa, Florida, en route to Cartagena, Obama announced a new program that the White House is calling the Small Business Network of the Americas, which he said would help businesses get financing and counseling on how to access new markets south of the U.S. border. His weekend visit will mark the longest time a U.S. president will have spent in that country, where security concerns had limited previous presidential trips. "Beyond our borders, these cartels and traffickers pose an extraordinary threat to our Central American neighbors," Obama said. But on a recent trip to Mexico, a country that has been ravaged by drug-related violence, U.S. Vice President Joe Biden rejected that idea. Correa threatened to put together a boycott with other leaders in the Bolivian Alliance (Venezuela, Bolivia and Nicaragua), which led to intense diplomacy behind the scenes.
