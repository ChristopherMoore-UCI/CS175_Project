In college Greer studied photography but spent her summers fighting wildland fires as a seasonal firefighter. For 15 years Kari Greer has been documenting wildland fires and the men and woman who battle them. "I think it helps people develop an understanding of the situation and how firefighters are working," says Greer. "There are many tools in the tool box for fighting fire and showing what fire is all about," Greer says. She now photographs fires from the front lines under contract with the National Interagency Fire Center, the federal outfit that supports wildland firefighting efforts.
