"When Fiji wins the Hong Kong Sevens it's a good 12 months for us until the next Hong Kong Sevens. -- As a young child in Fiji, rugby star Waisale Serevi strained to hear tales of his heroes through the crackles of an old transistor radio. "They said, 'Oh Fiji has just beaten the British Lions, and rugby makes people in Fiji happy.' In Serevi, Fiji gave rugby a player blessed with such flare, flamboyance and outrageous natural talent, that on many an occasion David was able to stun Goliath. If Serevi was the king, his royal residence was the Hong Kong Sevens -- the most famous date on the HSBC Sevens World Series calendar and a tournament followed religiously in Fiji.
