-- Like most aspects of his life, the health of North Korean leader Kim Jong Il was shrouded in secrecy. " In recent years, Kim had grown frailer, appearing in public with a thinner frame and gaunt cheeks. Kim died of a heart attack Saturday, according to North Korean state-run media agency KCNA. North Korea has been struck by food shortages, because of natural and man-made problems, leading to mass starvation. " "The heart of Kim Jong Il stopped beating, but his noble and august name and benevolent image will always be remembered," according to a message on KCNA's website.
