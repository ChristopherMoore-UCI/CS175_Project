Take Arc'teryx, a local company that got its start in 1991 making rock-climbing harnesses, and has since evolved into an industry leader turning out stellar outdoor apparel, equipment, and accessories year after year. It's not just the city's proximity to the outdoors that influences local gear companies; it's also Vancouver's thriving cosmopolitanism, fashion scene, and underground culture. Though it's doubtful the IOC had local gear companies in mind when it picked Vancouver to host the 2010 Winter Games, it's no coincidence that the city claims Olympic-caliber gear as its own. What started in 1990 with founder Chris Prior making snowboards in his North Vancouver garage has turned into one of the world's top producers of handcrafted snow equipment. Home to Arc'teryx, Westcomb, and Prior, these Vancouver-based brands are leading the charge in innovative gear technology and design.
