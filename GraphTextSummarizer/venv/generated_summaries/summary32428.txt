Both Sternbeck and Metro spokesman Dan Stessel said numerous items were lifted, including the Metro keys. An on-board video-camera captured images of the thieves as they either approached or departed the truck, Arlington Police Department spokesman Dustin Sternbeck said. But Washington Metro officials and authorities in Arlington County, Virginia, attempted to tamp down fears the September 19 theft is terror related. They grab keys to secure areas of Washington's subway system and flee. The fire crew reported the theft promptly, Sternbeck said, and canine dogs were sent to the scene.
