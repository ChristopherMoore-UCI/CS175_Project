Noting a compromise budget agreement recently passed by Congress after two years of partisan impasses on government spending, Obama said: "It's probably too early to declare an outbreak of bipartisanship, but it's also fair to say that we're not condemned to endless gridlock. Another disappointment cited by the President was the inability to get any of his main legislative priorities of 2013 passed by Congress, and he called for 2014 to be a "year of action" on immigration reform, job creation, expanded background checks on gun purchasers and extending long-term unemployment benefits. Citing economic progress and other achievements, President Barack Obama on Friday rejected the contention that 2013 was the worst year of his presidency. However, Obama added that "what is also clear from the public debate, people are concerned about the possibility of abuse," such as someone listening in on their phone calls. "We head into next year with an economy that's stronger than it was at the start of the year," Obama said.
