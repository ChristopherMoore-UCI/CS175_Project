Also Monday, volunteer attorneys calling themselves the Occupy Tucson Legal Working Group said that they have filed a civil rights suit in federal court, "and will ask for a temporary restraining order to stop arrests at Veinte De Agosto Park," where protesters are camped out. PHILADELPHIA A couple that met a month ago, working the information booth at Occupy Philadelphia, married Monday. An additional protester was taken into custody Monday, according to the Occupy Fresno website. Police issued citations to 43 people, who will be required to pay a fine, said Chicago police spokesman Veejay Zala. The couple said they'll spend their honeymoon visiting other Occupy movements along the East Coast.
