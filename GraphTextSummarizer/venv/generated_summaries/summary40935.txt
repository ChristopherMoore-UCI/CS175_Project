-- World champion Casey Stoner is urging seven-time MotoGP champion Valentino Rossi to put a disappointing 2011 behind him and mount a serious challenge on his Ducati this season. " Stoner doubled up on his 2007 title success as he claimed 10 victories last season to take the title off Yamaha's Jorge Lorenzo and he sees the Spaniard as his main rival again in 2012. Italian legend Rossi failed to win a race for the first time in his glittering career as his works bike was way off the pace of Stoner's all-conquering Honda. But Stoner knows that the public want to see close racing and Rossi taking his accustomed place on the podium. Yamaha and Honda want competition; unfortunately Kawasaki and Suzuki are gone from the championship, so we need all bikes at the front.
