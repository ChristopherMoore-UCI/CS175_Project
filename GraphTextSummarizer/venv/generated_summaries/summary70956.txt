Mexican Foreign Minister Jose Antonio Meade said in a Twitter post that officials are communicating with authorities in Central America over the derailment and offering assistance to injured victims. The train's engine and first car stayed on the tracks, allowing authorities to use them to transport injured victims to a regional hospital, officials said. Photos showed overturned train cars and injured victims on the tracks. The locomotive derailed after heavy rains in the area softened the earth around the tracks, state officials said. El Salvador's foreign ministry said consular officials were heading to the area to help any Salvadorans who may have been injured.
