A group of energized fans rallied for the 39-year-old as he walked down Boylston Street in the pouring rain with volunteers from his foundation, Vamos. Melamed is one of about 30,000 participants who raced in this year's marathon, which comes less than two weeks after a jury found Dzhokhar Tsarnaev guilty of all 30 charges related to the 2013 Boston bombings. His perseverance was celebrated by crowds at the marathon finish line Tuesday morning, and also by fans online. Friends who were waiting for Melamed to cross the finish line said the university professor and motivational speaker is dedicated and motivated. Melamed was born with muscular dystrophy, which causes progressive weakness and loss of muscle mass throughout the body.
