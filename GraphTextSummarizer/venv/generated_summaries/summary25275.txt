That's how residents of northeast Pennsylvania are feeling some six weeks into the search for suspected cop killer Eric Matthew Frein. Now, she drives a bus for the Pocono Mountain School District, which closed schools Tuesday because of the search for Frein. Late last week and early this week, Frein was reportedly spotted in a wooded area in the town of Swiftwater, about 8 miles southeast of the Canadensis area. "It's kind of scary -- a little bit nerve-wracking -- because we live so close to it," said Marissa Labarre, who rode the bus to school with Frein when they were children. Police have not spoken about a possible motive, other than that Frein has talked and written about hating law enforcement.
