Investigating magistrate Pablo Ruz at Spain's National Court, which handles terrorism cases, issued the indictments on Tuesday, which were made public Thursday, and CNN viewed a copy. A suspected Islamic militant who was detained in Afghanistan in 2001, imprisoned at the U.S. detention center in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, but later acquitted at trial in Spain, is again facing a trial in Madrid on new charges. The Madrid-based cell had contacts with militants in Syria, Egypt, Tunisia, Morocco, France and Belgium, the magistrate alleges in a 102-page indictment order, which sets the case for trial before a panel of judges. Security officials have expressed particular concern about these or other Islamic militant fighters returning from combat zones to Spain and other Western countries, and potentially carrying out attacks. In 2003, a different judge at the National Court, in a separate indictment, repeatedly cited Ikassrien and said he had been recruited earlier to go to Afghanistan by a Syrian-born man, Imad Eddin Barakat Yarkas, who was later convicted of being al Qaeda's leader in Spain.
