Sollecito and Knox were convicted of Kercher's murder in 2009 but set free on appeal in 2011. At one time after the first conviction, Sollecito's father sought the help of a private lawyer not connected to the case, who spoke to Perugia prosecutor Giuliano Mignini about striking a plea deal to cut Sollecito's sentence in exchange for evidence against Knox. " Neither he nor Knox had solid alibis for the night of Kercher's murder, Sollecito writes. Raffaele Sollecito's memoir, "Honor Bound: My Journey to Hell and Back with Amanda Knox," is the first book written by anyone directly involved in the Meredith Kercher murder trial in Perugia, Italy. Kercher, a 21-year-old British student, was found stabbed to death in the Italian apartment she shared with Knox, now 25, of Seattle.
