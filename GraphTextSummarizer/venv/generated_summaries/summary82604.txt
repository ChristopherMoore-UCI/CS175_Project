Duval said his scheme wasn't a response to this and complained that the government should be doing more to help hoteliers during tough economic times. "To be friendly to the tourists Laurent Fabius must cut the hotel taxes and charges, then Paris will be better and more attractive and not so expensive." Duval says the scheme has attracted interest from other hotels in Paris and elsewhere in France, with several in Cannes and Nice planning similar deals for the winter low season. When your city has an unenviable reputation for insulting tourists and fleecing them for every cent, inviting hotel guests to pay what they want could be a risky move. In the City of Light, it seems hotel guests are not generally light fingered. That's the experiment being tested by several hotels in the French capital during the height of the summer season.
