" Women of the world When former pediatrician Gayle joined CARE seven years ago, she became not just the first woman to lead the organization, but the first person of color. Since it first began over 60 years ago with American charities sending food packages to World War Two survivors, CARE International -- of which CARE USA is a member -- has become one of the largest aid organizations in the world, with 10,000 staff working in some 80 countries. She'd say 'you've got a good brain, and a big mouth, use it.'" Gayle didn't disappoint, working for over three decades at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, focusing on HIV/AIDS research. It is perhaps unsurprising that Gayle has now made women's rights a big focus at CARE. But among the high-brow accolades, Gayle remains focused on simple achievements such as education, access to clean drinking water, and shelter.
