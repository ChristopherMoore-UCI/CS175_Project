"There's no doubt in my mind that if they were successful they were going to continue with future acts," said Mary Rain, district attorney for St. Lawrence County. Howells and Vaisey drove to the farm, pulled up to the stand in a location where they couldn't be seen, and waited for the girls -- ages 6 and 12 -- to approach the car, Bigwarfe said. Brooks Bigwarfe detailed the couples' alleged plan and kidnapping of the girls, as related to him by Vaisey. New details about the abduction in Oswegatchie emerged during a preliminary hearing in St. Lawrence County on Thursday. Riendeau alleged his client was in a master-slave relationship with Howells and that she was not the mastermind of the planned kidnapping.
