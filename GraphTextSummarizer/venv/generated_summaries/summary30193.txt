The National Football League initiated an investigation into Favre's alleged actions after the sports website Deadspin.com reported in August that Favre sent voice messages, texts and pictures of his penis to Jets sideline personality and host Jenn Sterger in 2008. Childress said he's handling Favre's situation day by day. In a press conference Monday, Vikings head coach Brad Childress said Favre had two fractures, including a stress fracture, and was wearing an ankle boot. Favre recently made headlines due to allegations that he sent explicit material to a woman who worked for the New York Jets when he was the Jets' quarterback two years ago. Favre's record for most consecutive starts by any player in the history of the NFL spans about 19 seasons, according to NFL.com.
