Baradar was Afghanistan's deputy defense minister when the Taliban controlled the country, according to the U.N. committee in charge of sanctions on al Qaeda and Taliban members. -- Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, the Afghan Taliban commander whose capture was made public this week, is one of the most senior figures in the movement to be seized -- second only to Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar. "These talks came to an abrupt halt when in mid-2009, Prince Muqrin was told point-blank that Mullah Omar decided to discontinue all negotiations [since he] took it as an affront that on the one hand Washington aimed to engage the Taliban through Saudi Arabia, while on the other hand it planned to continue all efforts to defeat the Taliban through its troop surge and drone strikes," Samdani wrote in "Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and prospects for peace with the Taliban." "The Taliban leadership through Mullah Baradar engaged with the Saudis by conducting talks with Saudi intelligence chief, Muqrin," Mehlaqa Samdani of the Center for Strategic and International Studies wrote last week. "If anyone would know where the senior leaders are of al Qaeda and the Taliban, then Baradar is someone who would be privy to that kind of information.
