Nothing was taken from the chapel other than the heart, although Irish media said there were gold candesticks and other valuables there. St. Laurence O'Toole's heart was kept in a heart-shaped wooden box in a cage bolted to a wall in Saint Lauds Chapel, Irish police said. -- The heart of a 900-year-old saint has vanished from Christ Church Cathedral in Dublin, Ireland, police and the Cathedral said. Adding to the mystery, there was no sign of a break-in or of damage, police told CNN. It disappeared between Friday evening and Saturday noon, police said.
