After his death the medical staff realized he had presented Ebola symptoms and as I had close contact with him, it meant that I was at risk. He had diarrhea at least eight times per day but I did not know he was suffering from Ebola. Many people have already died, that is why I participate in activities [to educate people]. There is no cure or vaccine to treat Ebola, but the aid agency MSF has shown it doesn't have to be a death sentence if treated early. Ebola typically kills 90% of patients but the death rate in this outbreak has dropped to roughly 60%.
