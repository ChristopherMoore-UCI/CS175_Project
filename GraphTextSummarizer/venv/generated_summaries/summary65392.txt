The arrest by Dutch police of Russian diplomat Dmitry Borodin was a violation of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, the Dutch Foreign Ministry conceded Wednesday. Sofia Sarenkova, spokeswoman for the Russian Embassy in The Hague, told CNN that on Saturday night "four unidentified persons wearing police-like uniforms forced themselves into Mr. Borodin's apartment with no authority or identification. She said the men used physical force against the diplomat before handcuffing him and taking him to the police station, where he was kept for several hours without the chance to call the embassy, Sarenkova said. The Netherlands has apologized to Russia for arresting one of its diplomats in The Hague over the weekend, the Dutch government said Wednesday. But the Dutch Minister of Foreign Affairs, Frans Timmermans "recognizes that the police officers concerned were acting in accordance with their professional responsibility in responding to a reported situation," the ministry said.
