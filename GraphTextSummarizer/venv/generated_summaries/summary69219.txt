" Shafii said the border area where the hikers are accused of trespassing is unmarked and anyone could unwittingly cross over into Iran. Bauer and Fattal, both 28, and Sarah Shourd, 32, were detained July 31, 2009, after they allegedly strayed across an unmarked border into Iran while hiking in Iraq's Kurdistan region. Shourd has not responded to a court summons this week to return and stand trial on Sunday, Shafii said. The judge has granted Shafii permission to visit Shane Bauer and Josh Fattal for a few hours on Sunday prior to the start of the trial, Shafii said. Prosecutors in Iran have charged them with spying and trespassing.
