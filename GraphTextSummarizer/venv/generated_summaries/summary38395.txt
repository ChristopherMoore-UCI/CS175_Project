-- McLaren's Jenson Button has been hit with a five-place grid penalty ahead of this weekend's Japanese Grand Prix after a new gearbox was fitted to his car. Button's teammate and fellow Briton Lewis Hamilton was forced to retire from the Singapore Grand Prix earlier this month with an identical problem. It was announced last week Hamilton would be joining German manufacturer Mercedes on a three-year deal, ending his career-long association with McLaren. The Briton will be paired with a new driver next season, with Mexico's Sergio Perez drafted in from Sauber as a replacement for the departing Hamilton. Button will be hoping for a repeat of last year's victory at the Suzuka circuit when racing gets underway on Sunday.
