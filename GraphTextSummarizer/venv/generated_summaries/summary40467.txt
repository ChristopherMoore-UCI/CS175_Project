-- A former U.S. Navy SEAL commando, motivational speaker and frequent guest on national news shows is accused of lying to investigators about the circumstances of a shooting at an Ohio mall, police said Thursday. Christopher Mark Heben's website, sealteamconsulting.com, says he "emerged as the media's most featured Special Operations subject matter expert " after U.S. forces killed terrorist Osama bin Laden in 2011. Heben is to be arraigned later this month on two misdemeanor counts of falsification and obstructing official business, Bath Township Police Chief Michael McNeely said. Heben allowed police access to his registered gun and the bullet that struck him didn't match his weapon, McNeely said. On Heben's Facebook page, which describes him as a former "U.S. Navy SEAL turned Health Care professional, Veterans Advocate, Voice Actor, Actor, Writer, Singer/Songwriter, Author," a photo was posted under his name on the day the charges were announced.
