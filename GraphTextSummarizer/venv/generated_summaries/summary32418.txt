That dynamic allowed Lieberman to assert his will in the health care debate by threatening to join a Republican filibuster if the health care bill contained the public option or Medicare expansion he opposes. Independent Sen. Joe Lieberman, a former Democrat who sits with Democratic caucus, said Tuesday that he would not rule out running for re-election in 2012 as a Republican. Lieberman angered his colleagues in the Democratic caucus this week by threatening to torpedo health care legislation if it contains a government-run public health insurance or an expansion of Medicare. In 2000, Lieberman was Al Gore's running mate when Democrats lost the closest presidential national election in U.S. history. However, Lieberman's stance on the health care bill could prompt a backlash from liberal Democrats.
