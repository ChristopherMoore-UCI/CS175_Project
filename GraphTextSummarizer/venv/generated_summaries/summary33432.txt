Before he landed acting roles on U.S. shows like ABC's "Once Upon A Time," on which he played the Huntsman/Sheriff Graham, Dornan was known mainly to U.S. celebrity watchers as the guy dating fellow Brit Keira Knightley. Dakota Johnson, the daughter of Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson who has starred in the TV series "Ben and Kate," is still on board to play protagonist Anastasia Steele. However, studio Universal said Hunnam's TV schedule didn't give him time to adequately prepare to play Christian Grey. The author's revelation comes after industry trades like The Hollywood Reporter and Variety cited sources saying the 31-year-old actor has been tapped to replace Charlie Hunnam, the "Sons of Anarchy" actor who was originally cast as Christian Grey and dropped out in mid-October. The actor reportedly had competition from British actor Christian Cooke, "The Borgias'" Francois Arnaud and "True Blood" star Alexander Skarsgard.
