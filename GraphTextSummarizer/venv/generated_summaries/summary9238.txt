The implication, of course, being that pretty girls can't be role models. Disney was quickly taken to task by many, including the film's writer and co-director Brenda Chapman, who called the makeover a "blatantly sexist marketing move based on money" that strips the character of her place as a "better, stronger role model ... something of substance, not just a pretty face that waits around for romance." Instead, the message should be about how these days, women can be many things. But more poignantly, moneymaking is how Disney, and others, help new films get made -- and yes, even the progressive ones. The fact is that "babes" can be worthwhile role models, too, and no less so than those women whose looks are more rough and tumble.
