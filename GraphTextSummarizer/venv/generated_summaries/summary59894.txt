Back in 2002, the Slovakian Football Association was hit with a $29,000 fine after fans abused England duo Ashley Cole and Emile Heskey. @UEFAcom, @GovernmentRF, CSKA, all eyes are on you now.." UEFA has vowed to crack down harder on fans which continue to partake in racial abuse. In August, Polish club Legia Warsaw was fined $41,000 and ordered to close the north stand of its stadium following racist behavior by supporters during a Champions League second qualifying round tie. When it comes to punishment for racism, UEFA has imposed relatively small fines, which has left the governing body open to extreme criticism. That decision came a full six weeks after the incident and was then frowned upon further, after UEFA fined City $40,000 for coming out late ahead of the second-half of their last-16 Europa League game at Sporting Lisbon.
