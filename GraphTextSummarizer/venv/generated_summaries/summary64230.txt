The "Grease to Greece" expedition will attempt to travel from the UK to Greece powered exclusively by chip fat scrounged from a variety of restaurants, kebab shops and burger vans en route. If teams find waste oil hard to come by they can load up with fresh cooking oil from supermarkets. Organizer Andy Pag said: "The aim is to see if using vegetable oil for long distances is practical and feasible, and to have a bit of a laugh on the way." Andy Pag is leading a "chip fat" rally to Greece in August 2008. In 2007, Pag successfully drove a bio-truck powered by waste chocolate from the UK to Timbuktu.
