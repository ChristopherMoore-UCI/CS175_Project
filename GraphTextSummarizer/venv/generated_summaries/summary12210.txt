-- Tourism destinations deep inside India's tiger parks will be closed indefinitely after the Supreme Court of India imposed an interim ban on all tourism activities in core areas of tiger forests. "(Until) final directions of the court, core areas in tiger reserves will not be used for tourism activities," the court said in the order issued Tuesday, according to a report by the Times of India. The court is investigating whether tourism in India's tiger parks is in fact low impact. Tiger reserves are set up throughout India to provide a protected environment for animals still in the wild. India is home to the world's largest population of tigers -- 1,706 of them -- according to the World Wildlife Fund.
