Meaningful action on immigration reform has been paralyzed in part by broad disagreement over the issue of "amnesty" Disagreements center on what constitutes amnesty and whether current proposals by advocates for legalization of illegal immigrants represent an amnesty akin to what passed in 1986. Ever since Arizona and other states began addressing immigration on their own, there has been no shortage of media attention. But there is plenty of common ground on other immigration issues. Speaker Nancy Pelosi cited Colbert's "ability to bring attention to an important issue like immigration" in declaring the hearing appropriate. Does anyone believe that the real problem with immigration is a lack of attention to the issue?
