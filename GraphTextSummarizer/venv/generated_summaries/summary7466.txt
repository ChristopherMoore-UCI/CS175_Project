"The alleged actions as set forth in the complaint are predicated on former President Zedillo's actions as president of Mexico, thus involving the exercise of his powers of office," the U.S. government court filing said. The attorneys also criticized the U.S. government for basing its decision "on communications between Mr. Zedillo, the current Mexican government and the U.S. government" that were not related to the plaintiff's lawyers or the general public. Survivors of the attack and heirs of the 45 villagers killed in the massacre filed a civil lawsuit last year, accusing former Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo of crimes against humanity. "These anonymous accusations that President Zedillo was somehow complicit in the events in Acteal are baseless and outrageous," he said in a January court filing. But that tragedy was not the result of an elaborate conspiracy by the Mexican federal government, masterminded by President Zedillo.
