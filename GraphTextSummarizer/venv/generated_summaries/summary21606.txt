After the Friday night earthquake, authorities said police and local fire departments assessed affected areas and found no damage or significant injuries. Earthquakes with less than magnitude 5.5 don't usually cause significant damage or casualties, though results vary by region, geophysicist Paul Caruso said. "Tonight's earthquake is the second in two weeks, and reminds us to be prepared," Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said. The quakes come on the heels of  a magnitude-4.4 tremor that hit near downtown Los Angeles a week ago. A magnitude-5.1 earthquake struck the Los Angeles area Friday night, jolting nearby communities and breaking water mains in some neighborhoods.
