Amy Winehouse -- who last month gave a surprise performance with her producer Mark Ronson at a London movie premiere -- has taken another step closer to functional stardom, contributing a song to the upcoming Quincy Jones tribute album Q: Soul Bossa Nostra, due November 9th. "I am thrilled that she and Mark wanted to be a part of this album and I absolutely love what they did to make the song their own," Jones said in a statement. Winehouse and Ronson covered Lesley Gore's 1963 song "It's My Party," one of Quincy's first hits as a producer. Ronson admits, though, that the pair haven't started recording yet. (It's the song she performed in London last month.)
