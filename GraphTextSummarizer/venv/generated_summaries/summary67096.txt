The concern that terrorists will get hold of nuclear material and use it in an attack is a far greater threat than the older concern of global nuclear war, according to the president's Nuclear Posture Review. When pressed by reporters about whether there was specific intelligence indicating an active threat now, Brennan would only say, "I think you can point to a lot of al Qaeda activities and public statements that underscore their determination to carry out attacks against the U.S. and Western interests. CNN national security analyst Peter Bergen wrote in 2008 that "there is plenty of evidence that [al Qaeda] has experimented with crude chemical and biological weapons, and also attempted to acquire radioactive materials suitable for a 'dirty' bomb, a device that marries conventional explosives to radioactive materials. "They're doing the things that one would need to do to get nuclear weapons -- get help from those who know, start looking around for loose nukes ... Pakistan "has had many leaks from its program of classified information and sensitive nuclear equipment, and so you have to worry that it could be acquired in Pakistan," Albright said.
