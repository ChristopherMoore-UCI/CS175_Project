What American Giant is trying to do is not invest in those things and invest much more in the things that matter to customers and putting a lot of money into materials and into craftsmanship and into American-made products, so it really is looking at trying to be a part of this whole new wave of e-commerce. Bayard Winthrop: One of the big, dirty secrets in the apparel industry is that so much of the cost of what we pay for in our shirts and our pants is chewed up in distribution costs and big traditional marketing budgets. And while many clothing companies rely on retailers to distribute their products, one apparel company is steering clear of store fronts and selling their American-made clothing direct to consumers. CNN: More than 97% of apparel sold in the US Is made in other countries, and eight out of 10 shoes bought in the US are made in China. CNN: American Giant has no stores or marketing campaigns, and is sold strictly online.
