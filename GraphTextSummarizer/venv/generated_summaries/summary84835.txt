Indeed, even offensive clothing, like Nazi uniforms, has been deemed expressive conduct, and the reviled Klansman robe has garnered First Amendment protections. Clothing can be communicative, but courts require an identifiable, specific message to apply First Amendment protection. It's also true that speech need not be spoken or written. In 1971, the Supreme Court overturned one man's conviction for wearing a jacket that said "F**k the Draft" -- but that's not really expressive conduct, because the written words constituted speech. But that's just style -- or lack thereof -- and it's not enough of a message to be protected speech.
