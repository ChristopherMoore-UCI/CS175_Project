On the other end of the spectrum, viewers recommended fun and breezy comedies like "Peep Show" and "Silicon Valley," which require little investment of time or attention but deliver big on laughs and entertainment. Watching densely layered shows like those on a compressed cycle also minimizes the risk of forgetting key details or plot points that comes with waiting a week in between episodes. Judging from the responses, it seems that a variety of factors make a show binge-worthy, making different shows worth binging on for different reasons. This question was posed over the weekend on the social networking website Reddit, where community members can solicit feedback from others on topics of their choosing. Popular shows that had short runs, like "Firefly" or "Freaks and Geeks," also make compelling candidates if you can avoid getting emotionally attached.
