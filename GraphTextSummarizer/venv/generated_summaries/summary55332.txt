-- Two popular anti-smoking drugs will now carry warnings about the risk of severe mental health problems, the Food and Drug Administration announced Wednesday. "The labeling update underscores the important role of health care providers in treating smokers attempting to quit and provides specific information about Chantix and instructions that physicians and patients should follow closely," said Dr. Briggs W. Morrison, senior vice president of the primary care development group at Pfizer. Pfizer says it updated its label in 2007 to include information of neuropsychiatric symptoms and has revised the label again to reflect Wednesday's warning. In a review of side effects in patients using the nicotine patch, the agency said it didn't find a clear link between those products and suicidal events. "Quitting smoking is one of the best things people can do for their health, but the quitting process is both difficult and complex."
