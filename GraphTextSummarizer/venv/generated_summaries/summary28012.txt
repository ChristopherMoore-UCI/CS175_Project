"There are huge gaping differences between people in South Africa and that is why you need dialogue, which you can't have without its monuments and statues," he says. University of Cape Town students took to social media  to demand Cecil Rhodes' statue come down, saying his legacy is tainted with racism. Afrikaner groups also chained themselves to the statue of Dutch colonizer Jan van Riebeeck in Cape Town. "He represents the former colonial representation of this country -- supremacy, racism, misogyny," says Ramabina Mahapa, president of the students' Representative Council, which led the fight to remove the statue. "Students are saying these aren't the ideals that we want to have here," Mahapa says.
