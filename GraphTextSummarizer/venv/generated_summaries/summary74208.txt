In an opinion column for Yahoo News, the group's chairman, Maggie Gallagher, said Tyree told her he decided to speak out after his former teammate Michael Strahan declared his support for gay marriage last week. The video appeared to take a page out of the playbook of the group's adversary, the Human Rights Campaign, which has released a steady stream of video testimonials from celebrity advocates of gay marriage in recent months. On the same day that the New York State Assembly approved a same-sex marriage bill, Tyree warned of dire consequences if the legislation becomes law. His disapproval of gay marriage is based on religious as well as secular grounds, Tyree said. The bill's passage would "be the beginning of our country sliding toward ... anarchy," he said Tyree made the comments in a video released Wednesday by the National Organization for Marriage, which is spearheading opposition to the bill.
