Avellino police official Pasquale Picone said the bus struck 11 cars on the road before falling off the bridge, leading police to suspect the bus had brake problems. The funeral in Pozzuoli comes only a day after a somber memorial Mass in Spain for 79 victims of last week's train crash outside Santiago de Compostela. The bus was traveling east of Naples in Avellino province when it crashed late Sunday. Rosario Cantelmo, the Avellino prosecutor who is coordinating the investigation, told CNN that the bus driver -- who was among those killed -- is the focus of inquiries. Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta was among those who attended the service in the village of Pozzuoli, near Naples.
