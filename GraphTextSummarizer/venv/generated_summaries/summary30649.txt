The biker who was struck by the SUV, 28-year-old Christopher Cruz, was later arrested and faces several charges, including reckless endangerment, reckless driving and endangering the welfare of a child, Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said on Tuesday. -- One of two motorcyclists who police say used their helmets to bash in an SUV window moments before the driver was dragged out and allegedly assaulted by a gang of bikers turned himself in to authorities on Tuesday. Police say this same group of bikers descended on New York City and clogged up Times Square last year in what Commissioner Kelly said was a "major stunt event." The gang, called "Hollywood Stuntz," according to police, chased the man, and he was forced to stop because of flat tires. The man's name was not released, and police said Tuesday afternoon that he had not yet been charged.
