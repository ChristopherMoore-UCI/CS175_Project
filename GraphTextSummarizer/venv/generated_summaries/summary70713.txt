Dominion Virginia Power reported only 3,400 outages by Thursday afternoon, most of them in southeast Virginia, but it was unclear whether all of those were storm-related, said utility spokeswoman La-Ha Anderson. Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport had recorded more than 6 inches by mid-afternoon Thursday. After a storm that dumped more than 30 inches of snow in some places last weekend, the latest part of the one-two punch dropped 22.5 inches on Baltimore, Maryland, 15.8 inches on Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and about 10 inches on Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in Arlington, Virginia, Central Park in New York and Atlantic City, New Jersey, the National Weather Service said. Amtrak was still providing limited service for Washington, New York and Boston, Massachusetts, on Thursday, but most passenger rail service south of Washington was canceled. " Dulles International Airport and Reagan National Airport reopened Thursday after closing to flights Wednesday afternoon.
