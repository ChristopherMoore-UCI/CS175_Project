This is America and (marriage equality) should be part of the "United" part of our country. Its mission is simple: sell bow ties to raise money for marriage equality. Obviously, I'm so happy these states won marriage equality. But one stumbling block is the lack of education about marriage equality. We'll start a bow-tie line and funnel the proceeds into a foundation for marriage equality.
