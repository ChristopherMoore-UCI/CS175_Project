"Everyone looks at these girls like, 'Poor them, they're victims, they're just going to suffer and have such terrible lives,' " said Kranti founder Robin Chaurasiya. " Katti says she was sexually abused around age 11 or 12. " Katti credits her mother, Vandana, for encouraging her move to Kranti, which means "revolution" in Hindi. "I didn't want her to endure what I did." Katti said she now wants to study psychology so she can help other women back home. "I don't know what I'm going to find out there, but I'm really excited," Katti told CNN's Kristie Lu Stout.
