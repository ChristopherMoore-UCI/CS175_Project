"These are four big rules that set a framework for a really important change for food safety," said Michael Taylor, deputy commissioner for Foods at the FDA. " But food industry lobbyists and safety advocates contacted by CNN say it may have more to do with politics. The agency also points to parts of the law that have gone into effect, like the ability to hold food that may have been adulterated or mis-branded and requiring companies importing food to let the FDA know whether another country refused to allow it in. That leaves 80% of the U.S. food supply operating largely under safety laws dating from the Great Depression, and safety advocates and the food industry alike are puzzled. They're worried about that," said one lobbyist who has been in White House meetings and spoke on the condition his name would not be used.
