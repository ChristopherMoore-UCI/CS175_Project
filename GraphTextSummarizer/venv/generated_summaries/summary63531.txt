Thus far, McKenzie's Gordon seems like a one-note, righteous character, so we'll have to see if he gets fleshed out in future episodes. That title belongs to Detective Jim Gordon, who's not yet a commissioner, as played by "The OC" and "Southland" star Ben McKenzie. But compared to McKenzie's straight-as-an-arrow Gordon, the villains are so far the best part of "Gotham." Fish and her lackey Oswald Cobblepot -- who's also called by the nickname he hates,"Penguin" -- were a treat to watch, as were the younger versions of Gotham bad guys Riddler and Poison Ivy during their very brief introductions. Mike Hale at the New York Times tried to focus on the positive, pointing out that at the very least, "Gotham" has "consistent style."
