At the same time, there were reports -- like a July item in the New York Post titled "Inside the crumbling marriage of Jay Z and Beyonce" -- which claimed that the pair were now more business arrangement than happy couple. Say what you will about superstar couple Beyonce and Jay Z, but they appear determined to keep fans guessing. Us Weekly reports that Beyonce got emotional, wiping away tears as she said to her husband, "I love you so much" before asking the audience to "Give it up for Mr. Carter" (which is Jay Z's legal name). (Beyonce and Jay Z have consistently been named among the top-earning couples in the music industry.) After Beyonce's sister, Solange, was shown on surveillance video fighting her rapper brother-in-law after the Met Gala in New York City, there were whispers that divorce was on the horizon.
