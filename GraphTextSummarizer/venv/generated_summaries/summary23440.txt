Inmates at the medium-security Northpoint Training Center in Burgin started an uprising shortly after the warden announced he'd ease restrictions on a lockdown, Northpoint Public Information Officer Mendalyn Cochran told CNN. "There are several buildings in the front that will be a total loss," said Lt. David Jude of Kentucky State Police. Inmates set fire to a Kentucky prison on Friday after the warden said he would ease restrictions on a lockdown. Authorities regained control of a Kentucky prison early Saturday after inmates torched buildings, shattered windows and threw rocks at guards. Inmates were evacuated to the prison yard and authorities threw tear gas over the fence to subdue the prisoners, Cochran said.
