Now running as a respected independent in Egypt's first democratic presidential election, Abol Fotoh says the pillars of his program are to strengthen democracy, freedom and respect for human rights, and to ensure everyone is treated fairly under Egyptian law. Those ideals are backed by a long history of opposition to the regime of President Hosni Mubarak, said Dr. Omar Ashour, director of Middle East Studies at the University of Exeter and a visiting scholar at the Brookings Institution in Doha, Qatar. Abol Fotoh was among those who first demonstrated in Tahrir Square on January 25, 2011, Ashour told CNN from Cairo, and he has maintained his commitment to the popular revolution since. Abol Fotoh has also shown he can stand tough when he needs to, which suggests he will stick to his campaign promises, Ashour said. At the same time, Abol Fotoh appeals to the ultraconservative Salafi groups on political grounds because he is no longer part of the Muslim Brotherhood but is still an Islamist, rather than secular, contender.
