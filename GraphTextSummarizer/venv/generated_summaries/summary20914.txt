He noted that Google, faced with anti-Semitic search results in the United States, responded by posting an ad with a link to a statement that includes a link to information from the Anti-Defamation League. -- An Argentine court this week granted an injunction that blocks internet giant Google from "suggesting" searches that lead to certain sites that have been deemed anti-Semitic, and removes the sites from the search engine's index. " Google's suggested searches are a Google algorithm that offers search terms similar to the one the user appears to be typing in. Germany bans neo-Nazi content, and Google has agreed to remove such sites from its Google.de search engine in that country. I don't think that the people of Argentina are harmed by the inability to see anti-Semitic content, but I think that the best answer is counter-speech,"said Ryan Calo, a researcher at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society.
