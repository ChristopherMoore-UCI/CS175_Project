Ready for Hillary, a super PAC founded by Hillary Clinton devotees, has started to grease the wheels of state politics, currying favor with local Democrats by exchanging important data about the group's supporters with Senate and House campaigns ahead of the 2014 midterms. CNN asked a number of state parties and Senate campaigns to confirm whether they swapped names with Clinton. In turn, campaigns and state parties are looking for as much help as they can get. Anthony Corrado, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and expert on campaign finance, said "These names are increasingly as valuable as a contribution." "Campaigns are starting to realize that good names are more important than just having more dollars to spend on television," said Corrado, who also is a professor of government at Colby College. When it was founded in 2013, the group had two primary goals: Urge the former secretary of state to run for president and collect a massive amount of voter data to help that endeavor.
