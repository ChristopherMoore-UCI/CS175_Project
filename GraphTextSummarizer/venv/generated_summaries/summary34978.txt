One person who feels he deserves the reward is camp ranger Rick Heltebrake, one of Dorner's last victims. I believe that that money was put up by the private sector and basically corporate donors, not from taxpayer money or anything like that, and I believe those people wanted that money to go somewhere, and I'd like to do some good with it." Heltebrake said he could split the money with Karen and Jim Reynolds, the couple who encountered Dorner in their Big Bear-area condo Tuesday morning, before the carjacking. Dorner died from single gunshot to head "Collectively this group, led by my office, is posting a reward of $1 million for information that will lead to Mr. Dorner's capture," said Mayor Antonio R. Villaraigosa. The catch is that Dorner, the rogue former Los Angeles police officer who sparked a massive manhunt, was never captured. " Heltebrake said he wants to use the reward money to set up college funds for the children of the two law enforcement officers killed by Dorner.
