-- Four-time European champions Ajax scraped into Friday's Champions League draw after edging their third qualifying round tie on away goals. The Dutch team, who had to start in the opening preliminary stage of Europe's premier club competition after finishing second in the Eredivisie last season, drew 3-3 against Greek side PAOK Salonika on Wednesday night. While the third-round winners go into the hat for the chance to qualify for the lucrative group stage of the competition, won last May by Italy's Inter Milan, the losers will go into the draw for the playoffs of the second-tier Europa League. In other results, Russian league leaders Zenit St. Petersburg knocked out last year's group stage qualifiers Unirea Urziceni of Romania, with Portugal international Danny scoring the only goal of the two ties 12 minutes before halftime. Scottish side Celtic, the 1967 European champions, failed to reach the group stage for the second time in two years despite beating Braga 2-1 at home, losing 4-2 on aggregate to the Portuguese league runners-up.
