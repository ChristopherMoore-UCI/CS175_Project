-- When celebrated film composer Hans Zimmer agreed to create the soundtrack for Disney's 1994 animated film "The Lion King," he knew there was only one person he wanted to work with -- South African singer and songwriter Lebo M. Award-winning Zimmer, whose illustrious body of work includes scores for mega-hits such as "Gladiator," "Pirates of the Caribbean" and "The Simpsons," had already collaborated successfully with Lebo on "The Power of One," a 1992 drama set in South Africa. The movie also turned out to be a roaring success, winning two Academy Awards and three Golden Globes, as well as becoming the highest grossing hand-drawn film in cinema history "We had created a formula with Hans that puts together Eurocentric orchestration with African voices and African big drums," says Lebo. "I think the authenticity and the raw African-ness of 'The Lion King' is a bigger selling point than any other product that has ever been on Broadway or on stage, done with a world-class quality approach," says Lebo, who is determined to keep the show's feel authentically African by making sure that all international productions feature South African performing in them.

Lebo says that it is the combination of the African spirit with a global story line that has made the show such a success.
