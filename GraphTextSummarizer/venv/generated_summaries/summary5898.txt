-- When it comes to curing soccer injuries all you need is cheese, according to coach Felix Magath. The former Fulham manager confirmed reports he suggested defender Brede Hangeland wrap cheese around his injured knee to help it heal. Vonn told Sports Illustrated about her physical therapist's unusual remedy: "He's been wrapping cheese on it, and I know that sounds funny, but it seems to work." Maybe Hangeland, who has since left Fulham for Crystal Palace, should have given cheese a chance. The cheese hit the spot for Vonn as she went on to recover from injury and win the Olympic downhill title in a matter of weeks.
