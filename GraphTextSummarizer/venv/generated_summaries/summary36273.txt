"Without trust, teams and work groups simply cannot sustain satisfactory productivity over time," said Parsons. CNN.com asked Parsons and certified career coach Hallie Crawford of Atlanta for some advice. Mickey Parsons, a master certified career coach based in Atlanta, says good leaders understand the power of honesty and trust. Consider confronting your supervisor if you think it's necessary and won't hurt your reputation or job -- or confront your boss if you are ready to leave anyway, said Crawford. Parsons said there's a saying that at work 20% of the staff do 80% of the work.
