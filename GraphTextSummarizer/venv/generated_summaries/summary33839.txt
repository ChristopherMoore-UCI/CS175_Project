-- American journalist Michael Scott Moore, held for more than two years by Somali pirates, has been freed, Moore's family and a Somali official told CNN on Tuesday. In lawless Somalia, it's common -- particularly among pirates -- that people are kidnapped and their freedom negotiated for ransom. The U.S. State Department confirmed in January 2012 that officials had spoken with Moore's family and been in touch with contacts in Kenya and Somalia to get more information. They said, if you really care about the guy, that is not a good idea, raising his profile would make his release more difficult." Todd said Moore's stories suggested that illegal European fishing was driving Somalis into piracy. Freed journalist Peter Theo Curtis back in the U.S. CNN's Ray Sanchez and journalist Mohamed Sheikh Nor in Somalia contributed to this report.
