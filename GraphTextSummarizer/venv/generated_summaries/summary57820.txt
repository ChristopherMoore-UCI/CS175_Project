-- Turkish singer and actor Ibrahim Tatlises was in critical condition Monday after being shot in the head by unknown assailants early Monday morning, his doctor said on television. Elmaci said he does not believe that Tatlises will have problems with speech, as the side of the head that was injured does not control speech abilities. Tatlises and his spokeswoman, Buket Cakici, were shot as they left the building housing private Turkish television channel Beyaz TV following Tatlises' weekly television show. Tatlises, who has millions of fans in Turkey and the Middle East, was shot in the right side of his brain and underwent surgery, Dr. Ilhan Elmaci said in front of the Acibadem Hospital. Tatlises, 59, comes from Turkey's mostly Kurdish-populated southeastern province of Sanliurfa.
