New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie lobbied for construction of the Keystone XL pipeline during a trip to Canada on Thursday, staking out a position popular with Republicans and business groups ahead of a potential 2016 bid for the White House. He called on Congress to approve legislation that would fast-track approval of a new pact between Canada, the United States and 10 other Pacific Rim countries, covering a host of new issues -- including intellectual property rights and environmental and labor rules -- that weren't addressed in as much depth in the North American Free Trade Agreement. The travel and the year the New Jersey Republican just spent as Republican Governors Association chairman have given him opportunities to elevate his profile and connect with key donors ahead of his decision on whether to seek the GOP's 2016 presidential nomination. During a press conference with Prentice on Thursday, Christie said Keystone would be a "reliable and secure source of energy from a friendly neighbor and trading partner is something that is going to be a benefit to everyone in the United States, including the people of New Jersey." He batted away a question about whether dropping oil prices have undercut the need for the Keystone pipeline.
