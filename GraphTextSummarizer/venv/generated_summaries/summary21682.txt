The cylinders, each 16 feet tall and weighing 115 tons, were not damaged, and no radiation was released, said Rick Zuercher, spokesman for Dominion Virginia Power, which operates the North Anna Power Station near Louisa, Virginia. "An alert is the next-to-lowest NRC emergency classification for plant events, and the North Anna station exited the alert after off-site power was restored," the commission said in a statement. Zuercher, however, confirmed a report in the Washington Post that Dominion Virginia Power had notified the NRC last Friday that the earthquake might have shaken the power station more than it was designed to handle. An augmented inspection team is formed "to review more significant events or issues" at NRC facilities, and includes technical experts and additional inspectors. The NRC initially sent a seismic expert and a structural expert to assist resident inspectors at the site after the earthquake, but "further reviews indicated that additional inspection is warranted," the commission said in a statement issued Monday.
