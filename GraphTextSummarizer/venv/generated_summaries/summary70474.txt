-- A new audio recording released online Monday purportedly captures another profanity-laced argument between actor Mel Gibson and former girlfriend Oksana Grigorieva, in which he threatens her life and verbally abuses her. Grigorieva filed a restraining order against Gibson alleging that the actor and director struck her in the face, according to her spokesman, Stephen Jaffe. Gibson came under fire for a racially charged tirade in 2006, when he admitted to making anti-Semitic remarks during a drunken driving arrest. Grigorieva has spoken with sheriff's deputies and has provided a statement to them in their domestic violence investigation, Jaffe told CNN Friday. Jaffe said Friday that the site did not receive them from Grigorieva.
