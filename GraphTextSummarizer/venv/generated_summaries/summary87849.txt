At its height, the fishing ban resulting from the April 20 BP oil rig explosion stretched over 88,000 square miles, or 37 percent of federal Gulf waters, Lubchenco noted. Officials are "nibbling at the edges" in terms of reopening the Gulf waters after extensive testing, Lubchenco said, starting with areas that were the least contaminated. She also stated that the NOAA -- in conjunction with the Environmental Protection Agency -- will continue to test seafood from reopened areas of the Gulf. Thad Allen, the man in charge of the government response to the Gulf oil crisis, said Wednesday that the "fishing" operations had been delayed by a buildup of hydrates -- chemicals that form at low temperatures and high pressures toward the sea floor -- that temporarily jammed the cap that trapped oil in the well starting on July 15. -- The federal government has reopened 4,281 square miles of federal waters off the coast of western Louisiana to commercial and recreational fishing, according to Jane Lubchenco, head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
