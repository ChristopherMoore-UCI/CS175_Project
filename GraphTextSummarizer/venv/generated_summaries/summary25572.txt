-- Police agencies across Australia put out alerts Monday declaring as fake text messages and emails sent to thousands of Australians that said they had two days to pay $5,000 or die. The messages started assaulting mobile phones and email accounts Sunday. "Do not respond," said Detective Superintendent Brian Hay of the Queensland Police Service. The so-called hit-man scam has had two previous forays in Australia over the last two and a half years, according to Hay. "What is extraordinary in these circumstances is the extent of contact across the Australian landscape," Hay said.
