In "The Dictator," his third and most outwardly conventional Hollywood vehicle, he introduces us to one "General Admiral Aladeen," a North African despot who resembles Libya's Colonel Moammar Gadhafi, but with an Osama bin Laden beard, and something of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's knack for international diplomacy. How can you not, when Aladeen attempts to impersonate a Chinese-American tourist by pressing his fingers to his eyes and pronouncing his "r"s and "l"s, apparently convinced of his acting prowess after starring in several vanity projects back home in Wadiya. Summoned to the United Nations to explain his country's mushrooming nuclear weapons program, Aladeen plans to throw down the gauntlet, but instead he's abducted from his hotel room and only escapes assassination by the skin of his teeth. Mistaken for a political refugee by the well-meaning manager of a vegan cooperative grocery store (played by Anna Faris), Aladeen embarks on a new career in the service industry until he can get his country back. A barking chauvinist bigot, Aladeen makes Borat look like a puppy dog.
