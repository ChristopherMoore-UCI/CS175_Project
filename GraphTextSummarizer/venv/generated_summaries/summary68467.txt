"I think Dortmund were the best team by far," Real boss Mourinho told Sky Sports. Ronaldo's strike, his sixth in six consecutive Champions League games, appeared to have left Dortmund in a daze. Now, perhaps Borussia Dortmund can claim similar after crushing Real Madrid 4-1 in the first leg of its Champions League semifinal Wednesday. If Bayern's 4-0 win over Barcelona on Tuesday night was supposedly the beginning of a power shift from Spain to Germany, then Dortmund's dominance confirmed it. Barring the prospect of miracles at Camp Nou and the Bernabeu next week, Dortmund will contest the first ever all-German Champions League final against Bayern Munich at Wembley on May 25.
