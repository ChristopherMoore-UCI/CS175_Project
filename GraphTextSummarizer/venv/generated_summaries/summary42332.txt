Permitting dragnet religious surveillance of Muslim communities will also exacerbate anti-Muslim sentiment. Since September 11, 2001, the New York Police Department has used community mapping, video surveillance, photography and confidential informants to map Muslim life in and around New York. Religious surveillance of Muslim communities will one day join this tragic, shameful legacy. According to the judge, the harm to Muslim communities was caused by overzealous journalists, not snooping cops. Many vacillate before joining Muslim groups on campus or speaking on controversial issues like religious profiling in the classroom.
