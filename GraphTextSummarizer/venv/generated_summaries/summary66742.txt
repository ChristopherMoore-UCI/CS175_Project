It is currently on exhibit at the Reykjav√≠k Museum of Photography and will be featured in May at the Warsaw Festival of Art Photography. The inspiration started with a radio interview Ella heard in which people were discussing ethical questions brought up by prenatal tests to detect birth defects. Ella shot the photos in 2013 and 2014 as part of a final project at The School of Photography in Reykjavik. Icelandic photographer Sigga Ella wanted to show that people with Down syndrome are more than a chromosomal abnormality. It's necessary to open the discussion and educate people more about Down syndrome.
