The patient, who has not been identified publicly, flew Saturday aboard US Airways Flight 401 from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to San Francisco, California, airline spokesman Morgan Durrant told CNN. The person was stopped in San Francisco after trying to board another flight for a location outside the country, said Dr. Martin Cetron, CDC's director for global migration and quarantine. Since its creation, the list has held 88 names of people with contagious disease who represent a threat to public health and have shown evidence of intending to fly, Cetron told CNN. "When DHS was provided the do-not-board information from CDC, TSA quickly followed proper protocol and made this information available to airlines," TSA spokeswoman Kristin Lee told CNN. He insisted he had not been told he was contagious; public health officials disagreed.
