" Middle East analyst Reza Aslan said Monday that following years of frosty relations, Obama wants to strengthen ties with Turkey to send a signal to other Muslim nations. "I'm trying to make a statement about the importance of Turkey, not just to the United States but to the world," Obama said at a joint news conference Monday with Turkish President Abdullah Gul. President Obama and Turkish President Abdullah Gul hold a joint news conference Monday. Obama also called on Turkey, NATO's only Muslim member country, to work side by side with the United States to resolve conflicts across the turbulent Middle East. Turkey sends "a very important signal to the rest of the Muslim world that the United States is not anti-Muslim as so many have thought we have been, but rather here is a very strong Muslim nation that is working hand in hand with the United States," Cohen said.
