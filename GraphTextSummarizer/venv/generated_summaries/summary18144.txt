The next logical step after the underwater search is to "rethink all of the information we have at hand," ocean search specialist Rob McCallum told CNN. The document discusses how best to deploy resources, including new underwater search assets. Other objects search teams have spotted in the Indian Ocean turned out to be trash, jellyfish and fishing gear. The Bluefin-21 has scanned more than 90% of the underwater search area set out by investigators and began its 12th mission on Thursday. If the search changes tacks, that doesn't mean investigators did the wrong thing by looking where they did for the plane, said CNN analyst David Gallo, who co-led the search for Air France Flight 447.
