"Talent" judge Amanda Holden and Dr. Drew Pinsky of VH1's "Celebrity Rehab With Dr. Drew" joined CNN's Larry King Tuesday night to discuss Boyle's hospitalization for stress and the toll the spotlight and media criticism might have taken on her mental health. Watch Amanda Holden discuss Susan Boyle Â» King: She came in, though, [as] a small-town amateur singer, [with] learning disabilities due to suffering oxygen deprivation at birth. The only thing I'm worried about with Susan Boyle is that she seems to have a crush on Piers Morgan. ... The "Britain's Got Talent" contestant was expected to be something of a joke when she first sauntered on stage, but she absolutely wowed the audience, the judges -- and then the world via the Internet -- with her stunning rendition of "I Dreamed a Dream." Along with Simon Cowell and Piers Morgan, Amanda Holden is a judge on "Britain's Got Talent." And I just wonder whether maybe younger people voted and were quicker on the texts than the kind of people that were voting for Susan.
