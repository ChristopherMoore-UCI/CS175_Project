"This discovery suggests that the event(s) responsible for the origin of the rings is relatively recent, or that a fortuitous balance of forces have combined to help sustain them," said Ed Beshore, deputy principal investigator for NASA's OSIRIS-REx mission, which aims to visit a near-Earth asteroid and bring a sample back to Earth. The gravitational interactions from small moons may be keeping the orbiting material in ring form, scientists said. "We weren't looking for a ring and didn't think small bodies like Chariklo had them at all," he said in a statement. Scientists planning OSIRIS-REx, targeting an asteroid called Bennu, are finding challenges with the dynamics of small celestial bodies, Beshore said. Chariklo is fairly small -- 250 kilometers (150 miles) in diameter.
