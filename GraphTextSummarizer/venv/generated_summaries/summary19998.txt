If you are selected, you'll receive a bike, uniform, wet suit, personal training and nutrition coaching, two all-expenses-paid training trips and a chance to train and compete alongside Gupta at the 2013 Nautica Malibu Triathlon. The experience gave the team members altered perspective, a sense of purpose, healthy eating habits, a wealth of new skills, mental fortitude and a string of wonderful memories. It was an absolute privilege to join Dr. Sanjay Gupta and Coach April as a guest coach for the 2012 CNN Fit Nation team. -- A little more than two months ago, I stood on a California beach, tears streaming down my cheeks as I watched members of the 2012 CNN Fit Nation team cross the finish line of the Nautica Malibu Triathlon. I await the news of the selection of the 2013 CNN Fit Nation team, knowing it marks the start of a journey that will change lives, empowering a new group to defy what they may have deemed impossible and inspire everyone else out there to do the same.
