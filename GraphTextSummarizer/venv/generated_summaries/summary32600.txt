" Christofi was shot to death on February 14, 2002, in the bedroom of Williams' plush New Jersey estate. -- Former NBA star Jayson Williams pleaded guilty to aggravated assault Monday in the 2002 shooting death of his chauffeur, according to the New Jersey Attorney General's Office. Williams was scheduled to be retried on a manslaughter charge stemming from the shooting death of limousine driver Costas Christofi. Williams, who retired about 10 years ago because of a leg injury, played nine seasons with the Philadelphia 76ers and New Jersey Nets. Those charges allege that Williams was driving a black Mercedes sport utility vehicle fast when he hit a tree at 3:15 a.m., a New York police spokesman said.
