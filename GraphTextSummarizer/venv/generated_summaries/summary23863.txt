-- NBA star Derrick Rose has spoken out about gun crime in his hometown of Chicago and identified poverty as its root cause. " Presidential problem President Barack Obama has also spoken with concern about the problems of gun crime and poverty in Chicago -- home to his private residence. He went on to be named the NBA rookie of the year in 2009 -- an honor shared by former Bull Michael Jordan. "For me, all I could do is, like I said, stay positive, know that it's people watching me -- young kids looking up to me," Rose said. The death came as Obama's administration has been focused on reducing gun violence, especially the killing of children, after the December 14 elementary school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut.
