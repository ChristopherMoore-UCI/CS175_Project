A 85th minute strike from Wesley Sneijder earned Galatasaray a 1-0 win over Juventus on Wednesday as Tuesday's Group B Champions League match concluded after play had been suspended following a snowstorm on Tuesday night. Robert Lewandowski got Dortmund off to the perfect start with a goal in the fourth minute but German joy didn't last long as Marseille defender Souleymane Diawara equalized in 14th minute. Goals from 20-year-old Julian Draxler in the 50th minute followed by Joel Matip seven minutes later ensured second place in the group for the Bundesliga side at the expense of their opponents. With seven points, Galatasaray finished second to runaway group winners Real Madrid, while Juve had to settle for third place (on six points) and a place in the Europa League. Dortmund's better head-to-head record against Arsenal ensured they finished first in the group while the Gunners clinched second place despite losing 2-0 away to Napoli.
