Spanish National Police said Friday they have seized hundreds of kilograms of cocaine in an operation that they said thwarted an attempt by Mexican drug dealers allied with the Sinaloa drug cartel to establish a foothold in Europe. "As the drug wars come under fire from many quarters, one of the big advances that has been made has been intelligence sharing between U.S. agencies and their foreign counterparts, and this is further proof of that." Beith said Friday's announcement was a testament to the improvement in intelligence sharing by international agencies. If indeed "Chapo" Guzman's cousin was among the men arrested, "that is a big deal," said Beith, whose books "The Last Narco" and "Hasta El Ultimo Dia," focus on the Mexican drug war. But an expert on the Mexican drug war, Malcolm Beith, disputed that assertion.
