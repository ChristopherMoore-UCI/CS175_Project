If you're willing to peek behind the facade, you can experience Bourdain's Las Vegas -- a Sin City remarkably void of Elvis impersonators, migraine-inducing bright lights and spinning reels of slot machine fruit. Bundled in blankets and sipping vodka from flasks, they rode through the countryside where the city's wealthiest residents have their country homes, or dachas, and Emperor Paul built his 18th-century home. For Bourdain, night trains leave a lasting impression. When Bourdain visited Las Vegas in Season 3, he experienced a city that few people see. Bourdain traveled to Russia and filmed an episode with his longtime friend/drinking buddy Zamir Gotta.
