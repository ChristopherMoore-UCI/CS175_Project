Tunisian Prime Minister Habib Essid identified two suspects in the attack, Yassine Labidi and Saber Khachnaou, in an interview with French radio station RTL on Thursday, though it wasn't immediately clear if they were the pair killed at the museum by Tunisian security forces. "They left the country illegally last December for Libya, and they were able to train with weapons there," he told private broadcaster AlHiwar Ettounsi TV. Authorities have arrested nine people in connection with the attack, including four directly linked to it, according to a statement from Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi. That bloodshed is "just the start," the ISIS message warned -- a threat that may or may not be hollow, but nonetheless adds extra urgency for Tunisian investigators. Although his nephew said he'd gone to the Tunisian city of Sfax to work, his family now suspected he had been in Libya because of the phone numbers he called from.
