-- As a group of martial art students are put through their paces in downtown Ho Chi Minh City, grandmaster Nguyen Van Chieu sits at the side of the room wearing a quiet look of contentment. Founded in Hanoi by grandmaster Nguyen Loc in 1938, Vovinam fuses elements of traditional Vietnamese martial arts and other martial arts from around the world. It combines both hard and soft elements, says Van Chieu, referring to the contrasting methods deployed in martial arts to repel an attack. The 65-year-old has devoted his adult life to spreading the word about Vovinam, a form of martial arts originating in Vietnam. Back in Ho Chi Minh City, Nguyen Van Chieu can reflect on a life's work with a degree of satisfaction and pride.
