The suspect, whom authorities have identified only by his initials M.K.J., has also confessed involvement to a robbery of a restaurant last month, said General Solicitor Taco Stein. The suspect appeared before a judge Wednesday, who granted the prosecution's request for a pretrial detention of eight days for the suspect, Stein told CNN. He hasn't confessed to any involvement in the slayings and will appear in court Thursday for a pretrial detention hearing, Stein said. Investigators are now working to confirm the details of the suspect's statements and are gathering additional evidence to present in court, Stein said. A second suspect in custody in the Kings' murders has been identified as a 17-year-old man with the initials of J.C.M., Stein said.
