The Pakistani Taliban represent a confederation of Taliban groups in northwestern Pakistan, where they are based, said Bill Roggio, military-affairs analyst who is managing editor of The Long War Journal. Both groups swear allegiance to Taliban leader Mullah Omar and have close ties to al Qaeda, he said. FBI agents arrested Hafiz Khan and his son Izhar Khan in South Florida, the department said. Instead, as today's charges show, he acted with others to support terrorists to further acts of murder, kidnapping and maiming," U.S. Attorney Wilfredo A. Ferrer said. Hafiz Khan is the imam at Flagler Mosque in Miami.
