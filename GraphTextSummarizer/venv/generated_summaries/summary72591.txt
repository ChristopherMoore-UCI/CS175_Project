-- Government troops in southern Yemen on Sunday attacked al Qaeda hideouts, killing two dozen suspected militants in the latest push to clear the area of the terror organization, local security officials said. Suspected al Qaeda militants seized Abyan last year during Yemen's political stalemate after government troops evacuated most military posts in the province. Yemen's government has been fighting al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula for years with mixed results. On Saturday, a pair of U.S. drone strikes killed 11 suspected al Qaeda militants in Yemen's Mareb province. The device originated in Yemen and was brought to authorities' attention by a mole who infiltrated al Qaeda, a source in the region told CNN.
