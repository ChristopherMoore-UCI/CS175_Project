South Sudan shut down production in late January after accusing Sudan of stealing $815 million worth of its oil. The appeal comes as South Sudan's government struggles to make up for losing 98 percent of its revenue when it halted oil production amid a dispute over transportation and processing fees with Sudan. Kiir said the government has set up a special bank account in Kenya where officials and "corrupt individuals with close ties to government officials" can deposit public funds. In World Bank documents leaked to media last month, the Washington-based lender warned of "state collapse" if the country runs out of foreign exchange reserves, which it said could be depleted by July -- one year after South Sudan became the world's newest nation, following a two-decade civil war. "If funds are returned, the government of the Republic of South Sudan will grant amnesty and keep your name confidential," President Salva Kiir said in the letter, which was dated May 3 and sent to former and current "senior" officials.
