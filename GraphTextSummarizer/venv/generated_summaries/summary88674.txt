Their "contradictory messages and their continued military offensive seem to indicate that they might be intent on taking Bangui," said U.N. spokesman Farhan Haq, referring to the capital city. France has a permanent presence of 200 to 300 military personnel at Bangui's airport under the mandate of the Economic Community of Central African States. On Monday, the U.S. Department of State, citing "increased rebel activity" in the country, warned U.S. citizens against all but essential travel outside Bangui. The move "is a precautionary measure to reduce our presence in the event the security situation further deteriorates in Bangui," he continued. The developments came on the same day an Air France jet -- en route to Bangui -- turned around mid-flight and returned to Paris because of tensions in the country.
