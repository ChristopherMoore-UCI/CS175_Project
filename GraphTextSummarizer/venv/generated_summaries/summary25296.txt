An Oklahoma lawmaker says people will not be fined $500 for wearing hooded sweatshirts in public, despite some interpretations of a proposed law concerning hoods and masks. "The bill is not designed to ban hoodies, but to prevent the wearing of masks or disguises in the commission of a crime," Barrington said in a statement. Because hooded garments, or hoodies, are often worn as weather protection and not for the purposes of intentional concealment, it is unlikely they would be considered a disguise under the bill, he said in an email. Republican state Sen. Don Barrington's SB 13 would make it a crime to wear a "robe, mask or other disguise" in public that would "intentionally conceal the wearer's identity." The measure provides a number of exceptions, including religious garments, Halloween celebrations, parades, weather protection and other circumstances.
