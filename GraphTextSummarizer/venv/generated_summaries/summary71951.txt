Parents had gathered in the jury assembly room along with counselors, police and school officials, Skorik said. Witnesses told police that the suspect was communicating with other students, and "the dialogue at times, I'm told, was light," Skorik said. Baneck said Monday that school officials were working to make counselors available to students and others affected by the incident. Officials believe Hengel did not bring the duffel bag into class, but asked to use the bathroom, then went to his locker and retrieved it, said school Superintendent Tim Baneck. Skorik said Tuesday that police are still trying to determine a motive, saying the student was well-liked, had no prior law enforcement contact and "was a good student."
