"The support Arsenal Fanshare has from all of the club's major shareholders should allow all talk of a takeover to be put to one side," said Arsenal Fanshare board member and AST spokesman Tim Payton. -- Arsenal are backing a ground breaking new scheme to allow their supporters to buy affordable shares in the club and have a greater say over how it is run. "Arsenal Fanshare has been established to increase supporter ownership and representation. Kroenke has repeatedly upped his stake in Arsenal and now stands just ten shares short of 30 per cent - the figure that under UK takeover law would mean he is compelled to make an offer for the remaining shares. Buying one "fanshare" will allow a member to quiz Arsenal's directors on key decisions and cast their vote on the direction of the club, similar to how Spanish champions Barcelona are set up.
