Colombia capitulated to the drug kings and let cartel lawyers rewrite portions of the national constitution to outlaw extradition. In Colombia, once home to the world's biggest cocaine cartels, new crime organizations are being picked apart with silent efficiency -- aided by Bogota's enthusiastic embrace of extradition. The beauty of extradition as practiced by Colombia is not its power to stop drug smuggling. In recent years, more than 1,300 of Colombia's top crime bosses and their most dangerous enforcers have been sent north to face trafficking charges in the United States, a dramatic turnabout from the 1990s when extradition was outlawed under coercive pressure from the Medellin and Cali cartels. In short, extradition disorganizes organized crime.
