" Ananias Shaw's children, who live in the Chicago area, were able to see the video several hours after family members in Selma did. With police shootings making headlines across the nation, the Selma case adds a different layer to the conversation -- not least of all because of the city's historic civil rights significance. Ananias Shaw, 74, was killed last December after he rushed an officer while wielding a hatchet, police have said. It was the Ferguson, Missouri, protests that inspired longtime activist Faya Rose Toure to lead the charge for the Shaw family in Selma, though the circumstances are vastly different from Ferguson. Selma once shocked the national consciousness when police beat and tear-gassed 600 civil rights marchers as they crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge on their way to Montgomery.
