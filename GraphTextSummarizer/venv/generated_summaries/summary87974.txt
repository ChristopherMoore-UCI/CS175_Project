A European court on Monday ruled that radical Muslim cleric Abu Hamza can be extradited from Great Britain to the United States, where he faces a host of terrorism charges. U.S. authorities allege Aswat -- who suffers from schizophrenia, according to court documents, and is now held in Broadmoor Hospital, a high-security psychiatric facility situated 65 kilometers (40 miles) west of London -- was Hamza's co-conspirator. Hamza faces 11 charges in U.S. courts, including conspiracy in connection with a 1998 kidnapping of 16 Westerners in Yemen and conspiring with others to establish an Islamic jihad training camp in rural Oregon in 1999. The court determined, then and now, that the suspects would not get "ill treatment" in super-maximum security prisons if they are extradited to the United States and convicted in American courts, according to the European court's decision Monday. Two men who can now be extradited -- Al-Fawwaz and Bary were among more than 20 people indicted (with late al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden among them) -- are charged in connection with the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.
