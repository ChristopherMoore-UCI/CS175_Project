-- An 87th minute header from beleaguered striker Andy Carroll handed Liverpool a 2-1 victory over Merseyside rivals Everton in the semifinal of the English FA Cup on Saturday. Meanwhile in the English Premier League, Carlos Tevez scored a hat-trick for Manchester City on Saturday in the English Premier League as Manchester City thrashed Norwich City 6-1 at Carrow Road. Carroll's effort compounded a miserable second half for David Moyes' team after a promising opening to the match played at Wembley Stadium. Liverpool perhaps should have been ahead earlier in the half when Andy Carroll missed a gilt-edged chance to equalize but somehow directed his header wide. The win closes the gap on leaders Manchester United to just two points who play Aston Villa at Old Trafford on Sunday.
