The Australian Senate has rejected a bill that would have revived plans to process asylum seekers in offshore detention centers in a highly emotional vote following the sinking of two boats packed with people in one week. The dilemma of what to do with thousands of asylum seekers who attempt the risky trip by boat to Australia each year has long divided the nation's political parties, and its people. During his time in power, Rudd unraveled Howard's policies, including the "Pacific Solution," which involved diverting asylum seekers to detention camps on remote Pacific islands. The Howard policies were slammed by critics as inhumane, however supporters credited them with deterring large numbers of people from boarding boats to Australia. If the bill -- the Migration Legislation Amendment (The Bali Process) Bill 2012 -- had been passed Thursday, it would have allowed Australia to send asylum seekers to Malaysia and the island of Nauru in the South Pacific for processing.
