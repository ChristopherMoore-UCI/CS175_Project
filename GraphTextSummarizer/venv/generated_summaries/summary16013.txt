Zeinat is one of fewer than 30 civilians known to have lived through the entire siege of Homs -- more than two years of constant shelling, sniper fire and starvation. It has been nearly a week since a truce between the Syrian government and rebel groups took effect in Homs, and as opposition fighters have left the Old Town area of the city, thousands of displaced residents have come back. The United Nations says both sides are guilty of keeping supplies from reaching besieged places, but that the government's use of starvation is more widespread. Rebels captured the old town of Homs in 2011. The West accuses the al-Assad regime of using starvation as a weapon in the civil war.
