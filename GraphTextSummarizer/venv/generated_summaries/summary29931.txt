Last week, U.S. President Barack Obama said new airstrikes would aim to help Iraqi forces on the offensive against the Islamist militants. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry courted Middle Eastern leaders over the weekend to join a coalition in the fight against the Islamist militant group, which calls itself the Islamic State. And U.S. Central Command said in a statement that it was the first strike as part of "expanded efforts" to help Iraqi forces on the offensive against ISIS. Monday's airstrike destroyed an ISIS fighting position that had been firing at Iraqi forces, Central Command said. The United States began targeted airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq last month to protect American personnel and support humanitarian missions.
