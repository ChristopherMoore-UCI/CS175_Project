While those eight states retain a high Hispanic population, new opportunities are beckoning people to the West and South, said Mark Hugo Lopez, director of Hispanic Research at Pew. More than half the U.S. Hispanic population resides in three states: California, Texas and Florida, according to the Pew Research Center's Hispanic Trends Project. Those three states, plus New York, Illinois, Arizona, New Jersey and Colorado, contain three-quarters of the nation's Latino population, according to Pew's analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data. "I think this has huge political implications -- it means that more Latinos will be voting, running for office, and being part of the political culture in many more states." Other key findings from Pew: -- New Mexico has the the highest Hispanic population share, among the 50 states and District of Columbia, with 46.7% of the state's population counted as Hispanic.
