Jerome Kerviel -- $6 billion, Societe Generale In January 2008, French trader Kerviel was arrested in Paris and accused of committing massive fraud that cost Societe Generale Bank nearly $6 billion. From foreign currency trading to speculating on futures derivatives, a number of individual rogue traders have destabilized and even caused the collapse of their banks through unauthorized trades in the past twenty years alone. The UBS scandal revealed Thursday is the latest in a long list of unauthorized trades that have cost banks billions of dollars. Nicknamed "Mr. Five Percent" in reference to the amount of the global copper market he was once estimated to control, Hamanaka was accused for years of price-fixing in order to generate exorbitant profits for Sumitomo. 33-year-old Kerviel, who was sentenced to three years in prison last year, insisted he wasn't the only one doing this and that his bosses knew of and condoned his behavior while at the bank.
