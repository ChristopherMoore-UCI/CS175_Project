"If a vet has PTSD, they need to be under surveillance for cardiovascular disease as they age," says Joseph Boscarino, PhD, a senior investigator at Geisinger Center for Health Research, in Danville, Pennsylvania., and an expert on the link between post-traumatic stress and physical illness. A separate analysis involving heart scans from 637 of the veterans found that men and women with PTSD had more calcium buildup in their arteries than vets without post-traumatic stress. Boscarino says that thousands of veterans have contacted him to ask whether they can make disability claims for heart disease and post-traumatic stress to the Veterans Administration. (Health.com)  -- Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) affects more than the mind. Health.com: Surprising heart attack risks Among veterans with similar degrees of calcium buildup, those who had PTSD were 48 percent more likely to die of any cause during the study and 41 percent more likely to die from heart disease compared to those without PTSD, according to the study, which was led by Naser Ahmadi, MD, a cardiologist at the Greater Los Angeles Veterans Administration Medical Center.
