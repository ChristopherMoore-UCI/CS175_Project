The account alleges that the model had "a history of performance problems in icing conditions." However, Desmond Ross, former pilot and principal of DRA Professional Aviation Services, a consultancy for airlines and aviation authorities, says that amongst his peers, ATR planes have a good reputation. "(The ATR 72) is actually a very good aircraft -- it's been around for a while," he says. All involved ATR aircraft. "It appears that it could have had a single-engine flameout, it could have had a dual-engine flameout," former ATR pilot Stephen Frederick told CNN's "The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer. No fewer than 11 incidents resulting in passenger deaths involving  ATR turboprops have been recorded around the world, including TransAsia's recent crashes. I can't speak to them being dangerous." Indeed, the ATR's cost-efficiency has made it a popular choice for airlines, particularly those in the low-cost sector, and on less-popular routes which typically ferry fewer passengers.
