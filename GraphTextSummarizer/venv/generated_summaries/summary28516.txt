With the first shop due to begin trading in the first half of 2013, Paris Gallery CEO Mohamed A. R. Al Fahim says that now is the time to invest in Iraq's domestic market. The IMF estimates that between 2009 and 2012, GDP per-capita based on current prices in Iraq more than doubled, and Paris Gallery is hedging its bets on the growth of a previously stagnant consumer culture and Iraqis with more disposable income. Watts say that Iraq nonetheless has a historic reputation as a good place to do business, the culture of which still remains. Paris Gallery, known across the Gulf for its opulent premises piled high with glass cabinets of designer watches, perfumes, and other mainly European luxury goods, has unveiled plans to open at least five stores across major cities in Iraq -- including Baghdad and Basra -- over the next three years. "Once we've shown everyone that it can be done then I would love nothing more than to see other international firms who specialize in shopping and entertainment, moving in and helping make Iraq a happier place to live."
