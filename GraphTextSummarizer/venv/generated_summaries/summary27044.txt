In January, FIS rolled out a new, three-year scientific study to analyze Alpine racing safety and to make recommendations on how to decrease the number of injuries. Addressing the rash of early-season injuries, Aksel Lund Svindval, the 2009 men's overall World Cup winner, posted the following on his blog in December: "In two weeks of intense World Cup racing in North America, racers have sustained the following ... 7 torn ACLS, 4 knee ligaments, 1 broken arm, 1 broken leg, 1 broken neck, 1 concussion, 1 dislocated knee, 1 dislocated shoulder .. is this OK?" Sure, ski racing has always been a dangerous sport, but with ever-evolving gear and technologies creating faster and faster competitors, the incidence of injuries has spiked. As a part of this initiative, in December FIS convened a panel of six top Alpine competitors, including Didier Cuche, Scott Macartney, and Svindal, to drill down on how to make racing safer. Among Alpine racers, knee injuries are the most common affliction. The International Ski Federation (known as FIS), the World Cup governing body, launched the "Injury Surveillance System" in 2006 to track facts and figures on injury patterns across all disciplines: Nordic, freestyle and Alpine.
