Car makers will want to limit drivers to only using in-car systems while not steering so the vehicle can get their attention when there's an emergency or when they need to take over driving. Eventually, car makers hope to open up the lines of communications between individual cars on the road to better avoid traffic jams and prevent accidents. A recent report to Congress said in-car services that currently collect location data on drivers don't always follow recommenced privacy practices. That technology is even farther off than automated driving, since car manufacturers need to come together to agree on protocols and frequencies. Various laws will have to be updated around the world to make it legal for automated cars to drive on the road.
