" Remarkable turnaround To achieve this, Satha-Sambo works with uneducated women and young people who can't get into university. That was in 2009 and by 2011 Satha-Sambo had set up JARDS Products, a thriving social enterprise focused on producing a wide range of eco-friendly bamboo furniture and baskets -- from beautiful rocking chairs and mirror frames to hand-made dressing tables and storage units. And when she's not training young people, nor running JARDS, nor mentoring budding entrepreneurs -- not to mention raising her family -- Satha-Sambo manages to find time to attend the Malawi Institute of Management. To survive, Satha-Sambo resorted to a skill she'd learned from her mother while growing up: weaving bamboo baskets.
