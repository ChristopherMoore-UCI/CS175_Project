In the months following Bordeaux's disappearance, throngs of police, military members and volunteers scoured the area for Bordeaux. Fayetteville police said more charges might follow. Bordeaux was described as a "very good soldier, not the type of person that would come up AWOL or missing," Fayetteville Police Chief Tom Bergamine said in 2012. The remains were found Wednesday near the I-295 corridor in northern Fayetteville, police said. Bordeaux was assigned to the 601st Area Support Medical Company, 44th Medical Brigade and served as a combat medic, Fort Bragg said in a statement.
