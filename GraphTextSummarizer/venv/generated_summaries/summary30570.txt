It fears Russian President Vladimir Putin may next seek to invade eastern Ukraine, where there are also many ethnic Russians. 'Nothing but propaganda' Russia's Foreign Ministry said Wednesday that Ukraine and the United States have "no reason for concern" about the presence of Russian forces, which it says are on military exercises. The West has strongly condemned Russia for annexing Ukraine's southeastern Crimea region last month, after a referendum held while pro-Russian forces controlled the Black Sea peninsula. Speaking Thursday in the Czech Republic, NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen also pointed the finger at Moscow for "stirring up ethnic tensions in eastern Ukraine and provoking unrest." And he cast doubt on Russia's assertion that the troops it has along Ukraine's eastern border are simply there for military exercises.
