Battery and stalking charges will be dropped now that Capriati, 37, has completed 30 hours of community service and four hours of anger management counseling, the state attorney's office in Palm Beach County, Florida, said. -- Former teen tennis phenom Jennifer Capriati is off the hook after accusations that she stalked and punched an ex-boyfriend last Valentine's Day. But Capriati's star status faded the next few years, a time that included widely reported arrests on shoplifting and marijuana possession charges. "The current facts being circulated by Mr. Brannan are an overexaggeration and the police report is one-sided in (his) favor, since they failed to get Ms. Capriati's side of the story," read a statement attributed to the ex-tennis player's legal representative last year. According to a police report, the ex-boyfriend claimed Capriati started screaming at him before punching him with a closed fist four times in the chest.
