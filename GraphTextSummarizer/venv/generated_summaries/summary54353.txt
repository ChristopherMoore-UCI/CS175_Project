" "At this time we are awaiting additional information from investigators but, can confirm that the couple was not in Florida at the time and, the deceased was not a family member," publicist Michael Caprio said Tuesday. -- A contractor killed himself at a Florida home owned by singer and actor Olivia Newton-John, police said Tuesday. Public records indicate Newton-John's husband, John Easterling, owns the Palm Beach County home and that a sale is pending on the property. Newton-John and her husband were not at the property when the shooting happened, according to a spokesman with Tequesta Fire and Rescue. The cause of death was determined after an autopsy was conducted Tuesday morning, the statement said.
