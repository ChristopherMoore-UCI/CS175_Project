An exact number of released detainees has not been released; ICE characterized it as "several hundred." More likely, Hernandez was one of hundreds of undocumented immigrants released from detention because of looming budget cuts set to take effect Friday absent congressional action. Another congressman, House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul, R-Texas, wrote a letter to ICE Director John Morton demanding accountability. "Detainees with serious criminal histories are a detention priority and have not been released," she said. The move was made because the agency was preparing its year-end budget and had to take budget cuts into consideration, the official said.
