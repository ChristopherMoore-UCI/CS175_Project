Kepler is the pen name of Alexander Ahndoril and Alexandra Coelho Ahndoril, a charming married couple from Sweden. Every new book about Detective Inspector Joona Linna is independent and will have different main characters, but Joona is the main character of the series. CNN: There was a big furor in Sweden to find the real Lars Kepler, so why did you choose a pen name? Ahndorils: Our second Lars Kepler novel was published in Sweden in July 2010, and we're deep into the third, which will come out November 11 in Sweden. CNN: What do you think of the comparisons to Stieg Larsson, and what are your thoughts about the continuing Scandinavian crime fiction craze? Ahndorils: In fact, the name "Lars" in Lars Kepler is an homage to Larsson.
