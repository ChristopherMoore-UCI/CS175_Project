The efforts will be focused on the southern tip of the Dutch Caribbean island, Stein said, with police, firefighters and Dutch troops taking part. In addition, investigators plan to mount another search for 35-year-old Robyn Gardner in the coming days, Solicitor General Taco Stein told CNN. He said Gardner was nowhere to be found when he reached the beach, according to prosecutors. FBI agents have already been involved in the case, searching the Gaithersburg, Maryland, home of the man now being held in connection with Gardner's disappearance. Giordano told authorities that he had been snorkeling with Gardner when he signaled to her to swim back, according to a statement from the prosecutor's office.
