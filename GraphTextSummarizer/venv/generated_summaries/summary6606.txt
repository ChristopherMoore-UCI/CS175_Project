Ebola outbreak: Is it time to test experimental vaccines? Geisbert said that's important, because unlike outbreaks of Ebola in the past, this epidemic is harder to manage "I think it's very different, I mean historically outbreaks have occurred in central Africa and they have been relatively easy to contain," Geisbert said. Geisbert is best known as the man who discovered an airborne strain of Ebola that infects only monkeys. The grant covers three treatments that are thought to be the most promising - i.e. they have shown substantial ability to protect animals against Ebola in a laboratory setting,  Geisbert said. All of these have been able to protect nonhuman primates against Ebola when given after exposure."
