House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Friday that House Democrats will return to their districts with talking points and memos to help them rebut opponents running "a shock and awe campaign ... to perpetuate the status quo." "Facts mean nothing" to insurance industry executives and others opposed to change, she said. The fate of health care reform also remains uncertain in the Senate, where the Finance Committee recently postponed its long-awaited vote on a bipartisan compromise plan until after the August recess. Democrats had hoped the Finance Committee could finish its work before the August break to show progress toward health legislation. The prospects for health care reform in the full House, however, remain unclear. -- A key House committee passed comprehensive health care reform legislation Friday, moving President Obama's domestic priority one step closer to congressional approval.
