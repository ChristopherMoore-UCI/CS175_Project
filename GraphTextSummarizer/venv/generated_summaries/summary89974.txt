A man delivered bombs wrapped as Christmas presents to two banks Wednesday along with a note threatening "mass death" if they did not turn over tens of thousands of dollars, police in Aspen, Colorado, said Thursday. "At this point, we believe Blanning was acting alone," Aspen Assistant Police Chief Bill Linn said Thursday. A surveillance camera photo supplied by Aspen police shows the man identified as James Blanning. "You had better be a very cool individual and not start a panic or many in Aspen will pay a horrible price in blood," said the note, which was released by police. Authorities were quickly alerted, and the man apparently halted his plan, leaving two bombs that were intended for other banks in an alley, police said.
