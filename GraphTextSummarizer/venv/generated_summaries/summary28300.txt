As a result, a mix of international groups like Surgical Eye Expeditions (SEE) and Seeing Without Borders and individual doctors travel to Namibia every year, dedicating their time and expertise to help poor people to restore their sight. " Dr. Helena Ndume, the head of the eye department at Namibia's largest hospital, Windhoek Central, has dedicated her life to help to restore sight in a country where tens of thousands of people are suffering needlessly from a condition that is curable. "In an independent Namibia we need medical doctors, not fashion designers," Ndume remembers being told at the time by Nahas Angula, who is currently Namibia's prime minister. "You can't call yourself a progressive country or nation if you still have people going blind from cataracts today," says Ndume, who also runs eye camps across the southwest African country where she treats those who do not have the means to pay for a simple surgical procedure. So instead of following her fashion dream, Ndume was sent to Germany to become a doctor and in 1989 she returned to a liberated Namibia, keen to practice occupational health.
