Formal charges against Austin Reed Sigg, a high school student who lived about one mile from the 10-year-old and her family, likely will be filed Monday, Jefferson County District Attorney Pam Russell said. As a general policy, CNN does not show the booking photo or name suspects who are juveniles, but in this case, police had mentioned Sigg's name and released his photograph in hopes the public could provide information related to the case. "We hope and pray that this arrest gives them some measure of closure in dealing with this horrible loss and tragedy they have suffered," Westminster Police Chief Lee Birk told reporters. Police said a tip led them to Sigg's home, police said in a news release. That visit allowed police to make an arrest in the Ridgeway case, as well as another case -- an attempted abduction near Ketner Lake.
