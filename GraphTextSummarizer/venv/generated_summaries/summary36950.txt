When personal photo printers first debuted, there was a spike in sales, but slowly the demand dropped. "What we're looking at doing is developing tech that bridges that gap between traditional manufacturing and 3-D printing," Buford said. Buford thinks that if the technology becomes more accessible, creative people will come up with broader applications we haven't thought of yet, and desktop 3-D printer sales could take off. "The market for desktop 3-D printers right now is really makers, professional users and people who have a lot of patience and time," said Jonathan Buford, the entrepreneur behind the $200 MakiBox 3-D printer. Over the next six months, Buford plans to contine rolling out the MaxiBox while also returning to the idea of connecting engineers, inventors and product developers to the sometimes confusing world of manufacturing.
