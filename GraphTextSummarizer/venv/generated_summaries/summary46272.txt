The NAACP argues that the companies gave subprime rates to African-Americans who qualified for better rates and gave better rates to white customers with similar credit histories. " Under subprime lending, people who don't qualify for lower interest rates can borrow money at higher rates. In its statement Friday, the nation's oldest civil rights group said, "One lender has already entered into a preliminary settlement agreement with the NAACP, and a number of other lenders are engaged in similar discussions." The NAACP has launched similar suits against numerous other lenders. NAACP CEO Benjamin Jealous says, "We are not seeking damages; we just want them to fix the problem." "We have targeted these banks because we have gone through what we can get our hands on, and it seems like there's a real problem here," NAACP CEO Benjamin Jealous told CNN.
