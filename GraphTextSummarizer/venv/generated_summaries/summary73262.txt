On Friday, TSA Administrator John Pistole announced he would allow airport screeners to select a union for collective bargaining, or to forgo bargaining. But supporters of collective bargaining powers say that numerous other law enforcement agencies have broad union rights that do not hinder security. As a presidential candidate, Barack Obama promised to support collective bargaining for airport screeners. When Congress created the TSA in 2003, it gave the administrator the authority to decide whether or not screeners should be allowed to engage in collective bargaining. "Collective bargaining does not diminish our security -- it can actually enhance workforce productivity and TSA's mission." Rep. John Mica, R-Florida, called the move "President Obama's biggest give to organized labor."
