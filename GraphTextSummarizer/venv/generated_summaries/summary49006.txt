The stories most likely to jerk the tears of those surveyed by Virgin were "Toy Story 3," "Blind Side" and "Eat Pray Love." While Qantas is warning about sexually explicit material, Virgin Atlantic is giving warnings on a different topic: tears. Orgasms and tears are on the menu for some airplane movie watchers, it seems -- but they arrive with warnings. The first two films to carry the new Virgin Atlantic tear warnings will be "Water for Elephants" and "Just Go With It." Such is the evolution of in-flight entertainment that travelers can now fulfill their own needs on flights.
