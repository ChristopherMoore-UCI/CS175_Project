To the latter point, Minot officials announced a "boil-water order" Saturday afternoon, telling residents to boil tap water for at least a minute before consuming in order to kill any dangerous organisms. This situation prompted the evacuation Saturday of the city's 350 residents as water from the Souris River began to slosh up a main street through town, according to a U.S. Corps of Engineers official. On Saturday afternoon, the National Weather Service reported water levels at that bridge stood at 1,561.62 feet with an expected crest around midnight of 1,561.8 feet. -- A spontaneous burst of applause broke out at a Saturday press conference in Minot, North Dakota, when the city's mayor said the Souris River should crest overnight -- about 12 feet higher than flood stage, but several inches short of what had been feared. Around 6 p.m. Saturday, following a hot and sunny day, residents got a fresh scare when tornado sirens started blaring as a powerful thunderstorm bore down on Minot.
