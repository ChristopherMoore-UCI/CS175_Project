-- A moderately strong earthquake rocked Mexico City on Friday afternoon, shaking the earth in the sprawling capital. The U.S. Geological Survey measured the quake at magnitude 5.7, and placed the epicenter near the city of Puebla, about 85 miles southeast of Mexico City. Earthquakes are a frightening experience for the 20 million residents of Mexico City, where thousands of people perished in a massive quake in 1985. Parts of the city were without electricity Friday afternoon but there were no immediate reports of injuries or damage. People in Mexico City stream into the street as a magnitude 5.7 earthquake hits.
