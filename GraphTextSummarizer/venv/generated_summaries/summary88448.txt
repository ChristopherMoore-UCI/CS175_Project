Norwegian suspect Stig Hansen, a security expert based in Norway and author of the book "Al-Shabaab in Somalia," told CNN that if the Norwegian suspect is who he believes him to be, he lived in a small town in Norway but had connections with a wider group, not all of Somali origin. Al-Shabaab became quite popular among some Somali community groups in Norway from 2007 to 2009, Hansen said, "because they were wrongly seen as some kind of national resistance group." Kenyan counter terrorism sources said Norwegian intelligence services in Kenya were investigating both Ikrima and the Norwegian citizen and have spoken to the latter's sister in Norway. He is believed to be a key link figure between different terrorist groups including al Qaeda and al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, and may have key intelligence on future plots. As for the Norway connection, many people have traveled from Scandinavia to Somalia to join Al-Shabaab, CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank said.
