It would be a very positive irony if this decade of economic depression should prove the era in which science at last broke the clammy grip of psychic depression. Ten thousand people moved to downtown Philadelphia; 15,000 to Los Angeles' once ghostly downtown; 2,000 to downtown Detroit. Big industrial companies such as General Motors and U.S. Steel consolidated their dominance at the expense of weaker rivals. The supermarket was born, as were the passenger aviation industry and the first franchised food company: Dairy Queen. Over the past 20 years since the advent of Prozac, clinicians and researchers have developed a vastly enhanced understanding of depression.
