Thanks to climate change, you'll be more likely to get struck by lightning as the years pass, scientists say. "With warming, thunderstorms become more explosive," says University of California Berkeley climate scientist David Romps. But Romps offers for consideration that lightning strikes also spark half of all wildfires. While working up the long-term predictions, Romps and his colleagues came upon a useful way of predicting the frequency of lightning strikes in the here and now. Then they studied the 11 models on projected global temperature increases to predict how much these two factors should surge in the distant future, resulting in more lightning strikes if carbon dioxide emissions continue on their current path.
