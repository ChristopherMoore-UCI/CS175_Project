Michelle Obama did not need to shout, "I love you, women" in order to be understood by the women of America; her story is their story. Equal pay for equal work should not be a controversial issue in the 21st Century, but like the debate over contraception and choice, somehow the Republican Party has reignited a debate that should have ended decades ago. Drawing upon her own life story, a story of discrimination shared by too many women across America, Lilly Ledbetter delivered a rousing speech as only she can. While women will surely play a crucial role in this election, Tuesday night served as a reminder that Obama's commitment to women is not political -- it's personal. In addition, first lady Michelle Obama reminded Americans that her most important title is still "Mom in Chief."
