Submit a question for scientist Stephen Hawking and we will put the best to him on "The Spirit of Space" in October. The Spirit of Space will air at the following times in October: Thursday 9 October: 1300, 1730 Saturday 11 October: 0700, 1730 Sunday 12 October: 0300, 0730, 1300 We will put the best to him, and air his responses on "The Spirit of Space" in October. It is this drive to get a better grasp on the laws which govern the universe that has informed Hawking's research since the early days when he was a research fellow at Cambridge University in the UK. One of his great achievements since then, together with mathematician Roger Penrose, has been to prove that Einstein's General Theory of Relativity means space and time has a beginning in the "Big Bang" and ends in black holes.
