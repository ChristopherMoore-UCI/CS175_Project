Gov. Jerry Brown issued a directive on Friday telling authorities in "58 California counties that same-sex marriage is now legal in California and that marriage licenses must be issued to same-sex couples immediately." Attorney General Kamala Harris, in fact, performed one of the first such unions -- between Kristin Perry and Sandra Stier, who were one of the couples who sued to stop a voter-approved ban on same-sex marriage from taking effect -- at San Francisco's City Hall. " California's Supreme Court struck down the state's ban on same-sex marriage in May 2008, ruling that the state's constitution gives "this basic civil right to (marry to) all Californians, whether gay or heterosexual, and to same-sex couples as well as to opposite-sex couples." -- Lawyers for groups opposed to same-sex marriage in California petitioned to reverse a federal appeals court order that OK'd the resumption of such unions -- doing so a day after that ruling. Supreme Court cases rest of citizens who sued, made history ProtectMarriage.com and Alliance Defending Freedom say it shouldn't have happened then, at the least. That appeals court Friday lifted a previous injunction on same-sex marriages in California, "effective immediately."
