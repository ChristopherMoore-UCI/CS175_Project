Berlin Wall anniversary -- Twenty years ago this week, the Berlin Wall came tumbling down in a decisive moment in a revolution that ultimately ended decades of Communist rule and signaled the end of the Cold War. Another in New Orleans compared the rising waters from Ida with those of Gustav last year. Two iReporters shared several photos of preparations in Pensacola Beach, Florida, including closed roads, sandbags and high tides, saying it "packed a pretty good punch." For many iReporters, the fall of the wall holds personal significance. We've got all this and more in this week's video wrap-up.
