Retracing Chandra Levy's steps The man accused of her murder, Ingmar Guandique, is a reputed member of the Salvadoran gang Mara Salvatrucha. Police said Condit was never a suspect in the case, although he was questioned intensively as investigators tried to find Levy, who vanished at the end of her federal internship at the U.S. Bureau of Prisons. Guandique denies that he committed the crime, and there is no physical evidence linking him to it, leaving prosecutors to base their case largely on his alleged jailhouse admission that he killed the young intern. The revelation contributed to the political downfall of California Democrat Gary Condit, who now may be called to the witness stand. The judge in the case struck a number of potential jurors this week without further questioning.
