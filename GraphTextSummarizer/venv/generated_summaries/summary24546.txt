Concluding an emotional appearance, he appealed to the jury to put themselves in the shoes of Knox's family -- a counterpoise to the words of appeals court prosecutor Giancarlo Costagliola, who asked the jury to put themselves in the shoes of Kercher's family at the start of the closing arguments a week ago. But prosecutor Manuela Comodi said the evidence is clear, from bloody footprints with particular characteristics that match the two to the very spot where Knox's DNA was found on a kitchen knife believed by investigators to be the murder weapon. -- Amanda Knox and former boyfriend Rafael Sollecito are killers and the evidence proves it, a prosecutor insisted Friday in wrapping up her statement in the duo's appeal of their 2009 murder convictions. Comodi also used her microphone to demonstrate the how the location where Knox's DNA was found on the presumed murder weapon -- at the junction between the blade and the handle -- suggests a stabbing motion, rather than a cutting motion. Knox and Sollecito were convicted of killing Knox's former roommate, Meredith Kercher, in a bloody crime that left the victim half-naked with her throat slashed.
