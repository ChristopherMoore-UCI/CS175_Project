Open fractures are usually the result of a "high-energy" trauma, according to the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons website. -- As awful as Louisville guard Kevin Ware's leg injury appeared during Sunday night's Elite Eight game against Duke, Ware could be back on the court in six months to a year, an orthopedic surgeon says. In a two-hour surgery, his bone was reset and a rod inserted into his tibia, according to a statement from Kenneth Klein, senior associate athletic director for media relations at the University of Louisville. That develops when pressure builds in the muscles surrounding the injury; it's painful and can cause tissue death if the pressure is not relieved, according to the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons website. That's typical procedure for this kind of injury, says orthopedic surgeon Dr. Fred Azar of Memphis, who is not involved in Ware's care.
