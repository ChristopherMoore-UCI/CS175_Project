The new House balance of power currently stands at 244 Republicans, 188 Democrats and three districts undecided: Gifford's seat and Louisiana's fifth and sixth congressional district. Team Barber files suit in uncalled House race The recount procedure in the Arizona is expected to take about two weeks with a final certification -- and presumably a final winner --  determined by Tuesday, December 16. Republicans hoping to secure yet another House victory in their already substantial majority won in the 2014 midterm election are on edge as GOP candidate Martha McSally's lead over incumbent Rep. Ron Barber has dwindled down to a mere 161 votes, a margin small enough to trigger an automatic recount. Barber won his first election with less than 1 percent of the vote in Arizona's second congressional district. But technical difficulties later triggered a recount for early votes in Cochise County -- a predominantly Republican area -- that gave McSally a slightly greater lead.
