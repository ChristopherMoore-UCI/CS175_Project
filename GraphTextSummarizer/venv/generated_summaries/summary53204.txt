Previously, Abuelazam, 34, faced one murder count, five counts of assault with intent to commit murder and one charge of malicious destruction of property -- all related to attacks in Michigan. -- Two additional homicide charges were announced Thursday against a suspected serial stabber who was trying to board an overseas flight when he was arrested, Michigan authorities said. Abuelazam's mother recently flew from Israel to Flint, Michigan, to see her son, and has made several jailhouse visits. Five of the attacks were fatal -- all of those in Genesee County, Michigan, said the county's prosecutor, David Leyton. The new charges stem from separate fatal stabbings of two Michigan men, one 43 and another 60.
