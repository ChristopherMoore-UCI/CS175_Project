She also said, "George Zimmerman got away with murder, but you can't get away from God." Juror to ABC: He 'got away with murder' At the beginning of deliberations, Maddy told ABC, she wanted to convict Zimmerman of second-degree murder. -- George Zimmerman's defense team says people should delve into the "substance" of other comments made by a juror who claimed the man who killed Trayvon Martin "got away with murder." Juror B29 got it right when she said the six Florida jurors had to follow the law, rather than their hearts, Mark O'Mara said in a statement Friday. Juror B29 said the evidence showed that Zimmerman was guilty of killing Martin, 17, in February 2012 at a neighborhood in Sanford, Florida. Last week, the woman known as Juror B37 told CNN's "Anderson Cooper 360" that Zimmerman "didn't do anything unlawful" and was "justified" in shooting 17-year-old Martin last year. O'Mara said that the defense acknowledged Zimmerman killed Martin -- in self-defense.
