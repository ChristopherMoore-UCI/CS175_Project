Christianson said last week there has been "no electronic signature of any kind" from Rodriguez since the boy's abduction, meaning no evidence of cell phone, credit card or debit card use. Juliani's mother, Tabitha Cardenas, said last week that Rodriguez -- with whom she broke up about five months ago and who is the father of her unborn child -- would not purposely drive her son into the water. Stanislaus County Sheriff Adam Christianson said he believes the remains of Jose Esteban Rodriguez, the man accused of abducting the boy, are also in the canal. A witness had reported seeing the 2003 silver Toyota Corolla going into the water January 19 with a man and youngster inside, Christianson said last week. The discovery was made near Santa Nella, about 31 miles south of the area being searched for Juliani, who has been missing since he was taken from his grandmother January 18 in Patterson, Stanislaus Deputy Royjindar Singh told CNN.
