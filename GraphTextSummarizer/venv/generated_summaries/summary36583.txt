But until the United Nations and other international bodies commit serious financial resources to help developing nations tackle obesity, diabetes and other noncommunicable diseases, until governments overcome their political perceptions and until civil society mobilizes and pressures governments for a response, high-end U.N. meetings will only succeed in doing what they do best: writing reports, venting complaints and pointing fingers. The U.N.'s International Diabetes Federation recently stated that most bilateral and multilateral funding does not provide funding for obesity, diabetes and other related noncommunicable diseases, while only 0.9% of the $22 billion spent on international health is provided for these diseases. What's more, the assembly's draft resolution does not make the need to raise funding for obesity, diabetes and other noncommunicable diseases a priority. The first simply has to do with the availability of international funding for obesity and diabetes, especially when compared with HIV/AIDS. International financial support for obesity and diabetes has been minimal at best.
