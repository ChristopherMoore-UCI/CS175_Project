Square, a mobile app and phone attachment created by one of the founders of Twitter, is gaining traction as a tool for small businesses to accept credit-card payments and this month signed a deal with Starbucks for the coffee behemoth to begin accepting payments through the app. In addition to the McDonald's deal, PayPal has signed up with such retailers as Home Depot. The app will also give users exclusive coupons and deals. And Google Wallet aims to be no less than a single tool that turns your phone into your wallet, driver's license and house key. Customers at 30 locations in France are now able to order their meals using the McDonald's mobile app, pay for it via PayPal, then join a separate line to pick up their food, according to a Reuters report.
