After one year of treatment, people taking TNF inhibitors had no higher risk of serious infections than those taking other types of drugs. Previous studies have found that TNF inhibitors as much as double the risk of serious infection compared with other treatment options. "Up until now there has been considerable evidence that anti-TNFs heightened the risk of serious infection compared to other treatments. The research, which was funded by the Food and Drug Administration and other federal health agencies, contradicts numerous earlier studies that did find an increased risk of infection associated with the drugs, known as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors. This class of drugs drastically improved the treatment of these conditions when first introduced in the late 1990s, but because they suppress the immune system they are believed to open the door to opportunistic infections.
