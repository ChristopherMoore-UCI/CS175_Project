Doctors Without Borders has been working at Mbera camp since February 2012, when the first groups of refugees from Mali began to arrive. The majority of the refugees in Mbera camp are pastoralists who lived nomadic or semi-nomadic lifestyles in northern Mali, according to the report. Even before the latest influx of refugees, the nutritional situation was critical, with a study by Doctors Without Borders in November revealing mortality rates above the emergency threshold for children under 2 years old. , Doctors Without Borders said, "the challenge will be to continue to provide assistance that meets humanitarian standards." Water is still in short supply in the desert camp, a situation made worse by daytime temperatures that reach 50 degrees Celsius (122 degrees Fahrenheit). Islamist extremists carved out a large haven in northern Mali last year, taking advantage of a chaotic situation after a military coup by the separatist party MNLA.
