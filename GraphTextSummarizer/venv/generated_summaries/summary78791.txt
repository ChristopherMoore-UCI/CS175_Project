-- A Federal Trade Commission official announced that Twitter users will be able block personal data from being shared with third-party websites. "Twitter's use of 'Do Not Track' in its new feature is good news for Twitter users and a meaningful step toward broader adoption of a strong 'Do Not Track' system that will give consumers simple, comprehensive control over online tracking," said FTC Chairman Jon Leibowitz. "Do Not Track" allows users to block third-party cookies, which are used to piece together Internet users' personal information and online activity. Other top web browsers, including Apple's Safari and Microsoft's Internet Explorer, have similar features. According to Mozilla, around 9% of Firefox users opt in to "Do Not Track."
