-- India are poised to build a handy first-innings lead over South Africa after Virender Sehwag and Sachin Tendulkar scored centuries on the second day of the second cricket Test in Kolkata. South Africa had resumed on 266-9 after a late collapse on Sunday, and tailenders Morne Morkel and Wayne Parnell added another 30 runs for a final-wicket stand of 35. India reached lunch at 97-2 and Sehwag raced to three figures in only 87 balls for his 19th Test century as the duo batted through the middle session, going to tea at 232-2. He and Gautam Gambhir put on 73 for the first wicket in just 9.2 overs before the latter was run out for 25, then paceman Morne Morkel had Murali Vijay caught behind by stand-in wicketkeeper A.B. The veteran Tendulkar extended his world record of Test tons to 47 as he took on the junior role, facing 206 deliveries for his 106.
