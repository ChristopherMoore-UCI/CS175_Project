A post on a website used by al Qaeda in Iraq claimed responsibility for the Jordan attacks. Jordanian authorities at the time said the attacks were orchestrated by the terrorist group al Qaeda in Iraq, which was led by Jordanian-born Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. Sajida al-Rishawi was sentenced to death for that attempt, and Jordan executed her early Wednesday. In a televised confession in November 2005, al-Rishawi calmly recounted how she tried to take part in a string of terror attacks at Jordanian hotels that month that killed at least 57 people. ISIS started in 2004 as al Qaeda in Iraq with the aim of creating an Islamic state across Sunni areas of Iraq and in Syria.
