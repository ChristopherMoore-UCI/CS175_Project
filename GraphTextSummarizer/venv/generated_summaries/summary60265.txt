The immigrants rejected by Murrieta protesters were initially held in Texas, where U.S. facilities are overflowing, forcing detainees to be sent to other states for processing. Protests and tension Many never show up and join the undocumented population, according to the National Border Patrol Council, the union representing Border Patrol agents. " Long said earlier this week that his city "continues to object to the transfer of illegal immigrants to the local Border Patrol office." A surge of undocumented Central American immigrants has created a federal crisis, and some of them are supposed to be processed in Murrieta. " Murrieta's concerns and compassion Residents object to how U.S. agents may "dump" the Central American immigrants into their community once their processing is completed, a practice that was true in the past, said Murrieta Mayor Alan Long.
