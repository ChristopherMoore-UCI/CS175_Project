To start, searches of cell phones have the potential to be far more invasive than the searches in Navarette and King. Scalia wrote that such stops were not the constitutional framers' concept of a "people secure from unreasonable searches and seizures." This seemingly idiosyncratic lineup is a developing bloc in Fourth Amendment cases, and it's one to keep any eye on as the court hears two even bigger such cases Tuesday. The court hasn't before confronted the question at issue in Riley and Wurie -- cell phone searches. Even the search in King -- a light swabbing of the cheek -- while more physically invasive, does not reveal all of a person's most private communications and the intimate details of one's life the way searches of a smart phone can.
