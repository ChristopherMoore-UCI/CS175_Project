A day earlier, Syrian forces dropped barrel bombs on an opposition-held area of Aleppo, killing 25 children, according to the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria. The unrest comes amid Syria's three-year civil war pitting government forces against rebels trying to end the rule of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. -- Syrian military airstrikes hit parts of the country's largest city Thursday, killing at least 33 people and injuring several others, the UK-based opposition group Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The airstrikes were the latest in a string of attacks reported in Aleppo, the northwest Syrian city that has been a hotly contested area in Syria's civil war. The government intends to hold elections June 3.
