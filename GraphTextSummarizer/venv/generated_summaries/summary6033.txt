Earlier this year, Nintendo president Satoru Iwata said, ''I have doubts whether people will be wearing glasses to play games at home. Nintendo announced Tuesday it will introduce a handheld console that plays games in 3-D without the use of special glasses. Gaming blogs were buzzing Tuesday with speculation about how Nintendo will achieve the 3-D affect without specialized glasses. The handheld device will be called the 3DS, succeeding Nintendo's DS series of portable gaming consoles. Nintendo said it will announce more details at the E3 trade show, to be held June 15-17 in Los Angeles, California.
