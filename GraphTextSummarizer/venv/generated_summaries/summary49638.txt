The governor said he would be traveling next week to Washington to meet with outgoing Energy Secretary Steven Chu, who called Inslee on Friday morning with news of a leaking single-shell tank. -- A tank storing radioactive waste at the Hanford Nuclear Reservation in southeast Washington is leaking liquids to the tune of 150 to 300 gallons per year, the governor said Friday. "This is an extremely toxic substance, and we have to have a zero-tolerance policy for leaks of radioactive material into the ground and potentially groundwater of the state of Washington," Gov. Jay Inslee said. "At the same time that I am making clear that this is a long-term, very significant concern of the state of Washington; it is not a short-term concern," he said. The leaking tank is believed to be the first to lose liquids since 2005.
