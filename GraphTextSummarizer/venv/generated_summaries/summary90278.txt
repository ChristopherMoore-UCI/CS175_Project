In 2010, safety expert Lawrence Muscarella published an article in the journal Endoscopy calling for special attention to the elevator wire, and in 2011, a consortium of medical societies warned that automatic cleaning processes didn't always effectively disinfect duodenoscopes and so manual cleaning should be performed. Dr. John Allen, a gastroenterologist, had to morph into a detective when 10 of his patients came down with the exact same type of rare bacterial infection. Over the years, the FDA also received dozens of reports about infections from duodenoscopes. According to FDA spokewoman Leslie Wooldridge, this is the first time the FDA communicated such advice for duodenoscopes. "I want to know what the FDA knew and when did they know it." Understanding CRE, the 'nightmare' superbug Dr. William Maisel, deputy director of science and chief scientist at the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health, said it wasn't until 2013 that there was "convincing evidence" that duodenoscopes could harbor antibiotic-resistant infections even when the manufacturer's cleaning instructions were followed properly, and the agency issued the advisory last week after doing research "so we felt we understood the issue sufficiently."
