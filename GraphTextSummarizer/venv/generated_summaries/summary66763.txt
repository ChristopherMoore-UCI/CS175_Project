-- Saudi Arabia named Prince Salman bin Abdulaziz to be crown prince Monday, the state news agency reported, putting him next in line to the throne of the oil-rich kingdom. Nayef, a hard-line conservative credited with pushing back al Qaeda, was interior minister as well as crown prince. His appointment comes a day after burial services for Crown Prince Nayef bin Abdulaziz, whose death was announced Saturday. In recent years, his son, Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, led the kingdom's fight against al Qaeda as the elder Nayef seemed to have taken more of a back seat. We all knew his health was frail, but his death is a shock," Saudi Foreign Ministry spokesman Osama Nogali said.
