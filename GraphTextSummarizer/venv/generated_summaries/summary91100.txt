Grand juries chose not to indict officers in those cases, just as they decided not to indict police involved in Crawford's death in Beavercreek. John Crawford III was black, and his family's lawyers Tuesday mentioned Eric Garner, Tamir Rice and Michael Brown as they announced the suit -- evoking cases that have stirred international outrage because the three also were black and killed by police officers. The family of a man who picked up a BB gun for sale at an Ohio Walmart and was shot dead by police has filed a federal lawsuit, claiming that the corporation and police are responsible for his death. "We believe that had Mr. Crawford been white, he may have gotten a little bit more time to respond to the police officers," he said. "As a result, Mr. Crawford was shot before he even had time to react to the officer's presence, much less to comply with any verbal commands Defendants Williams or Darkow may have made."
