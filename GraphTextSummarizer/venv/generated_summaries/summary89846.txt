Then as a special treat for April Fools' Day, Reynolds was "interviewed" by "Extra" host Mario Lopez, about the debate over whether the movie should be rated PG-13 or R. The ultraviolent Deadpool would seem to lend himself to an R rating, but Reynolds settled all that in memorable fashion, "killing" Lopez in the process. Ryan Reynolds gave us a sneak peek at his new costume last week, and followed it up with a first look on video. Reynolds played Deadpool in 2009's "X-Men Origins: Wolverine," but he never wore the famous red and black attire. In response to skepticism online who was beneath the mask, screenwriter Rhett Reese confirmed via Twitter that Reynolds was indeed in the suit.
