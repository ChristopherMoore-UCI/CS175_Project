The win takes Malaga -- who have been banned from playing in UEFA club competitions next season after falling foul of the European governing body's Financial Fair Play regulations -- to within two points of third-placed Madrid. Real Madrid crashed to their fourth league defeat of the season at Malaga. The home side halved the deficit in the 89th minute when Javi Guerra scored before Cristian Tello added a third for Barcelona in injury time. But two goals in three minutes from substitute Roque Santa Cruz consigned Madrid to defeat. -- Lionel Messi scored his 91st and final goal of 2012 on Saturday as Barcelona enjoyed a comfortable 3-1 win over Real Valladolid at the Estadio Jose Zorrilla.
