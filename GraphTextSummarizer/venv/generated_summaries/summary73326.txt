In response to the current wave of suicides, Cornell will "strengthen the capacity of the community to know what to do," Marchell said. -- Two suspected cases of suicide on the Cornell University campus have officially been confirmed by the Tompkins County chief medical examiner, bringing the total number of suicides for the academic year to six. The national average for school suicides is 7.29 per year for every 100,000 students, said Paula Clayton, medical director of the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. The cause of the wave of suicides is unclear, Marchell said. Cornell responded to a cluster of suicides in the late 1990s with comprehensive training for members of the university community.
