In other words, I have no idea what the different "cases" are in Russian, even though I understand that endings of words change in different constructions. -- Whether I was squeezing myself into a crowded subway car or admiring the fall leaves around at Tsaritsino Park, I was constantly learning new Russian words during my two-week study trip to Moscow last October. In the two months since I started the beginning Russian levels, I've been exposed to a variety of everyday vocabulary words through pictures and constant audio reinforcement. This seems like a good supplement for language learning but not ideal on its own, especially since there's no speaking or writing practice. For $7.99, you get flash cards with audio and pictures, and I feel that both elements are essential for my own learning of new words.
