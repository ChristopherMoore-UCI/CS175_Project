They agreed to use "all necessary means, in particular, military means" to enforce a United Nations resolution authorizing the use of force against Libya, Sarkozy said. The warning, announced by French President Nicolas Sarkozy at the end of a last-minute meeting in Paris, came as Sarkozy revealed French fighter jets were already flying over rebel-held areas of Libya to protect the population. -- U.S., European and Arab leaders delivered a strong warning to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi on Saturday, saying he must stop attacking his own people or else face international military action. "If there is not an immediate cease-fire and withdrawal of the forces that have been attacking civilian populations in the last few weeks, our countries will have recourse to military means," Sarkozy said, adding that all participants at the meeting endorsed the warning. As they met, participants were "aware of the news reports" coming out of Libya that show Libyan government forces moving toward Benghazi, a senior U.S. State Department official told reporters.
