Because powdered infant formulas are not commercially sterile, the FDA recommends the following steps to reduce infection in newborn babies: -- Prepare only a small amount of reconstituted formula for each feeding so as to reduce the amount of time the formula is held at room temperature. The World Health Organization has guidelines for the safe preparation and handling of powdered infant formula, which include washing hands with soap and water, thoroughly sterilizing all feeding equipment in hot, soapy water, and preparing enough formula for only one feeding at a time. Because of a growing number of Cronobacter infections among newborns, however, there is compelling evidence that milk-based powdered infant formulas are the source of infection, Missouri health authorities said. The FDA has collected samples of powdered formula, both opened and unopened, from the home of the deceased infant and the Walmart store, located in Lebanon, Missouri, FDA spokeswoman Siobhan DeLancey said. -- Do not hold reconstituted formula for longer than two hours without refrigeration.
