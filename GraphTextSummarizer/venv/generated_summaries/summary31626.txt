U.S. veterans are dying because of delays in diagnosis and treatment at VA hospitals. As CNN has previously reported,  as many as 7,000 veterans were on a backlog list -- waiting too long for colonscopies or endoscopies -- at VA facilities in Columbia, South Carolina and Augusta, Georgia. For a year the Army veteran went to several VA clinics and hospitals in South Carolina, trying to get help. At least 19 veterans have died because of delays in simple medical screenings like colonoscopies or endoscopies, at various VA hospitals or clinics, CNN has learned. Congress demands answers on VA deaths "The problem was getting worse and I was having more pain," Coates said, talking about one specific VA doctor who he saw every few months.
