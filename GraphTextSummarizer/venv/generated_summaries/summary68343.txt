Moreover, such notables as Ellen DeGeneres and mogul Richard Branson have announced they won't patronize the hotel or other properties in the Dorchester Collection of luxury hotels, which owns and manages the Beverly Hills Hotel and the Hotel Bel-Air. At a briefing Monday, State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said, "We have very serious concerns." -- The Beverly Hills Hotel has been a haven for Hollywood's elite since 1912 -- two years before the City of Beverly Hills was even created. The City of Beverly Hills is also making its opinion known. "We, the IWMF, can no longer hold an event at a venue whose owner stands for the violation of the very human rights we fight for," Elisa Lees Munoz, executive director of the IWMF, said in a statement.
