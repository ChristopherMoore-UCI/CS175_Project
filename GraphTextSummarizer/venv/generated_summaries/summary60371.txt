The death of Dawn Brancheau was an occasion of almost unbearable sadness for those closest to Dawn -- her family, friends and colleagues at SeaWorld. The tragedy of Dawn's death cannot and has not been ignored, but neither should the literally millions of safe interactions we have had with killer whales over that span of time. But anyone approaching this subject in good faith must recognize a simple fact: Our staff has interacted with killer whales -- for veterinary care, training, shows, educational presentations, husbandry, exercise, play and enrichment -- hundreds of times a day for nearly 50 years. Not a single interview with a guest who was inspired and enriched by their experience with killer whales at SeaWorld. I was honored to know Dawn and count myself among those SeaWorld team members deeply affected by her loss.
