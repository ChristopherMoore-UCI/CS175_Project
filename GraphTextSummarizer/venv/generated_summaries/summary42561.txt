In 1968, one of the front-runners for the Republican nomination was Romney's father, Gov. George Romney of Michigan, former CEO of American Motors. Right now, many Republicans reluctantly see Mitt Romney as the best possible option for the party. Upon giving Romney his endorsement, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, another part of the new generation of Republicans from the region, said: "The Northeast Republicans are sticking together in this case." Ironically, Romney, the candidate who seems to generate the least excitement among Republican voters -- the candidate by default -- potentially could have the most far-reaching impact on the character of the GOP. Whether GOP voters have the confidence to take a risk on a candidate who provides a different perspective than Southern and Western Republicans remains to be seen.
