After all, tax simplification is both needed and polls well, and the flat tax promises a simpler approach to paying taxes. Making ideological peace with the idea of broadening the tax base could also help some conservatives move from anti-tax absolutism to a broader conversation about tax reform that could help get crippling long-term budget imbalances under control. The fact that the flat tax has been backed by a prominent presidential candidate will help shape the national debate and perhaps provide some urgency to the idea of tax reform. Even if Perry's plan is only a base-pleasing opening bid in a larger round of tax reform, it is a step in the right direction. And while more Americans would pay taxes under this plan, by broadening the base, we would stop the potentially destabilizing dynamic under which nearly half of Americans don't pay federal income taxes.
