" A change in mentality It is a story that began at Euro 2008 -- and really, truly began with Spain's quarterfinal penalty shootout victory over Italy in Vienna, a match that defender Gerard Pique looks back on as the turning point. If Italy were besieged by the storm of another match-fixing scandal in their domestic game brewing prior to Euro 2012, Pirlo provided the steady hand on the tiller to sail the ship into calmer waters. Balotelli double sends Italy through to Euro 2012 final Balotelli went into Euro 2012 considered a talented liability, as capable of moments of madness as those of brilliance, but he powered home a header to give Italy the lead and then crashed a stunning second into the top corner from 18 yards. Sunday's showpiece European Championship final in the Ukrainian capital Kiev pits holders Spain against Italy, between them the winners of the last two World Cups. The master and the maverick When looking long, Pirlo has often sought out Mario Balotelli, the maverick Manchester City striker who is as well-known for his controversial lifestyle away from football as his performances on the pitch -- something which may change after his monumental two-goal showing against the much-fancied Germans in the semifinal.
