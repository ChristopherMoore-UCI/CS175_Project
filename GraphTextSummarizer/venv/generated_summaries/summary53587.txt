A Harris Interactive poll (no relation to John Harris) found 87 percent of Americans want to know more about their family background. Harris, 62, a sales executive and consultant from Atlanta, Georgia, had always hoped to learn more about his family, including his father, John Henry Harris, whom he said was murdered by another man when he was 5 years old. "Researching family history is not hard, but it takes work being a detective," said Harris. Harris is one of millions of Americans interested in learning and researching details about family origins.
