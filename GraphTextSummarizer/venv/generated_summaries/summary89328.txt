Two days after Fulton's applications were filed, Los Angeles musician Marcus Singletary applied for a trademark for "Justice for Trayvon" hooded sweatshirts. Applying for trademarks will not provide immediate legal protection for the family, according to trademark lawyers, because the applications usually take a year or more to process. Evolution of the hoodie "In my opinion, Trayvon's parents were correct when they cited the lack of civility by some popular media figures who have chosen to find significance in dissecting a teenager's wardrobe as a somehow 'factual' explanation for the child's untimely (and, apparently, permissible) death by firearm," Singletary wrote to CNN in an e-mail. Fulton's trademark applications covered digital media, CDs and DVDs featuring Trayvon Martin. The goal of the foundation, she said, will be to help other families who are going through similar situations.
