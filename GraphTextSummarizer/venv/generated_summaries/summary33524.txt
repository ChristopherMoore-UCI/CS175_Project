Save the Elephants, which focuses on helping elephant populations worldwide, said it has partnered with a foundation and the Mali government in its fundraising appeal. Reaching desperately for drops of water, they had lowered their trunks, toppled in, remained trapped and died in Mali's scorching heat. A baby elephant in the Gourma region of central Mali had been trapped in a well for three days. The World Food Programme says the majority of infant deaths in Mali are due to malnutrition. But they're south of Timbuktu, Wall told CNN in a phone interview from Bamako, Mali.
