-- Bangladesh on Monday entered the second day of a strike amid clashes between protesters and security forces that have killed dozens of people after an Islamist party leader was sentenced to death last week for war crimes. But the court's decision February 5 to sentence Abdul Quader Mollah, Jamaat's assistant secretary general, to life imprisonment rather than death set off a different type of demonstration. Hundreds of thousands of demonstrators, led by youths and fueled by social media, gathered at an intersection in Dhaka, saying the sentence was too mild and demanding the death penalty for those convicted of war crimes. "The leadership of Jamaat should immediately issue public statements to its followers to stop these violent, unacceptable attacks against law enforcement officers and those who support the verdicts of the war crimes trials," Brad Adams, Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement Friday. The violence, which has shaken the South Asian country in recent days, left 21 people dead Sunday, authorities said, after supporters of the Islamist party Jamaat-e-Islami attacked police stations and government offices.
