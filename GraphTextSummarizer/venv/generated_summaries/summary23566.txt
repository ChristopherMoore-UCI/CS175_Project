"Some 13 years ago the Belgian Football Federation decided to reorganize Belgian football programs and set up in every province an elite academy," leading Belgium youth football coach Michel Bruyninckx, who has long been interested in maximizing the way players use their brain in games as part of his innovative training sessions, told CNN in a recent interview. While the Belgium players remain united, the team will often arrange separate interviews for Flemish and French speakers. And with its place at the 2014 World Cup finals almost secure, midfielder Mousa Dembele believes Belgium's multicultural array of stars can follow in the footsteps of France's 1998 winning team. But the divisions stop there -- on the pitch these players have come together to give Belgian football its most exciting generation of players since the team reached the 1986 World Cup semifinal. Like Les Bleus -- a team which included players of African and Caribbean heritage -- Belgium's class of 2013 has a cosmopolitan feel.
