After leading losing fights to use Chinese standards in 3G technology and wireless mobile standards, China is trying to get out front early on IoT. "In technology China has come from a position of follower, adopting foreign standards on which it has to pay royalties," said Mark Natkin, director of Marbridge, a technology consulting firm in Beijing. The larger goal of China's focus in IoT, analysts say, is to win a fight Beijing has long been losing -- setting international standards for new technology. "But I think the third thing is China has matured to a point where it is no longer a low cost center of labor ... in cutting edge businesses, it wants to really develop its own brand and its own next generation of technology, to walk into the fight with your own swords by investing in the next Google, the next Apple," Law said. "The biggest game changer of the past 25 years has been the Internet," said Law, whose Cybertecture Mirror is an offshoot of his Hong Kong architectural firm's focus on integrating technology in design. Since Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao identified IoT as an "emerging strategic industry" in an interview on state media, Beijing has focused on developing technology by which devices can communicate via infrared sensor, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and other Machine-to-Machine (M2M) technology.
