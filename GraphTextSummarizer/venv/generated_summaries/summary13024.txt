Police also said they found Pakistani Taliban literature and maps of the parliament building and the houses of the president and prime minister. -- Three Pakistani men linked to Faisal Shahzad, the 30-year-old Pakistani-American who has pleaded guilty to the botched Times Square terror attack, were arrested and have confessed before a judge, authorities said Wednesday. According to their confessions, they took Shahzad to northwest Pakistan to meet with the Taliban leadership and to take part in training at least four or five times, Yamin said. Shahzad is accused of attempting to set off a vehicle bomb in Times Square on May 1. This was not the first time that Shoaib Mughal, Humbal Akhtar and Muahammed Shahid have been the targets of Pakistani police operations.
