-- Grammy-winning singer Angelique Kidjo joined human rights activists to demand courts martial for troops who publicly gang raped women in the streets of the West African country of Guinea last month. It's part of a strong message against rape that Kidjo, a UNICEF goodwill ambassador, and activist Leymah Gbowee are spreading to the women of Africa, the governments of Africa and the rest of the world. " Women have power but must learn to use it, said Kidjo, who provided music for the documentary. "The thing is, we women of Africa, we have the power," she said. Moussa Dadis Camara, who seized power in a bloodless coup in December, said last month that most of the people who died were crushed in the rally.
