On the TV show, Burton became a trusted friend to children, parents and educators, recommending a variety of books and taking viewers on book-related field trips. "I wanted to put in the hands of kids a library of books and videos, like the TV show did, all in the service of inspiring a love of literature and exploring the world -- connecting the real world to the literature that kids are reading," said Burton, who received the Impact Award for his efforts to instill "a lifelong love of reading in children" during Children's Book Week this month. In the app incarnation of "Reading Rainbow," children navigate the app in a virtual hot air balloon, traveling to themed islands and discovering books they might like to read. Just as Burton's mother nurtured his interest in reading, parents and children can bond through books, whether on paper or tablets. "Reading Rainbow" will continue to share a variety of books, just as he did on the show, he said.
