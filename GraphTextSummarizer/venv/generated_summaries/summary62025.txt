The charges against Coleman, who has no history of sexual crimes, include kidnapping, aggravated assault, criminal sexual conduct, armed robbery and felony with a firearm, according to Jerry Dorsey IV, with the Wayne County prosecutor's office. Raynard Coleman, 31, was taken into custody without incident last Wednesday, after DNA evidence tied him to six of seven assaults that have taken place in the city since January 1, Chief Ralph Godbee said. Detroit police set up a 24-hour operational command post, which was manned by a specialized joint task force, to receive tips about the attacks, Godbee said. -- Detroit police have arrested a man suspected to be the rapist who "terrorized" women on the city's Northeast side, the police chief said Monday. Without their descriptions, he said, police would not have been able to release a composite sketch to the public.
