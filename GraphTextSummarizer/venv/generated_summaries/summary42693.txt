"Clearly, if you can't use American security contractors, then you will have to use other contractors," such as those from Jordan, the Gulf region or Iraq, he said. The Iraqi government has criticized the blanket immunity because of the actions of security contractors, such as the September shootings in Baghdad of Iraqi citizens that involved Blackwater contractors. He said security contractors are the main target, but he said non-security contractors also would be subject to Iraqi law if immunity is revoked. An American contractor said Thursday that the U.S. mission in Iraq will be undermined if the Iraqi government succeeds in revoking blanket legal immunity for American security contractors. Carter Andress reacted to a Wednesday government report that said the removal of legal immunity for American private security contractors could set off an "exodus" from war-ravaged Iraq and "impose significant limitations" on American reconstruction efforts.
