But it gets us thinking: If comic books (and comic-book movies) teach us anything, it's that when some characters appear to die -- we're looking at you, Superman, Captain America, S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Phil Coulson -- appearances can be deceiving. Using two cell phones, she whips up a remote detonator, blows up the house from a safe distance and escapes with Charlie and Jesse -- who discovers he has a thing for older women. Despite collapsing at the end of the "Breaking Bad" finale, everyone's favorite meth kingpin could still be alive -- or so star Bryan Cranston teasingly implied to CNN's Ashleigh Banfield on Thursday. What really happened next: He was just passed out, and after struggling with cancer in prison volunteers for experimental drug therapy in exchange for clemency. "Burn Notice" How you think it ended: Maddie (Sharon Gless) tells her secret-agent son Michael that she needs to blow up her house to take out some gunmen and give her grandson Charlie and his protector Jesse a chance to escape.
