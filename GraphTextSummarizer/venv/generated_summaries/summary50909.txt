Despite the letdown of learning Victoria is not his biological daughter, Cohen says he enjoyed introducing her as his daughter at Washington events, like the White House Christmas party. " That's how Rep. Steve Cohen, D-Tennessee, described his reaction upon finding out the woman he though was his long lost daughter, really wasn't. Cohen, 64, announced that aspiring model Victoria Brink was actually his daughter, something he learned from her mother, an old girlfriend he had recently contacted. But during the process, Victoria and the man she'd always thought was her father, wanted to do paternity tests to be sure. Cohen said he only took a DNA test because Victoria wanted it.
