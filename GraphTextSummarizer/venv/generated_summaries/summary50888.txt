A few hours after the Los Angeles Dodgers and the San Francisco Giants played at AT&T Park in San Francisco on Wednesday night, a man wearing Dodgers gear was stabbed and killed in a fight. The club held a moment of silence for Denver before a Thursday night game, and police bulked up security. "The fact that anybody got into any sort of beef over the Giants and the Dodgers and somebody lost their life," San Francisco Police Chief Greg Suhr said. Michael Montgomery, 21, of Lodi, California, has been charged with one count of homicide, San Francisco police said Thursday. -- An arrest has been made in the stabbing death of a man who was apparently killed in an argument stemming from a long and intense West Coast baseball rivalry.
