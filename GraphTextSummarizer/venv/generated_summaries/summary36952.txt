Strong attendance numbers at its flagship locations in Orlando, Florida, San Diego, California and San Antonio, Texas, among others, helped boost the marine park's gains, despite criticism sparked by a recent documentary that raised questions about killer whales in captivity. In a news release, the company noted SeaWorld's animal rehabilitation program has rescued more than 23,000 animals as of late last year. Propelled by fourth-quarter attendance, SeaWorld expects an estimated $1.46 billion in revenue for fiscal year 2013, the company announced Monday. Since then, at least nine musical acts, including Trace Adkins, Willie Nelson, Trisha Yearwood, Heart, Cheap Trick and Barenaked Ladies, have canceled planned concert appearances at the park while other artists, such as Joan Jett and Edgar Winter, have asked that their music no longer be used in shows featuring the sound-sensitive orcas. But as strong as last year was for us, we are looking forward to another great year in 2014."
