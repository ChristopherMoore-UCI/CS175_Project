Officer Cleon Joseph of the Los Angeles police said reporters have asked detectives whether Medellin's killing was linked in any way to Luka Rocco Magnotta, 29, suspected of killing Chinese student Jun Lin in Montreal. On Friday, Concordia University, where Lin was studying, announced the Jun Lin Family Fund, which will absorb funds from the Lin Jun Rest in Peace Foundation announced by the Chinese consulate in Montreal a day earlier, university spokeswoman Christine Mota said. The Jun Lin Family Fund will provide financial assistance to the Lin family, and the school is also creating the Jun Lin Award to benefit Chinese students studying at the university after the family said they wanted something good to come out of Lin's killing, Mota said. Police say they believe Magnotta sent Lin's body parts by mail to political party headquarters in Ottawa and two schools in Vancouver, British Columbia. Montreal police told the Toronto Sun newspaper that Magnotta may have been in Los Angeles at the time of Medellin's killing.
