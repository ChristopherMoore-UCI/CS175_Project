The judge made it clear Monday that Siracusa will be Gristina's public defender and criminal attorney, while Gleason would represent her in other matters. Judge Juan Merchan will weigh the proposal made by the attorney, Peter Gleason, which would mandate that Anna Gristina be confined to Gleason's apartment and have to wear an electronic ankle bracelet. Gleason complained that Siracusa had not visited Gristina at New York's well-known Rikers Island jail complex, while Gleason countered that he'd visited their mutual client "seven or eight times." That same day, a Morgan Stanley broker was placed on administrative leave pending the results of the investigation into Gristina, according to company spokesman Mark Lake. The judge ruled Monday that, given her financial situation as portrayed by Gleason, Gristina can continue to have a public defender.
