-- Virginia GOP Rep. Randy Forbes on Wednesday became the first member of Congress to call for U.S. Secret Service Director Mark Sullivan to step down due to a prostitution scandal involving eleven agents that has raised questions about security at the agency. But House Armed Services Committee Chairman Buck McKeon, R-California, disagreed with Forbes, telling reporters he didn't think the head of the agency should be held responsible. Eleven Secret Service agents are allegedly involved in the scandal, along with several members of the U.S. military. One of the women, a source said, became involved in a dispute with Secret Service personnel about how much she was to be paid. Like Forbes, McKeon believes that the Pentagon is "very capable" of doing its own probe of members of the military who may be involved.
