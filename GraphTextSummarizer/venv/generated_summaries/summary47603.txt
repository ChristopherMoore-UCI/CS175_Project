Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge James Brandlin sentenced Brown to serve 365 days in jail for the admitted probation violation, and the singer was given credit for serving 234 days because of the rehab and jail time. The case against Brown in Washington, in which he and his bodyguard Christopher Hollosy were accused of beating a man who tried to take a photo of Brown last October, is still pending. In May, Brown admitted to violating his probation for his arrest last year for an alleged assault in Washington. The troubled singer was released from a Los Angeles County jail just after midnight Monday, a Los Angeles Sheriff's Department representative confirmed to CNN. Brown has been charged with misdemeanor assault.
