" "We've repeatedly said that Bahraini authorities should never have used military courts to prosecute ordinary civilians, including doctors, teachers and human rights activists," he added. "It appears that the real reason for targeting these health workers was the fact that they denounced the government crackdown on protesters in interviews to international media. More than 30 people have been killed during the demonstrations, in which activists say Bahraini security forces used live ammunition against protesters. Thirteen of the physicians were sentenced to 15 years in prison, two for 10 years and five for five years, said military prosecutor, Col. Yussef Rashid Flaifel. Charges against the doctors included possession of unlicensed weapons, inciting the overthrow of the government, provoking sectarian hatred and forceful occupation of a public building, officials said.
