According to a defector from the ranks of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) -- whose stronghold in the Syrian town of Raqqa punishes smokers and insists women wear a veil --  the jihadist group runs a series of internet welcome chat groups to begin the process of indoctrinating and filtering potential recruits from outside Syria. He said the recruitment was first aimed at filling ISIS ranks inside Syria, and that the return of these radicals to their home countries was carefully regulated by the emirs, or senior commanders, of ISIS. The defector was himself jailed for one day by ISIS for overstepping the permitted topics of conversation with recruits, and says he fled Syria with the clothes on his back after his relatives were killed. The defector agreed to an interview with CNN but wanted to hide his identity, but his story was ratified by a witness and his extensive knowledge of life inside Syria under the ISIS. " When the recruit is ready to come to Syria, a different part of ISIS assists, and the defector said he was not supposed to meet those he helped recruit.
