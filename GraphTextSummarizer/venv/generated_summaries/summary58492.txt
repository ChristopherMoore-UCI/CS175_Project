In July, Garner, an unarmed father of six children, had just helped break up a fight when police officers arrived and surrounded him. If you care about justice and about the values that our country was founded upon, you will feel sickened by the grand jury's decision not to indict NYPD Officer Daniel Pantaleo in the choking death of Eric Garner in Staten Island. For those of you arguing that Garner was "resisting arrest" -- do you really want to live in a country where you could get choked to death if you question why the police officers are targeting you? It's a blow to the vast majority of amazing police officers that suit up and put their lives on the line every day and follow the rules. You can see multiple officers on Garner.
