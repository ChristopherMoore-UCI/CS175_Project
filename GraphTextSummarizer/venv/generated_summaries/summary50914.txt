The original classic game, which was briefly turned into a cartoon series in 1989, concerns the hero Link, who must save Princess Zelda from the clutches of Ganon, while exploring Hyrule for clues and adventure. One of the most prominent was Zelda Williams, daughter of the late Robin Williams, who was named after Princess Zelda. Netflix is developing a live-action series based on the popular "Legend of Zelda" series of video games. It's too early to say if the show will come to fruition, but the game is so beloved by fans that any TV series would be subject to intense scrutiny. If Nintendo has its way, you can prepare for a visit to the magical land of Hyrule, looking more real than ever.
