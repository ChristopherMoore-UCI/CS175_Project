Testimony at that inquiry has outlined widespread corruption allegations and close relationships between elected officials, city employees, contractors and even organized crime. Quebec police said the charges involve at least two Montreal real estate transactions from 2006 to 2011 and hundreds of thousands of dollars traded hands. -- Montreal's interim mayor, Michael Applebaum, was arrested and charged early Monday with 14 criminal counts including fraud, breach of trust and conspiracy. He would not confirm or deny if the charges involve bribes or ties to gangsters and organized crime. Applebaum took over the mayor's job in November after Gerald Tremblay resigned amid corruption allegations.
