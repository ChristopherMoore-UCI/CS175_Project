" London calling Just 18 months after making her Grand Prix debut, Dujardin headed out onto Greenwich Park as part of the British team seeking to win its first ever medal in dressage since 1912. Dujardin and Valegro then won the FEI World Cup Grand Prix at London Olympia in 2011, and set a new world points record at the Olympic Grand Prix special event the following year. Sitting on her beloved Valegro, Dujardin had the horse dancing majestically to the sounds of "Land of Hope and Glory," "The Great Escape" and the chimes of London's iconic Big Ben. Competing in both the team and individual event in front of a home crowd might have left lesser riders with stage fright -- but not Dujardin. Horses cost serious money, as do all the extras which come with owning an animal primed for the very top.
