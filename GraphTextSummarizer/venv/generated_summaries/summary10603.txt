But Monday marks the day that super powerful vacuum cleaners that use more than 1600 Watts can no longer be sold in stores in the EU, nor manufactured in EU plants. Next year the EU will start to talk about putting other appliances on the list; lawn mowers, mobile phones, hair dryers, kettles (watch out for the British headlines on that one -- EU Blows its Stack, EU Boils Over). But for some reason here in the UK, the vacuum cleaner appears a step too far for the popular press which has noted that the EU is "sucking" consumer rights out of Britain, or just that the "EU Sucks." "I believe there is a misconception and that is that if you have a high-voltage vac that also means that it has a lot of power to suck the dust," the EU spokesperson Marlene Holzner told me last week, dismissing endless columns of ink in Britain that we will have to vacuum for longer periods, hence use more electricity, to clean our homes. The EU hopes to meet about a third of its power reduction targets in the coming years simply by reducing energy used by appliances.
