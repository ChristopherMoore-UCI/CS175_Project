Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon declared a state of emergency Sunday as residents cleaned up from Saturday's tornado that ripped through the small town of Orrick, east of Kansas City. A tornado watch has also been issued for parts of central and eastern Iowa, including the counties of Appanoose, Davis, Putnam and Van Buren and the towns of Cedar Rapids, Davenport, Dubuque and Iowa City. In a statement, the governor urged residents to monitor conditions and heed weather alerts as another round of potentially dangerous weather is forecast for later Sunday. An area of low pressure stretching from Texas north to the Great Lakes region threatens to produce severe thunderstorms for much of the country late Sunday, CNN meteorologists warn. Nixon asked Missourians to "stay alert, use caution and take shelter immediately" if severe weather is headed their way.
