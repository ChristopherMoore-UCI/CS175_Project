Alaska Airlines Flight 448 was just barely on its way to Los Angeles from Seattle-Tacoma International Airport on Monday afternoon when the pilot reported hearing unusual banging from the cargo hold. After the delay, the flight with 170 passengers and six crew members on board made it to Los Angeles early Monday evening. "All of a sudden we heard all this pounding underneath the plane and we thought there was something wrong with the landing gear," Robert Higgins told CNN affiliate KABC. "At some point, the marshal kind of made himself known," said Troi Ge. "There could be a person in there so we're going to come back around," he told air traffic control.
