Most compulsive shoppers have other problems as well, including depression, anxiety or other addictions, including compulsive sexual behavior, Internet addiction or compulsive gambling. Some might assume compulsive shopping is relatively recent -- perhaps a product of Madison Avenue. Compulsive shopping was described over a century ago by German psychiatrist Emil Kraepelin. Compulsive shopping has little to do with income, though money does determine the shopping venue. The good news is that we know a lot more about compulsive shopping than 20 years ago.
