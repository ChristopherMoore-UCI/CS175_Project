When questioned by a student on the failure of the legislation on gun background check in the Senate, Clinton spoke in parables. Alarmingly, for the NRA, this show of disapproval is happening in red states that should be gun rights strongholds. Their ideological rigidity on immigration reform, marriage equality, reproductive rights, Wall Street reform and numerous other hot-button issues is unpopular. When you factor in the outrage over gun violence, Republicans -- who seem inextricably bound to the NRA in the public's mind -- are under the gun. New surveys by Public Policy Polling and Quinnipiac University confirm Clinton's view that the public has cooled to the NRA.
