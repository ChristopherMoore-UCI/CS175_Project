Earlier this month, China met with other Asian countries to enhance collaboration between countries to combat illegal wildlife trafficking, according to a report by TRAFFIC, a wildlife trade monitoring network. Zheng Yuanying of the Green Eye of China environmental protection group told Britain's The Guardian that a strong black market has persisted in the region despite government efforts to crack down on exotic animal smuggling. The Siamese crocodiles were seized Tuesday in the Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region after they crossed over the China-Vietnam border, according to reports in the Chinese state-run Xinhua news agency. The provinces of Yunnan, Guangxi and Guangdong in southern China accounted for 68.3% of the national trafficking total in 2011, according to the report. Officials believe they were headed for restaurants in southern China -- known for its exotic dining options.
