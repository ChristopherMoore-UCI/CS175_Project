The U.S. Senate gave final approval Friday to a $787 billion recovery package that President Obama hopes will help boost an economy in freefall with a combination of government spending and tax cuts and credits. The compromise legislation, which was hammered out by House and Senate leaders and White House staff over the past several days, passed in the House on a 246-183 vote. Although the package was signed off on by leadership Thursday, a written version wasn't available to most lawmakers until about 11 p.m. Some Republicans in the House expressed frustration over how little time they had to read the 1,000-plus-page bill, and others predicted ruin if it passed. Sen. Sherrod Brown speaks to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid at right on the Senate floor Friday. Here's how the compromise bill is expected to affect individuals: Most individuals will get a $400 tax credit, and most couples will get an $800 credit.
