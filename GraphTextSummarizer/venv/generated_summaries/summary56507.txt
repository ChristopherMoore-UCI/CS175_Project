Sold in shopping malls and discount stores and not just small computer stores -- the norm for the time -- the C64 became many people's gateway into the world of computers, said Brian Bagnall, author of "On the edge: The spectacular rise and fall of Commodore." Popular downloads include "Boulder Dash," "Ghostbusters," and "The Great Giana Sisters." "It may have not been the most sophisticated computer, but it did have a lot of personality and it was lovable and remains loveable," said Harry McCracken, vice president and editor in chief of PC World. Users could play many games and also learn the programming language of computers -- BASIC. Computer pioneers will reflect on the C64's achievements and contribution to the industry. "I don't think there are many computers today that we use that people will be talking about fondly 25 years from now."
