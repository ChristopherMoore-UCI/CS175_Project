My first visit to Augusta National was in 2005 when I was reporting for Ireland's national television channel RTE. What was utterly fascinating was the opportunity to have a go at playing Tiger Woods' chip shot at 16 from the previous day, which is arguably the greatest shot in modern times at Augusta. Literally 15 hours after the leaders Chris DiMarco and a certain Tiger Woods had graced the back nine in the tournament, so would I. Up early, grooves cleaned and excited beyond belief, I pitched up at the gates of Magnolia Lane and made my way up to the clubhouse to check in, meet my caddy Travis in his traditional white overalls and head to the practice range. On this and so many of the greens, there are impossible putts if you don't play the correct approach shot. working press from all over the globe suddenly possessing the wide-eyed stare of excited children, with a glorious invitation to the pristine fairways of Augusta National -- living out our fantasies of actually playing the course.
