USF police asked the Tampa police's bomb team to respond to the campus regarding a backpack belonging to man in the first incident, said Ross. But Ross said that the campus had been given the all-clear, except for the shuttle-bus area -- where the first subject was taken into custody -- while Tampa Police examined the backpack. Text messages were sent out to 13,000 employees and 45,000 students to warn them after the first incident, and emergency sirens on campus also were activated, officials said. The campus stayed on lockdown after police received a report almost immediately after taking the first man into custody of a man wearing a black tank top and a cowboy hat, carrying a knife and a black puppy. Investigators were questioning one man following a report of an armed intruder, USF police Lt. Meg Ross said.
