Nicklaus, who racked up 73 wins on the PGA Tour, has built up a business empire which includes golf course design and equipment, real estate and lifestyle products. Golf legend Jack Nicklaus proved almost unstoppable in a career which netted him 18 major titles but just maybe his then rivals could have disturbed his concentration on course by tempting him with his favorite treat. Nicklaus, who retired from competitive golf in 2005, took a leading role in testing the product and told his official website that he relished the task. He is considered by many experts as golf's all-time greatest player and his major titles tally is four more than achieved by Tiger Woods. Nicklaus -- nicknamed "The Golden Bear" -- has a particular craving for ice cream and now the 75-year-old American has launched  his own brand with his name emblazoned over the packaging.
