The hoax ended after German police released a photograph of who they said was a 17-year-old known only as "Ray" who turned up at Berlin City Hall last year after claiming to have been living in the woods for five years. He never lived in the forest and made his way to Berlin some time last year, police said. After his father died last August, he said, he roamed north for five days until he arrived at Berlin City Hall and asked for help last September 5, authorities said. But because he was an adult and could determine where he wanted to live, there was no further investigation by Dutch authorities, police in Germany said. "They were hiking with the help of maps and a compass only and stayed in tents or caves overnight," Berlin authorities cited the boy as saying, in a statement released Tuesday.
