Passionate about his country, L'Abidine says January's revolution shows the world that Tunisia is not just a tourist destination but a place with long history and rich culture. "I'm lucky in a way that actually I can go back to Tunisia or in the Middle East and do different roles in Arabic or sometimes in French or in English," says L'Abidine who is fluent in four languages. "There were hard times but now when you look back they were very useful and actually you can learn from them and they make you who you are -- at the end, you can't have a life experience just with good things, the difficult times are also very useful for now and for the future," says L'Abidine. -- When scores of disgruntled Tunisians took to the streets in January to demand the ouster of their country's president, actor Dhafer L'Abidine was watching from afar. While L'Abidine has been carving a successful path as an actor in the international stage -- his work also includes roles in "Centurion" and "The Stone Merchant" -- he's maintained links with the region he's from, getting the best of the two worlds.
