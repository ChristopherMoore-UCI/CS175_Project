A Massachusetts judge granted a defense request Monday to transfer ex-New England Patriot Aaron Hernandez to a jail closer to his lawyers in Boston as he awaits trial on murder charges. Inside the case against Aaron Hernandez Bristol County Sheriff Thomas Hodgson told CNN that Hernandez likely will be transferred to another jail on Tuesday. The judge also did not rule on previous defense motions to dismiss a first-degree murder charge or throw out a June 18, 2013 search warrant of Hernandez's home in relation to the Lloyd case. Also in attendance was Ursula Ward, mother of murder victim Odin Lloyd. Hernandez is charged with "orchestrating the execution" of Lloyd on June 17, 2013.
