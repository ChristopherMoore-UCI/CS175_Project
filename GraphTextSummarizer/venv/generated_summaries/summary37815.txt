ISIS claims the ransom amount is the same as the financial aid pledged by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to countries affected by the militant group. Hours before the estimated deadline, an ISIS spokesman told Japanese broadcaster NHK that the group would release a statement "soon" about the hostages. Japanese officials have repeatedly stressed that their military, which is constitutionally forbidden from taking action other than for self-defense, isn't involved in the international airstrikes against ISIS positions in Syria and Iraq. Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said he was aware of reports that ISIS would soon make a statement. Should nations just pay ISIS ransom?
