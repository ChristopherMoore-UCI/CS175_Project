Wigan went ahead through Mohamed Diame at the beginning of the second half, but Steve Bruce's team came roaring back through goals from Ghana striker Asamoah Gyan and young England midfielder Jordan Henderson. The victory helped Chelsea reign in leaders Manchester United, who had moved nine points clear with a 1-0 win over Everton in the opening game of the day. Everton rarely threatened, but came close to going ahead when veteran United goalkeeper Edwin Van der Sar produced a fine finger-tip save from Jack Rodwell's low drive on 68 minutes. United know that victory in their next two Premier League fixtures against third-placed Arsenal on May 1 and Chelsea on May 8 should clinch a record 19th title. Substitute Franco Di Santo scored a consolation goal in the 90th minute for Wigan, who stayed inside the relegation zone in 18th place on goal difference below.
