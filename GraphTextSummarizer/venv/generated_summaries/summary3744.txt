Kim said his government is urging North Korea "to immediately retract this measure and to allow the smooth flow of personnel and communication." As of Monday morning, hundreds of South Koreans were kept from crossing the border to and from an industrial complex because North Korea cut off military communications, preventing the workers from getting clearance to return home, Kim said. The statement came as the North cut off communications with neighboring South Korea. North Korea said the communications channel will remain closed until the 12-day joint exercise by South Korean and U.S. forces ends on March 20, according to South Korea's Yonhap news agency. North Korea's announcement comes as South Korea and the United States start their annual joint military drills on Monday. "We have said several times that the U.S.-South Korean military exercises are annual defensive exercises," Kim Ho-nyun, spokesman for South Korea's Ministry of Unification, said at a news briefing Monday.
