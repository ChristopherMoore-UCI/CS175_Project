The reality that female directors and producers and writers deal with is the ongoing perception that women will go see movies about men and that men won't go see stories about women. It is worth noting that this summer in the sea of superhero films, there are only two films with women leads being distributed by the major studios. While neither of the movies being released by the studios is directed by a woman, there are a handful of women directed films you can see this summer, at least here in the US. There's a prevailing sense that male stories are universal, for everyone, and that women's stories are just for women. And while there are still not enough women directed films at the top tier festivals, this year for the first time at the Sundance Film Festival there was parity in both the US documentary and feature competitions.
