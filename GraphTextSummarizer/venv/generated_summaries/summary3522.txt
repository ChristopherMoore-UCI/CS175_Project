Instagram announced a feature on Thursday called Photos of You that lets people tag their own images with the Instagram handles of friends or anyone with an account on Instagram. Instagram has created a built-in way to hide tagged photos you don't like from your your profile. It's no secret that people spend a lot of time on Instagram. Between posting photos, tinkering with filters, creating hashtags and browsing streams, the average user spends about four hours a month on the photo-sharing platform, according to comScore. Instagram says these new tags can be populated only with usernames, not hashtags, though hashtags still work just fine in the comments.
