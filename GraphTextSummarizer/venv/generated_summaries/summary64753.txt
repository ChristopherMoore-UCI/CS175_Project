Local police say the incidence of rape has fallen in Haryana over recent months, and that recent cases have attracted "hype." "The nature of the crime created hype in the number of rape cases registered in Haryana," said Satish Balan, Police Superintendent of the Hisar district. "Child marriage is not a solution to protecting girls from sexual crimes including rape. In the past month, at least 17 other young women have reported rapes in Haryana, a relatively sparsely-populated state in the country's northwest. "In two cases there were suicides which led to media coverage of rapes in Haryana otherwise the number of rapes registered has come down by 15%. Tirath told CNN in an interview Thursday that she strongly condemned the cases of rape being reported in Haryana.
