Verdin says if BP provided him with more boom and agreed to hire more workers, he could probably get 100 people on the job. In the 1970s, Verdin said, tribal members stood on the shores of the sacred ground cradling shotguns and rifles to face down oil company workers intent on dredging the land for a pipeline. But if this area is going to be protected from the encroaching oil spill, the residents of Pointe Aux Chenes will have to do it themselves. What concerns the tribe the most is a small island off the coast of Pointe Aux Chenes they call their sacred grounds. That erosion has turned the once abundant oak trees in Pointe Aux Chenes -- which means "Oak Point" in French -- into empty husks.
