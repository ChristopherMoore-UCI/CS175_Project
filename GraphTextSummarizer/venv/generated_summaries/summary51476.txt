In the lawsuit, Gross' attorney's argued that he was not warned by Development Alternatives Inc. that his work could run afoul of Cuban authorities. "We want Alan back home, safe and sound." Last year, Cuban authorities offered to discuss to Gross' case with the United States as well as that of five Cuban agents jailed in the United States on spy charges. The company hired Gross to fulfill a U.S. Agency for International Development contract to connect private citizens to the Internet in Cuba, a scarce commodity on the island. The amount to be paid to Alan Gross and his wife, Judy, by Development Alternatives Inc. was subject to a non-disclosure agreement, the court filing said. Gross argued that his work wasn't political and he was trying to connect Cuba's tiny Jewish community to the Internet.
