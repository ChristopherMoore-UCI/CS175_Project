This comes in a season where many of the canceled shows have been comedies, including NBC Thursday night shows "Bad Judge" and "A to Z." "As a longtime fan of TV comedy, it's sad to see a broadcast network make this decision," said Gordon. There was a time when Thursday night on NBC was truly "must-see TV" -- and it was thanks to comedies. NBC is hoping to make a ratings dent in ABC's Thursday night dramas, not to mention CBS' Thursday night comedy lineup, led by "The Big Bang Theory." On Friday, NBC announced a new midseason schedule completely absent of Thursday night comedies. "What was really interesting to me was what happened last season, when NBC made a concerted effort to sign NBC Must See TV Thursday alumni Sean Hayes and Michael J. Fox to very prominent sitcom deals, both of which flopped completely in the 9 p.m. hour," he observed.
