After a quiet opening 20 minutes at Loftus Versfeld Stadium Paraguay fashioned the first opening when Lucas Barrios got into the area and forced Japan goalkeeper Eiji Kawashima into a good low save. Japan's Yuichi Komano missed the crucial spot kick and Paraguay striker Oscar Cardozo was the man to seal the game with the winning penalty, as his side triumphed 5-3. In the second half of extra time Japan came close to a winner when Yuto Nagatomo's cross was met by Honda but Villar saved, but the game went to penalties. Paraguay pressed forward after the restart and substitute Edgar Barreto tested Kawashima with a header, before the 'keeper had to dive at Nelson Valdez's feet to prevent him scoring.
