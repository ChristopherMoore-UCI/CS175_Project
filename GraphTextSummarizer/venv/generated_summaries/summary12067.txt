Ahlu Sunna fighters -- a Sufi militia aligned with the government -- fought fiercely against al Qaeda-linked Al Shabaab near Bakara market while government forces and Al Shabaab clashed in the north. The chief of Somali Police, Gen. Ali Mohamed Hassan, told reporters that the drive led by the president marks the beginning of a larger operation against Al Shabaab. The aide said that the president is accompanied by government soldiers and forces from the African Union Mission in Somalia. Also Wednesday, heavy shelling rocked the capital during the evening, killing at least five people and wounding at least eight, according to ambulance service spokesman Ali Musa. "The president is on the front line leading the fight against Al Shabaab and he is armed with an AK-47," said the aide, who declined to be named.
