It was the second successive year in which the Springboks have beaten defending series champions New Zealand in the Vegas final, and the third consecutive year in which the Kiwis have lost the showpiece match. And for the third time since the event moved to Vegas, South Africa emerged victorious after beating New Zealand 14-7 in Sunday's deciding match. Tries from Branco du Preez and Werner Kok secured the win and 22 series points for South Africa, which now leads New Zealand by one point. Since 2010, Nevada has played host to the U.S. leg of a nine-stop global tour to decide which country rules this shortened version of rugby union. For the second year in a row it was South Africa left celebrating at the end of Vegas' annual sevens party.
