Malala's letter to the abducted schoolgirls Alasholuyi has also appealed to his government  -- and other nations -- to fight the violence imposed by Boko Haram which has carried out multiple attacks and abductions since the kidnapping of the Chibok girls. When more than 200 Nigerian girls were kidnapped from their school a year ago by Boko Haram militants, millions of people around the world joined a social media campaign to plead for their safe return. He has also met local leaders to highlight the need for girls to be able to get an education without the fear of being abducted. Alasholuyi says he believes in miracles and hopes his passion, commitment and determination to help the Chibok girls through his daily photos will one day bring them home safely. He is confident president elect Muhammadu Buhari, the country's newly-elected president and a retired Major General in the Nigerian Army, will do more to combat the threat of Boko Haram.
