-- A co-founder of the Pinkberry yogurt chain was found guilty on Friday of beating a homeless man with a tire iron near downtown Los Angeles, prosecutors said. The victim, whose name wasn't released Friday, was panhandling on an off-ramp of U.S. Highway 101 near downtown when Lee thought the homeless man had disrespected him by exposing a sexually explicit tattoo, prosecutors said. A jury deliberated a little more than one day and found Young Lee, 49, guilty of assault with a deadly weapon, said the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office. After Lee's arrest in January 2012, Pinkberry released a statement in which it said he no longer has any involvement with the company, and hasn't since May 2010. Lee parked his car near the off ramp, gave chase and beat the victim on his head and arm, prosecutors said.
