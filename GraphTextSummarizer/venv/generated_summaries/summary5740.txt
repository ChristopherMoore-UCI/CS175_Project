That's the route Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson took, choosing to play Sunday, just two days after the death of his son, who was living with his mother in South Dakota. After Sunday's game, Peterson's teammate, tight end Kyle Rudolph, praised Peterson's determination and heart. The woman's 27-year-old boyfriend, Joseph Robert Patterson, has been arrested on felony battery and assault charges in the child's death, according to Sioux Falls, South Dakota, police. In a text to a Fox Sports reporter, Peterson said he decided to play Sunday for the same reason he participated in the NFL's skills testing event for potential draft picks a day after his brother died in 2007. He tweeted that another child, Adrian Peterson Jr., lives with him and is fine, and he asked people to stop distributing pictures of that child.
