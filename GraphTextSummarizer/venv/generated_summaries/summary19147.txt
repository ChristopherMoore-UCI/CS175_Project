"This production stability and reserve replacement and oil prices where they are - there doesn't seem to be a sense of urgency in the political elites of Mexico to tackle such a complex and controversial reform." For Pemex, the question is almost philosophical. So now there is controversial talk of constitutional amendment which would allow additional capital and expertise to be brought into Mexico's oil industry. To compensate for the aging Supergiants, Pemex must now exploit resources at depths of up to 3,000 meters -- where they estimate there may be some 29 billion barrels of oil. -- Much of Mexico's remaining oil wealth lies thousands of meters below the surface of the Gulf of Mexico. At depths of 3,000 meters, temperatures are so low that oil can freeze as it leaves the subsoil and equipment must be able to withstand strong currents.
