Prosecutors have said that Penn State officials -- former President Graham Spanier, former Vice President Gary Schultz, and former Athletic Director Tim Curley -- all knew about two allegations against Sandusky in 1998 and in 2001. -- Penn State University reached settlements over the past few months with what it calls 26 victims of former assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky -- settlements that will cost the university a total of $59.7 million, the school announced Monday. "We hope this is another step forward in the healing process for those hurt by Mr. Sandusky, and another step forward for Penn State," university President Rodney Erickson said in a statement. The scandal has so far cost Penn State university tens of millions of dollars, including a $60 million NCAA fine, and millions more in crisis management. Kline praised Penn State lawyers in regard to the settlement process, saying they worked methodically through each claim, making it possible to settle in just about 13 months.
