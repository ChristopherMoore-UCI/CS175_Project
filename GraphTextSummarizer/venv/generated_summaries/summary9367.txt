Hospital spokeswoman Rachael Kagan confirmed that Dr. Jeffrey Critchfield, chief of the Division of Hospital Medicine, called Harris on Thursday, though Kagan did not elaborate on their conversation. Haig Harris, an attorney representing the children of the late Lynne Spalding, said an official at San Francisco General called him on Thursday to tell him about the October 4 incident. The statement added that hospital employees and sheriff's deputies searched for Spalding. -- A worker at San Francisco General Hospital alerted a supervisor about a body in a stairwell four full days before the facility announced that a long-missing patient's body had been found in the same locale, a lawyer for the patient's family said Thursday. Harris said Critchfield told him that around 7:20 a.m. on October 4, a senior female staff member on the hospital's fifth floor heard banging coming from Stairwell 8.
