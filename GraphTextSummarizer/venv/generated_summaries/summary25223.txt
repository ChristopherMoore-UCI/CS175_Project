"We are disappointed the United States will now descend further down the path of expedient and secret justice that military commissions have come to represent," Rick Kammen said in an e-mail. " "Unlike federal courts, military commissions have unfairly lax rules for allowing evidence, except when it comes to torture -- the commissions may admit coerced testimony, while evidence of the torture that produced it can be censored," said Denny LeBoeuf, director of the ACLU Capital Punishment Project. This latest step for the Guantanamo detainee comes as the new chief prosecutor for military commissions, Army Brig. "The convening authority referred the charges to a capital military commission, meaning that if convicted, al-Nashiri could be sentenced to death," the Defense Department statement said. The Pentagon moved closer Wednesday to its next military trial on the U.S. Navy base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, for the suspected ringleader of the deadly bombing of the USS Cole.
