-- Former U.S. Sen. Howard Baker, a one-time towering political figure in Washington who also served presidents and famously asked during the Watergate scandal what Richard Nixon knew and "when did he know it," has died. Baker also played a key role in the Watergate investigation that led to the downfall of President Richard Nixon. As the vice chairman and ranking Republican of the investigation into Nixon's connection to the 1972 break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters in Washington, Baker famously asked "what did the President know and when did he know it." A statement released by Baker's wife, former Sen. Nancy Kassebaum, and his two children from his first marriage, Darek Baker and Cynthia (Cissy) Baker, said his death was a "time of sorrow and also a time for the celebration of a remarkable life. President Barack Obama said in a statement that Baker's unofficial role as the "Great Conciliator" had "won him admirers across party lines, over multiple generations, and beyond the state he called home.
