The United States doesn't blacklist individual airlines, but it does make public a list of countries it judges to fall short of international aviation safety standards. Four airlines only achieved one star for safety. He says the airline is an industry benchmark for best practice and has taken the lead in virtually every major advancement in airline safety over the past 60 years. "Qantas continues to lead the industry with safety innovations and its fleet is now the youngest -- 7.9 years -- it has been since the airline was privatized in 1995," AirlineRatings.com editor Geoffrey Thomas tells CNN. "Unlike a number of low cost carriers these airlines have all passed the stringent International Air Transport Association Operational Safety Audit audit and have excellent safety records," says Thomas.
