Though Bachmann apparently has deleted his own Facebook account, screen grabs published by numerous media outlets suggest Bachmann posted the Hitler photo in September, while the KKK image is from 2012. It appears the images gained traction not because of timeliness but because PEGIDA has successfully organized weekly anti-Islamization demonstrations in Dresden. "The police has canceled the rally in agreement with PEGIDA because they can't guarantee the security and safety of participants after information of planned attacks by islamistic groups," the Facebook post said. " German Justice Minister Heiko Maas and Chancellor Angela Merkel have called on the group to cancel the rallies in Dresden and other German cities. I am sorry that I thereby damaged the interests of our movement, and draw the appropriate conclusion," Bachmann said in Dresden.
