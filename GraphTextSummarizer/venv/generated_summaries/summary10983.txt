-- Tension escalated in the Albanian capital Thursday as opposition members clashed with police outside the building where a commission is still counting votes from a local election that was seen as a crucible for stability in the Balkan nation. Rama's Socialist Party has accused the ruling Democratic Party of vote manipulation and has asked to check ballot boxes. The Socialist Party has won 70% of local elections, winning seats in other Albanian towns and cities. Earlier in the year, Rama, a three-term mayor of Tirana, had promoted protests alleging government corruption and demanded the resignation of Prime Minister Sal Berisha. A final vote tabulation by the Central Election Committee could tip the results of the May 8 vote in favor of the government candidate, former Interior Minister Lulzim Basha.
