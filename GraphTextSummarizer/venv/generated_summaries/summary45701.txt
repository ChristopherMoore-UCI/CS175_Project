Once in Coogee you can admire the Australian coastline by following it all the way back to Sydney's famous Bondi Beach. And finally, there's no better place to end the night than in one of Sydney's karaoke bars. Early risers can waste no time in immersing themselves in Sydney's cultural highlights. A recent spate of shark attacks may have put you off Sydney's beaches, but there are plenty of outdoor pools that offer both sun and seawater. For serious laps, try the North Sydney Olympic Pool (next to the Sydney Harbour Bridge) or for a lazier affair have a massage at Wylies Bath in Coogee.
