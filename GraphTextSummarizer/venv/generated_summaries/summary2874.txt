-- Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich appeared in court Tuesday afternoon to hear federal corruption charges against him. At a news conference Tuesday, Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, a Democrat, said he wants the Illinois Legislature to act quickly to pass a law setting a special election to fill Obama's seat, in order to prevent Blagojevich from making a tainted appointment or there being a lengthy vacancy in the Senate. Rod Blagojevich is serving his second term as governor of Illinois. FBI agents arrested Blagojevich and his chief of staff, John Harris, early Tuesday on federal corruption charges related in part to the selection of President-elect Barack Obama's successor to the Senate, the U.S. attorney's office said. Blagojevich, who turns 52 on Wednesday, is in his second four-year term as Illinois governor.
