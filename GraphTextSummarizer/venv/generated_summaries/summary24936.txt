In photos: Siwa Oasis Three barren hills -- home to the Oracle of Siwa, the Mountain of the Dead and the old town -- loom above the sea of green foliage. Two large saltwater lakes fed by fresh water springs dominate the oasis, surrounded by a forest of date and fruit trees. We couldn't be sure, seeing neither of us are meteor experts or geologists. Watch: Egypt wants tourists back We stayed at the Adrere Amellal Ecolodge, which sits on the far west end of the oasis straddling Siwa Lake and the Sahara Desert. The rooms are built in the traditional Siwa fashion, but with all the amenities of a five-star hotel, including hot water.
