In addition to fixing the iOS battery issue, 5.0.1. adds multitouch gestures to the original iPad, fixes iCloud bugs and improves voice recognition for Australian iPhone users. On November 2, Apple admitted that iOS 5 had battery performance issues and announced that the company would fix the problem with iOS 5.0.1. This issue affected not just iPhone 4S users though, but anybody using iOS 5. iOS 5.0.1 is the first update to Apple's iOS 5, which brought the notifications tray, increased performance and iCloud to the iPad, iPhone and iPod touch. Our testing of the beta has shown that iOS 5.0.1 provides a noticeable improvement to the iPhone's battery life.
