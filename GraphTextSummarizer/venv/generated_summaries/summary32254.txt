-- Double-amputee athlete Oscar Pistorius was selected Monday in the South African team for the world championships in Daegu later this month. The four-time Paralympic gold medallist had both legs amputated below the knee for medical reasons when he was 11 months old, but it has not prevented him competing in a number of sports, including athletics. Reigning world 800m champion Caster Semenya will get the chance to defend her title after also being named in the South African squad. The 24-year-old Pistorius was cleared to compete against able-bodied athletes three years ago, but in the past has failed to reach the qualifying times for the Olympics and major championships. But all that changed with a 45.07 second clocking for 400m in Italy last month.
