Ten minutes later, she called husband Brendan Ganguzza and told him she was going jogging at Jay Blanchard Park, not far from the university's campus in Orlando, Florida. -- Nicole Ganguzza was a newlywed in grad school at the University of Central Florida when she was dragged off a trail and strangled to death while jogging in a park in June. Writing recently about the charitable foundation established in Nicole Ganguzza's name, an Orlando Sentinel columnist described her as "the anti-Casey." Police are being tight-lipped about whether Ganguzza's attacker left behind any DNA or other forensic evidence. Ganguzza, 26, was close to earning her master's degree in marriage and family therapy.
