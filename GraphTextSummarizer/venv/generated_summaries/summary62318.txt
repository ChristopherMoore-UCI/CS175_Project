Mo Martin produced the performance of her life to secure her first major title with victory at the Women's British Open at Royal Birkdale Sunday. "From the first time I saw Royal Birkdale, I fell in love with it. The 31-year-old secured top spot with a stunning eagle on the final hole to finish one shot clear of Norway's Suzann Pettersen and China's Shanshan Feng. Meanwhile Justin Rose warmed up for this week's British Open by winning the Scottish Open at Royal Aberdeen.
