In a case that's captured international attention, Nadia Suleman, the mother of six children, gave birth to octuplets in Bellflower, California. And with that comes a risk of babies having immature lungs, a risk of complications with their intestines unable to grow. But at that point in time, my focus was on taking care of the patient and dealing with the seven babies that we thought were onboard at that time. Dr. Karen Maples, the leader of a team of doctors who delivered the babies, appeared on CNN's "Larry King Live" on Monday night to discuss last week's delivery and give an update on the 33-year-old mother. She had already been seen in our prenatal clinic, and she came to our Kaiser Bellflower when she was in her first trimester.
