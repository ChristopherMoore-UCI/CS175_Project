Officials say demands for railroads have increased as international trade goes up and road traffic worsens. The tunnel will cut regional travel time on routes including Zurich, Switzerland, to Milan, Italy, an important business link. The company says the tunnel is an environmental feat and will allow millions more tons of items to pass through the Alps by rail. The trend will affect the environment, prompting Switzerland to adopt environmentally-friendly means of travel. The Gotthard Base Tunnel is 57 km (34 miles) and links northern and southern Europe, AlpTransit Gotthard company said in a statement.
