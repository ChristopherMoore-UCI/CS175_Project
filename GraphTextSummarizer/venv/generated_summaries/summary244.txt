Successful prevention means the baby is free of HIV infection and will no longer need treatment. This incredible reduction was accomplished despite the fact that more women with HIV infection were giving birth. That is why we need to have a Plan B for babies with HIV infection -- and the findings of Gay and her colleagues might be just that. A landmark study showed that treating HIV-positive pregnant women during their labor and delivery with intravenous zidovudine, or AZT, and then giving the infant AZT syrup orally for four to six weeks reduced the risk of HIV transmission to less than 2%. Without effective treatment of HIV, a physician couldn't offer much more than supportive care.
