The government will keep construction plans on hold until a court considers the objections of protesters camped out in the Taksim Square's Gezi Park, officials say, If a judicial ruling is not in line with what Gezi protesters want, a plebiscite on the park will be held. But despite Erdogan's tough rhetoric toward protesters, he and his government appear to be hearing the diverse voices in Taksim and other squares across Turkey. The protesters -- part of a Taksim Solidarity coalition -- were pleased: "This is just the beginning, resistance will continue," protesters chanted at a meeting in Istanbul. This comes after leaders of the protests in Istanbul's Taksim Square met last night with Erdogan at his home in Ankara, the capital -- an event regarded as a sign of reconciliation between the government and the protesters. It belongs to the whole of Istanbul and whole of the nation, and everyone should be able to benefit and enjoy this Gezi Park easily."
