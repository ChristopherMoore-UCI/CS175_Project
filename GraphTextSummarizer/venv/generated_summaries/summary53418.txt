The report goes on to say that "many malls do not even have plans to limit access to sensitive areas in times of heightened alert." Since that report was written, the International Council of Shopping Centers, in conjunction with George Washington University, has developed a DVD to train mall security guards. Shopping malls around the country were expected to review their emergency plans and consider additional security measures in light of Wednesday's shooting, which killed eight. He said malls would be considering whether to close some entrances, bring in additional officers, and make security more visible. While some mall owners have increased training of security personnel and have upgraded their emergency systems, many security experts believe more should and can be done. "This is not something that anybody can reasonably anticipate," said Don Greene, a former FBI agent who has written a book on mall security.
