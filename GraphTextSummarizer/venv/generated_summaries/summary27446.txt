In spite of ever rising tuition and ballooning student loan debts, a large majority of students still desire to attend college. Many students are ill prepared for the labor market, whether by fault of their own or by colleges and universities that are out of sync with the needs of a skilled work force. It's time for parents and students to look at the entire enterprise of higher education and ask -- how, when, where, for whom, in what studies and at what cost is a college education appropriate? However, given the dismal reality facing college graduates, perhaps the future of higher education will have to change. But this does not stop an overwhelming number of students from paying an exorbitant amount of money or taking on huge amounts of debt in order to attend college.
