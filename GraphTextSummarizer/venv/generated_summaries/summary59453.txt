Previous studies showed that cancer drug tamoxifen reduced the risk of getting breast cancer in older women by 50% and osteoporosis drug raloxifene reduced the risk by 38% after five years of taking the drugs. Women who are at high risk for breast cancer that is fueled by the hormone estrogen could reduce their risk of getting cancer by taking the hormone-blocking drug Aromasin, according to a study presented at a conference in Chicago on Saturday. Two other estrogen-blocking drugs exist, but few women use them to prevent breast cancer because there are rare but serious possible side effects, such as an increased risk of uterine cancer and blood clots. " Women are considered to be at high risk for breast cancer if they are older than 60, postmenopausal and/or have had abnormal breast biopsies in which there are some lesions. "This is the first study to show that a new class of drugs, aromatase inhibitors, have the ability to prevent breast cancer in high-risk women," said Dr. Jennifer Litton, who is a breast cancer specialist at the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston and is not connected to this research.
