Edward Shaw said Selma police knew his brother "acted crazy" but that he never harmed anyone. Shaw's brother, Edward Shaw, said his brother's death was unnecessary. Ananias Shaw, 74, was killed last December after he rushed an officer while wielding a hatchet, police said. It was the Ferguson protests that inspired longtime activist Faya Rose Toure to lead the charge for the Shaw family in Selma, though the circumstances are vastly different here. When officers responded to a call about a disturbance at Church's Chicken, Shaw had ducked into a vacant building, Riley said.
