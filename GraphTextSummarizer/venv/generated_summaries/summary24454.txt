"I expect to keep bringing pride and joy to Santos fans all around the world." Even after retiring from football, Pele has remained in the public eye as a product pitchman, ambassador for the sport of football and advocate for Brazil's poor, having grown up among them in Tres Coracoes. Soccer legend Pele joked with reporters Tuesday after he was discharged Tuesday from a Sao Paolo, Brazil, hospital. Pele went on to star on two other World Cup title teams as well, in 1962 and 1970, in addition to a breakthrough career with the Brazilian club Santos and later with the New York Cosmos of the now-defunct North American Soccer League. He burst onto the scene as a teenager, helping lead his native Brazil to the 1958 World Cup championship. Because I am from Tres Coracoes, ("I have three hearts"), it will be difficult for me to die," the three-time World Cup winner said.
