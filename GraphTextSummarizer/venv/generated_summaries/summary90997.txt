Neymar, who will be counted on by Brazil at next year's World Cup on home soil, opened the scoring at the Camp Nou from the penalty spot in the 30th minute and tapped home the close-range winner in the 69th against the Yellow Submarine. He netted a hat-trick against Celtic in the Champions League and got both goals Saturday as Barcelona -- still without Lionel Messi -- beat Villarreal 2-1 to move three points clear of idle Atletico Madrid and five clear of arch-rival Real Madrid in Spain. Bayern, which will conclude 2013 unbeaten in the Bundesliga, went seven points ahead of Bayer Leverkusen -- which plays fourth-last Frankfurt on Sunday -- and 12 ahead of Borussia Dortmund. Bayern increases lead Bayern Munich's 18-match winning streak at home ended in midweek when it was upset by Manchester City in the Champions League but Bayern bounced back by beating Hamburg 3-1 at the Allianz Arena on Saturday. Bayern's semifinal opponent at the Club World Cup on Tuesday will be Asian champion Guangzhou Evergrande, which beat Egypt's Al Ahly 2-0.
