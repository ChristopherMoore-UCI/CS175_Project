Same-sex marriage is legal in 19 U.S states and the District of Columbia: California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington. Crabb was referring to a Supreme Court case in which same-sex marriages in Utah were put on hold. Same-sex couples have waited many years to receive equal treatment under the law, so it is understandable that they do not want to wait any longer," U.S. District Judge Barbara Crabb wrote in her decision Friday. "That leaves Wisconsin couples married in the last week in legal limbo, like couples in Utah and Michigan who married after the bans were invalidated and before stays were issued," he said. -- A federal judge on Friday temporarily blocked same-sex marriages in Wisconsin, pending appeals.
