According to Burnett, late director Stanley Kubrick would call King "every night" while shooting "Eyes Wide Shut," starring Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, to get ideas on shooting erotic scenes. And in 1989, King moved behind the camera to direct "Wild Orchid," written by him and his wife and featuring Rourke and Jacqueline Bisset. After fighting cancer for six years, King died Friday morning at his home in Santa Monica, California, son-in-law Allison Burnett told CNN. King also knew Martin Sheen for decades, as well as his son Charlie Sheen, according to Burnett. "My dear friend of 40 years, Zalman King, just lost his battle with cancer," Charlie Sheen wrote.
