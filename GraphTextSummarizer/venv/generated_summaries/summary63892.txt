To the south of the compound, which is located near Tripoli's Mediterranean shore, fighting between rebel fighters and Gadhafi loyalists persisted. The sprawling complex was littered with spent anti-aircraft shells, with rebel fighters picking through the detritus of the life Gadhafi's supporters left behind when they fled. Rebel fighters say the men were executed by Gadhafi's retreating forces. -- Fugitive Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's compound was strewn with shell casings and litter two days after its capture by rebel forces, while the bodies of a dozen bound men lay in a nearby intersection. The streets outside Bab al-Aziziya are awash in guns and rumors, including one that saw rebel fighters surround a nearby apartment complex Thursday on a tip that Gadhafi was inside.
