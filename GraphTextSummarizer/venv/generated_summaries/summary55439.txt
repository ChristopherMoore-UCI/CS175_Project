" George Sabra, a spokesman for the opposition Syrian National Council, said Hijab fled Syria overnight and arrived with his family in Jordan. A Syrian opposition official, Muhammad el-Etri, told CNN that Hijab had defected, was "in a country neighboring Syria" and would be heading to Qatar "sometime soon. Al-Assad appointed Hijab prime minister in June, a month after parliamentary elections that were boycotted by supporters of those seeking to oust al-Assad. But a senior Jordanian official told CNN that Hijab had defected to Jordan and was with his family. Manaf Tlas, a Sunni general in Syria's elite Republican Guards, also defected last month.
