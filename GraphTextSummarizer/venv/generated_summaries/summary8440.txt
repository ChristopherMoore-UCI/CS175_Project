"If you create a more responsive climate around people, you can save a lot of energy by creating just a bubble of heat or a bubble of cool in which they can travel," Professor Carlo Ratti, the head of the team at Carlo Ratti Associati from Turin, Italy, that developed the Cloud Cast technology, told CNN. " Cloud Cast works by creating mobile responsive clouds that follow people as they move under a canopy. "It's something that people have been using for centuries, it's called evaporative cooling," Ratti said. The UAE is experimenting with many traditional solutions to air-conditioning, including wind towers that funnel upper currents of cool air down into houses. Ratti, however, says the beauty of their Cloud Cast system is that it is responsive to people.
