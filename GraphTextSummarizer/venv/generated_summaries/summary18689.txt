His hunger strike came to an end in July after Cuba began to release dissidents as part of an agreement with the Roman Catholic Church and Spain to empty Cuba's jails of political prisoners. He founded and ran the Lawton Foundation for Human Rights and also led the "Friends of Human Rights" group in Cuba, according to the U.S.-based non-profit group Freedom Now, which "works to free individual prisoners of conscience. "This is a victory for all the Cuban people -- those who are in exile or in Cuba, those who are inside jails or those who are supposedly free on the streets of Cuba," dissident Guillermo Farinas told CNN en Espa√±ol Thursday. Thursday's news means that at least 80 political prisoners will have been released in recent months, with most of them going on to live in Spain. Farinas, a psychologist and writer, gained international attention last February when he stopped eating for 135 days to protest the Cuban government's imprisonment of political activists.
