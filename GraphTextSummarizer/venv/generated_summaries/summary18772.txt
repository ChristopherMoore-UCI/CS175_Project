This legislation seeks to address this by placing an emphasis on early detection and promoting the discovery and development of biomarkers so cancers can be detected at the earliest possible stage, when cancer is most treatable. The first step in saving lives is in detecting cancer early. If breast cancer is a guide, developing effective early detection techniques is critically important to increasing mortality rates. A couple of years later, I too was diagnosed with breast cancer, at age 37. Unfortunately, many cancers still do not have effective early detection methods.
