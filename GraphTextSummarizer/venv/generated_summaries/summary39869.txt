"It's what happened to us," he said, adding, "once we did break up, unlike other bands, we were actually successful individually." Indeed, the musicians worked regularly through the ensuing decades, notably Johansen, who became perhaps better known for his good-time nightclub singer character Buster Poindexter and the hit "Hot Hot Hot." It's a familiar mix of hard rock -- the bitter lashing of the title cut, the ecstatic grunge of "Exorcism of Despair" -- with Johansen playfulness ("Nobody Got No Bizness"), classic pop ("Lonely So Long") and even a reggae remake of the first album's "Trash." "It rained every day," said guitarist and singer David Johansen in Atlanta's Center Stage theater Friday, where the band was scheduled to play later that day. The original band, made up of Johansen, Sylvain Sylvain, Johnny Thunders, Arthur Kane and Jerry Nolan, were known for ferocious live performances that blended elements of the Rolling Stones, Velvet Underground, glam and girl groups -- down to the occasional wearing of drag. Watch Johansen describe the kids who followed them down the street Â» Sylvain, with Johansen one of the two survivors of the old Dolls (Thunders and Nolan died in the early '90s, and Kane died of leukemia in 2004), is philosophical about the band's inability to break through.
