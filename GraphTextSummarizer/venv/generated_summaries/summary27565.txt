The last flatbed truck in the parade was crossing tracks when an eastbound train slammed into it, said Midland police spokesman Ryan Stout. "Our thoughts and prayers are with family and friends of those affected," Lange said, adding that Union Pacific employees are on site and more are heading that way to investigate. First responders found two dead at the scene, while two others were later pronounced dead at Midland Memorial Hospital, Stout said. The gates and lights at the intersection were working at the time, and the train's two-member crew sounded the horn prior to impact, according to Tom Lange, a spokesman for Union Pacific Railroad. -- A train rammed into a flatbed truck carrying participants in a West Texas parade saluting U.S. troops, killing four people and injuring several others, a police spokesman said.
