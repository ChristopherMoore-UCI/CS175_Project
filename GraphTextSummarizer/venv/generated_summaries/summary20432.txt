"We have chosen Bob Bradley to lead the national team after a lengthy negotiation with many foreign coaches," Egyptian FA president Sameer Zahir told CNN Arabic. After coaching at college level, Bradley earned his first big job with Major League Soccer side Chicago Fire, winning a domestic double in 1998 to be named coach of the year. A year previously he took America to the last 16 of the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. Bradley was sacked by U.S. Soccer in June, having led his team to the final of the Gold Cup earlier the same month. He will be hoping to guide Egypt to the nation's first World Cup finals since 1990, with the next edition of the four-yearly tournament to take place in Brazil in 2014.
