"The question of food appropriation or who owns the food is massive here," says Jerusalem-born chef Yotam Ottolenghi, now a London restaurateur and co-author of the cookbook, "Jerusalem." Even when Bourdain concentrates on the rich history, food and culture of the region, spending time with Muslim and Jewish chefs, home cooks and cookbook authors, the answers are debated over and over. So says Anthony Bourdain about the magnificent, contentious lands of Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza. " "Gaza Kitchen" cookbook author Laila El-Haddad takes him on a hunt for a watermelon salad made just 30 minutes outside Gaza City, also showing him the three distinct cuisines of Gaza City, its villages and the seafood of the coast. Ottolenghi escorts Bourdain through distinct neighborhoods of Jerusalem, taking him to a typical falafel stand.
