In addition, the United Nations last month urged Iraq to impose a moratorium on the death penalty, saying its justice system could not guarantee fair trials. However, under the Iraqi system of justice, they would not be charged until after an investigative judge examines the evidence and decides whether to refer the case to court for trial. Cases like these would be handled by the Central Criminal Court of Iraq. They were told to expect a decision Tuesday on whether they would be freed or stand trial, a source close to the suspects told CNN. The court has recently come under fire from Human Rights Watch, which in a report issued in December said the court "is seriously failing to meet international standards of due process and fair trials."
