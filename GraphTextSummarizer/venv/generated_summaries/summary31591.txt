The cholera outbreak, which was first confirmed last month in northwest Haiti, had spread across much of the country by Monday, killing close to 1,000 people and entering the makeshift camps teeming with people who were made homeless in January's massive earthquake, officials said. And the cholera killed many people in Cap Haitien. -- Protesters angry over the government's handling of a cholera outbreak clashed Monday with peacekeepers in two towns in northern Haiti, where the outbreak began last month. A similar pattern in Haiti could produce some 270,000 cases, which means public health officials likely face long-term challenges in Haiti. If Haiti's cholera epidemic follows a pattern similar to that of the last cholera epidemic in the Americas, it could produce hundreds of thousands of additional cases over the next several years, Dr. Jon K. Andrus, deputy director of the Pan American Health Organization, told reporters last week.
