In western Libya, Ban said, there were reports of ongoing clashes between government forces and armed opponents. Forces loyal to Gadhafi tried to retake a town near the capital that is under opposition control but were repelled, an opposition leader in the town told CNN Tuesday. Over the past two weeks, government forces have repeatedly clashed with demonstrators and rebel forces, fired on crowds and at times shot indiscriminately at people in the streets, numerous witnesses have told CNN. -- International efforts to persuade Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi to step down ratcheted up Tuesday, as world leaders moved against him on financial and political fronts, strengthened their rhetoric and moved military might into the region. A senior official in Gadhafi's regime denied that government forces attacked rebels in Zawiya.
