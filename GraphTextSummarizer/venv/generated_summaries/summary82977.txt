-- The family of American Steven Sotloff had a message Wednesday for the notorious leader of the terror group ISIS, asking him to answer for the sin he committed with the beheading of the journalist. The goal of the United States is to "degrade and destroy" the capabilities of ISIS in Iraq and Syria, "it's not contain," Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel told CNN's Jim Sciutto. Journalists most at risk Hagel: Options on the table All options -- with the exception of a ground invasion -- are on the table to address the threat posed by ISIS, Hagel said. The killing is the second beheading of an American journalist in two weeks, and the militant group said it's a result of Obama's decision to conduct airstrikes in Iraq against ISIS, which calls itself the Islamic State. Speaking Wednesday, Obama addressed his much-criticized statement last week that he has no strategy on ISIS.
