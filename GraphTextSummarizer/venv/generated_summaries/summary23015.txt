Watch Clinton talk about Wright and other issues Â» An Obama campaign spokesman said Clinton's comments were part of a "transparent effort to distract attention away from the story she made up about dodging sniper fire in Bosnia," a reference to comments Clinton made last week. " In his speech last week, Obama said he heard his former minister make controversial remarks, but not the ones that have been the subject of recent controversy. " Clinton's comments on Wright came almost a week after Obama delivered a speech on race and politics in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, during which he denounced some of his former minister's sermons, but said he could not repudiate the man himself. "The truth is, Barack Obama has already spoken out against his pastor's offensive comments and addressed the issue of race in America with a deeply personal and uncommonly honest speech," Obama campaign press secretary Bill Burton said. -- Sen. Hillary Clinton would have long ago distanced herself from the Rev. Jeremiah Wright if she had been a member of his church, the Democratic presidential candidate said Tuesday.
