Community leaders will work together to help those living in the area and those affected directly cope with the tragedy, said June Lee, executive director of Korean Community of the East Bay, based in Oakland. The portrait of Goh emerging one day after six women and one man were shot to death at Oikos University in Oakland is of someone who felt he was "teased" and "picked on" at the college, which eventually expelled him, possibly for poor behavior, police said. After the shooting, which just lasted minutes, the gunman drove off in a victim's car, and when the suspect surrendered to police at a grocery story in the Oakland suburb of Alameda, the gunman showed no remorse and told police he was angry about his expulsion from the college, police said. Goh was self-conscious of his inability to speak English like a native and felt that students and others at the school made fun of him, police said. Oakland Police Chief Howard Jordan said it wasn't immediately clear why Goh had been expelled from the college but, "We've been told that some of the possibilities are that he was expelled for his behavioral problems, anger management, but nothing specific."
