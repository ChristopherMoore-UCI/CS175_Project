"There are millions of teachers and children who are killed (globally) because of being in the classroom itself," says Pauline Rose, director of an independent annual report on education published by UNESCO. In the town of Jabal Zawiya, in the embattled Idlib province, the shrieks and laughter of children scurrying from class to class, while teachers rein them in with firm, gentle admonishments, have died out from the hallway of a large school, leaving it completely empty, with the exception of an arid pile of concrete rubble that fell when a shell blasted through the ceiling. Many pupils and teachers dare not attend lessons, opting to take cover or flee with their families, leaving schools deserted. The Syrian government has justified military operations at schools in state media reports, stating that rebels have used them as bomb-making factories and weapons caches. Even with its battle scars, the school in Jabal Zawiya -- compared with Internet videos of damage done to other schools -- makes an almost intact impression.
