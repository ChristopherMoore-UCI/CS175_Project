-- Former New York Congressman Anthony Weiner is hoping to open a restaurant and create jobs, a year after his failed bid to become the city's next mayor. This won't be the first restaurant endeavor for the family; Weiner's brother Jason is the chef and co-owner of Almond restaurant in New York City's Flatiron district. Anthony Bourdain: Eat out and tip big to save NYC restaurants after Sandy Weiner says he's still raising money for the non-profit, and that he hopes the restaurant will be operational "in about a year." "Our hope is to train people and give them skills to be able to go on and work in other restaurants," Weiner said. In 2013 Weiner again made headlines when lewd text messages surfaced between him and a 22-year-old woman while he was running for mayor of New York City.
