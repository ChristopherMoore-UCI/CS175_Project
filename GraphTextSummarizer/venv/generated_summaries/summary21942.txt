Witness: Philadelphia priest raped me when I was 14 Lynn is accused of knowingly allowing Avery and Brennan access to children despite allegations of sexual abuse of minors. Defense attorney Jeff Lindy dismissed that claim, arguing that allowing jurors to hear Avery's plea or having other witnesses alleging abuse after Lynn left his post as secretary of clergy put his client at a disadvantage. Defrocked priest Edward Avery of the Philadelphia Archdiocese pleaded guilty to involuntary deviate sexual intercourse and conspiracy to endanger the welfare of child after admitting that he sexually assaulted a 10-year-old altar boy during the 1998-1999 school year. Assistant District Attorney Patrick Blessington argued that if Lynn's defense attorneys "attacked the creditability" of the witness, the Commonwealth would be allowed to tell the jury Avery pleaded guilty. " After listing to both sides in open court, Common Pleas Court Judge M. Teresa Sarmina suggested that perhaps prosecutors call Avery to the witness stand.
