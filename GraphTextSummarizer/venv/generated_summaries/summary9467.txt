If an unauthorized adult gets too close, bus drivers are supposed to close bus doors or drive away, if necessary, school officials said In Ozark, school officials decided to begin strictly enforcing a 15-foot safety zone around school buses required by state law. "Based on our discussions with Mr. Dykes, he feels like he has a story that's important to him, although it's very complex,"  Olson said Monday before the hostage situation ended. In the ensuing days, officials said little about what was going on in the bunker or in their strategy, or what -- if anything -- Dykes wanted. Neighbors and officials had described Dykes as a survivalist with "anti-government" views.
