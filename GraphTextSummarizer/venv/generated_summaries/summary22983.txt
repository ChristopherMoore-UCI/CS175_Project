" In the end, comedian Kevin Nealon and his wife decided to name their son Gable. In 2009, he even published a book about becoming a first-time dad called "Yes, You're Pregnant, But What About Me?" "We finally got the pacifier away from him," Nealon says of Gable. For all his faults and failures, fans just can't get enough of the self-centered, shamed city councilman of fictional Agrestic, and he has become, perhaps, Nealon's most beloved character on TV. However, as you'll see and hear in our recent video interview, Nealon and Doug Wilson are really nothing alike. These days, Nealon is mostly keeping busy on the road with his stand-up act, and he plans to record a new one-hour special next year.
