She left Colombia at 10:30 a.m. Friday, according to U.S. State Department spokesman William Ostick, who noted that the U.S. Embassy in Bogota worked closely with Colombian officials as well as authorities in Texas to bring Turner's case to a resolution. So, too, is the girl's grandmother Lorene Turner, who said U.S. Embassy officials called with the news that her granddaughter would be turned over to U.S. officials. Turner wound up being deported to Bogota, Colombia, in May 2011 after U.S. authorities last year mistook the girl, an apparent teenage runaway who lacked identification, for a Colombian national. Jakadrien's family is still demanding to know why immigration authorities deported the teen -- a U.S. citizen with no knowledge of Spanish -- and why they simply took her at her word when she gave them a fake name. " Colombia's foreign ministry said Thursday it was investigating what sort of verification its consulate in Texas requested before giving the girl an expedited provisional passport as part of deportation proceedings, as well as how she got work authorization for training at a call center as part of the government's "Welcome Home" program.
