Unlike Biden's other category of gaffes -- off-color blurting and uncomfortable racial stereotyping -- this one had real political consequences, but ultimately boiled down to what was merely an election-year headache for the President. And so, slamming our partners in a nakedly political attempt to defend President Obama's policies to a group of college students understandably didn't sit well with our friends overseas. After criticizing key Arab allies in our fragile anti-ISIS coalition -- including Turkey, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia at a time when muscling the resolve to go after the terrorist fighters in Syria and Iraq is a heavy lift for everyone involved -- Biden's "gaffe" is one that could come with significant consequences. In fact, back in 2012, Biden explained his spontaneous declaration that Obama was "absolutely comfortable" with same-sex marriage -- well before Obama was ready to -- this way, according to Jo Becker's book "Forcing the Spring:" "I didn't go out volunteering a position, but when asked a question...I had to respond to it." Except, of course, that Biden did volunteer a position, not just his own but the President's. It has been used to describe one of the best outfielders in baseball history, Manny Ramirez, who -- like a certain Vice President -- had a way of stumbling into (and creating) some truly terrible press.
