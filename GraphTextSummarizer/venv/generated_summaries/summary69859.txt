Rather than building a phone and customizing its own version of Android to fit its needs, Facebook should take some cues from Amazon and consider building its own Facebook app store that runs on Android devices. By app store — I don't just mean a copy of Google Play or a place for developers to offer their apps on yet another store — I mean a way for Facebook to offer mobile developers a way to build apps that interact and interface with Facebook on a deeper level. Companies such as Huawei and ZTE — companies that sell more phones than HTC, I might add — struggle to get major U.S. carriers to pick up their products, and those products run Android proper. Not only were the old versions of Facebook for Android and iOS slow and lacking in feature parity with the website, the company hadn't started to figure out a way to monetize the apps themselves and offer mobile ad units to buyers. Facebook is holding an Android-related press event next week and already the Internet is in a tizzy.
