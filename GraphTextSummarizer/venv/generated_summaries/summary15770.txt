Sharper, 38, faces rape charges in Arizona and California and a warrant for his arrest was issued in Louisiana. He has pleaded not guilty to assaults in California, where he has been jailed in Los Angeles since February after turning himself in. -- Police in Miami Beach, Florida, said Thursday no charges will be filed against retired NFL star Darren Sharper after a four-month sexual assault investigation. Sharper played for the Green Bay Packers, Minnesota Vikings and New Orleans Saints from 1997 through the 2010 season. Thayer said an assistant state attorney decided to shutter the investigation because there was no physical evidence, no witnesses and the alleged victim made conflicting statements about the sexual encounter.
