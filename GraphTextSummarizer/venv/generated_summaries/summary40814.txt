Program Description: "Pictures Don't Lie: A Black in America Special" examines the hazy legacy of legendary photographer Ernest Withers, who helped advance the civil rights movement with his stunningly intimate black-and-white images. How did this group's approach to civil rights differ from the movement led by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Young? During this month of reflection, the timing couldn't be better to debate this conflicted character's place in civil rights history. How would you assess Ernest Withers' role in the civil rights movement? Learning Activity: Pose this question to students: Do you think that Ernest Withers did more to promote or to undermine the civil rights movement?
