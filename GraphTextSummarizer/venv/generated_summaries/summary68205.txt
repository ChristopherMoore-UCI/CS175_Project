Jessica Heeringa, 25, was abducted late last month from an Exxon station in Norton Shores, where she was working alone, sometime around 11 p.m., police have said. People with information that may help find Jessica Heeringa are asked to call Norton Shores police at 231-733-2691. Heeringa's mother, Shelly Heeringa, has said that she suspects someone familiar with the gas station and possibly known to Jessica took her daughter. Lack of surveillance images The station did not have security cameras, something that police said has hindered the investigation and that Shelly Heeringa said always troubled her. The way the station was left, police say, led them to believe somebody abducted Heeringa.
