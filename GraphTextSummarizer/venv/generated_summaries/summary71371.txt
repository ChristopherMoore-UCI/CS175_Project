Police raided a major methamphetamine lab in an Atlanta, Georgia, suburb, discovering a large amount of crystal meth and liquid methamphetamine oil, they said Tuesday. Ritter said Jose Galvez-Vela, 33, of Weslaco, Texas, is in custody and has been charged with trafficking methamphetamine. A total of 933 pounds of methamphetamine with an estimated street value of $44,641,000 was recovered during the raid Monday afternoon, officials said. Authorities say the home does not appear to have had anyone living in it and was used strictly for the production of methamphetamine. "This is believed to be one of the largest methamphetamine confiscations in the United States," according to a statement from Gwinnett County Police Cpl.
