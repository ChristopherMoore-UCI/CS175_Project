On the Night of Power in 2000, which that year fell on January 3, al Qaeda militants attempted to launch a suicide attack against the American warship USS The Sullivans off the coast of Yemen with a bomb-filled boat. For al Qaeda, these diplomatic compounds are attractive targets because they symbolize American power and because their locations are widely known. The U.S. embassy in Sana'a, Yemen, was targeted by an al Qaeda affiliate two times in 2008, attacks that killed 21. It was the day after the Night of Power in December 2001 that Osama bin Laden signed his will as he feared death from American bombs falling during the battle of Tora Bora in eastern Afghanistan. On Friday the U.S. State Department issued a worldwide travel alert because of an unspecified al Qaeda threat.
