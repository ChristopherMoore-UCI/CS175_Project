"It cannot be that like in this case, a sort of moral handling of stolen goods is continued." Radcliffe said improvements in technology and wider public knowledge about works looted by the Nazis mean the tide is turning against those in possession of stolen art. A cache of 1,500 works of art -- including masterpieces by Picasso, Matisse and Chagall -- confiscated by the Nazis and missing for more than 70 years has been found in Germany, according to German media reports. " But art experts have questioned why it has taken so long for the Munich discovery to be revealed. Thousands of pieces of art labeled "degenerate" by the Nazis were looted from private collections and confiscated from galleries during the 1930s and 1940s; other works were stolen from Jewish families or sold for a fraction of their true value as the owners tried to flee the country. " "This case shows the extent of organised art robbery which occurred in museums and private collections," said Ruediger Mahlo, representative of the Conference on Jewish Material Claims against Germany.
