The 3-year-old boy was under his mother's watch in Myrtle Creek when the incident happened last week, Police Officer Kevin Taggart said. "We want to encourage parents to remember that children are very crafty in finding ways to get in trouble and for parents to be very vigilant," Taggart said. A diaper-clad toddler crashed a Jeep Wrangler into a neighbor's house in Oregon -- then scampered home, sat on the couch and watched cartoons, authorities said. "An officer went to the boy's home -- and the boy was sitting on the couch watching cartoons like nothing ever happened," Taggart said. She was not paying attention to him and he found the keys, got inside the car and knocked it out of gear, according to Taggart.
