The cease-fire talks are not expected just to address just a cessation of hostilities and related security issues, but also the humanitarian situation and Palestinian concerns -- such as addressing re-opening the Rafah border crossing between Egypt and Gaza, Palestinian fishing rights, salaries for Palestinians in Gaza and the eventual disarmament of Gaza. One of the goals of the cease-fire is to address some of the issues surrounding the lack of Palestinian unity, with the ultimate goal of having the Palestinian Authority be the ruling authority over Gaza. Qatar can also help pay Palestinian salaries, but the U.S. officials say they don't want Qatar propping up Hamas financially. The goal, officials from Egypt, the United States and Israel said, is to put the pieces in place to a cease-fire that endures and includes preventing Hamas's inability to re-arm and continue rocket fire. By Monday, the death toll from about a week of Israeli airstrikes had reached 186 -- all of them Palestinians -- with at least 1,390 wounded, according to Palestinian health authorities.
