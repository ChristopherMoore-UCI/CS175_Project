"I have said there is a purpose behind this and there is political assassination and today there is a fabrication to embarrass this man after all he has done over the years and despite all the sacrifices made," al-Hashimi said, referring to himself and his efforts to bring about political consensus in the diverse country during the post-Saddam Hussein era. An official in al-Hashimi's office, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of security concerns, said the three men in the videotaped confessions were security guards for al-Hashimi. Al-Hashimi questioned the legal procedure in the case and said airing confessions violates Iraqi law. The charges appear to be based on the purported confessions of three men, identified as security guards for al-Hashimi. We're urging all political sides in Iraq to work out their differences peaceably, politically, through dialogue, and certainly in a manner that is consistent with democratic political processes and international standards of rule of law," said Victoria Nuland, a spokeswoman for the State Department.
