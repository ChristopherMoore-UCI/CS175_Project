But will concerns over Cuba's weapons shipment that Panama seized from a North Korean boat this week put a stop to such talks? And the Cuba delegation once again criticized U.S. migration policies toward the island. Under migration accords with Cuba, the United States gives at least 20,000 Cubans a year visas to immigrate to the United States legally. Cuba has said the 240-metric-ton weapons stash consisted of obsolete equipment it was sending to North Korea for repair. If anything, the seizure of the North Korean boat shows the importance of more dialogue with countries like Cuba and North Korea, said Antonio Betancourt of the Universal Peace Foundation.
