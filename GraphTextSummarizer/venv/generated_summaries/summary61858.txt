Halim Sharif, a club promoter in New York City, claims the department store stopped him and unnecessarily searched his purchase because he was black, said lawyer Kareem Vessup. The one-page document is to be posted to the department store websites, which will include Macy's, Barneys New York, Bloomingdales, Lord & Taylor and Saks Fifth Avenue. "They beat up the purchase pretty badly," said Vessup, who said, "They [Macy's] became a little bit dismissive of Mr. Sharif. Three allegedly involved Macy's; the other two allegations were at Barneys New York. He is the fifth person to say he was targeted after shopping at a New York department store because of race this year.
