Inside San Pedro Sula, the 'murder capital' of the world Mexico City District Attorney Rodolfo Rios Garza said security cameras at the bar were not working, but authorities are relying on city cameras in the neighborhood. The protesters who gathered Thursday are relatives of 11 partygoers who went missing more than a week ago from a bar in a posh Mexico City neighborhood known as "Zona Rosa," or Pink Zone. The bar is only steps away from Paseo de la Reforma, an iconic avenue in central Mexico City. Mexico City Mayor Miguel Angel Mancera said authorities are treating the incident as a missing-person case because so far, there's no evidence the young people were kidnapped. Mexico reports more than 26,000 missing Most of those hanging out at the after-hours bar were in their 20s, except for Yersi Ortiz, who is 16.
