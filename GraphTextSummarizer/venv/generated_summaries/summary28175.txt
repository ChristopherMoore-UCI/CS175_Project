For the first time since last week, Hernandez's lawyer broke his silence Monday, saying his client has been subjected to "a relentless flood of rumors, misinformation and false reports," including unsubstantiated accounts in some media outlets late last week that an arrest warrant had been issued in connection with the investigation. In one development of sorts Monday, Hernandez's attorney and District Attorney Sam Sutter traded compliments. Michael K. Fee's statement regarding the "flood of rumors, misinformation and false reports" about his client praised Sutter's office, saying, "None of these false reports came from official sources and we appreciated the professionalism and restraint shown by the Bristol County District Attorney's Office to date with regard to its public statements while its investigation is under way. A man who identified himself as Hernandez's barber, Robby Olivares, showed up at the player's home Monday evening and told CNN he gave his famous client a haircut. " Investigators working in woods near Hernandez's home would not respond to questions Monday about what they were looking for or its possible significance to the probe.
