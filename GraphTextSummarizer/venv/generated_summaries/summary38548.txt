Most girls will naturally gravitate toward pink princess dresses and white wedding dress fantasies, and most women will avoid traditionally "masculine" activities and aspirations. They had answered questionnaires over the years where they described whether their parents had pushed them toward feminine activities or encouraged them to play with a range of toys, including those traditionally viewed as masculine. On average, fetuses that become girls are exposed to less testosterone in the womb than those destined to be boys. The bottom line, according to this school of thought, is that it doesn't much matter how parents raise girls. We found that the level of testosterone exposure in utero did have a small effect on how adult women described their personalities.
