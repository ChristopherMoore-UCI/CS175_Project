The yen went up to the post-war high of 75.32 per dollar early Monday. The Japanese government stepped in Monday to weaken the yen, after it climbed to a post-World War II high against the dollar. "The question is how long will the effect of the intervention continue," said Toshihiko Matsuno, a senior strategist of SMBC Friend Securities. The intervention immediately sent it tumbling to 79 per dollar. For every 1 yen appreciation against the dollar, Toyota, the car manufacturer, loses 30 billion yen ($380 million) in profits.
