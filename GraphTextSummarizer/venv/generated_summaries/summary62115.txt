Doctors get around this by performing cosmetic procedures in their own in-office operating rooms or at ambulatory surgery centers, where the credentialing requirements may not be as strict. Plastic surgery has become the Wild West of medicine, with an increasing number of doctors performing invasive cosmetic procedures without proper training or credentials. Although state medical boards regulate who can obtain a license to practice medicine, they don't restrict doctors from performing procedures outside of their training or specialty. These physicians learn the basics of plastic surgery through weekend courses, shadowing other doctors and even online webinars. So an increasing number of doctors are closing their traditional medical practices and opening cosmetic surgery centers.
