Donate to worthy organizations I came across a number of responsible, effective organizations in Alaska that are working to shelter rape victims and get people talking about what Gov.  Sean Parnell called Alaska's "epidemic" of rape and domestic violence. I met several victims of rape and domestic violence in Alaska who told me their personal healing started when they realized they weren't alone. Share this post with your friends The more people who know Alaska has an "epidemic" of rape and domestic violence, the more chance that will change. Parnell, the governor, is trying to get the state talking about domestic violence and sexual assault by encouraging people all over Alaska to hold "Choose Respect" rallies in their communities on March 27. Katie TePas, a senior policy adviser and Alaska's "Choose Respect" coordinator, said Alaska's backlog of forensic evidence "has been drastically reduced" in recent years.
