Visitors to KC will find cascading fountains, waterspout fountains and fountains punctuated with statues. Robert Altman celebrated this scene in "Kansas City," his 1996 crime drama set against a backdrop of 1930s jazz, and the American Jazz Museum is located in -- you guessed it -- KC. Climb 264 steps and then plunge down the world's tallest water slide at Schlitterbahn Waterpark in Kansas City, Kansas. But folks in Kansas City will happily tell you they have more fountains, for one thing. Inspired by the grand cities of Europe, planners in the late 1800s filled Kansas City with parks, boulevards and public squares teeming with decorative water displays -- more than 200 in all.
