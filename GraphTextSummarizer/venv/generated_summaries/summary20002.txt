Ben Gurion airport, because Israel has been threatened since it was formed in 1948, is the most secure airport," the former New York mayor told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. Calling the decision a "mistake," Michael Bloomberg -- who arrived in Israel on El Al, Israel's national airline -- praised Tel Aviv Ben Gurion International Airport as most secure airport on Earth. Banning flights rewards Hamas Bloomberg landed safely Wednesday and tweeted a photograph of himself sitting down with Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyhu. Ben Gurion was still expecting 206 flights Wednesday despite cancellations from U.S. and some European airlines, Israel's Transport Ministry said. "The security in Ben Gurion and in Israel is as good as it gets," said Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat.
