"It is hard to believe that Bill Cosby is a serial rapist because the belief doesn't just indict Cosby, it indicts us," wrote Ta-Nehisi Coates in The Atlantic. Since TV Land canceled syndication of "The Cosby Show" recently in reaction to multiple allegations that Bill Cosby is a rapist, I've been thinking more about whether we can separate the art from the artist. We drew feel-good conclusions about Bill Cosby the man from pudding-pop commercials and TV shows not just because he wanted us to, but because we wanted to. I think some of our collective reluctance to believe more than a dozen women who have accused Bill Cosby of rape stems from our desire to preserve the cultural significance of "The Cosby Show." I was 7 years old when "The Cosby Show" premiered, and over the course of eight seasons, I grew up with Rudy, Vanessa, Theo and Denise, Sondra, Clair and, yes, Cliff, the father character played by Cosby.
