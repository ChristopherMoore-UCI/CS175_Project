Yet if we include tablets within mobile media, we can predict that mobile advertising will surpass traditional digital spending by 2016. Orange's annual independent study into mobile media habits for advertisers, showed that in the UK 82% of mobile media users access the internet primarily via the browser, compared to 61% who accessed internet information from an app. If we focus on mobile phones - then it is our expectation that mobile media will take no more than 20% of digital revenues by 2016. The industry has repeatedly promised a "mobile advertising tipping point," yet despite the proliferation in smartphones, new advertising formats and new promises, mobile advertising is yet to come of age. There are still some hurdles to overcome and lessons to learn, but it is our belief that mobile advertising will have a long and healthy life in the future.
