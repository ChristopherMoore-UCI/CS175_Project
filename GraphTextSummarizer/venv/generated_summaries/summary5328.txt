-- Dozens of demonstrators demanding the revocation of a new protest law clashed with Egyptian security forces in Cairo Tuesday, igniting a firestorm of criticism online and on the streets, state media and activist reported. "Riot police began pulling and pushing everybody, beating us with sticks, grabbing hair, and dragging people. Police later dumped more than a dozen of the female detainees along an empty highway after beating and harassing the group for several hours, several witnesses and activists reported Tuesday. Police fired water cannon and tear gas canisters to disperse two small demonstrations, one against the military trials of civilians and another in honor of a man killed by police last year. I started running and I saw some people were being arrested," activist Gigi Ibrahim told CNN as she described how nearly 200 riot gear clad police officers broke up a demonstration she attended that had around 100 people.
