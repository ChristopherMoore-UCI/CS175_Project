Family wants answers in Florida teen's death after Tasering Laguna Young was the only one of the four who had not been released as of Wednesday afternoon. Officer Terry Mahan of the Tallahassee Police Department and other officers responded to complaints about open-air drug sales in the area, the police department said in a statement Wednesday. It's not clear if Laguna Young, 41, is related to Viola Young. Probable-cause affidavits paint a scene in which officers feared for their safety because of angry residents berating police and calling others to the scene. " Young was medically cleared by Leon County Emergency Medical Services before being sent to the Leon County Jail, along with the other three individuals arrested, police said.
