Other brands like Casetagram have been letting customers use their Instagram and Facebook photos to create unique cases for iPhones, iPads, and Samsung Galaxy devices. Adidas says it's creating mobile apps that will let users make a fashion statement by printing any photo, including Instagram pics, on a pair of shoes. The Instagram post had garnered more than 42,000 likes by Tuesday afternoon, perhaps an indication of potential customers. The technology is part of the relaunch of "mi adidas," the shoemaker's customizable-sneakers program, and is available for its line of Originals lifestyle shoes, such as the ZX Flux (but not its sport shoes). But printing these photos on shoes appears to be new.
