Actor Stephen Baldwin pleaded guilty to repeated failure to file income taxes for three years and will pay $300,000 in back taxes, his attorney Russell Yankwitt said Friday. Baldwin initially needed to pay $400,000 in back taxes, interest and penalties, but the court waived interest and penalties, which brought the total to $350,000, Yankwitt said. The charge was a result of an investigation conducted by the Rockland County, New York, Special Investigations Unit and the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance, authorities said. Baldwin had trusted paid professionals to handle his affairs, especially during the time he was on an island shooting the reality TV show "Survivor," Yankwitt said previously. "Mr. Baldwin is a man of faith, and it's difficult for him to get jobs in Hollywood that are compatible with his faith, and that's one of the difficulties he's had paying off the money," Yankwitt said.
