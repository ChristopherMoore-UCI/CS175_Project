-- A dilapidated building collapsed in Mumbai, India, on Wednesday, killing at least 16 people who had defied orders to vacate the structure, a police spokesman told CNN. Mumbai city officials had told residents living in the old building to leave it because of structural concerns. Rescue workers clear away debris after a building collapsed Wednesday in Mumbai, India. Last July, another building collapse in Mumbai -- formerly Bombay -- killed 26 people. The chief minister of Maharashtra state, Vilasrao Deshmukh, visited the building hours after the collapse to pay his respects to the victims.
