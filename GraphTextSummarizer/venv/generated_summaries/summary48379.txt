She died Thursday as a result of "blunt impact head injuries," said Ellen Borakove, a spokeswoman for the New York City medical examiner's office. The attack occurred in Harlem, just across the street from the station office of Police Service Area 6, which patrols public housing developments in the neighborhood. The death of a transgender woman who was beaten in New York is being investigated as a hate crime, authorities said. "They were called faggots, they were called he-shes, she-males, things of that nature," Dolores Nettles, the victim's mother, told CNN affiliate WABC. Islan Nettles, 21, was attacked in the early morning hours on August 17.
