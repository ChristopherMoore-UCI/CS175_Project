Clearly public health programs such as tobacco taxes and smoke-free public places and housing have worked in reducing smoking rates, but it seems poorer communities are being overlooked. Until we get real about the emotional toll of living in neighborhoods that offer little hope or help and stop the strong promotion of cigarettes, smoking will continue to be one strategy for coping among the most vulnerable members of our society. Single mothers in poor neighborhoods are more likely to experience "double jeopardy," with a high burden of childcare responsibilities coupled with social isolation and the chronic stress associated with neighborhood poverty. Tobacco manufacturers also specifically target young people in lower socioeconomic and minority neighborhoods and sell cheaper cigarettes in poor communities. And childhood adversity is linked to unhealthy behaviors later, particularly to smoking.
