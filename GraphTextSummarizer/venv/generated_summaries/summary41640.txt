Whether manufactured or not, it gave at least a ray of hope for a thirsty citizenry -- as we gather Wednesday in marches across the world, from Lagos to New York, Abuja to London. The relative inaction has only emboldened Boko Haram, which these days invades communities, taunts Nigerians in videos (including the latest this week by its leader Abubakar Shekau), and hoists flags in villages with the ease of an advancing army. In those weeks, at least 11 of the parents have died: seven of the fathers were among 51 bodies taken to hospital in Chibok after the terrorists attacked Kautakari, just nearby, and at least four are confirmed to have died of heart failure, high blood pressure and other illnesses. In a politically charged climate, where everything is interpreted against the backdrop of the coming 2015 general elections, this might be little more than futile hope. The 100-day marker for the kidnap of the Chibok girls stands as the highest symbol for the failure of the Nigerian state to protect its citizens, to defend its territory, to inspire hope.
