But many Nigerians view the subsidy as the only benefit of living in an oil-producing country that has little infrastructure, poor roads, high unemployment and intermittent electric power. The situation is tense amid rumors that people from the north will be attacked, and some 4,000 people have fled their homes and sought refuge in camps, the Red Cross report says. Demonstrators were gathered listening to speeches when police "suddenly came and some were shooting and some were throwing tear gas," said Shehi Ali, vice chairman of the Nigeria Medical Association. "Though we know that in the long run, removal of (the) subsidy will help the economy, for now it is a high-profile lifestyle that is unbearable for most Nigerians, and soon the poorer ones will die out," said protester Diane Awunah. In the southwest, violence flared at some rallies in Lagos, the country's commercial capital, as protesters clashed with police, resulting in seven injuries and three deaths, the Red Cross said.
