(If that wasn't clear enough, there's also the bristly open letter Caldwell wrote to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg earlier this month, in which he pledges "to never write another line of code for rotten-to-the-core 'platforms' like Facebook or Twitter.") Founder and CEO Dalton Caldwell says he's been disappointed by the advertising models of sites like Twitter and Facebook and thinks users will be willing to plunk down money for an alternative. After gaining widespread popularity with no real means of making money, Twitter has begun selling promoted tweets, promoted trends and promoted accounts. " The logic contains plenty of not-so-veiled swipes at both Twitter and Facebook. The multibillion-dollar profits of Facebook come primarly from advertising, leading to a commonly repeated line that Caldwell appears to echo: "If you're not paying for a service, you're not the customer -- you're the product."
