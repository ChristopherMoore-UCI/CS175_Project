Prosecutors withheld from the jury Saldate's personnel record which showed instances of misconduct in other cases, including lying under oath. Key to the case's dismissal was prosecutorial misconduct, mainly that of a detective, Armando Saldate, who said Milke confessed to the crime to him -- even though there was no witness or recording. A day after seeing Santa Claus at a mall on December 1, 1989, young Christopher Milke asked his mother if he could go again. This makes Milke only the second woman exonerated from death row in the United States. The two men with whom Milke was accused of conspiring were tried separately and are still on death row.
