The list of canceled Bill Cosby shows has grown this month. The concert cancellations are the latest complications for Cosby, who has been the subject of numerous sexual abuse allegations. For example, at Cosby's London, Ontario, show, about 100 people came to protest the comedian. "It's a dance that the promoter does with the venue and with Cosby himself," Bongiovanni said of the considerations that go into cancellation decisions. Cosby's website, billcosby.com, no longer lists tour stops, though a list can be found elsewhere on the Internet (including on Pollstar's website).
