-- Kim Jong Un, successor to his father's dictatorship over North Korea, will have to find ways to balance political factions and generate revenue -- or he may not remain in power for long, analysts said Tuesday. Depending on the balance between the new people that support Kim Jong Un and the older generation that upheld Kim Jong Il, things may not necessarily go smoothly within the leadership," he said. "The way to view Kim Jong Un is almost as a CEO of North Korea Inc.," Park said. "Over the span of some 50 hours, North Korea was very effectively able to conceal the death of Kim Jong Il, successfully make the announcement of his death. North Koreans "know much more about the world than they did" when Kim Jong Il came to power, said Caryl, who last visited a few years ago.
