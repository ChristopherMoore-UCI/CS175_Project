-- Longtime women's rights activist and Malawian Vice President Joyce Banda took charge of her homeland Saturday, ending two days of political intrigue after the death of President Bingu wa Mutharika. Banda became vice president in May 2009. However, his popularity plunged as the economy faltered and the nation faced chronic fuel shortages and frequent power blackouts. "The conduct of the honorable Joyce Banda in forming her own opposition party precludes her from being eligible to succeed the presidency," said Patricia Kaliati, who serves as information and civic education minister. The country, she said, would take positive strides under Banda.
