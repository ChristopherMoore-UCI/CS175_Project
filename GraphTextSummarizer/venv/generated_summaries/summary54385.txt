"There does not appear to be any concern about ongoing exposure to norovirus at Harbor Inn," said Doug Urland, health director of Catawba County Public Health Department, in a statement. Several health departments have reported multiple outbreaks, prompting officials to urge residents to take precautions to prevent possible exposure to the virus, which they identified as norovirus. "A case-control study will give us and state health officials the ability to learn more about the nature of norovirus, how it spreads, and what steps may be available to help better prevent this type of illness in the future. The largest outbreak, with 135 cases traced to a single restaurant, was found in Catawba County, said Kelly Schermerhorn, a public information officer with the Catawba County Public Health Department. Following the initial report of illness, Catawba County Public Health's Environmental Health specialists said they conducted a thorough inspection of the restaurant and found no violations.
