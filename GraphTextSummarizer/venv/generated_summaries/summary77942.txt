Cruz reportedly met with top Jewish donors in New York City in November, according to the New York Observer. Cruz, who has been actively courting major Jewish and pro-Israel donors in recent months, will speak at at least one ritzy Passover getaway this spring in California. Grauer added that Cruz may speak at an additional Passover event in California or Colorado, but deferred additional comment to Cruz's office. A tea party and evangelical favorite, Cruz is billed as a speaker alongside several leading rabbis and Malcolm Hoenlein, a major player in the pro-Israel lobby and the executive vice chairman of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations. Sen. Ted Cruz hasn't decided whether he'll be hitting the presidential campaign trail in 2015, but he's scheduled to hit the Passover speaking circuit next year.
