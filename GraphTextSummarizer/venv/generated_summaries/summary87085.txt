-- Assailants terrorized residents of a southwestern Pakistani city Sunday with a deadly suicide bombing that targeted police followed by rocket attacks. The apparent target of the bombing, Balochistan provincial Police Chief Mushtaq Ahmed Sukhera, survived the attack unharmed, Mobeen said. "The blast was so loud it was heard all over the city," police spokesman Syed Ahmed Mobeen said. Voter turnout was nearly 60%, the chief election commissioner said early Sunday. Saturday's voting across Pakistan saw bursts of deadly violence aimed at polling stations, but it failed to deter citizens eager to have their say in landmark national and provincial elections.
