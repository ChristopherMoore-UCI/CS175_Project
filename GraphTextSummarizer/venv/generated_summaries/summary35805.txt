President Jacob Zuma and other members of South Africa's ruling party, the African National Congress, gathered to bid Mandela farewell from the air force base. With so many high-profile guests in South Africa for Mandela's state funeral, security has been a key concern. The Mandela family, President Zuma and Cabinet members will be present as well as local and foreign dignitaries. -- Ten days of mourning for South Africa's anti-apartheid icon and former leader Nelson Mandela will come to an end Sunday with his state funeral. The burial area has been especially built for him; some of Mandela's long deceased family members are already buried at the site.
