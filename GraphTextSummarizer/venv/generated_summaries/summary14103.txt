The Army specialist told HLN's Vinnie Politan that the tight timetable and sheer distance led him to believe that his chances were slim of joining wife Ashleigh Ramirez in Fort Polk, Louisiana, before their child was born. Ramirez said that, throughout the process, he'd been in regular contact with Ashleigh. "I got into a car and pretty much flew down there," Ramirez said from Fort Polk. On Thanksgiving morning, Ramirez said he boarded a flight to Alexandria, Louisiana, then quickly hopped on the road -- still about one hour, 15 minutes from the base in the western part of the state. -- Asbai Ramirez had toiled for months as a U.S. soldier in Iraq.
