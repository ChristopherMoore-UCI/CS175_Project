The breakthrough came when LeBlanc, an FBI counter-terrorism agent, linked Shukrijumah to the thwarted New York subway suicide mission last fall -- the biggest post-9/11 terror investigation. Shukrijumah's mother adamantly denies her son is directing al Qaeda attacks. The FBI says that after he left America, Shukrijumah started off as an al Qaeda dishwasher, doing menial tasks at training camps. Shukrijumah moved up the ladder after two others who directed outside operations for al Qaeda were killed in suspected U.S. drone attacks, the FBI says. On a hunch, LeBlanc asked agents in New York to show that video of Shukrijumah to would-be bomber Zazi.
