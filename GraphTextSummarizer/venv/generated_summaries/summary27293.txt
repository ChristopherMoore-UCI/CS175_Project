"Having carefully considered my evidence and the impact of the two withdrawals, I have come to the conclusion that currently the case against Mr. Kenyatta does not satisfy the high evidentiary standards required at trial," Bensouda said in a statement. African leaders have accused the court of targeting their continent, and have demanded charges against sitting leaders be dropped. A key witness is not willing to testify while another one confessed to giving false evidence on a critical event in the case, according to Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda. -- The International Criminal Court prosecutor called for a delay in the Kenyan president's trial, saying there is no longer sufficient evidence to charge him with crimes against humanity. The trial against President Uhuru Kenyatta was scheduled to start in February.
