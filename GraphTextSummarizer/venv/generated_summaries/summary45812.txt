South Sudan formally split from Sudan in 2011 after a referendum, following decades of conflict. The State Department said U.S. citizens in South Sudan should leave immediately and ordered the departure of nonemergency U.S. government personnel from the country. Ten people were arrested in connection with the foiled coup and five others are still at large, according to a statement posted Tuesday on the South Sudan government website. " In Bor, a town 87 miles north of Juba, the South Sudan Red Cross reported 19 civilians were killed, said U.N. spokesman Martin Nesirky. More than 300 people have been admitted to Juba Teaching Hospital and Juba Military Hospital over the past two days, the organization said Tuesday.
