Sometimes law enforcement exercises so much control over a civilian that his private actions become police action, constitutionally speaking. The bottom line is this: A voluntary confession must be the product of a rational intellect and a free will, not physical intimidation or psychological pressure. However, a confession will only be considered involuntary if it is the product of police activity. Durst would have to establish that the HBO interviewers were direct agents of the police and that the interview was coerced by police. Given the defendant's burden here, it's unlikely that he can convince a judge that, in light of all the circumstances, filmmakers acted as an instrument or agent of police.
