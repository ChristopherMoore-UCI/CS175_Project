" USA Today's Robert Bianco called Tuesday's pilot a "very promising start," adding that "anyone familiar with Whedon's TV work will be happy to see some of his best traits on display: the sideways humor that surprises while staying true to plot and character; the efforts to ground the fantasy in real-world emotion; the belief that events in past episodes (and movies) must have repercussions in the present. It sounds like it could be the setup for yet another Marvel movie, but Whedon and his team, which includes Jed Whedon and Maurissa Tancharoen, have scaled down this superhero universe to fit onto the small screen. Co-creator Joss Whedon, whose career has veered into blockbuster territory with the 2012 film "Avengers," took out time from leading the "Avengers" sequel, "Age of Ultron," to helm "S.H.I.E.L.D.'s" pilot episode. a show like this can't help but look and feel anemic," said New York Magazine's Matt Zoller Seitz. I thought it had some good Whedon-esque hallmarks, while keeping in line with the Marvel mythology.
