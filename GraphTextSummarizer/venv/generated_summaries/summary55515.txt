But this was the Southwest's first wedding where the airline joined the wedding planning team from departure gate to arrival gate. The airline had been prevented from offering that particular route under the Wright Amendment, which Congress passed in 1979 to allow only flights from Love Field to neighboring states (with a few exceptions). -- Love was in the air on Sunday for Dottie Coven and Keith Stewart. The wedding took place on Southwest's first nonstop flight from Nashville to Dallas Love Field. A flower girl walking down the aisle handed out peanuts to start the ceremony, followed by an officiant using the loudspeaker to perform the marriage of Coven and Stewart.
