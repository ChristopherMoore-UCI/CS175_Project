UTair said the aircraft was operated by a subsidiary, Katekavia, and that the parking maneuvers of aircraft and departure conditions were the responsibility of airport ground services. "The problems at departure were caused by weather conditions, in particular, extremely low air temperature which is typical for this part of Krasnoyarsk region and sometimes gets as low as minus 50 Celsius," an UTair spokesperson told CNN. That was the situation at Igarka Airport earlier this week where temperatures of minus 50 Celsius left a Tupolev Tu-134 aircraft stranded on the runway. "While the aircraft was parked at Igarka airport, its landing gear froze on to the aerodrome surface. Video and images circulated on social media show the passengers succeeding in their mission, despite biting winds and freezing temperatures.
