While there's still a lot of work to be done, according to NASA, this spacecraft should eventually be capable of sustaining a crew of up to six astronauts on deep space missions that could last anywhere from six days for a lunar fly-by, to up to 900 days for a Mars exploration mission. Shuttle crews have also repaired space equipment, like the Hubble Telescope. This capsule, touted as the future of NASA, expected to one day carry man into deep space. I just wanted to see the next thing that NASA was going to do, the next part of space explorations. Americans could be headed back to the moon or into deep space toward Mars.
