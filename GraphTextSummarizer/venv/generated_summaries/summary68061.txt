Syrian President Bashar al-Assad indicated Monday he might consider a halt in fighting in the city of Aleppo to allow U.N. humanitarian aid into the beleaguered city, according to Syrian state-run SANA news agency. Al-Assad met Monday in Damascus with U.N. envoy Staffan de Mistura to discuss a U.N. proposal for a fighting "freeze," which was first presented to the U.N. Security Council last month. The plan "merits consideration," al-Assad said after the meeting, according to the Syrian state-run news agency SANA. Aleppo would only be the first local "freeze" in Syria under the U.N. plan. A U.N. statement called the meeting a "constructive" discussion.
