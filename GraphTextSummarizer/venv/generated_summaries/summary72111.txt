" Ellison's Oracle The team will need deep pockets to be a serious contender against reigning champions Oracle Team USA -- owned by tech billionaire Larry Ellison, the fifth wealthiest person in the world according to Forbes. Of the six crew members revealed, four hail from Britain and two from New Zealand -- including three times America's Cup winner Jono MacBeth. The New Zealander was quick to point out that Ainslie was "the type of bloke who always gets in the first round of beers," and you get the feeling this isn't just an assemblage of world class athletes, but close friends hoping to make history together. "They say Ainslie has the Midas touch -- I'm not sure about that, but I have seen him time and time again achieve the impossible," said Olympic gold medalist and CNN's Main Sail presenter Shirley Robertson. "If you could be the brand that brings the America's Cup back to Britain, I think that's a phenomenally powerful thing to be associated with," said Charles Dunstone, chairman of the racing team and co-founder of British phone retailer The Carphone Warehouse.
