-- The pilots of a Southwest Airlines jet that landed at the wrong Missouri airport this week were not directed there by air traffic controllers, and should have known they were landing at the wrong location, U.S. Sen. Roy Blunt said on Thursday. The FAA oversees air traffic control for commercial airline travel. The Taney County airport was not staffed by controllers, but they were in touch with air traffic centers along the way. Blunt said he had talked with Federal Aviation Administration chief Michael Huerta about the incident. Southwest Flight 4013 from Chicago's Midway Airport with 124 passengers was scheduled to land at Branson Airport in southwest Missouri on Sunday night.
