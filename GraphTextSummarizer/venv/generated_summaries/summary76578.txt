-- Two unmanned NASA spacecraft reached the moon's orbit Tuesday morning and began the process of mapping its surface for future missions. The LCROSS is scheduled to crash land on the moon Oct. 9 to search for the presence of water ice in a permanently shadowed crater at the moon's South Pole. The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO), a satellite whose instruments will help scientists compile high resolution, three-dimensional maps of the moon's surface, entered lunar orbit at 6:27 a.m. ET. An unmanned NASA spacecraft captured this image of the moon from about 5,000 miles away Tuesday. The spacecraft sent streaming video back to Earth, shown on a NASA Web site, for an hour as it passed the moon.
