Authorities shut down cell phone service Reports flew around social media, mainly Twitter, on Monday that police in Boston had shut down cellular networks to prevent an attacker from using a cell phone to detonate another explosive. In the aftermath of dramatic events like Monday's bombing attack at the Boston Marathon, it's a truth of our times that millions of people will get early bits of news via social media. "We would like to clarify that the picture circulating on the web and Twitter of a little girl wearing a Joe Cassella 5K bib claiming to have been killed at the Boston marathon is being used fraudulently," read the page for the Joe Cassella Foundation. The "Hope for Boston" account was created on March 24, according to the Web tool When Did You Join Twitter? To be sure, sites like Twitter and Facebook were used extensively by police, relief groups and governments to share important information about the bombings.
