NTSB investigator Jay Neylon said the NTSB is focusing on a seven-hour window in which the Cessna 172R crashed along runway 2C at Nashville International Airport. Aircraft are required to communicate with controllers when entering controlled airspace. Neylon said the safety board had not yet determined whether the pilot attempted to contact air traffic controllers. If the pilot was unfamiliar with Nashville airport's frequencies, he could have used a universal frequency to contact controllers, Landsberg said. The doomed Canadian pilot flies to a major airport apparently without radioing controllers.
