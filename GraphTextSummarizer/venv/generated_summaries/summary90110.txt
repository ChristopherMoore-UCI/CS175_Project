The revelation, as more details surface about Gardner and his history with the criminal justice system, is that the system for dealing with repeat sex offenders and child predators is, in California and probably other states as well, beyond broken. The Associated Press reported yesterday that Gardner violated his parole by moving too close to a school but was allowed to remain free, according to parole records obtained by the news agency. We may never know what parole officers observed and concluded when they observed Gardner on the outside. People want to know how it is that Gardner -- who was sentenced to six years in prison in 2000 for molesting, beating and falsely imprisoning a 13-year-old girl but eventually served only five years and three years on parole -- was apparently able to move freely and do as he pleased. John Albert Gardner III, a convicted sex offender, is charged with murdering King.
