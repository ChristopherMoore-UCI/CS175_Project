"I'm looking forward to hopefully having the chance to go up against him next year on the final day of a tournament," McIlroy said of Woods. After a year which saw him clinch the Masters title, Tiger Woods used his first major triumph as a springboard for one of the most devastating spells of dominance that golf, and indeed sport, has ever seen. In fact, if the 34-year-old can fend off competition from McIlroy at this weekend's Dubai World Championship he will become the first player in the sport's history to finish a season top of both the European and U.S. money lists. " McIlroy has certainly come a long way since that disastrous Sunday at the Masters, with his new-found confidence best illustrated by his response to the question, "Would you back yourself to win a major next season?" His three-word answer: "Yes I would." One such player is Australia's Jason Day, who finished second at the Masters and U.S. Open during a breakthrough 2011.
