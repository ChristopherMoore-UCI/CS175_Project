The grand jury hearing evidence on the Michael Brown shooting is preparing to meet Friday for what might be its final session, and a decision on whether to charge Officer Darren Wilson could come the same day, law enforcement officials briefed on the plans said. They point to witness testimony and leaked grand jury documents that suggest Brown might have attacked Wilson, struggled for his gun and perhaps even charged the officer after the tussle over the weapon. Brown's shooting on August 9 also touched a national nerve, with protests decrying racism and police brutality taking place around the country since his death. The city's police will wear normal uniforms, as "we do not want to appear to militarize our response to the demonstrations and want to do everything we can to de-escalate," the mayor wrote, adding that police may don riot gear if public safety demands it. Rather, he wrote, they will be placed with police officers at 45 locations around the city to prevent violence and property destruction.
