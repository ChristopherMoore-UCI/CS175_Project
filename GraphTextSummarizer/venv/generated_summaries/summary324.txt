The death penalty trial of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has been delayed by painstaking jury selection, crippling snowstorms and last-ditch appeals for change of venue. Tamerlan Tsarnaev died during a gun battle with police, and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was found hours later, bleeding and hiding in a boat in a Watertown backyard. The officer was ambushed in his patrol car and shot to death as Tsarnaev and his brother, Tamerlan, ran from police hours after their photographs were released to the public. If Tsarnaev is convicted, the jury then will decide whether he should be punished by life in prison without the possibility of release or death, most likely by lethal injection. A U.S. appeals court has rejected a fourth request to move the trial for the accused Boston Marathon bomber to another city.
