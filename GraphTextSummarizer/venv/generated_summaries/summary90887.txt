For a senior high school student, a study routine will include self-study sessions at school, cram school classes and more self-studying hours late into the night at private cubicles. From elementary school ages, South Koreans will spend many hours in cram schools after their regular classes. Younger students gathered in large groups outside school gates, some having arrived at 4a.m. to mind a good spot, waiting to support their school seniors. In order to reduce the financial burden from private education and encourage the students to rest, the current Lee Myung-bak administration placed a ban on operating private classes after 10pm. In a country where more than 80% of high school students move on to higher-level education, getting into a prestigious school is all the more competitive.
