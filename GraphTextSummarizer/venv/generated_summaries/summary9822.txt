The result left Atletico in seventh place on goal difference above Getafe, who won 4-1 at home to Deportivo La Coruna earlier on Saturday. Messi broke the deadlock in the 17th minute as he cut in from the right in trademark fashion and fired a left-foot shot from the edge of the box across goalkeeper David de Gea. In Italy, Udinese moved up to fifth place with a 2-0 win at home to Sampdoria as Chile midfielder Alexis Sanchez opened the scoring in the 18th minute and striker Antonio Di Natale netted his 100th league goal before halftime. In Sunday's top games, leaders AC Milan travel to Genoa, champions Inter Milan host Roma, second-placed Napoli are at home to Cesena and Lazio welcome Chievo. January signing Alessandro Matri scored the opening two goals against his former club, while veteran striker Luca Toni came off the bench to seal victory six minutes from the end with his first for Juve.
