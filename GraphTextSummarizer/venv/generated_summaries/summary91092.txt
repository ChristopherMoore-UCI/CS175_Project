This is a day when fans get to show the world how much we love the "Star Wars" world you created; a day to show just how large the fan base is; that "Star Wars" is one of the greatest movies ever made. Is there a chance that you did not know why May the 4th was special to "Star Wars" fans? Of course, I thank you for the incredible, imaginative world you created with "Star Wars," and for the happiness it's brought me and all your fans. If we feel taken advantage of by the Star Wars May the 4th page, should we e-mail Lucasfilm? -- Dear Mr. Lucas, Happy Star Wars Day to you!
