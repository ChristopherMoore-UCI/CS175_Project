FBI: $2.1 million reward paid in Bulger case "The sentence ought to take into account the broader effect of Greig's conduct," wrote prosecutors, who are also seeking a $150,000 fine and three years' supervised release. Affleck, Damon to produce, star in Whitey Bulger film After more than 16 years on the run, she and Bulger were captured in Santa Monica, California, last July. Prosecutors say Greig could have walked away at any time but protected Bulger instead, and in so doing deprived victims' family members of reasonable justice. Bulger is accused of 19 murders during his reign of terror in South Boston during the 1970s and '80s.
