In court papers filed Monday, prosecutors argued that Alexander "repeatedly flouted" the limits of her bond by running errands, taking shopping trips and taking relatives to the airport. -- Florida prosecutors have asked a judge to tighten conditions or revoke bond for Marissa Alexander, who faces a second trial for firing a gun to scare off her allegedly abusive husband. She said her husband had read cell phone text messages that she had written to her ex-husband, got angry and tried to strangle her. 'Stand Your Ground' laws up to states, not Obama or Congress Corey had said she offered Alexander a plea bargain that would have resulted in a three-year prison sentence -- but Alexander chose to take her chances at trial, where a conviction would bring an enhanced sentence for the use of a firearm.
