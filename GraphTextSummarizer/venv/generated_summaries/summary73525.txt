And Evans says he's even been approached by pigeon racers and hawk owners to see if the G-Paws might work for their birds. "He was actually traveling a couple of miles pretty much every night, visiting other houses and we suspect those other houses were feeding him," says Evans. Now that the mystery of Yollo's expanding waistline has been solved, Evans has developed the "G-Paws" device he says will be available soon for purchase by other curious pet owners. The light weight, waterproof device takes a recording every five seconds and Evans says it is accurate to two or three meters so you can see the precise route of your furry friend.
