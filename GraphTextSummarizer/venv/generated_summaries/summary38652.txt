-- Furious winds, giant waves and lack of sleep have all plagued the journey of Dilip Donde, the first Indian to attempt sailing solo round-the-world. The scale, is the international standard for determining wind speeds based on observable sea conditions, such as the height of waves. The scale goes from zero (no wind, glassy sea) to 12 (hurricane winds of over 100 kilometers per hour and "phenomenal" seas with waves that can sometimes reach above 17 meters). Sailors seek out the exhilaration that comes from sailing in strong winds -- just under 40 km/h is ideal -- but it's a fine line, and as winds get stronger, delight can be tinged with anxiety which can quickly turn into terror. Rounding Cape Horn was bad too with steep breaking waves, strong currents and winds gusting to 45 knots (83 km/h) in the "roaring forties."
