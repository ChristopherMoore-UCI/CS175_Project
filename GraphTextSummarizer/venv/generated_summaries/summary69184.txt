The civil war broadly pitted Palestinian and pro-Palestinian Muslim militias against Lebanon's Christian militias, devastating the country in the process. With the formation of Israel in 1948, thousands of Palestinian refugees flooded into Lebanon altering the country's finely balanced demographic. According to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), the international body set up to ensure the welfare of Palestinian refugees, there are about 400,000 officially registered Palestinian refugees in Lebanon, or approximately 10% of the population. According to the FCO, Lebanon is home to 18 separate religious sects and several different ethnic groups. The country had an estimated 4,125,247 people in July 2010, according to figures from the CIA Factbook, although no official census has been taken since 1932 because of the sensitive political balance between Lebanon's various religious groups.
