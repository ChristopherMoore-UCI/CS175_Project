ISIS has released a new video of British hostage John Cantlie, this time showing him in the Syrian border city of Kobani. In a segment that lasts for more than five minutes, Cantlie argues that -- unlike Western media accounts of recent days -- Kobani is mostly under control of the terror group, which calls itself the Islamic state. In the video, Cantlie describes weapons from a U.S. airdrop that he says made their way into the hands of ISIS -- a claim the group also made last week. In the first video of him released by the group last month, Cantlie made clear that he was forced to share a message from ISIS. A U.S. official said last week that one of 28 bundles dropped in and around Kobani drifted away from its target zone.
