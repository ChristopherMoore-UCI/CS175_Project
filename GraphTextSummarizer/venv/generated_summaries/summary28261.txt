-- Sweden's Carl Pettersson and Tiger Woods were neck and neck as the second round of the U.S. PGA Championship at Kiawah Island, South Carolina drew to a close on Friday. Pettersson, who posted a six-under par round of 66 on Thursday, made a shaky start to his second round collecting two bogeys in the opening three holes, before hitting back with three birdies. Early exits are also expected for Spain's Sergio Garcia who finished seven-over par, Lucas Glover and current U.S. Open champion Webb Simpson. John Daly slipped down the leaderboard into a tie for 16th on Friday. The club professional from Dayton, Ohio slumped to a 21-over par 93 on Friday -- one short of the all-time high score at the tournament.
