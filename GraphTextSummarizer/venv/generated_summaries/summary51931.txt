Adam Scott won the 77th Masters golf tournament in Augusta, Georgia -- and the green jacket that goes to the champion -- on Sunday, beating Argentine Angel Cabrera on the second hole of a thrilling, sudden-death playoff to become the first Australian ever to win the Masters. Scott survived his own painful ordeal in last year's British Open, when he bogeyed the last four holes at Royal Lytham and St. Annes Golf Club to lose by a stroke to Ernie Els. For years, Scott, who has been ranked in the top 20 of the official world golf rankings for the better part of a decade, was considered one of the best golfers to have never won one of golf's four major championships: the Masters, the U.S. Open, the British Open, and the PGA championship. "There was one guy who inspired a nation of golfers, and that's Greg Norman," Scott said. Australians had come in second in the Masters seven times before, most recently when Scott and Jason Day, who finished third this year, tied as runner-ups in 2011.
