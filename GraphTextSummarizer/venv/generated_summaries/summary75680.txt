Arab leaders can no longer turn a blind eye to the abhorrent behavior of fellow Arab rulers. Whereas popular discontent was traditionally channeled toward Israel and the West, collective Arab opprobrium is now targeted at brutal Arab regimes. In the short term, a more active Arab role may indeed make non-Arab nations hesitate to get involved -- but as was the case in Libya, the Arab League might actually be providing the necessary regional legitimacy for outside intervention. Gone are the days when Arab leaders could act with total disregard for their people's opinions. This sentiment is motivating Arab leaders to respond to their people's anger, through the Arab League.
