The capital, the biggest city in the Vanuatu island chain, sits on the coastline, which is vulnerable to storm surges during powerful cyclones. CNN host Bill Weir, who was recently in Vanuatu on assignment, said that while Port Vila has some modern development in the form of an airport, large hotels and a convention center that's under construction, life on some of the islands has remained almost unchanged for thousands of years. "The strongest thing they've got is cement churches," said Inga Mepham, program director for CARE International for the Vanuatu program. Meteorologists said the storm has weakened some, but it was still pounding the islands after hours of fierce winds and torrential rain. Pam, one of the strongest storms seen in the South Pacific in years, earlier made a direct hit on the capital, raising fears of mass destruction.
