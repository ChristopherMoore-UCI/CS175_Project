"Frank Lautenberg has been one of the most productive senators in the history of this country," Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, said in December 2011 on the occasion of Lautenberg's 9,000th vote, the statement by Lautenberg's office said. On the Democratic side, Newark Mayor Cory Booker announced in January he intended to run for the Senate next year, which caused a public tiff with Lautenberg, who later decided against seeking re-election. According to New Jersey law, Christie can appoint a temporary replacement to serve until a special election in November or fill the rest of Lautenberg's term, which expires next year. He announced in a statement in February that he would not seek re-election next year, but he continued to push for stronger gun control laws. Lautenberg was first elected to the Senate in 1982 and won re-election twice.
