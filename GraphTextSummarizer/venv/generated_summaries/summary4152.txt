Red Bull -- the only other team to win races in 2014 -- will be hot on the champion's heels while a resurgent Williams -- the only team to deny Mercedes pole position -- is out to go one better on race day next season. But, despite the swirling emotions of fighting mano a mano with his Mercedes teammate and close teenage friend Nico Rosberg, Hamilton impressively kept his head above water to win a second world title with some style. The Mercedes rivals tested each other's limits in Bahrain, where Hamilton had cut across Rosberg to retake the lead. In Monaco -- where the pair happen to live in the same apartment block -- Rosberg was accused and cleared of blocking Hamilton during qualifying. Rosberg was forced to apologize to Hamilton after he collided with the rear of his Mercedes in an attempt to retake the lead, effectively putting his rival out of the race.
