It's part of a trend of beloved shark programming that has found favor with viewers, including Syfy's campy made-for-TV movies "Sharknado" and "Sharknado 2: The Second One." The much-anticipated annual summer event has turned pop cultural phenomena and saw #SharkWeek and 10 other related trending topics rise on Twitter as fans took to social media to discuss the shows. Discovery offers multiple programs throughout the week to feed the shark pop culture frenzy and viewers used Sunday to dive right in. That made it the network's 13th highest-rated prime time evening ever with the biggest viewership gains coming from women 25-54. Sunday night's programming attracted more than 3.6 million total viewers.
