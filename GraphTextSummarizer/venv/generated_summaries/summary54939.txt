John Myers and his family from Bloomfield, New Jersey, were visiting Madison, Wisconsin, to attend a friend's wedding Saturday at the state Capitol. According to Myers, the family went outside after the ceremony to take pictures. It was only after walking away that he realized he had forgotten his bag -- which contained his wallet, hotel and rental car keys and other family valuables. "Looking back now it wasn't a good idea to leave my bag so far away," Myers told CNN on Tuesday. Unbeknown to him, Myers -- as he captured the scene -- also caught a person red-handed stealing his bag.
