Their aim is to introduce insect farming to countries with an affinity for insect consumption and a lack of access to nutritional sustenance. "You won't see it everywhere in Ghana, but in places where it is consumed, it is consumed with quite a high affinity," says Ashour. While the project in Ghana is fairly new (Aspire launched the program less than three months ago), Ashour has high hopes for it, ultimately envisioning his weevil products to reach 30% of the market in Ghana. I think what they eat is lacking in nutrition," says Dr. Clement Akotsen-Mensah, an entomologist and research fellow at the Forest and Horticultural Crops Research Center at the University of Ghana. While the government supplies pregnant women with iron pills and vitamins, Ashour says locals aren't always too amenable to taking them.
