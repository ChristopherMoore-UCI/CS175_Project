About three-quarters of Americans support U.S. airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq and in Syria, and 38% even support putting U.S. ground troops in Iraq or Syria. Top U.S. military officer: U.S. ground troops to fight ISIS, if necessary The Obama administration moved quickly to tamp down any suggestion that the United States would deploy combat troops. America's top military officer raised the specter Tuesday of U.S. troops in Iraq taking on a combat role to fight ISIS, a position that was quickly knocked down by the White House. The Pentagon's spokesman, Rear Adm. John Kirby, characterized Dempsey's statement as a hypothetical, saying on CNN's "Amanpour" that the chairman was speaking about his "best military advice" should U.S. troops in Iraq need to act in an advise-and-assist role with "lower level units." Gen. Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the Senate Armed Services Committee that it was possible that U.S. troops advising and assisting Iraq's military could be deployed to fight.
