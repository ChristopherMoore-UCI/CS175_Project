It seems likely that in the immediate aftermath of Kim's death, North Korea will be run by a collective leadership, perhaps headed by Kim's brother-in-law Jang Song-taek, as Kim Jong Un is prepared to assume official power. Even the year of his birth -- 1942 -- has been contested by knowledgeable sources in South Korea and Russia, who claim Kim was born a few years earlier but that his official birth date was pushed back to make him exactly 30 years younger than his father, North Korea's founding leader, Kim Il Sung. Kim Jong Il led North Korea not to reform and opening, like his Chinese contemporaries, but through economic catastrophe, famine and repeated nuclear confrontations with the United States. But defectors' reports suggest the view of Kim within his own country is more mixed, and while his father is still widely revered, Kim Jong Il is associated with the trauma of famine and crisis in the late 1990s. No one outside Pyongyang's inner circle knows what kind of leader Kim Jong Un will be and where he will take the country.
