Where jurisdictions cannot meet this threshold, we will object -- under the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and other laws -- in order to guarantee that all eligible citizens have unrestricted access to the ballot box," said Holder. For example, the Justice Department in March blocked a controversial new Texas law requiring voters to present personal identification before going to the polls, saying it could have a discriminatory effect on Hispanics and other minorities. Addressing the La Raza conference, the attorney general discussed how his department has responded over the last 18 months to proposed laws that could make it more difficult for some voters to cast ballots. The House of Representatives voted last week to hold Holder in contempt for refusing to turn over documents tied to the program. Attorney General Eric Holder promised Saturday to do all in his power to protect Americans' right to vote.
