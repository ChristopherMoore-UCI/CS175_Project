For the second time since the U.S.-led effort to counter ISIS began, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Martin Dempsey, said he would not rule out asking the President to send U.S. ground troops into Iraq. While McKeon and others are calling for more U.S. involvement in Iraq and Syria, other members are expressing frustrations over the fact that the United States is potentially becoming involved in another protracted foreign war. And the Iraqi Security Forces, already U.S.-trained once before at great cost, initially fled in large numbers as ISIS advanced into northern Iraq. Dempsey told the committee that he could envision scenarios in which a U.S. ground contingent would be necessary in Iraq, particularly if the coalition moves to retake Mosul or the western border with Syria. Rep. Buck McKeon, R-California, the committee's chairman, expressed concern about President Obama's consistent refusal to consider sending U.S. ground troops to the region.
