However, his reported unhappiness at Real appears to be water under the bridge after Los Blancos ended Barca's three-year La Liga title reign in fine style, setting records for points and goals scored. "The manager has won La Liga and the Copa del Rey, establishing impressive records at the club and in every championship, therefore prompting his contract to be extended," Real's website reported. He matched Ernst Happel and Giovanni Trapattoni in winning in four different European countries, including his own -- only Bela Guttman and Tomislav Ivic have clinched league titles in more nations. This season brought more European disappointment, losing to Bayern Munich in the semis after a penalty shootout, but there was consolation on the domestic front as Real finished nine points clear of Barca. He took Real Madrid to the semifinals last season for the first time since 2003, and also won the Spanish Cup.
