Allowing kids to "fail" has different meanings to parents, says Vicki Hoefle, author of "Duct Tape Parenting: A Less is More Approach to Raising Respectful, Responsible, and Resilient Kids." "And this is where some of the confusion comes in. Lahey, who has spent more than a decade teaching middle and high school students, has become somewhat of an expert in this area, after her article "Why Parents Need to Let Their Children Fail" in The Atlantic back in January 2013 went viral. " Lahey says her biggest piece of advice for parents is to move away from any focus on the end results, namely grades and test scores. "Every single time we turn around and say, 'I'll just do that for you' or 'Here let me help you with that,' we are saying to them, 'I don't think you can do that for yourself,' " said Lahey, who is also a columnist for The New York Times and a contributor to The Atlantic and Vermont Public Radio. "And that is really damaging over time. We create a really helpless culture of kids so that now when I talk to college professors, they say these kids show up to college unable to handle anything on their own."
