Weeds particularly broke ground with Parker's Golden Globe-winning portrayal of a suburban pot-dealing matriarch, a performance that was later followed by other female anti-hero programs like Showtime's "Nurse Jackie" and FX's "Damages." "From a creative standpoint, the show broke a bunch of barriers," Beggs says. "There were two shows, 'Weeds' and 'Dexter,' that really got Showtime taken seriously for cutting-edge original programming," says Showtime entertainment president David Nevins. "No matter how close she's gone to the edge of everything falling apart, she reels the story back in, grounds it, and brings you back," says Lionsgate TV Group president Kevin Beggs. Weeds helped pave the way for other daring cable shows and made Showtime a competitive force in the original series game. Showtime and "Weeds''" studio Lionsgate Television Group have full faith that Kohan will deliver a stellar final batch of episodes.
