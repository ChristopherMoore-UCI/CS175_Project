"Each city reflects the full spectrum of living well in its own unique way -- innovative restaurants and markets with nutritious local foods, abundant spaces for walking and other exercise, and a population that takes advantage of both," says senior editor Phillip Rhodes, who headed up the project. The result, we think, is a ranking of U.S. cities that best provide the resources people need to live healthful lives. Seattle appears to be a place where healthful living comes easily and naturally, Cooking Light says. In our list, the city ranks third in restaurants rated "extraordinary to perfection" and third in nominations for James Beard awards. To celebrate our 20th year of publication, Cooking Light wanted to know what places best fit our philosophy to eat smart, be fit, and live well.
