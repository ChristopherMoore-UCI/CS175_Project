The Obama administration drone strikes also seem to be having more success eliminating militant leaders, as at least 13 have been confirmed killed in drone attacks since Obama was inaugurated in January 2009, compared with 16 during the Bush administration's five years of authorizing drone strikes in Pakistan. -- Last week the U.N.'s senior official for extrajudicial executions, Philip Alston, argued in a critical report and remarks delivered in Geneva, Switzerland, that the United States should explain the legal rationale for the CIA's campaign of drone strikes in northwest Pakistan, which he characterized as "a vaguely defined license to kill" that has created "a major accountability vacuum. The criticism of the drone program by the United Nations official Philip Alston seems to have had little impact on the Obama administration, which is plowing ahead with drone strikes in Pakistan's tribal regions on the grounds that they are "effective, exact and essential." As Pakistan gears up for operations in North Waziristan -- the last redoubt for a militant m√©lange that includes the Haqqani network, various factions of the Afghan and Pakistani Taliban and al-Qaeda -- the United States has fired more drone strikes than ever into this region: 37 of 2010's 39 reported strikes have hit targets in North Waziristan. So far no drone strikes appear to have targeted Osama bin Laden, who occasionally releases audiotapes taunting the United States as he did a few weeks after the alleged botched Christmas Day attempt by an al Qaeda affiliate to blow up a Northwest Airlines passenger jet over Detroit, but who otherwise has vanished into the wilds of the Afghan-Pakistan border region.
