A U.S. Navy SEAL was killed in a parachute accident in Perris, California, near Riverside, a U.S. Navy official told CNN on Wednesday. He was the epitome of  the quiet professional in all facets of his life, and he leaves an inspiring legacy of natural  tenacity and focused commitment for posterity," the Navy said in a news release. He was identified Thursday as Special Warfare Operator 3rd Class Jason Kortz, 29, of Highlands Ranch, Colorado. Kortz was part of a West Coast-based Navy SEAL team. Kortz joined the SEALs in September after enlisting in the Navy two years earlier.
