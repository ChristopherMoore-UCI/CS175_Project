Beginning with the NASA Commercial Orbital Transportation Services competition, continuing with the Commercial Resupply Services (cargo) and now the Commercial Crew selection, NASA "bet the farm" on commercial companies filling the gap left by the retirement of the space shuttle, with the Commercial Crew companies (SpaceX and Boeing) replacing the Russians in bringing NASA astronauts to the ISS. I believe it is critical that both commercial cargo and crew succeed for at least two reasons: First, NASA's proper role can be summed up in three words: "Explore Deep Space." As an aerospace professional and former NASA executive, I have encountered over the decades many concepts for private space exploration. As with the early 20th century airmail routes that helped stimulate aviation, NASA's commercial programs are now the anchor tenants in the government transfer of space services to the private sector. This will allow NASA to invest the savings in deep space capabilities such as SLS and Orion.
