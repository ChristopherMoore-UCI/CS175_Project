"She didn't want to change it, but I did." Veering from the topic of his movie, Perry told Winfrey he felt the need to reiterate how hard the Jackson family worked to try to save their brother. Tyler Perry, she added, was by her side the entire time, asking her how she wanted to be treated on set, making sure no one had access to images of Jackson crying in character (lest a tabloid run them as evidence of what Jackson was going through at the time), and even changing the ending of the movie, which opens nationwide Friday, for her. " Her brother's passing happened right as Janet Jackson had started production on Tyler Perry's new film, "Why Did I Get Married Too?" and the emotional turmoil she was in comes through in the film, Winfrey said. " The family was worried, Jackson said, and did several interventions. The emotional turmoil Jackson was dealing with, both in her role in Perry's movie as well as personally, began to affect her physically as well: Jackson said she's definitely an emotional eater.
