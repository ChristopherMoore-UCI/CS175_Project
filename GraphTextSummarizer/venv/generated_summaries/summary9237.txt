-- One day before U.S. President Barack Obama's Canadian visit last week, Canadian fighter jets intercepted two Russian bombers near Canadian air space, the defense minister said Friday. "At no time did Russian planes enter Canadian air space, but within 24 hours of the president's visit here ... we did scramble F-18 fighter planes from NORAD in Canada command," Peter MacKay said in a news conference in Ottawa. The Russian planes were identified as TU-95 Bear aircraft by NORAD spokesman Michael Kucharek. Canadian jets intercepted Russian TU-95 Bear bomber aircraft last week similar to this one.
