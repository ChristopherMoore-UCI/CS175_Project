One set is played in each of men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, mixed doubles and legends doubles. Max Eisenbud, the agent of both Maria Sharapova and Li Na, told CNN on Thursday that neither would be appearing in the team tournament that is set to make its debut in Asia this November.

"In Asia, there is enormous potential (for tennis to grow), in places like China and India due to the amount of people that live there and the excitement they have for tennis. Pros from the U.S. and Europe also face the prospect of making the long trip to Asia -- after completing the Asian chunk of the schedule weeks or a month before.
