The announcement of the arrests comes on the same weekend a funeral was held in El Paso for two of the three people associated with the U.S. consulate in Juarez who were killed last week after they left a social gathering. Six people, including 26-year-old U.S. Air Force Airman David Booher, died in a November 2009 shooting carried out at a strip club in Juarez, according to Juarez Mayor Jose Reyes Ferriz. According to the press release, Arias was also the apparent leader of the drug cell "Los Linces," and it was that cell that ordered the killing on January 31 in southern Juarez. Arias "was at one time in U.S. custody, but was later deported to Juarez," Reyes said. About 200 U.S. federal, state and local authorities interviewed more than 100 Barrio Azteca members and associates in El Paso and southern New Mexico on Thursday, the U.S. Justice Department said.
