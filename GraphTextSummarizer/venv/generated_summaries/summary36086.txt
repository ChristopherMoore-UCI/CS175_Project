Jumbaz joined the rebel Free Syrian Army and fought alongside other members of the armed opposition to liberate an opposition enclave in Homs. "There are enough Free Syrian Army troops to protect us now, but I noticed how difficult the situation is around us," Jumbaz said. Before the Syrian civil war turned Homs into a conflict zone, Jumbaz owned a baked-sweets business, selling cakes and candy to the mainly pro-government Allawi and Christian districts near his native neighborhood in Homs' Old District. I am proud that I married one of the revolutionaries, and I am proud to be here in old Homs defending my nation and my dignity." Now, Jumbaz spends his days kneading rations of flour and bits of butter into dough, creating sweet, creamy Syrian desserts.
