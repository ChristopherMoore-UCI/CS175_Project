The Lynch family says their hope is that Inzinga will become completely self-sustaining and a model for other villages in South Africa. As of this planting season, Isipho has helped start gardens at every crÃ¨che, primary school and secondary school in Inzinga. Assuming it would be the only time he and his daughter would set foot in South Africa, Tom wanted Miranda to see more than the commercialized landscape of the reserve. Volunteer your time or make a donation to help Isipho provide fencing, seeds and know-how to the people of Inzinga, South Africa. The soil is fertile in Inzinga, but many people can neither afford the supplies nor have the knowledge to cultivate the land.
