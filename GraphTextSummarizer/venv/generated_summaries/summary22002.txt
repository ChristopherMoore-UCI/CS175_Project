The Knight claim alleges the Navy and the VA missed a numerous "red flags" that Alexis presented a foreseeable risk, citing his run-ins with authorities where his mental health was called into question. The claim accuses the VA of failing to diagnose and hospitalize Alexis, who "sought assistance for mental illness" at a VA hospital on August 23. His father told Seattle police in 2004 that his son was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder after taking part in 9/11 rescue efforts, according to police records. The FBI has said Alexis, a contractor who had been discharged from the Navy, was under "the delusional belief that he was being controlled or influence by extremely low frequency electromagnetic waves" in the days leading up to the shooting. The claim alleges the Navy should have known that Alexis exhibited a pattern of "emotionally unstable behavior," citing his general discharge in 2011 for misconduct.
