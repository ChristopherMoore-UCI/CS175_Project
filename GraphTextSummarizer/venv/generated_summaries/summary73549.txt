The incident started when authorities got a call that a black male was yelling and jumping in front of cars, Madison Police Chief Mike Koval said. She said Madison police park on street corners in African-American neighborhoods and wait for something to happen, which leads to residents being hassled. Because Robinson did not have a weapon, the death spurred memories of other unarmed black men killed by police: Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. Koval said he knows it may be difficult for Madison to move forward after Robinson's death. "In light of so many things that have happened not just across the country, but in our own community, it's understandable that the reaction at the scene and of some of our citizens is extremely volatile, emotional and upsetting," Chief Koval told CNN affiliate WKOW-TV.
