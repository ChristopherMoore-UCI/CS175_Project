You can participate in the "waterfall challenge" at California's Whiskeytown National Recreation Area, commemorate the opening battle of the American Revolutionary War at Minute Man National Historic Park in Massachusetts or experience how Civil War soldiers lived in a living history encampment weekend at Appomattox Court House National Historic Park in Virginia. In 2013, national parks across the country saw 273.6 million visitors, with an average of 784,000 visitors per day during the month of April when National Park Week is always observed. Parks and scenic trails like Yellowstone National Park in Montana are not the only areas that make up the National Park Service. "National Park Week definitely raises awareness of national parks as great places to visit," Kupper said. Entrance fees will be waived at all U.S. national park sites this Saturday and Sunday, April 19-20, to kick off National Park Week, which runs through April 27.
