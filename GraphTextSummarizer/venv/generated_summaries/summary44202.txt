But Michigan's did and, as in Utah, scores of same-sex couples sought and got marriage licenses before later court decisions halted such unions -- at least for now, as higher courts weigh in. Friedman's ruling was the latest in a series of recent similar decisions affecting marriage restrictions in states including Texas, Virginia, Kentucky and Oklahoma. U.S. District Judge Bernard Friedman issued an order Friday that invalidated a state constitutional amendment restricting marriage to between one man and one woman because, in his view, it violated the U.S. Constitution. Couples marry before court halts licenses "Because the stay brings Michigan law on this back into effect, the rights tied to these marriages are suspended until the stay is lifted or Judge Friedman's decision is upheld on appeal," Snyder said, referring to the state's ban on gay marriages.
