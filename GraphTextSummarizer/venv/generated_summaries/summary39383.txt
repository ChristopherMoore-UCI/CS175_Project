To combat these gaps in expectations, states began to develop expectations for student learning, broad guidelines meant to spell out what students should know and be able to do in core subjects at different grade levels. Once students learn how to decode, reading comprehension is directly linked not just to their fluency with reading skills, but also with their knowledge and vocabulary. Before state standards, schools, districts, and teachers held different students to different expectations. Teachers should indeed be in charge of classroom instruction, but quality standards are an important piece of a comprehensive effort to boost student achievement. Today, ample evidence shows this strategy succeeds, so long as rigorous standards are accompanied by tests that measure student learning and accountability for results.
