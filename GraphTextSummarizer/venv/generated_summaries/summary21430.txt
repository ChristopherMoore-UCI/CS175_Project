Advisers to the project include Salman Khan of Khan Academies, Melinda Gates and Jackie Bezos, the co-director of the education-oriented Bezos Family Foundation and mother of Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos. "From local cuisine, health and wellness and parenting to sports, music, comedy, animation and news, this new lineup of original channels will have something for everyone," said Robert Kyncl, YouTube's global head of content, in a blog post. But increasingly, the Web's leading video site has also been working to become the Internet's cable provider, mixing channels of its own original content, often in partnership with established stars, into the mix. On Monday, it announced plans for another 40, with an international bent that includes channels from France, Germany and the United Kingdom. New U.S. offerings include health-food channel Super Foods, The Creators Project from Vice and Above Average Productions, featuring short comedy clips by writers from "Saturday Night Live," "30 Rock," the Lonely Island comedy troupe and elsewhere.
