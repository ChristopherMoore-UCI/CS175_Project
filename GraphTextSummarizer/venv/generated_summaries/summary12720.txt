-- About 2.5 million young people have received health insurance coverage as a result of health care reform measures that President Barack Obama signed into law last year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Wednesday. Young adults have traditionally been the age group least likely to have health insurance, the Department of Health and Human Services said. "This is the result of a bipartisan policy change that was also in our alternative -- there was no reason it had to be enacted as part of a job-killing government takeover of health care," Michael Steel, spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, said Wednesday. About 2.5 million more people, aged 19 to 25, have health insurance than had it before the law took effect because of a provision that lets young adults remain on their parents' insurance plans through age 26, the agency's National Center for Health Statistics said. The new estimates show that by the following June, the percentage of insured young people in that age group rose from 64% to 73%, Health and Human Services said.
