"If users increasingly access mobile products as a substitute for access through personal computers, and if we are unable to successfully implement monetization strategies for our mobile users," the company writes in its filing documents, "our financial performance and ability to grow revenue would be negatively affected." Facebook currently makes little revenue from its mobile app — the app doesn't include ads, and only started to include "sponsored posts" in users' news feeds last March. In fact, the report revealed that Facebook users spent more time accessing the social network on smartphones than on computers in March. The comScore report also revealed that smartphone users spent more time on Facebook than on any other social media network, including Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest and Foursquare. By comparison, users spent 391 minutes — or 6 hours, 31 minutes — checking out Facebook on PCs.
