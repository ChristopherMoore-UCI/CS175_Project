-- Seven people, mostly tourists, were killed Thursday when a small plane crashed in southern Peru near the famous Nazca Lines, the official Andina news agency reported, citing Nazca police. The plane belonged to Nazca Airlines, which had not made a statement as of Thursday afternoon. The Nazca Lines are believed to have had ritual astronomical functions, according to UNESCO, which designated them a World Heritage site in 1994. Though they're virtually indecipherable from the ground, from the air they are clearly visible as a monkey, a killer whale, a hummingbird, a condor, a pelican among flowers, trees and geometric shapes. They were constructed by the Nazca culture about 2,000 years ago.
