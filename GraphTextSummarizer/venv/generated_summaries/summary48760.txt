During an unsuccessful search for the man inside the zoo, police and zoo employees found a patas monkey that was seriously injured near an exhibit where the suspect was last seen. The animal died; the cause of death was determined to be blunt force trauma to the head and neck. "I speak for many of us in the police department and the community who were angered and outraged over this senseless crime," said Boise Police Chief Michael Masterson. Monkeys need to be housed in social groups, and so ... Michael J. Watkins, 22, faces two felony charges, burglary and grand theft.
