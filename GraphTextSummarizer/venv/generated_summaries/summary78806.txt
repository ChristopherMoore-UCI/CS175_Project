You may have heard the wonderful story in recent days about what happened when CNN senior producer David Daniel was walking to work at the network's Los Angeles bureau. Except the name on the star was: Julia Luis Dreyfus. In our computer-screen age, typos -- and their cousins, misspellings and grammatical errors -- have been given a reprieve. The theory seems to be that, in e-mails and instant messages and various other forms of digital discourse, speed counts for more than accuracy, and those whose blood pressures rise when they see such typos are stodgy, ancient, out of touch. It would have imbued typos with the seriousness they deserve, and would have been an inspiring triumph for sticklers everywehre.
