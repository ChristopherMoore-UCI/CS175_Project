Despite the sudden Internet fame, Ague is "keeping a level head," said fellow patrolman Scott Firestone. A photo of officer Nick Ague carrying the 75-pound dog over his shoulder was posted to the South Londonderry Township Police Facebook page on Sunday getting more than 6,000 "likes" and 1,300 "shares." "If you look on our Facebook page you can see we've searched for lost hikers and things like that," Firestone said, but "by far this is the most attention anyone in our department has received." On Sunday, Ague responded to an accident involving at least one vehicle in Palmyra, the department posted on Facebook. When Mya finally came to a stop, Ague realized her paws were injured -- presumably from running across hot asphalt and the rough terrain, the department posted on Facebook.
