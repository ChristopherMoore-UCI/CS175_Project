That marked "The Voice's" most-watched finale to date, and it also surpasses the 14.3 million who watched "American Idol's" 12th season finale on Fox in May. That veteran singing competition is undergoing a slew of changes, as Fox has announced that longtime producer Nigel Lythgoe is departing "Idol," along with judges Randy Jackson, Mariah Carey and Nicki Minaj. -- "The Voice" crowned Texas teen Danielle Bradbery its new winner on Tuesday, proving to the country singer that she could do what she'd thought to be impossible. New "The Voice" coach Usher Raymond saw one of his mentees, Michelle Chamuel, land in second place, while the Swon Brothers from Shelton's team came in third. The 16-year-old claimed the title during Tuesday's finale of the NBC singing competition, which was packed with performances from Cher, Bruno Mars and "Voice" coach Christina Aguilera, who will return to the series next season after a short hiatus. But perhaps the updates will benefit "Idol" in the same way it's worked for "The Voice," which temporarily brought in Usher and Shakira as coaches this season in place of Aguilera and Cee Lo Green.
