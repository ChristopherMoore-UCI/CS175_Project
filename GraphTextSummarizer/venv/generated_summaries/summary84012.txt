Romney needed to win both states, but especially Michigan -- where he grew up when his father was governor -- to assert his ability to overcome the conservative challenge from former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum. While noting it was "easy to see how Mitt Romney can lose this," Gergen added that it was "very hard to see how any of his rivals can win it." Michigan and Arizona come four days before Washington state holds its caucuses on Saturday and a week before 10 states hold primaries and caucuses worth 437 delegates on Super Tuesday.

Speaking to reporters in Livonia, Michigan, on Tuesday morning -- his first news conference in nearly three weeks -- Romney called the tactics by Santorum and Democrats "a real effort to kidnap our primary process.
