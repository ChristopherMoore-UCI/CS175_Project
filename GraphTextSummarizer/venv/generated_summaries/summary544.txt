-- A Delaware pediatrician is facing numerous charges in the alleged sexual abuse of his patients, authorities said Wednesday, and there may be "multiple victims." Dr. Earl Bradley, 56, who has had a practice in Lewes, Delaware, for more than 10 years, is charged with eight counts of first-degree rape; four counts of second-degree rape; 14 counts of sexual exploitation of a child; and two counts of endangering the welfare of a child, Delaware Attorney General Beau Biden told CNN. Police said they have seized photographic and video evidence showing Bradley abusing victims, WBOC said. Biden stopped short of that, saying only authorities think there may have been multiple victims, and the investigation is ongoing. Biden urged parents or others who have concerns regarding Bradley to contact his office, where a hot line is staffed with people who can provide information including counseling referrals. The charges against Bradley, and any additional charges that are filed, will be presented to a grand jury "at some point," Biden told CNN.
