Thirty-one animals rescued from flood waters in southeastern Missouri are heading to St. Louis, including 24 domestic rabbits found abandoned inside a cotton gin trailer, according to CNN affiliate KSDK. The Corps reported river levels had fallen more than a foot since engineers detonated explosives late Monday night at Birds Point, Missouri, briefly illuminating the night sky like lightning and sending water coursing across a floodway that Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon described as "literally the most productive part of our continent." Two other Mississippi River sections along the Missouri-Kentucky border will reopen Wednesday or later, she said. While the plan appeared to be working -- the level of the Ohio River fell where it joins the Mississippi -- record crests and relentless pressure from millions of gallons of water still threatened communities throughout the Mississippi and Ohio river valleys. The intentional breach of a levee on the Mississippi River is sending 396,000 cubic feet per second of water onto 200 square miles of fertile Missouri farmland.
