The region's governing football body for football has confirmed that the team, known as the "Hawks", will take no further part in the tournament being hosted by Angola after failing to appear for their first group game against Ghana on Monday, according to CNN affiliate ITN. The CAF has also ordered a moment of silence to be observed in memory of the slain Togolese before each match in the first round of the tournament, it announced Monday. " The head of South Africa's World Cup organising body, Danny Jordaan, has told CNN that his country will not suffer the same security lapses that have occurred in Angola. Angolan authorities have arrested two people involved in the attack, state media reported, while goalkeeper Kodjovi Obilale remains in a stable condition in a South African hospital but needs a ventilator as he recovers from being shot. "Togo have not taken official steps to come back and play the African Nations Cup," it quoted an unnamed CAF official as saying before Monday night's abandoned match.
