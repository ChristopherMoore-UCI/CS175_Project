"The branch model is outdated and not relevant any longer we're looking to create a different kind of bank one that offers all the products and services of a large bank but delivers them with real community engagement and the service of a great retailer or hospitality company," said Eve Callahan of Oregon-based Umpqua Bank. Using what it calls the store concept, Umpqua Bank aims to create for banking what Apple or Gap has done for computing and apparel -- that is set up a space where customers, or just the curious, can browse, rest or come in and do some banking. We welcome everyone regardless of whether they have a relationship with us or not," said Abdul Sanger, Universal Associate, at Umpqua Bank. Ultimately, banking is based on trust and Umpqua has found its local branches a perfect place to build that relationship. Customers that want a meeting room can use one of Umpqua's at no cost.
