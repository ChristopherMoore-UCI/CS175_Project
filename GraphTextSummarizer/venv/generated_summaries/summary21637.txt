That includes Metro-North service for a 30-mile stretch between New Haven and South Norwalk, Connecticut, and Amtrak service between New York and New Haven. Amtrak released a statement Sunday night saying that service between Boston and New Haven also would be limited, and "there is no estimate on service restoration." National Transportation Safety Board investigators looking at the accident, along the corridor from New York to New Haven, Connecticut, are focusing on a broken rail as a possible cause for Friday's rush-hour collision. The train heading from New York City to New Haven derailed around 6:10 p.m. and struck the other train in Bridgeport, Connecticut, Weener said Saturday. Because of a bridge replacement project, those two tracks are the only way in and out of New York City by train from that part of Connecticut.
