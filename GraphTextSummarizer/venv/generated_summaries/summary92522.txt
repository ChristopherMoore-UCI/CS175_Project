In anticipation of the Apple announcement, Google announced a set of improvements last week to Google Maps in what it called part of "the never-ending quest for the perfect map." Significantly, 3-D modeling, one of the features touted by Apple on Monday, was among the upgrades. "We believe Apple will continue to add content partners for Siri to marginalize Google's presence on the iPhone." Even enhanced Facebook integration (it's cooked right in to iOS 6, making sharing to the site seamless), can be seen as a jab at Google's efforts to gain a foothold in the social media world with Google+. A brand new map system, complete with 3-D imaging and voice-assisted, turn-by-turn navigation is clearly Apple's effort to keep iPhone and iPad users home instead of clicking on what had been the system's go-to app, Google Maps. At least one expert on Monday saw Apple's latest moves as a strategic way to limit Google's mobile growth. "We believe the biggest takeaway is that Apple is strengthening not only the interaction within its own ecosystem, but also creating a consortium of powerful web partners to offer an experience that largely falls outside of Google's walls," said Gene Munster, an industry analyst with Piper Jaffray.
