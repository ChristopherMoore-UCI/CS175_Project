It said a second collapse had occurred after rescue workers arrived and a third took place Saturday, but that no rescuers were injured in the latest collapse. At least 53 people died in Thursday's collapse at the Maxima supermarket, in the west of Latvia's capital, national news agency LETA said Saturday. "The area is very dangerous and unstable, and the decision has been made to search the area with less men, so to prevent anymore collapses," the news agency said. -- Latvia's president has described the deadly collapse of a supermarket roof in Riga as "basically mass murder" of defenseless citizens, local media reports. LETA earlier quoted a State Fire and Rescue Service spokesman as saying rescuers had begun searching the "least stable" area of the site Saturday.
