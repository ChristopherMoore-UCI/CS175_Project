While the asteroid is moving at a good clip, space rockets have to accelerate to an even higher speed to escape Earth's gravity and make it into space. At least two start-up companies, Planetary Resources and Deep Space Industries, plan to mine asteroids and sell the acquired bounty on Earth and in space. "Its orbit is very well-known," said Dr. Don Yeomans, NASA specialist for near-Earth objects. Opinion: Don't count 'doomsday asteroid' out yet Asteroids are potential gold mines Asteroids can be chock full of metals and other materials, which could be mined for use on earth or on space stations. Being able to exploit asteroids' resources would allow humans to fly farther out into the solar system, build stations a long way from Earth and supply them with materials gathered out in space.
