"We will continue targeting Pakistan military until it stops supporting the U.S.," said Azam Tariq, the central spokesman for the group. The teenager detonated his explosives after walking onto the grounds where army recruits were receiving their morning training, according to police chief Abdullah Khan. -- A teenage suicide bomber killed at least 27 army recruits and wounded 42 others Thursday when he blew himself up at a military training center in northwest Pakistan, officials said. The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for the blast, saying it was a "message for those who wish to join (the) pro-American military." The attack took place in Mardan, a district 50 kilometers (31 miles) north of Peshawar in Pakistan's Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province, formerly known as the North West Frontier Province.
