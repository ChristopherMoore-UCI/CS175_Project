-- Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama emerged victorious in the first election returns of the 2008 presidential race, winning 15 of 21 votes cast in Dixville Notch, New Hampshire. McCain ultimately won the state of New Hampshire, while Sen. Hillary Clinton upset Obama there. The town, home to around 75 residents, has opened its polls shortly after midnight each election day since 1960, drawing national media attention for being the first place in the country to make its presidential preferences known. Though New Hampshire  is a perennial swing state, Dixville Notch -- until now -- had consistently leaned Republican. However, since 1996, another small New Hampshire town -- Hart's Location -- reinstated its practice from the 1940s and also began opening its polls at midnight.
