The singer "underwent the placement of an Impella peripheral left ventricular assist device for stabilization prior to transferring hospitals," Travis spokesman Kirt Webster said in a written statement Tuesday. Travis had recently been on the road, performing in Detroit on June 28 and Chicago on June 29. "Mr. Randy Travis is out of surgery and in critical condition," the hospital website announced Wednesday night. " Word of his setback came just hours after his doctors said Travis had "stabilized and he has shown signs of improvement." Randy Travis suffered a stroke and underwent surgery to relieve pressure on his brain Wednesday evening, his publicist said.
