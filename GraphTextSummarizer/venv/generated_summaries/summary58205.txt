But Italy's top court ruled that judges, not politicians, should be the ones to determine if a defendant is free to appear in court. Berlusconi is under investigation for allegedly having sex with the teenager, say prosecutors in Milan, who are linking the case to prostitution activity. -- Allegations that Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi had sex with a teenage prostitute are "mud" thrown on him by political opponents who want to get rid of him, the scandal-prone politician said. Berlusconi allegedly asked Minetti to serve as Ruby's tutor so the girl would be able to leave prison. Milan prosecutors started the investigation of this case in December after the premier called police and urged the teen's release from prison.
