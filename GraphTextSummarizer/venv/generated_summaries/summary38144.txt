Police took Moore into custody at the grocery store Tuesday morning, said Boulder police spokeswoman Kim Kobel. -- A man suspected of planting a bomb at a mall in Littleton, Colorado, on the 12th anniversary of the attack at Columbine High School was arrested Tuesday at a grocery store in Boulder, authorities said. Federal court records show Moore was sentenced to 18 years in prison for a March 2005 robbery at the Whitesville State Bank in Crab Orchard, West Virginia. Moore allegedly planted the bomb at the mall just one week after he was released from the medium-security Federal Correctional Institution in Estill, South Carolina, authorities said. Moore, who was turned over to federal authorities, was scheduled to appear in federal court in Denver on Wednesday, FBI Special Agent Jim Yacone said at the news conference.
