The artifacts, some of the oldest in ancient civilization, are from the "age of ignorance," ISIS says, before the advent of Islam. In a battle between Iraqi forces and ISIS over control of Tikrit recently, the tomb of Saddam Hussein was squashed to rubble, though it's not clear which side did it. ISIS has smashed priceless ancient statues in Mosul, bulldozed the ruins of Nineveh and Hatra, and dynamited centuries-old churches, mosques and shrines. Safa ad-Din Hassan and other parents took Iraqi scouts on a camping trip near Babylon to teach them about their history and make ancient artwork with them. Iraq will defend its heritage against ISIS, said Mohamed Hattab from Iraq's Antiquities Department.
