The new game from creator David Jaffe and Eat Sleep Play not only brings back some familiar and twisted characters, but it also reworks a demolition-derby style of combat that pits vehicle against vehicle with explosive results. Starting with Sweet Tooth's iconic ice cream truck, the virtual garage includes a motorcycle, a helicopter, a semitruck and even an ambulance that vaguely resembles Ecto-1 from "Ghostbusters." There are several game modes available to allow for split-screen action and online play. Some smash-ups are played out in little towns with residents running for cover (or, inevitably, getting run over). The story that acts as a backdrop for the behind-the-wheel chaos makes learning about combat fun.
