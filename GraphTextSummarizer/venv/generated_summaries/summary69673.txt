Two platoons from Dominguez's battalion, Temecula police and firefighters, city officials, representatives from the foundations, city residents and Emmy-winning actor Gary Sinise were on hand to celebrate as Dominguez took possession of his new house. Dominguez and his family received the house on September 11. After 9/11, how we honored our son's memory Temecula enthusiastically anticipated his relocation and welcomed him with American flags lining his motorcade's route on the morning of September 11. "Giving Juan a measure of his life back after all he has done, on the anniversary of the day our brother died, means the world to us," said Frank Siller, chairman of the Tunnel to Towers Foundation. Dominguez, who is from New Mexico, chose Temecula because he fell in love with the city after several visits.
