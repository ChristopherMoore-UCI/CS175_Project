Guns are extremely lethal as a means of suicide. My hope is that people will recognize the very real threat of suicide, know that it is preventable, and act to keep guns out of reach. Though guns lack intent, they are suggestive of death. Mental health treatment has not made a dent in suicide statistics, but reducing access to the most lethal methods can drastically lower overall suicide and murder rates. -- I am a mother of three, and my views on guns have evolved significantly over the course of my lifetime.
