"At its core, this is an abuse-of-power case involving a sheriff and sheriff's office that disregarded the Constitution, ignored sound police practices, compromised public safety, and did not hesitate to retaliate against perceived critics," said Assistant U.S. Attorney General Thomas Perez. -- The sheriff of Maricopa County, Arizona, lashed out Thursday at Justice Department officials, calling their civil lawsuit alleging civil rights violations against him and his county politically motivated. "This incites obvious and unwarranted hostility toward the inmates, potentially placing prisoners and officers alike in harm's way," Perez said. "Attempts to forge solutions to address the serious civil rights and public safety concerns have proven elusive," Perez said. The December letter said detention officers in Arpaio's jail invoked slurs and profanities against Latinos, calling them "wetbacks," "Mexican bitches" and "stupid Mexicans." Arpaio has denied any discrimination, and one of his attorneys called the Justice Department investigation a "witch hunt."
