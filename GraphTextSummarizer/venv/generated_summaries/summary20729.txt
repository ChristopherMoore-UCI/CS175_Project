When "Daily Show" host Jon Stewart tore into Sen. Dianne Feinstein for complaining about the CIA removing classified documents from her staff's computers after giving the intelligence community a pass on spying on private citizens, he joined a chorus of civil liberties advocates who say she's being hypocritical. House intel chair warns of penalty if CIA searched Senate computers Privacy and civil liberty advocates hope more oversight will occur now that members of Congress have gotten a personal taste of intelligence gathering practices they find objectionable. These types of actions have always been "dangerous to a democracy" even when they happen to ordinary private citizens, civil liberties advocates said. The Justice Department is weighing whether to investigate CIA claims that Intelligence Committee staffers accessed material they shouldn't have seen while reviewing millions of documents at a Virginia facility. Privacy advocates and civil liberty groups hailed Feinstein's diatribe against the CIA's tactics as a watershed moment in urging stronger checks on the executive branch's spying practices.
