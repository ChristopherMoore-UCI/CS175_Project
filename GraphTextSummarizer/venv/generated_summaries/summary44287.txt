Chris Cline, vice president of clinical services at Skyland Trail, a mental health services facility in Atlanta, said it's not clear from Holmes' appearance whether mental illness is a factor. He knows that spending life in a psych ward with meds will be a lot better than spending hard time on death row in a maximum security prison." HLN's Dr. Drew Pinsky believes it's likely that Holmes is suffering from some sort of mental illness, and probably should have been on medication if he wasn't already. " Holmes may have been medicated, said Chicago clinical psychologist Daniela Schreier. Asked Monday whether Holmes was medicated for his court appearance, Arapahoe County Undersheriff David C. Walcher said he did not know, and couldn't reveal that information to the media even if he did. Others say he may have just been exhausted, or feigning mental illness to game the judicial system.
