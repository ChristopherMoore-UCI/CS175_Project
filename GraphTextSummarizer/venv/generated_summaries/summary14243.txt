Water cannons and thermal imagery systems are in place in a bid to defend against potential pirate attacks. "This is a moving house," says the Director of Palmer Johnson Europe, Russell Morris. Designed in conjunction with Rolls Royce and boat makers Palmer Johnson, the ice class superyacht aims to be the ultimate luxury home on water. Makers hope the yacht will be a keen sailor's mega mansion on water, with room for offices kitted out with the latest in satellite technology and a classroom for the children. The hangar, which also comes equipped with a re-fueling system, means that the helicopter is protected from the elements and can stay on-board while the PJ World yacht explores.
