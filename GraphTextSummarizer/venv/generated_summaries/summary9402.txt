He is charged with first-degree murder in the November 2012 death of 17-year-old Jordan Davis, one of four black teenagers who were in an SUV shot by Dunn -- who is white -- in violence that flared from an argument over loud music. But Assistant State Attorney Erin Wolfson said Wednesday that Dunn's claims don't add up. " Trial draws comparisons to another Florida case The Dunn case has drawn parallels to the trial of George Zimmerman in the killing of teenager Trayvon Martin, which like the current trial had racial overtones and claims of self-defense. Dunn defense attorney Cory Strolla told CNN's Chris Cuomo on Friday that the Zimmerman and Dunn cases aren't so similar in his mind. Dunn rolled down his window and asked the youths to turn it down, which they did, but then turned it back up, Wolfson said.
