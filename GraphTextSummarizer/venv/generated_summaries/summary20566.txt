Piccard:  With Solar Impulse we want to demonstrate what can be achieved today with renewable energy and technologies that allow energy savings. This project voices our conviction that a pioneering spirit with political vision can together change society and reduce society's dependence on fossil energies. At the same time, the excess of energy will charge the 400 kg of batteries. The industries will have to reduce their consumption by using energy savings technologies and switch to renewables. The objective of this first prototype is to demonstrate by this summer, the feasibility of a night flight propelled only by solar energy.
