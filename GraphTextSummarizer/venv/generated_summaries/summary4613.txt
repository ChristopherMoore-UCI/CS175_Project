The newspaper admitted to taking photos of the 33-year-old's body during a cornea removal surgery in a operating room after her death on Friday evening at a Shenzhen Hospital. The allegations unleashed a storm of criticism about media ethics on social media. A Chinese newspaper has come under fire for taking photos of the body of Yao Beina, a popular singer, at a hospital morgue after her death from breast cancer. The Shenzhen Evening News issued an apology on Sunday on their official Sina Weibo account, a widely used Chinese social media site, confirming the incident. Allegations of the incident surfaced on social media a day after the news of the 33-year-old's death broke.
