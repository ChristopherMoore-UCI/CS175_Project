After pleading guilty last year to charges of conspiracy, wire fraud, money laundering and filing false federal income tax returns, she's awaiting sentencing in federal court. -- Spanish art dealer Jose Carlos Bergantiños Diaz helped persuade wealthy buyers to shell out millions of dollars for works he claimed famous masters of modern art had painted. The alleged scheme stretched for nearly two decades, involved several New York art galleries and earned the conspirators more than $30 million, according to an indictment unsealed in federal court on Monday. To make the paintings more convincing, Bergantiños bought old canvases at flea markets, stained newer canvases with tea bags to make them look older and gave Qian old paint to use. A number of civil cases against him are still pending, according to federal court records.
