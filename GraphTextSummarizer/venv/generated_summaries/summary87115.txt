The real Rocky is one of boxing's true characters, a burly former Marine nicknamed the Bayonne Bleeder who went from fighting in smoky New Jersey clubs to knocking down (but not out) the mighty Ali. Wepner is Rocky, the man who went almost the full 15 rounds (the fight was stopped in the 15th) with Ali in 1975 to inspire the Oscar-winning movie. Flip it over, and you'll find a photo of a young Wepner, boxing trunks pulled over his navel, standing over a fallen Ali in the ring. "The night I lost, my (ex-)wife is sitting on the edge of the bed in the neglig√©e and she asks, 'So, am I going to Ali's room or what?'" But you don't have to meet Wepner to know why he's famous -- and why he's about to become even more well-known in the coming months. Promoter Don King had chosen Wepner to fight Ali, but no one had bothered to tell him.
