Sony Pictures is expanding its "Ghostbusters" movies with Ghost Corps, a collective headed by original "Ghostbusters" director Ivan Reitman and star Dan Aykroyd, that will oversee the expansion of the movie franchise beyond a cinematic universe into television and merchandising. New all-female 'Ghostbusters' cast chosen Joe and Anthony Russo, the duo behind "Captain America: The Winter Soldier" and who signed a first-look deal with Sony last week, are being tapped to produce and direct the new movie. Drew Pearce, who penned "Iron Man 3", will write the script while Channing Tatum, another Sony favorite after the 22 Jump Street movies, will also produce with his partners Reid Carolin and Peter Kiernan. The first order of business will be to develop a new male-oriented "Ghostbusters" that will be released after the much ballyhooed female-centric movie being put together by Paul Feig.
