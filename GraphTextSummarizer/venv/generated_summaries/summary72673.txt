CNN exclusive: Bush on AIDS, Mandela, Snowden and his legacy Retirement Retirement seems to have afforded Bush opportunities for fun and fulfilling charity work. Bush used the opening to land the first shot at the late-night host, who will go off the air next spring after 20 years on the tube. Bush has largely avoided it since he left the White House in 2009, and Leno couldn't help but immediately pry into the reason why. Leno showed a video of Bush dancing with locals in Zambia, making them laugh, and photo of the former Chief Executive painting a clinic. Bush made a gift to Leno of a portrait of the comedian, which he painted himself.
