Authorities said they were tipped off in February by a confidential informant who said garages and auto body shops in the city were "equipping vehicles with special compartments to traffic drugs." The District Attorney's office said the arrests Wednesday are a direct result of a series of arrests in September 2011 by the Dangerous Drug Offenders Unit that involved members of the Sinaloa Cartel, one of the largest drug cartels in the world, operating out of Sinaloa and Juarez, Mexico. -- Seventeen people were arrested in Philadelphia in a multimillion dollar drug bust, with the help of a member of one of the world's largest drug cartels, the Philadelphia District Attorney's Office announced Wednesday. It is unclear if the informant who tipped the police off in February and the Sinaloa Cartel informant are the same person. The city's Dangerous Drug Offenders Unit seized almost $3 million worth of cocaine in the bust, as well as 16 vehicles and five guns, after a three-month investigation.
