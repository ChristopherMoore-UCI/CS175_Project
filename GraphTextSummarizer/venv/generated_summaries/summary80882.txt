Marussia driver Jules Bianchi underwent emergency surgery for a "severe head injury" after crashing in the closing stages of Sunday's Japanese Grand Prix. As Sutil's car was being recovered, Bianchi's Marussia careered off at the same place, plowing into the truck which was being used to remove Sutil's car. Sutil was out of his car when he witnessed Bianchi's crash. But at the presentations all the drivers' thoughts were with Bianchi and the traditional champagne-spraying celebration did not take place. Medical staff rushed to Bianchi's aid and he was taken to the nearby Mie Prefectural General Medical Center by ambulance.
