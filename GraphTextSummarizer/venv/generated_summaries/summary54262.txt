Three have been hospitalized and one is at home, said Health Minister Jose Gomes Temporao. -- Both people who died of swine flu in the United States had pre-existing health problems, federal health authorities said Thursday in a report. In Buenos Aires, Health Minister Graciela Ocana confirmed Argentina's first H1N1 case -- a man who arrived April 25 from Mexico. The 22-month-old child who died April 27 of the flu, also called H1N1, had neonatal myasthenia gravis, an autoimmune disease, said the report, which was written by a virus investigation team at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and published online in the New England Journal of Medicine. It said that 36 of the 399 patients with confirmed H1N1 infection whose hospitalization status was known had been hospitalized.
