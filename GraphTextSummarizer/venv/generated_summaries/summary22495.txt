"Over the next 20 years, the numbers of people with dementia are anticipated to increase by 40 percent in Europe, 63 percent in North America, 77 percent in the southern Latin America ... and 89 percent in the developed Asia Pacific countries," the report said. "In comparison, the percentage increase is expected to be 117 percent in East Asia, 107 percent in South Asia, 134-146 percent in the rest of Latin America, and 125 percent in North Africa and the Middle East." One in seven Americans age 71 and older, or about 3.4 million, have dementia, according to the National Institutes of Health. "In the same way physical exercise can delay many of the effects of aging on the body, there's some evidence cognitive exercise can at least delay the onset of Alzheimer's." A combination of antioxidants, supplements and curry may also help. It's common for people with Alzheimer's or other types of dementia to wander from their homes.
