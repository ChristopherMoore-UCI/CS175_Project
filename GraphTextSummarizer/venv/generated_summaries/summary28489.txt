"Police were in a standoff with the vehicle just down the hill," said CNN photographer Gabe Ramirez saw the chase end in Watertown. Police ran down the streets of Watertown, according to CNN affiliate WCVB, which broadcast images from the pursuit. Students and faculty received e-mails to alert them to the event, CNN affiliate WCVB reported. Dozens of police from various units arrived in Watertown, some in SWAT uniforms, others wearing helmets. But even with all this activity it was unclear if the arrest in Watertown was related to the shooting on the MIT campus or any other incident in the Boston area.
