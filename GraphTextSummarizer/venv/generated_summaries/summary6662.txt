Its 14-page complaint named Biogenesis, its predecessor company and six individuals -- among them program director Bosch, others at the company, someone who worked at a sports agency, a former University of Miami baseball player and a "self-proclaimed chemist" who supplied substances. Major League Baseball has dropped its lawsuit against Anthony Bosch and the company the league claims provided performance-enhancing drugs to a number of players, including Yankees star Alex Rodriguez, a league spokesman said Tuesday. According to Major League Baseball, the accused solicited players, supplied them with drugs and offered dosage recommendations to help them avoid testing positive for banned substances under the league's program. After a surge in home runs in the late 1980s and 1990s -- highlighted by Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa racing to break Roger Maris' single-season home run record in 1998, followed three years later by Barry Bonds breaking the new record -- Major League Baseball was accused of not doing enough to recognize and combat the use of performance enhancing substances. Besides Rodriguez, suspended players included Milwaukee Brewers outfielder Ryan Braun, the 2011 National League MVP.
