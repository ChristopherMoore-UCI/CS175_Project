Chief among them are growing income equality between countries, as the global "South" (Africa, Latin America, the Middle East and Asia) develops, at the same time that there is increased income inequality within many nations. Many of these people are part of the top global 1-5% of income earners (a group which is otherwise dominated by individuals in developed countries). China and India have been key in promoting greater global income inequality between nations. World Bank research indicates that, for the first time in about 200 years, overall global income inequality (one of the key measures of economic inequality) appears to be going into reverse. But if emerging market growth decelerates faster than anticipated, or income inequality within countries accelerates, this process could go into reverse.
