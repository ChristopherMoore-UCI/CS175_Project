Richard Beasley faces multiple counts of aggravated murder, kidnapping and aggravated robbery as well as a host of other charges, according to the 28-page indictment released Friday by the Summit County prosecutor's office. "This case, we view to be one of the worst of the worst when it comes to horrible murder cases." Beasley will be formally arraigned on the charges next Wednesday morning, prosecutor's office spokeswoman April Wiesner told CNN affiliate WJW by e-mail. As outlined in the indictment, Beasley is the "principal offender" in the murders of three men between August and November 2011, Summit County Prosecutor Sherri Bevan Walsh said. Brogan Rafferty, 16, of Stow, Ohio, who is a high school sophomore, is facing charges of aggravated murder and attempted murder in connection with the killings, and prosecutors are seeking to try him as an adult, according to CNN affiliates WKYC and WJW. The wounded man -- who was identified in the indictment as Scott Davis, 48, from South Carolina -- told the law enforcement officer that he had answered an ad on the Craigslist website offering work caring for cattle on a 688-acre property in eastern Ohio.
