"We are aware of 10 deaths," said Gen. Manuel Garcia Ruiz, public security secretary in Michoacan. Nearly 43,000 people have been killed in drug-related violence since President Felipe Calderon took office in December 2006, according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. At least 14 people were killed in the western Mexican state of Michoacan -- including 10 slain during a shootout with soldiers, authorities said Friday. Their bodies were found Friday morning in a vehicle riddled by bullets, according to police. Various cartels, including the Knights Templar, La Familia Michoacana and Los Zetas, are known to operate in the area.
