The prisoners escaped the al-Kwyfah facility in Benghazi early Friday, but only 18 have been captured, city security spokesman Mohammed Hujazi told Libya News TV on Saturday. Residents living next to the prison stormed the facility because they didn't want a prison in their neighborhood, said Ali Zaidan, prime minister of Libya's transitional government. Hujazi, the city's security spokesman, said the security apparatus in Benghazi "suffers from the lack of manpower and equipment." Zaidan said the country's border posts have lists of the escaped prisoners. Authorities rushed to the scene, but were instructed "not to draw arms against citizens," Zaidan said.
