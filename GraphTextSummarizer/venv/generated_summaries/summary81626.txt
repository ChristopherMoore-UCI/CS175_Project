Although that may be true to some extent -- Drew Brees of the New Orleans Saints made the top five of Forbes' "World's Highest Paid Athletes" list last year -- the reality is that the majority of players are not so lucky. "The perception in the past has always been that sports players in America can earn the major bucks," Sporting Intelligence editor Nick Harris told CNN. Last year the Premier League sold its broadcasting rights to Sky and BT in a record-breaking deal worth around $4.98 billion, while overseas TV deals brought in another $3.35 billion. Perhaps the biggest misconception when it comes to wages in sport is that NFL players take home some of the heftiest pay packets. According to the report, which looked at 294 teams in 15 leagues in 12 countries across seven different sports, the average first-team player to ply their trade at the English Premier League club earns $8,969,407 per year, or $172,488 per week.
