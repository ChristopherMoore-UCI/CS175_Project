Thursday's launch was the first time North Korea had fired Scud missiles, which have a range that covers the whole of the Korean Peninsula, since 2009, South Korea said. Foreign policy experts say the North Korean missile firings may not herald a repeat of last year's saber rattling from Pyongyang, which included threats of preemptive nuclear strikes against the United States and South Korea and the declaration that the armistice that stopped the Korean War in 1953 is null and void. On Thursday, four Scud missiles with a shorter range were fired into the sea off North Korea's eastern coast -- flying about 220 kilometers (137 miles), according to Yonhap -- just days after the start of annual joint military exercises between South Korea and the United States. North Korea's missile capabilities Last year's exercises triggered weeks of heightened tensions between the nations and North Korean threats of nuclear war. North Korea opposes such exercises, which routinely cause friction among the three countries.
