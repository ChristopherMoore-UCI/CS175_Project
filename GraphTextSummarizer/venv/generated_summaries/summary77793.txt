Police charged Cristofaro with illegal possession of animals, ANSA said. Cristofaro used the crocodile to intimidate people, notably entrepreneurs, to pay him more money, Italy's ANSA news agency reported. Cristofaro, who the Forest Service said comes from a mafia family, already had a criminal record for weapons-related charges, resisting police, and extortion, ANSA reported. The Forest Service is now holding the reptile at an animal center near Rome, ANSA reported. Authorities discovered the animal during a search for weapons at Cristofaro's home, LAV said.
