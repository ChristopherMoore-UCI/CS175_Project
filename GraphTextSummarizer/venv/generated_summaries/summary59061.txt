In the aftermath of Jackson's breakthrough success, MTV helped usher rap into the mainstream with shows like "Yo! MTV Raps," and black artists like Prince and Chaka Khan became mainstays of the network. When MTV launched in 1981, it modeled its playlist on the popular album-oriented rock radio format of the day, which meant that music by black artists was effectively excluded from the network. MTV was called to task on the air in 1983 for its lack of black artists by none other than David Bowie. At a time when MTV was criticizing for not featuring black artists, Michael Jackson's success changed all that. It was just what MTV considered rock music.
