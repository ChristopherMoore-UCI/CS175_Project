Sheen, on the other hand, had the cold toughness of loathing, anger and regret, a comic style almost radical (for prime time) in its thin ash of contempt. It's not as if anyone would blame Lorre: Sheen's outrageous behavior earlier this year left a top-rated sitcom without a completed season, without an anchor -- and, regardless of how you regard Sheen personally, without one of the best sitcom actors in prime time. I think if creator Chuck Lorre could have had all the cast and crew come out shrieking and tear apart a lifelike effigy of departed star Sheen, with blood and viscera and intestines tossed into a vat of hot oil, he would have. And so the first half of the episode practically danced with sadistic, vengeful glee in explaining how Sheen's character, the irredeemably low-life womanizer Charlie Harper, had perished: At a memorial service, crazy Rose (the very funny Melanie Lynskey) hinted that she had shoved him under the Paris Metro after she caught him cheating during their honeymoon. Except that, as mentioned, he is apparently better endowed than Young Frankenstein and, unlike Mr. Sheen, possesses a body that can be paraded around naked with a preening, unembarrassed confidence.
