While Mexican authorities said Wednesday that Rodriguez was associated with the Sinaloa cartel, U.S. officials offered a slightly different biography of the trafficker. Eventually, pressured by the Sinaloa and Gulf cartels, the Rodriguez brothers moved their operations to Leon, Guanajuato, and established a strong relationship with the Zetas drug cartel. Luis Rodriguez Olivera, alias "El Guero," was arrested at Mexico City's airport Tuesday, federal police said in a statement. The Rodriguez brothers were indicted in New York in 2009 for drug trafficking. According to Mexico's Ministry of Public Security, Rodriguez and his brothers Esteban, Daniel and Miguel were part of a criminal ring known as Los Gueritos, who smuggled drugs into the United States between 1996 and 2008.
