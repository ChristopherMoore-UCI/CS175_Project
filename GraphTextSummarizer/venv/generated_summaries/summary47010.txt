For years, Nobel Peace laureate Shirin Ebadi has been speaking out against human rights violations in her country of Iran, where her defense of political prisoners and support for human rights and democracy have earned her the ire of the ruling regime. It was very important that the U.S. government and other member countries of the U.N. Human Rights Council voted to condemn Iran's human rights violations and to assign a special U.N. rapporteur on human rights for Iran. Q: How can citizens of the U.S., Europe, and other countries help promote human rights in Iran? A: I preferred to be in Iran, but the situation there is such that because of censorship and repression, there is no possibility for any kind of human rights activity. Q: What more could or should the U.S. government and the international community do about Iran's human rights record?
