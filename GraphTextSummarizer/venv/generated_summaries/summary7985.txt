Thai turmoil Caretaker Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra was removed from office along with nine cabinet ministers by a top court last Wednesday, and subsequently indicted by the country's anti-graft body. Drawn mainly from Bangkok's royalist, middle class establishment, the anti-government protesters have been seeking to rid Thai politics of the alleged influence of Yingluck's brother, the former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra. Yingluck, who was elected in a landslide at the polls in 2011, is the third Thaksin-linked prime minister to be dismissed by the Constitutional Court, which also dissolved Thaksin's Thai Rak Thai political party in 2007. The attack occurred at about 2 a.m. local time Thursday when gunmen on a pickup truck opened fire on a protest camp near the site of Bangkok's Democracy Monument, where protesters have been camped for months, said Lt. Gen. Paradon Patthanathabut, Thailand's national security adviser to the Prime Minister. Later that morning, anti-government protesters stormed the grounds of an Air Force office compound, forcing the country's caretaker Prime Minister to flee a meeting with members of the Election Commission.
