Official: Mother abandons disabled daughter Last year, von Anhalt announced that he wanted Gabor to become a mother again using an egg donor, artificial insemination and a surrogate mother. Gabor's only child, the result of her marriage to Conrad Hilton, will also get weekly visits with her mother without von Anhalt present, the judge said. But the man named temporary conservator is Gabor's ninth husband, Prince Frederic von Anhalt, who has feuded with his stepdaughter Francesca Hilton for years. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Reva Goetz, who also oversees singer Britney Spears' conservatorship, ordered an end to any powers of attorney von Anhalt might claim that would have allowed him to sell Gabor's Bel Air mansion or other estate assets. Hilton and von Anhalt have battled publicly for several years over Gabor's finances and her access to her mother.
