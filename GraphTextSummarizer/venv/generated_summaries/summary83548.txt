Argentine midfielder Esteban Cambiasso scored the winning goal as Jose Mourinho's Inter Milan defeated former club Chelsea 2-1 in the first leg of their Champions League last 16 tie at the San Siro. Chelsea may have to do without keeper Cech for the second leg. Meanwhile, in the evening's other Champions League tie, Primera Liga side Sevilla look favorites to progress after earning a 1-1 draw at CSKA Moscow. But the home side levelled midway through the second half when Mark Gonzalaez, who ironically joined CSKA in the summer from Sevilla's city rivals Real Betis, fired home an unstoppable long-range drive that gave goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev no chance. In a frantic opening 45 minutes, Didier Drogba struck the bar for Chelsea with a fierce free-kick while they also had a penalty claim for a tackle on Salomon Kalou turned down.
