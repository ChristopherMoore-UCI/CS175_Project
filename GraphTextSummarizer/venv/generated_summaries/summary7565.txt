James O'Connor and replacement Beale kicked two penalties to give the Wallabies renewed hope, but the ever accurate Halfpenny's boot stretched the lead to 23-18. They led 13-12 at halftime, despite two tries from Australia wing Israel Folau, who was making a sensational debut just five months after switching to rugby union from rugby league and Australian Rules football. It was a trying circumstance to put themselves in a position to win the game," Australia coach Robbie Deans said. Beale, returning to the Wallabies side, then wasted the two late opportunities to leave his side facing up to defeat. The opening match of the three-Test series swung on a few key moments and the Wallabies were left to count the cost of two late missed penalties from Kurtley Beale.
