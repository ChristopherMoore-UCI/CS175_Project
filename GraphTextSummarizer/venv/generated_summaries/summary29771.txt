-- Two Pakistani television networks that transmit from Dubai in United Arab Emirates were ordered off the air Friday at the request of Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf, officials from the networks said. " Aslan said network officials have been in discussions with Pakistani government officials and "it seemed very obvious that they were going to do this. Pakistan's president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, has been under pressure to lift a state of emergency. Both networks had been banned from Pakistan's cable television system -- along with other networks, including CNN and BBC -- since Musharraf declared a state of emergency on November 3. Musharraf has said the emergency order improves stability and will foster peaceful parliamentary elections, which he has said he would like to see take place before January 9.
