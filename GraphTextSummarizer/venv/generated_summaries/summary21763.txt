Fans from across the world poured out their grief after English soccer team Manchester United revealed that their legendary manager, Alex Ferguson, is to retire at the end of this season. Thousands of miles away in Malaysia, Instagram user @shar316 pictured herself with a commemorative scarf and t-shirt as she reflected Ferguson's achievements at Old Trafford. The showing of emotion was particularly apparent on the mobile photo sharing site Instagram, where fans shared photos of themselves and loved ones in United gear in honor of the famed manager, who steered the club to countless victories both in the UK and abroad. In Florida, Instagram user @sosogeed813 said he was "shocked" but at the same time was thankful for the legacy that Ferguson will leave the club. After hearing the news, Instagram user @alexbalding went and got a tattoo of a "Red Devil" logo -- the team's nickname.
