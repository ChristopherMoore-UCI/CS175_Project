In a letter to TSA Administrator John Pistole, Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-California, said the incident involved an active-duty Marine who had lost both of legs to an improvised explosive device, and was in a wheelchair, with limited or no mobility. "In recognition of the sacrifices of our men and women in uniform, we have revised our screening requirements to allow expedited screening for this trusted group of citizens," John Halinski, TSA's deputy administrator and a 25-year U.S. Marine Corps veteran, said in a statement. The move comes after a March 13 encounter between a small group of Marines and TSA screeners at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport sparked a spat between members of Congress and the TSA. The operations center will then notify appropriate TSA officials at the involved airports. The TSA said it hopes to assist wounded warriors in the future though its Wounded Warrior/Military Severely Injured Joint Support Operations Center Program.
