Japan this week authorized its passenger airlines to resume Dreamliner flights, but it wasn't clear when they they would reinstate the aircraft. The Ethiopian Airlines Dreamliner flight carried passengers from Addis Ababa to Nairobi, Kenya, the company said. United Airlines, which has six Boeing 787 aircraft, is the only U.S. airline to take delivery of the Dreamliner so far. Nearly 50 Dreamliners around the world had been out of commission after two incidents on jets operated by Japanese airlines called the battery systems into question. The company plans to begin domestic flights using the 787 in May and possibly launch the Denver-Narita, Japan, route on June 10.
