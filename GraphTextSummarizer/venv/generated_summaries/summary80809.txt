The critical moment for Sen. Ted Cruz and his allies came around 7 p.m. on Tuesday night. "That's always a defining issue, how much stamina a person has," said Senate Historian Don Ritchie, who recorded the oral history with Riddick and says there is a tradition of senators using a contraption for bodily functions during speech-a-thons. "When he showed up, we had a feeling that we could go until noon (the next day)," said Lee spokesman Brian Phillips. But until that point, the brunt of the speaking had been done by Cruz and his ally, Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah. Cruz was on the Senate floor just 1 hour and 41 minutes short of a day.
