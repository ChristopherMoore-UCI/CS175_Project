Authorities say SUV driver Alexander Lien was chased by bikers after he initially bumped one during a biker rally. When his Range Rover was surrounded by several bikers, Lien called 911, told police he feared for his life and drove off, running over bikers and critically injuring one. -- Charges are likely to be reduced against the bikers who were arrested and charged in connection with the beating of an SUV driver on a Manhattan street in September, a Manhattan District Attorney spokeswoman told CNN. CNN's Rande Iaboni and Tracy Dorsey contributed to this report Prosecutors said Friday that charges would likely be reduced on the next court date because of the lack of serious physical injury, the spokeswoman said.
