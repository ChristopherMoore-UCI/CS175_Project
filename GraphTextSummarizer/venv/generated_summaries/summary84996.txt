Russian Orthodox Church leaders chose Kirill Tuesday to replace Patriarch Alexy II, who died in December. Russian first lady Svetlana Medvedeva was the first person to receive the Eucharist from the new Patriarch, Russia's Interfax news agency reported. Patriarch Kirill, 62, becomes first new leader of the church since the fall of communism, and the first enthroned in the Cathedral since it was rebuilt at the end of the 1990s. He is credited with reviving the denomination after years of communist rule. Kirill, who became acting head of the church after Alexy died, is seen as a modernizer.
