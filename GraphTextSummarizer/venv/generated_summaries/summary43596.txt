A study I published in 2007 with my colleagues Jerry Tatum and J.T. Newberry found that fraternity men were three times more likely to commit rape than other men on college campuses. The definition of "success" in the e-mail sounds eerily similar to what David Lisak identifies as rape in his research on profiling "undetected rapists" -- college men who have committed rape and/or attempted rape, an average of six times each, but are never reported and never are held accountable for their crimes. Before they got to college, fraternity men were no different from other male students. We then compared the rates of sexual assault among men who joined fraternities to the rates of sexual assault among men who did not join fraternities. There are a lot of us across the country who have worked for decades trying to prevent rape on college campuses.
