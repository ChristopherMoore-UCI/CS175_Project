The jump put Baumgartner in the record books and spelled publicity for the sponsor, Red Bull, a caffeinated sugar-y drink building a reputation for risk and adventure. So NASA (or Space X) probably doesn't need Red Bull, or Baumgartner, whose other work may have been more about research and development and less about testing human limits. Baumgartner needed a pressurized suit because the atmosphere is very thin at such high altitudes, as well as very cold. After the Columbia accident in 2003, NASA limited further space shuttle flights to the essential -- mostly carrying cargo to finish the International Space Station. Watching the replay of Baumgartner's stunt on the news, I noticed a room full of technical experts supporting the balloon launch and human cannonball descent.
