In the English Premier League Arsenal's hopes of strengthening their grip on third place ahead of London rivals Chelsea and Tottenham in the race for Champions League football were dented by a 0-0 draw with Everton. Bayern are also sitting pretty in Europe having dismissed Juventus to take their place in the Champions League semifinals where they will face Barcelona. Everton are sixth, two points behind Chelsea in fourth. The result means Arsenal remain third in the table, two points clear of both their London rivals but they have played a game more than Chelsea and two more than Tottenham. After a season's sabbatical Bayern won the race for his signature, but the 42-year-old might have a tough task on his hands if Bayern go on to pin down another two trophies between now and the season's end.
