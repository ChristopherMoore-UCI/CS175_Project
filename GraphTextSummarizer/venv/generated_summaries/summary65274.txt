That's like sentencing Edward Norton to life in prison for his role in "American History X." What makes this court ruling even more preposterous is that these films are not recent films. As a child, I remember watching Adel Iman films when I visited my family in Egypt during summer break. This doesn't just prevent comedians, writers and artists from finding humor in the single biggest aspect of every Egyptian's life but it also will suppress creativity in general. Not for something he said but for roles he played in films. Over the decades they created films, television series and plays that delighted audiences across the region.
