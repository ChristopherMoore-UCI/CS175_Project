But other more immediate sporting fixtures have been thrown into chaos, with European champions Barcelona forced to make a near 1,000 km coach journey to play the first leg of their Champions League semifinal against Inter in Milan on Tuesday. English clubs Liverpool and Fulham are also struggling to get to Europa League semifinal ties on Thursday in Madrid and Hamburg respectively after UEFA said both would go ahead. Fulham confirmed on its club Web site that their match in Germany remains unchanged, while Liverpool told CNN they are arranging alternative travel plans for their tie against Atletico Madrid. MotoGP is not the only motorsport event affected, with Formula One teams, who took part last weekend's grand prix in Shanghai, struggling to get back to their European bases. "Although the situation is beyond our control, we sincerely apologize to fans who have been eagerly waiting for the world's top-level race," said Hiroshi Oshima, president of the race operators.
