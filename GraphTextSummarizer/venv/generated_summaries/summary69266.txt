He's accused of killing Gavin Smith, a Fox entertainment executive whose remains were found in a shallow grave last year -- more than two years after he vanished. Smith was an 18-year veteran of 20th Century Fox's distribution department, serving as a liaison between the studio and movie theaters, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Dave Dolson of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said last year. Authorities have said they believe they know how and why Smith was killed, but they haven't revealed details. He told a reporter for the Los Angeles Times that he'd never met Smith.
