Three days later, two more were discovered: another one with bullet wounds near Ocean Springs, and one on Ship Island, a remote barrier island off Biloxi, Mississippi, with its jaw cut off. The first dolphin was found January 8 with a bullet wound on Deer Island, near Biloxi, Mississippi. On November 6, a dolphin was found dead with numerous cuts near Ocean Springs, Mississippi. A group of bird surveyors discovered an adult dolphin head on the west tip of Horn Island on Friday. It's not unusual to see dolphin bodies, or even parts of bodies, wash up.
