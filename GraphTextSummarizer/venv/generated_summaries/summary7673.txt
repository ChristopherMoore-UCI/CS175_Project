The 19 firefighters were Andrew Ashcraft, 29; Robert Caldwell, 23; Travis Carter, 31; Dustin Deford, 24; Christopher MacKenzie, 30; Eric Marsh, 43; Grant McKee, 21; Sean Misner, 26; Scott Norris, 28; Wade Parker, 22; John Percin, 24; Anthony Rose, 23; Jesse Steed, 36; Joe Thurston, 32; Travis Turbyfill, 27; William Warneke, 25; Clayton Whitted, 28; Kevin Woyjeck, 21; and Garret Zuppiger, 27. The 19, members of the Prescott Fire Department's elite Granite Mountain Hotshots wildfire crew, died while battling the Yarnell Hill fire, which consumed 8,400 acres northwest of Phoenix. Officials have said it appears the 19 were forced to lie down under fire shelters, blankets meant to protect against flames and heat, as a last resort after the fire suddenly changed directions. The fallen firefighters: who they were Vice President Joe Biden honored the men at a memorial service this week in Arizona, saying they "rushed toward the flames as everyone else retreated. They raced to embrace life just like they raced (to) the fight against ... the raging fire on Yarnell Hill."
