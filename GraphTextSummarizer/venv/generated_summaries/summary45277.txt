Learn how to shoot amazing videos with drones Dean of USF Libraries Bill Garrison says the drones could be a great resource for students working on multimedia projects, and sees the program working in conjunction with other departments at the university. Garrison says the move to introduce drones to the school's library service is part of a larger effort to stay relevant on campus by providing more digital learning tools. Students at the University of South Florida will be soaring to new academic heights, with drones. It's a bold move considering that more places are starting to limit the access of drones, including the National Park Service, which announced a temporary ban on the use of drones on Friday. Yet, USF is taking a different approach to drones, making the technology more accessible to its students.
