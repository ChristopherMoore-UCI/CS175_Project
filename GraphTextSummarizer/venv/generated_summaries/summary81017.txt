The proposed change to the wording has also worried Japan's neighbors, who see the hawkish Abe as largely unrepentant for what most Asians view as war crimes committed by Japanese troops during the Second World War. The government's proposal is expected to gain cabinet approval on July 1st after an agreement is finalized between Japan's main ruling parties, despite polls that say a majority of Japanese citizens oppose the measure. The changes would allow the Japanese Self Defense Force to engage in collective defense, which includes deploying soldiers internationally to defend the interests of Japanese allies. But opponents -- both domestically and abroad -- oppose the change to Article 9 of the document, which states "the Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as a means of settling international disputes." Currently, Japan's constitution, signed into effect following the Second World War, allows for self-defense but does not authorize military action outside Japan.
