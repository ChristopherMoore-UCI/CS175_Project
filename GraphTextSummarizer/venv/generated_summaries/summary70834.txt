If fight rumors start to flood the hallways, or even if something seems a little off, it's best to bring it to the attention of the administrators or school resource officers. If available and in working order, I'll use a radio or phone to contact administrators or school resource officers. Supplemental training in restraints and fight intervention is made available to some teachers, but I and most other teachers I know are mainly qualified to fight ignorance. I know that, like me, they didn't enter their classrooms to be prison guards, and that they'd prefer to guide children toward higher roads to civility. Early in my teaching career, I was afraid of some of the bigger boys at school, especially one.
