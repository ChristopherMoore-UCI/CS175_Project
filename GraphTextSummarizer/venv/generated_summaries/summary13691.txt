I've rekindled old friendships and moved existing friendships forward. My relationship with my husband, Scott, has deepened through shared bike rides, running sessions and healthy meal planning. Tell friends about your goals and invite them to training sessions. I envisioned myself running, biking, swimming and eating super-nutritious meals. More important, I attended a talk Lesley gave about her journey to Xterra triathlon, in which she was brutally honest about her failures as well as her successes.
