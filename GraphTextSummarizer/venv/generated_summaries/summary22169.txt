Nishikori ground out a three set win over Croatia's Marin Cili, while Hewitt continued his fine run with a straight sets dismissal of Romanian qualifier Marius Copil, 6-4, 6-2. The second semifinal will be between second seed Kei Nishikori of Japan and home favorite Lleyton Hewitt. The top seed will next play France's Jeremy Chardy, who beat another Australian, wildcard Sam Groth, 7-5 6-4. Federer is playing in Brisbane for the first time in his glittering career and treated the crowd on the Pat Pat Rafter Arena to a tennis master class against his Australian opponent. Monfils, something of a Doha specialist and twice a losing finalist, showed his quality with a straight sets 6-3 6-2 win over Florian Mayer of Germany in a little under an hour.
