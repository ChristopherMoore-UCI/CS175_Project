-- In his first post-Election Day interview, President Bush spoke to CNN's Heidi Collins on Tuesday aboard the Intrepid, a former U.S. Navy aircraft carrier where he was commemorating Veterans Day. It is good for our country that people have hope in the system and feel vested in the future and President-elect Obama has a great opportunity. I know there's this kind of preoccupation by some by popularity polls, but for me they're just moments, they come and go. CNN: What will you tell -- and maybe you talked about this yesterday with President-elect Obama -- about taking care of America's veterans and active servicemen and women? And I assure you, as president of the United States you better have a core set of beliefs, because a lot of people are watching you and they are trying to determine where America will stand.
