"Many people don't get to be exposed to the Games unless they have a ticket to an event," says boat builder Mark Covell. "This gives more people the chance to be a part of the celebrations and the cultural history of the Olympics." Covell knows firsthand the thrill of being part of the Games -- having won a silver medal in Sydney in 2000. The donated items were collected over six months by organizers who visited 20 locations across south east England. Even without taking to the water Covell says 'The Boat Project' has embodied the spirit of the Olympics. "The amount of precious things that were given has been really inspiring," says Covell.
