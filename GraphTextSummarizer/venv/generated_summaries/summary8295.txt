Local health systems, which were weak at best, have been completely devastated as many health workers became victims of this deadly virus. Fourth, the infection of two health care workers in Dallas during the treatment of Duncan raises questions about the ability of hospitals across the country to handle the extensive safety protocols required to treat Ebola patients.

In order to avoid bureaucratic red tape, we should begin discussion with the WHO, drug companies and West African governments on the processes for purchasing and distributing of these drugs. Finally, we need to increase our efforts to develop an Ebola vaccine and to increase production of antiviral drugs.
