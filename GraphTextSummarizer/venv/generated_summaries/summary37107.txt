The latest, uh, must-have appears to be positive pregnancy test results. Another ad reassures buyers conscious of name brands, "This will NOT be a dollar store test. " Most ads found by CNN ended the same way, with sellers assuring potential customers "It isn't my business what you choose to use it for." I really don't care what you use it for." That particular test was going for the reasonable rate of $25 dollars. The tests in Texas seem to be slightly more expensive, at $30 a pop.
