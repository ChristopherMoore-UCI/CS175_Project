A 2-2 draw with Portuguese champions Porto wasn't enough to see Italian side Napoli into the last eight, as they lost 3-2 on aggregate. Dutch side AZ Alkmaar held on in Russia for a 0-0 draw against Anzhi Makhachkala to secure a 1-0 win on aggregate. Portuguese giants Benfica are also through to the last eight after they held firm in the face of a late fightback from English Premier League side Tottenham Hotspur. At 34, Pirlo is most certainly in the twilight of his long and illustrious career, which has seen him snare four Italian league titles, two European Champions League crowns and one World Cup. Elsewhere, Spanish outfit Valencia cruised into the quarterfinals after a 1-0 victory over Bulgarian minnows Ludogorets Razgrad confirmed a 4-0 aggregate success.
