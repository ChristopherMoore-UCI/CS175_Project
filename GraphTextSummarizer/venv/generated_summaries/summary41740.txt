-- Hunger isn't glamorous, but Michael Kors and Halle Berry are using the power of fashion and Hollywood to help the U.N. World Food Programme provide meals for children around the world. School meals help encourage poor families to send children to school and keep them there. Thursday is World Food Day, but the celebrities are rallying support all month long to raise funds for WFP's School Meals program with the #WatchHungerStop campaign. In 2013, WFP said it provided school meals to 19.8 million children in 63 countries. The money raised by Kors and Berry goes toward providing school meals.
