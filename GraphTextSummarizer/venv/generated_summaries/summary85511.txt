Roll bottom third of apples in ½ cup chopped toasted pecans and ¼ teaspoon Maldon sea salt. If desired, roll bottom third of apples in mixture of ½ cup chopped toasted almonds and ½ teaspoon Maldon sea salt. If desired, roll bottom half of apples in mixture of ½ cup chopped toasted hazelnuts and ½ teaspoon Maldon sea salt. Holding one apple by its chopstick, immerse apple in caramel with swirling motion, tilting pan if necessary to pool caramel deep enough to coat at least ¾ of apple. Lift apple out of caramel and hold over pan for about 10 seconds, allowing excess caramel to drip back into pan, then hold apple upside down over pan for about 15 seconds, allowing caramel to begin to set.
