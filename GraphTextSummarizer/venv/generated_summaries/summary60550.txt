Not only did Obama downplay campaign finance reform, but he subsequently embraced a legislative strategy that depended on cutting deals with powerful interest groups such as the pharmaceutical industry so that lobbyists would "buy into" legislation rather than oppose it. Obama shelved substantive campaign reform proposals as he turned his attention to the economic crisis, health care reform and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Obama's actions followed a pattern of candidates running on campaign finance reform as an issue, then putting it aside once they get into office. Nonetheless, at the moment when the president arguably had the most political capital to move forward with an issue as difficult as campaign finance reform, Obama succumbed to these familiar and predictable fears. During the campaign, Obama disappointed many campaign reform advocates when he announced that he would not use public funds in the general election campaign so that he could raise an unlimited amount of money in his race against Sen. John McCain.
