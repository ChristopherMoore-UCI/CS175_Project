Gone are the ban on the use of corporate treasury funds in federal elections and the requirement that corporations use political action committees to advocate for a candidate. After Citizens United, corporate managers are free to spend corporate treasury money on politics without the knowledge or consent of their shareholders. Corporate money may now be infused into elections in ways we can only begin to imagine. One immediate firebreak would be to change the securities laws to allow shareholders authority and oversight over corporate political spending. Adding corporate money into politics is like setting a brush fire.
