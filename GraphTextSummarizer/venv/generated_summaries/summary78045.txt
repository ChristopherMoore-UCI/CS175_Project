Famed boxer Muhammad Ali has "vastly improved" after being hospitalized over the weekend with a mild case of pneumonia, his spokesman Bob Gunnell said. "Ali's team of doctors hopes to discharge him soon," said Gunnell. "The Ali family continues to request privacy and appreciates all of the prayers and well wishes," read a statement sent from Gunnell. In 1964, he became world heavyweight champion in an upset victory against then-champion Sonny Liston, according to Ali's official website. The boxer was also known for his protest against the Vietnam War and refusal to be drafted into service out of religious conviction.
