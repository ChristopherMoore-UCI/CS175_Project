Robert Ferrante was extradited from West Virginia to Allegheny County Jail in Pennsylvania on Tuesday morning, where he later appeared via video conference at his arraignment, according to the Allegheny County district attorney's office. One day before Klein fell ill, Ferrante had used his University of Pittsburgh credit card to place an overnight order for more than a half a pound of cyanide. In a statement made to detectives shortly after being informed of Klein's death because of cyanide poisoning, Ferrante said, "Why would she do that to herself? Several text messages sent between the couple before Klein's death in April suggest that Ferrante urged Klein to try using creatine to get help her get pregnant, according to the complaint. Ferrante pleaded not guilty in the death of his wife, Autumn Klein, 41, former head of women's neurology at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, according to the district attorney's office.
