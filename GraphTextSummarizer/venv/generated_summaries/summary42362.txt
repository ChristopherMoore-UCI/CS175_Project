-- Russian lawmakers backed a sweeping amnesty law Wednesday that could see jailed members of the Pussy Riot punk protest band released early and arrested Greenpeace activists avoiding prison, the state-run RIA Novosti news agency reported. The law received enough votes in favor in the Duma that it does not require President Vladimir Putin's signature, Ria Novosti said. The women, set to complete their sentences in coming months, have young children and would therefore qualify for the amnesty, RIA Novosti said. "With the amnesty also extended to individuals on trial, however, the group may be free from prosecution and its foreign members be allowed to return home," RIA Novosti said. The performance was held at a Russian Orthodox cathedral in 2012, and the musicians were found guilty of hooliganism.
