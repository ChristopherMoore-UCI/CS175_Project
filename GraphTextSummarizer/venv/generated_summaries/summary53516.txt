-- Oil company BP shouldered some responsibility for the Gulf of Mexico oil disaster Wednesday after an internal investigation of the spill, but assigned much of the blame to contractors Halliburton and Transocean. "The Transocean rig crew and BP well site leaders reached the incorrect view that the test was successful and that well integrity had been established." In addition, e-mails from BP engineers, released by a congressional committee in June, suggest that the oil company had its own concerns about the well. Multiple companies, work teams and circumstances were involved over time." Both Halliburton and Transocean sharply disputed the findings, with Transocean calling them "self-serving" and Halliburton insisting that the problem lay with BP's well design. A Halliburton engineer also criticized BP's well design during an August hearing by the Coast Guard-Interior Department board investigating the disaster.
