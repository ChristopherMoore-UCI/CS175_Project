We have been involved in crafting and teaching national security strategy, of which military strategy and use of military force are vital components. Cutting Pentagon spending recognizes that national security is more than military power. Reducing wasteful spending on unneeded programs and outdated strategy will save money and enhance national security. In 2008, a National Intelligence Estimate declared the economic crisis, not terrorism, as the greatest threat to national security. Sadly, defense spending is driven by political interests, not necessity.
