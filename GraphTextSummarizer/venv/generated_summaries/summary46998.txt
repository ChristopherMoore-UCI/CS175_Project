McCluskey and Welch were arrested late Thursday at a campground on the edge of Apache and Sitgreaves National Forests in Springerville, Arizona, U.S. Marshal David Gonzales said Friday. Welch and McCluskey appeared in court Friday in Apache County, Arizona, where he faces three counts of kidnapping, two counts of escape, two counts of robbery, two counts of aggravated assault and two counts of misconduct involving weapons. Authorities are working to coordinate the transport of Province back to Arizona from Wyoming, expected to occur within the next month, the marshals service said. McCluskey was serving a 15-year sentence for attempted second-degree murder and other charges when he and fellow convicts Tracy Province and Daniel Renwick broke out of the prison July 30, allegedly with help from Casslyn Mae Welch. McCluskey, 45, was taken from the Mohave County Jail in Kingman, Arizona, to a hospital, where he was treated for minor injuries.
