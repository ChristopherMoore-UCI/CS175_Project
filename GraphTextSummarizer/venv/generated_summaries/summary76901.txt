It was carried out to avenge the death of Mehsud's predecessor, Baitullah Mehsud, who died in a suspected U.S. drone strike last year, according to al Qaeda's commander of operations in Afghanistan, Mustafa Abu Yazid. -- Pakistani Taliban leader Hakimullah Mehsud is dead, three Taliban sources and a government official said Tuesday. Baitullah Mehsud and Hakimullah Mehsud are from the same tribe, not the same family. The government official told CNN Mehsud died as a result of the January 14 attack in North Waziristan. Word of his death contradicts a statement by a Taliban spokesman last week that Mehsud was alive and in hiding.
