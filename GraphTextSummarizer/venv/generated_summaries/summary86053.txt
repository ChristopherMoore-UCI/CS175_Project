-- Details were just beginning to emerge Thursday on plans for memorial services and other tributes to Steve Jobs, the iconic Apple co-founder who died Wednesday. A statement from Jobs' family late Wednesday said a website is going to be created "for those who wish to offer tributes and memories." Online, a pre-existing group of Apple fans had already declared October 14, the day the iPhone 4S will be released, "Steve Jobs Day" as a tribute to his legacy. But at Apple's headquarters, Apple stores worldwide and on the Internet, unofficial tributes had already begun. In its statement announcing the CEO's death, Apple provided an email address -- rememberingsteve@apple.com -- for people wishing to "share your thoughts, memories, and condolences."
