The school board representing Minnesota's largest school district on Monday night will consider scrapping a controversial policy requiring teachers not to discuss homosexuality in school. Carlson emphasized students need to report bullying, and he acknowledged "gay students in our district struggle with bullying and harassment on a daily basis." Nevertheless, the string of suicides stirred public debate over the school's sexual orientation curriculum policy. The Anoka-Hennepin School District's sexual orientation curriculum policy, adopted in 2009, bars teachers from taking a position on homosexuality in the classroom and says such matters are best addressed outside of school. Superintendent Dennis Carlson has said in the past that the neutrality policy -- which has attracted just as many local supporters as it has critics to heated school board meetings -- is a reasonable response to a divided community. The so-called "neutrality policy" triggered a federal lawsuit by students who allege the policy creates a toxic environment for lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender students -- or students perceived to be LGBT.
