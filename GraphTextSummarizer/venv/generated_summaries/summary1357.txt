Almost half of U.S. health care institutions surveyed by the Global Alliance for Arts & Health in 2009 (the most recent data available) had arts programs of some sort, including permanent displays of arts, performances in public spaces and bedside activities. By this time, the program included more arts services for patients, family members and hospital staffers. Their mission is to facilitate "creative encounters" that can help patients and their families discover new meaning in life and death, or "just for fun," as Repar puts it. At that point, the program consisted primarily of concerts and "roving rejuvenators" -- artists and massage professionals tending to hospital staff and patients. He has also seen depressed patients respond to the arts, even when they don't respond to other people.
