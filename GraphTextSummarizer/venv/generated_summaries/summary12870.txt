For the other $500 billion of debt ceiling extension in the first stage, Congress can vote on resolutions of disapproval that, if passed, the president can then veto, the White House said. However, Obama would be able to request only up to $1.2 trillion in additional debt ceiling if the special congressional committee fails to agree to at least $1.2 trillion in cuts. At that point, across-the-board spending cuts would be activated, equal to the difference between the committee's recommendations and the $1.2 trillion in additional debt ceiling. In the first stage, it includes $917 billion in spending cuts and other deficit reduction now, as well as a $900 billion increase in the debt ceiling. Sixty-four percent of respondents to a July 18-20 survey preferred a deal with a mix of spending cuts and tax increases.
