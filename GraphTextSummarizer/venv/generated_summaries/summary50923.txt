The students were among about seven in the Delaware Valley Charter High School gym at that time -- some playing basketball, others in one corner -- according to city police Commissioner Charles Ramsey. The injured boy and girl, each 15, were transported in stable condition after being shot in the arm just before 3:30 p.m., Philadelphia police Lt. John Stanford said. But a few hours later, Stanford said that young man was not the shooter as police initially thought, though he was at the scene. A short time later, Philadelphia police tweeted they had a suspect in custody. By then, Philadelphia police had announced they were "still looking for additional suspects."
