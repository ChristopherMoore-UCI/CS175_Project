After making his first foray into competitions in 2012, he claimed second place at the inaugural Caribbean Cup in Roatan, first place at the Deja Blue tournament in CuraÃ§ao, and a silver medal in constant no fins at this year's AIDA Depth World Championship in Greece. According to Graves, Mevoli's death is the first to occur in competition in 21 years. At that depth, the diver's heart rate begins to slow, their blood vessels shrink and their lungs compress to the size of oranges under the huge force of water pressure.. The night before Mevoli died he sat and spoke with Graves. " Vertical Blue, the competition organizers, paid its own tribute to Mevoli. "We are very sad to report that earlier today Nicholas Mevoli (USA) tragically lost his life after a CNF dive to 72m," said Vertical Blue, which organized the competition, in a statement on its website.
