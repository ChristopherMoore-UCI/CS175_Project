-- Kenyan President Mwai Kibaki set five tons of elephant tusks and ivory carvings ablaze Wednesday in the first national celebration of African Elephant Law Enforcement Day. Noah Wekesa, Kenya's minister for forestry and wildlife, said the country is also finalizing a bill that will severely penalize poachers to ensure illegal wildlife trade has no "haven within our region. Kibaki said countries need to understand the effects illegal trade has on national economies. "Through the disposal of contraband ivory, we seek to formally demonstrate to the world our determination to eliminate all forms of illegal trade in ivory," Kibaki said. Kibaki said he wants his country to be at the forefront of wildlife conservation.
