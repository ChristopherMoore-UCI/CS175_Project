-- As Ricot Duprevil tells it, rescuers saved him after he spent two weeks under earthquake rubble. U.S. military medics and doctors at the International Medical Surgical Response team field hospital said Duprevil was severely dehydrated after being rescued, but otherwise had strong blood pressure and pulse. "Undoubtedly, this is very, very exciting, especially for all of us who have been deeply involved in this mission," said Dr. Henry Ford, who is treating Duprevil. And the U.S. soldiers who arrived and treated Duprevil after his rescue did not see which building area residents recovered him from -- a freshly collapsed one or one destroyed two weeks ago, when a 7.0-magnitude earthquake devastated Haiti. There's no question that Duprevil was pulled out alive from the rubble of a Port-au-Prince building Tuesday.
