Moscow, Russia Place: Seldom included on lists of romantic things: fear. The electrostatic sensuality generated by tango -- watched or danced; the lawns full of frisky youth at Tres de Febrero Park; the unparalleled showcase for the city's passion and potency that is soccer at La Bombanera. Things: The titillation of women twisting in the windows of the Red Light District; the puritanical eye of the RLD's carnal storm that is Oude Kerk ("old church"); 10 p.m. summer sunsets; a kiss under the Magere Brug ("skinny bridge"), ensuring fidelity. The intellectual arousal of its late night bookstores; the metamorphosed grandeur of Gorky Park; old factories and warehouses transformed into galleries, clubs and performance spaces; countless monuments to lovers; vanishing vestiges of the Soviet era. Havana, Cuba Place: Think old stuff is romantic?
