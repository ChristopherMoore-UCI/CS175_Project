" Most couples do use the postnups as a blueprint for an eventual divorce, according to Elinor Robin, a Boca Raton, Florida, conflict strategist and mediator. The husband and wife, who asked to remain anonymous, had taken out two mortgages on their home and spent inheritance money to pay down debt from the husband's consulting business. The agreements usually are used to settle financial issues, says Weston, whose high-profile clients have included Robert Iger, chief executive of the Walt Disney Company, as well as author Terry McMillan and boxer Oscar de la Hoya. She valued stability; he saw debt as a means of building his business. The agreement largely has quelled their arguments, they say, even though the husband's consulting business is still between $150,000 and $200,000 in debt.
