U.S. helicopter gunships supported Iraqi ground forces battling ISIS militants in al-Baghdadi, military sources said, an action that brings U.S. troops closer to combat. "I think the Iraqi government is getting it back together and, yes, they do need help from coalition forces, U.S. forces right now," he said. Robert Baer, a former CIA officer, said the battles may indicate a deepening involvement of U.S. troops in the fight against ISIS. And U.S. forces were "several kilometers" away from where the fighting happened, the Pentagon said in a statement. On Saturday, the U.S. military said al-Baghdadi was "contested," as Iraqi forces fought back.
