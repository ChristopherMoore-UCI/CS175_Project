Fossett, 63, was in a single-engine plane when he took off at 9 a.m. (noon ET) in good flying conditions from hotel magnate Barron Hilton's Flying M Ranch, Ryan said. CNN.com interviewed Fossett last year after he published a book about his life's passion for breaking world records, titled "Chasing the Wind." He's credited with 115 world records or world firsts, and holds official world records in five sports, according to his Web site. Fossett is the first person to solo around the world in a balloon, and has broken numerous other flight records. Fossett did not file a flight plan, which is not required on flights using visual navigation.
