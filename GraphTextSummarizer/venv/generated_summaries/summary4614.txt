The dilemma for the crowdfunding industry ahead is to sort out the level of risk involved, who companies are actually marketing to and who they want to invest in their platforms, said Ben Yearsley, head of investment research for Charles Stanley Direct "So the future is interesting. We're going to take our story and our vision of what we believe the future should look like, and tell it to the crowd and see what happens," explained Ali Jelveh, founder of Protonet, to CNN's Diana Magnay at the company's office. "I believe that in the future we will see companies that are 100% crowdfunded," added Jelveh. Anyone who has an idea for a creative concept can post it on a website and ask backers to fund it, whether it be a new product, gadget or artistic project. Highly-connected, mobile and flexible, the crowdfunding model can react to change faster than traditional companies.
