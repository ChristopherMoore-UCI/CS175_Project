In an interview with Out magazine, pop star Christina Aguilera referred to fellow superstar Lady Gaga as a "newcomer" who was "fun to look at," but Aguilera posted a statement on her website claiming that there wasn't any malice behind those words. If Aguilera or the "Sex and the City" stars really are estranged from other famous women, so be it -- but why no mention of their relationship with co-stars Chris Noth or John Corbett? A likely reason for the media coverage, explained pop culture expert and "The Cult of Celebrity" author Cooper Lawrence, is because "it's much easier to believe that women don't like each other. The difference, said Robert Thompson, director of the Bleier Center for Television and Popular Culture at Syracuse University, is that those battles are often steeped with violent overtones, and they're treated with more severity than the disputes female celebrities are rumored to have. "The chemistry among the four of us is very strong, [but] ... the press has to put women in these boxes, rather than show them as the movie portrays them: working together and being powerful," Cattrall said in the Marie Claire interview.
