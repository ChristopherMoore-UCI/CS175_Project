Boeing employees were conducting a test of a system designed to prevent fires  when smoke began filling the back of the cabin of the next-generation 787  Dreamliner, according to the company. It made its maiden flight in December 2009 after two years of delays, but the  head of Boeing's commercial aircraft division told CNN in July that the Dreamliner could still make its debut in early 2011. There is no indication,  however, that Tuesday's fire was caused by the nitrogen generation  system, according to Boeing spokesman Jim Proulx. Boeing is grounding its entire fleet of test Dreamliners pending results of  its analysis of  hundreds of different data measurements to determine the cause  of the fire. -- An electrical fire on board a Boeing Dreamliner caused the plane to lose primary electrical power during a test  flight Tuesday, the company said.
