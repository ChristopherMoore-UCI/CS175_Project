Perhaps because it has to: If Facebook can't compete with Google and Apple in mobile technology, it may find itself on the losing side of some of consumer tech's greatest battles. Judging by the reaction to the news around the Web this past week, a good number of tech commentators and Facebook users aren't the slightest bit keen on the idea of Facebook releasing a cell phone. Facebook would love for that "country" to have an economy to match, and that means having all its users embrace Facebook Credits. Instead, rival Google is plowing ahead with Google Wallet, which when combined with Google's Android operating system could make Google a leader in this hot market. By building its own alternative to mobile app stores, either on top of Android or using HTML5 apps on the Web, Facebook might get back in the game.
