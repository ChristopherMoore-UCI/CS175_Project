The pharmacy, Infusion Resource, was also found to have a center for giving intravenous medications to patients in violation of state regulations, which require a clinic license, Dr. Madeleine Biondolillo, director of the Massachusetts Department of Public Health Bureau of Healthcare Safety and Quality, said Sunday. -- A second Massachusetts compounding pharmacy surrendered its license after state inspectors found "significant" issues that could affect sterility, state health officials said. The space in our facility is intended for patient education, validation of patient and caregiver skills, medication counseling, medication education, teaching and training." Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick said last week the state would immediately begin unannounced inspections of all Massachusetts pharmacies and require that they submit annual reports detailing what they produce and distribute. "No issues were cited related to the integrity of our products nor to the quality of our compounding practices," said Bernard Lambrese, Infusion Resource CEO, in a statement.
