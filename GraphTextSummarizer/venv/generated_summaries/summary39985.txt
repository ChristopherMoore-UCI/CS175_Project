One person who will likely not be returning anytime soon is the pro-Taliban cleric Sufi Muhammad, who brokered a short-lived deal between the Taliban and the government that allowed the Taliban to enforce Sharia law in the Swat Valley. Sufi Muhammad was arrested in Peshawar in late July, accused of encouraging violence. Under the watchful eye of government forces, anxious local residents were starting to return. In June, the Pakistani military organized a media tour to areas of the Lower Dir in North West Frontier Province that were under their control. The rugged beauty of the expansive Dir Valley can mask the detail of what is happening on the ground.
