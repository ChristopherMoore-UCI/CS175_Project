"I think it's the right and just thing to abolish the death penalty and punish those who commit heinous crimes, evil people, with life in prison without parole or any chance of release," said Quinn. In announcing his decision, Quinn said that a flawed system of capital punishment had put the state in "grave danger" of putting innocent prisoners to death and that creating a "mistake-free" system was impossible. "Executions in this country are carried out as part of an unequal system of justice, in which innocent people are too often sentenced to death and decisions about who lives and who dies are largely dependent upon the skill of their attorneys, the race of their victim, their socioeconomic status and where the crime took place," John Holdridge, director of the ACLU Capital Punishment Project, said in a statement issued after Quinn's announcement. -- Illinois put an end to capital punishment Wednesday as Gov. Pat Quinn signed legislation abolishing the practice and commuting the sentences of his state's remaining death row inmates. And state Sen. William Haine, one of several Democrats to oppose repeal, said Quinn should have pushed for a statewide debate and a referendum on whether to keep capital punishment.
