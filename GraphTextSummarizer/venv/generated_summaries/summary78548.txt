But until the Cole memo, Justice Department policy discouraged recorded interviews for decades, in part because of fears that it could aid defendants on trial. -- The Justice Department is about to reverse a century of resistance to technology, requiring that federal agents record interviews of most suspects under arrest. And it also doesn't apply to interviews of suspects before arrest. That meant that even in high-profile trials, juries are often treated to the spectacle of FBI or other agents having to testify about what their hand-scribbled notes taken during interviews were supposed to mean. A memorandum from Deputy Attorney General James Cole, first reported Wednesday by the Arizona Republic, says that beginning July 11, "There is a presumption that the custodial statement of an individual in a place of detention with suitable recording equipment, following arrest but prior to initial appearance, will be electronically recorded."
