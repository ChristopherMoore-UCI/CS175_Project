Robert Burck has become a fixture in Times Square for playing the guitar dressed in a white cowboy hat, white cowboy boots and white underpants while tourists pose with him for pictures and slip money into his boots. In February, the street performer filed a lawsuit against Mars Inc. and Chute Gerdeman Inc., after they released a video billboard showing a guitar-playing blue M&M dressed in a white cowboy hat, cowboy boots and underpants. Chin dismissed the privacy claim, however, saying New York law protects only the "name, portrait, or picture of a living person" and not a character "created or a role performed by a living person," according to a statement from the court. Mars issued a statement saying, "we do not comment on matters of litigation. The company also ran print ads showing a similar yellow M&M. Burck says in his lawsuit that he has registered trademarks to the Naked Cowboy name and likeness.
