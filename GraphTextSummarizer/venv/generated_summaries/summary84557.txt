"For the Cikeusik trial to be a step toward ending religious violence in Indonesia, the police need to ensure the security of everyone in the courtroom," said Elaine Pearson, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch. The Setara Institute for Peace and Democracy, a local think tank, noted in a recent report a marked increase in the number of attacks against Ahmadiyah and other minority religions in Indonesia in recent years. Last week, Human Rights Watch issued a statement, urging authorities to ensure proper security at the trial. Hundreds of people, mostly students from nearby Islamic boarding schools, prayed and chanted outside the courthouse in support of the defendants. -- The trial of 12 men charged in a deadly attack against a minority Muslim sect began Tuesday under heavy security in West Java.
