After Sue Today, Peter Larson still runs the Black Hills Institute of Geological Research in Hill City, South Dakota, where his enthusiasm for T-Rexes hasn't abated. He stressed that Sue "wasn't ... what was being looked at as far as potential criminal violations." Larson and his colleagues have denied taking fossils off of public lands. "Ever since we created that little museum on our parents' ranch, it's always been our dream to have a museum here in Hill City (South Dakota)," Peter Larson said, referring to the Black Hills Institute. Larson said he and the entire town hoped that a public display of Sue would "put Hill City on the map." In November 1993, a federal grand jury returned a 39-count indictment containing 153 charges against Peter Larson and five others linked to the Black Hills Institute, including Wentz and Larson's brother, Neal.
