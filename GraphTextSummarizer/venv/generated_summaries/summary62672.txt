-- Jordan's intelligence department foiled "a major terrorist plot" that targeted "shopping centers, residential areas, diplomats and foreign nationals" in Jordan, the country's state news agency reported Sunday. All 11 suspects are Jordanian citizens who moved in and out of Syria, government spokesman Samih al-Maaytah said on state television Sunday. The U.S. Embassy in Amman appeared to be among the targets, a person familiar with the investigation told CNN Sunday. The terrorists called their plan "9/11 (2)," suggesting it was set to happen on the seventh anniversary of the last al Qaeda attack in Jordan when suicide bombs exploded in an Amman hotel November 9, 2005, the report said. The plot, which was in the preliminary stages, involved "a group of 11 terrorists associated with the ideology of al Qaeda," Petra reported.
