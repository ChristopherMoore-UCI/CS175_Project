Separately, Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan is not considering swapping Boko Haram prisoners for the kidnapped girls, according to media reports, which cited Mark Simmonds, Britain's Africa minister, who met with the President. The United States, which is supporting the Nigerian government's efforts, will continue to deepen its efforts, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said Wednesday while traveling to Saudi Arabia. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called the kidnapping of hundreds of girls an "unconscionable crime," vowing to do "everything possible to support the Nigerian government to return these young women to their homes and to hold the perpetrators to justice. The United States is now using drones and manned surveillance aircraft over Nigeria in the search for the hundreds of schoolgirls kidnapped by Boko Haram. As it currently stands, U.S. law prohibits the U.S. military from working with Nigerian military units that have been accused of abuses, a senior State Department official said.
