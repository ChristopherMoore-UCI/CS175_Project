" "North Korea ... faces a dire food shortage," U.N. World Food Program spokesman Paul Risley said at a Bangkok, Thailand, news conference. The Democratic Republic of North Korea is still recovering from a famine in the 1990s that is believed to have killed about a million people and left many children permanently stunted, according to the New York-based Human Rights Watch. "Because of high global food prices it will be very difficult for the government of DPRK to purchase food on global markets to make up the difference." "We're very concerned that this year the food shortfall of 1,600,000 tons of rice and wheat will mean that malnutrition will increase and that children will receive less food than they are really needing to receive," Risley said. -- North Korea may be on the brink of another famine as a result of last year's devastating floods, the worldwide increase in food prices, and a malnourished population, the United Nations warned on Thursday.
