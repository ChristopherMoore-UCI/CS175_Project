Robert Reich, a former Labor Secretary under President Clinton, endorsed Sen. Obama Friday. Robert Reich, a former Clinton cabinet member and longtime friend of the former president, formally endorsed Obama's White House bid, saying that "my conscience won't let me be silent any longer." "Although Hillary Clinton has offered solid and sensible policy proposals, Obama's strike me as even more so," Reich wrote on his blog. -- Sen. Barack Obama received key endorsements Friday from a top former Clinton administration official and two former Democratic senators. "Nor are they helping the Democratic Party." Asked to respond to Reich's endorsement, Clinton spokesman Mo Eleithee said, "Didn't he endorse him last year?" Reich is the latest former Clinton administration official to announce his support for Obama. Reich also criticized Bill Clinton earlier in the year over the former president's sharp attacks on Obama in South Carolina.
