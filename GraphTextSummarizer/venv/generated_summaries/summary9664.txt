Hospitals can file Medicaid claims for emergency services provided to undocumented immigrants, including childbirth. Georgia Attorney General Sam Olens said he wants to recover state Medicaid funds. The services provided under these agreements included translation, determination of Medicaid eligibility, and other services designed to improve the delivery of obstetric care and increase the likelihood of a safe birth and a healthy baby," the statement said. It alleges violations of anti-kickback statutes by the hospital companies, pointing to contracts between them and Hispanic Medical Management, which operates clinics around the Atlanta metropolitan area known as "Clinica de la Mama." "By knowingly entering these contracts with the purpose of receiving patient referral services, defendant hospitals violated federal and state law and submitted false certification to the State Medicaid program that they were in compliance with such federal and state laws, including the Anti-Kickback Statue," the lawsuit says. "These hospitals allegedly paid Clinica kickbacks camouflaged as interpreter service payments to funnel emergency Medicaid patients their way and increase their bottom line," he said in a written statement.
