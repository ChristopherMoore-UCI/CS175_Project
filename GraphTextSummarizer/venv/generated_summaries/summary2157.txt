The site, launched in early January, is the brainchild of relationship author and blogger Helen Croydon. We are for singles looking for regular partners with mutual attraction, genuine friendship, respect and a magical spark but whom have no expectations of moving in after three months and value their free time and independence," claims the site, which users must opt into via other, more established dating sites. "Yet, you have this socially approved model of relationship that you live together." Croydon asserts that a low-maintenance or part-time relationship is distinctively different than the eloquently named "booty call," or the even more lucid "casual encounter" in that the goal is lasting love. "You don't have to see someone three to four nights a week to express love," she told CNN over the phone from London.
