Federer saved four match points to inflict a devastating 4-6 7-5 7-6 (6) defeat on Davis Cup teammate Stan Wawrinka at the O2 Arena in London in easily the best match of a tournament that has featured an overflow of lopsided results. Djokovic immediately broke for 2-0 and coasted, with Nishikori double faulting on match point. It was the third time he saved match points this year, the other occasions coming against Gael Monfils at the U.S Open and Leonardo Mayer in Shanghai. Federer saved three match points at 4-5 in the third on Wawrinka's serve and another on his own serve at 5-6 in the tiebreaker before converting on his first chance. "First couple points in the third set, I thought I had it," said Nishikori, the first Asian man to reach a grand slam final.
