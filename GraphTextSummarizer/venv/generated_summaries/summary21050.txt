Today, increasing numbers of people affected by diabetes could hamper efforts to control new TB infections. "We are doing integrated disease management," says Dr. Aaron Motsoaledi, the Minister of Health for South Africa, where one in every 116 people was newly infected with TB in 2013. The cost of treating diabetes could be huge in these nations and the unfaltering levels of drug-resistant forms of TB in recent years make any factors influencing the onset of disease a cause for further concern. Globally, the rate of new TB infections is falling by just 1.5% each year and any factors increasing the likely development and spread of the disease could be disastrous, as was the case with TB and HIV/AIDS 20 years ago. The number of people with diabetes is predicted to be 592 million by 2035, with the majority living in countries with high rates of TB, such as India, China, Brazil, Indonesia, Pakistan and Russia.
