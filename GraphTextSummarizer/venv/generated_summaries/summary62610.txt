Glyzelle and Jun are both in the care of Tulay ng Kabataan Foundation, a non-governmental organization that looks after Manila's street children. "There are many children neglected by their own parents," Glyzelle said Sunday at a ceremony at a 400-year-old Catholic university in Manila. This week, the 12-year-old girl was on a stage in front of tens of thousands of people, asking Pope Francis why God lets children suffer. Another former street child, Jun Chura, told Pope Francis about his struggle to survive without a home. A few years ago, Glyzelle Palomar was begging for food on the streets of northern Manila.
