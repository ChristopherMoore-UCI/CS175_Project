" Rolling Stone: The life and times of the hip-hop great Like "Notorious," the biopic that starred first-time actor Jamal Woolard as Biggie, Fuqua hopes to cast an unknown to portray Tupac. (Rolling Stone)  -- The long-gestating Tupac Shakur movie may finally begin production this November, now that director Antoine Fuqua ("Training Day") has brought on Oscar-nominated screenwriters Stephen J. Rivele and Chris Wilkinson to pen a new script. Plans for the movie began in 2007, when Tupac's mother, Afeni Shakur, sold the rights. He was in the process of changing himself, and entering a new phase of his life," says Rivele, who previously teamed with Wilkinson to script "Ali" and "Nixon." Instead, it will focus onTupac's last day, and flash back on the four years that preceded his still-unsolved shooting death in Las Vegas.
