-- Brett Favre's 297-game NFL record for consecutive starts for quarterbacks won't be getting any longer. The 41-year-old "Iron Man," who has held the record since 1999, was out for Monday night's game against the New York Giants, Vikings spokesman Jeff Anderson said. Including playoff games, he's started an almost unbelievable 321 consecutive games. He took over the quarterbacks lead in consecutive starts on November 7, 1999, against the Chicago Bears. That lengthy career means a lot more records -- he is the only NFL quarterback to throw more than 500 touchdown passes or to pass for more than 70,000 yards, among many others.
