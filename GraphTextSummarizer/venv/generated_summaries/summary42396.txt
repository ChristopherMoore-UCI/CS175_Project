"I just remind conservative commentators that for years, what we've heard is, the biggest problem on the bench was judicial activism or a lack of judicial restraint, that an unelected group of people would somehow overturn a duly constituted and passed law," the president said. On Monday, Obama said a Supreme Court ruling overturning the law passed by Congress would amount to the kind of "judicial activism" that conservative commentators oppose. "But it's precisely because of that extraordinary power that the court has traditionally exercised significant restraint and deference to our duly-elected legislature, our Congress." Asked what would happen if the high court strikes down the health care law's individual mandate, which requires people to have health coverage or pay a fine, Obama said he believed the provision would be upheld. " On Tuesday, Obama made no mention of judicial activism, focusing instead on people who have been helped by the law even though it has yet to be fully implemented. and I think the justices should understand that in the absence of an individual mandate, you cannot have a mechanism to ensure that people with pre-existing conditions can actually get health care," Obama said then.
