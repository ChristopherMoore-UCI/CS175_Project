-- Singer George Hamilton IV, known as the "International Ambassador of Country Music," has died at a Nashville hospital following a heart attack, the Grand Ole Opry said in a press release. His other country hits were "Before This Day Ends," "Three Steps to the Phone" and "If You Don't Know, I Ain't Gonna Tell You." Hamilton performed around the world and became the first American country singer to appear in the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia and was the first to record a studio album in Eastern Europe, the Grand Ole Opry said. The North Carolina native died Wednesday Saint Thomas Midtown Hospital in Nashville. Hamilton started out as a pop singer and had a million-selling hit "A Rose and a Baby Ruth" in 1956 before switching to country. The singer was not related to actor George Hamilton.
