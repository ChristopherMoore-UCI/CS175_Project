" What makes it different in the case of Carmel, New York, High School seniors Dylan Meehan and Bradley Taylor is what they won: the superlative of "Cutest Couple," as highlighted in the school yearbook. Lots of people win 'Cutest Couple,'" said the elder Taylor. " Bradley Taylor, who has participated in plays at his school, and at a community theater, received a full scholarship to the New York University Gallatin School of Individualized Study. The yearbooks were distributed Wednesday, and we didn't get any calls until someone posted it online," Carroll, whose school is about 65 miles north of New York City, told CNN Tuesday. Taylor's father, Robert Taylor, agreed with Carroll in saying that in this day, it should be no surprise that a gay couple won the "Cutest Couple" title.
