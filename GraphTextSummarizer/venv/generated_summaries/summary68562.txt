Beachwear company Tavik made the shirt, hence the surfing term "Hang Loose," but the inclusion of the noose led posters on social media to draw connections to lynching and suicide. T.J. Maxx has pulled a T-shirt from its shelves after a shopper tweeted an image of the shirt featuring the phrase "Hang Loose" and an illustration of a noose, leading to an uproar on social media. "At T.J. Maxx, we take product matters very seriously and appreciate that this T-shirt was brought to our attention," T.J. Maxx spokeswoman Doreen Thompson said. "We mistakenly purchased a few hundred units of the item, and unfortunately, with thousands of products coming into each of our stores every week, our product review process missed this item. Tavik PR manager Kelly McElroy said the company regrets the design.
