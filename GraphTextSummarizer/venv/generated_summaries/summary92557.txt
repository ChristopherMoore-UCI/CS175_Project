Razer wanted to bolster the hardware specs without detracting from what makes the Blade unique in portable computer gaming -- its size. USB ports are all located on the left hand side of the deck so if you want to add a mouse for serious gaming, you'll need a long cord -- or a wireless one mouse. However, this machine is built for gaming performance and that's where most of the improvements were targeted. The battery life isn't as long as I'd like, but the battery pack is slim and sleek, which is good for mobile gaming and finding those outlets on the road. What makes the Blade different than standard laptops is its unique Switchblade interface, which sits on the right-hand side of the keyboard.
