The same thing that got him interested in playing video games in the first place, Dr. Scott Rigby says. "I think that translates really well to exercise and bodybuilding because you have to have that level of knowledge, (and) you have to have that commitment." Rigby says the community around online games, or fitness, satisfies one of the last psychological needs: relationships. Talens and Wang are the co-founders of Fitocracy, a website that's turning gaming geeks into fitness geeks. "In video games, you're constantly getting information about your achievements and (learning) how to do things better," Ryan says. A second motivator in video games is the feeling of freedom and autonomy, Rigby says.
