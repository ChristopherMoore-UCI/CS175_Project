Mid-table Espanyol lost 1-0 at the Nou Camp in December, but could have led at halftime in the first match between the two teams at the new Cornella-El Prat stadium. Should that match in Italy go ahead if European air travel resumes following the volcanic ash fallout from Iceland, Inter boss Jose Mourinho will have eagerly noted Espanyol's success in nullifying Barcelona's star-studded line-up. The stalemate was the first time Barcelona had failed to score in La Liga since October, and came ahead of Tuesday's Champions League semifinal first leg away to Inter Milan. Alves was dismissed for a second booking in the 62nd minute after body checking Jose Callejon, but Espanyol could not take advantage of having an extra man. Barcelona had hit the crossbar when winger Pedro's cross deceived goalkeeper Carlos Kameni, but the home side created the better chances and should have scored just before halftime but Victor Valdes pushed striker Osvaldo's shot onto the near post.
