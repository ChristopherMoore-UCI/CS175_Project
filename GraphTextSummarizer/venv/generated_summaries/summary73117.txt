Despite the push in green cars in previous years following government subsidies for cleaner vehicles, this year's focus turned to gas-guzzling SUVs. "Last year, more Jeep vehicles were sold in China than in any other country besides the U.S. and Canada." Manley said because the brand is committed to China, it's important to design and tailor vehicles specifically to Chinese tastes. " Automakers have turned their attention to bigger cars and flashier cars to attract consumers since there are fewer government-backed incentives to pursue green technology, analysts say. " Jeep and Aston Martin are among many foreign automakers hoping to woo hundreds of thousands of Chinese consumers visiting the show this week, especially as China has become the world's largest auto market amid a sales slump in Europe and tepid growth in the United States. "Since last year, we've seen growth rates of 50 to 60%, something I would definitely would not expect this year, but there's definitely sustainable growth to come.
