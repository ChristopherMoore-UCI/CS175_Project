They'll get paid eventually, but that's little solace now when Kamin's figuring out how to stretch out her last check -- for 48 hours of pay instead of 80 -- to cover her kids' before-and-after-school care and the gas she needs to keep showing up to work. Kamin canceled the private tutoring her son has received since falling behind in school last year and has told her daughter she can't go to two birthday parties because they can't pay for gifts or gas to get there. "Having to explain to your children why they can't go to tutoring right now, or why they can't get a Halloween costume or pumpkin, or why they can't attend a friend's birthday party, all because of this nonsense in Washington, is horrible," Kamin wrote on CNN iReport. Lorien also reflected on the irony of the situation -- her grandchildren having to take government assistance because the government forced her out of work. Kamin has tried to shield her children from her money woes; they've already been through a lot, having lost their father, uncle and grandfather in a boating accident last year.
