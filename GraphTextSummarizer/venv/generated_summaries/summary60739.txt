-- An Iranian citizen and an airline pilot from Kentucky pleaded guilty to violating U.S. export law on Monday through a scheme to send aircraft and parts to Iran for civilian use. According to the two-count indictment, the men conspired to and also actually violated U.S. law by exporting aircraft or parts to Iran. Prosecutors said Asefi used his company's office in Britain as a point to get goods from the United States and ship them through third parties. Prosecutors said the helicopters and engines were intended for civilian use. The indictment said Asefi sent requests to Karimian to buy aircraft and parts in the United States.
