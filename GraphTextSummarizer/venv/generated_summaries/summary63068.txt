-- A Guatemalan man accused in five rapes in Palm Beach County, Florida, has been extradited to the United States to face charges, officials announced Thursday. Baltazar Gabriel Delgado Ros was extradited Wednesday after Palm Beach investigators worked to bring him back to the United States. In 2011, he was arrested in Guatemala on charges in the attempted rape of a minor, Gregg said. DNA evidence linked the suspect to the five victims, said Capt. Carol Gregg of the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office.
