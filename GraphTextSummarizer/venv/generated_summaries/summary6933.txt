-- Ex-Germany international Jens Lehmann is set to make a sensational return to English club Arsenal ten months after announcing his retirement from soccer. He was part of Arsenal's 'Invincibles' side who went through the entire 2003-04 season unbeaten as they secured the English Premier League title. " Lehmann enjoyed a notoriously fractious relationship with Arsenal's current number one goalkeeper, Spaniard Manuel Almunia, with several of their disagreements spilling over into the public arena. Wenger insisted it was a good move for the club, who have been knocked out of three competitions in the last three weeks, given injuries to Wojciech Szczesny, Vito Mannone and Lukasz Fabianski. "I think Jens Lehmann will get the best out of Almunia, because he will show him every day he is ready to fight for his place -- as he has always been.
