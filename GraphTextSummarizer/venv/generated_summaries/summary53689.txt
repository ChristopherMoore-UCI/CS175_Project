-- None of the seven doctors and one nurse investigated by the state will face criminal prosecution in the death of singer Michael Jackson, the state attorney general's office said Wednesday. A consultant's report included in the autopsy said the level of lorazepam, a powerful anti-anxiety agent found in Jackson's body "would have accentuated the respiratory and cardiovascular depression from propofol. The Los Angeles County coroner ruled that Jackson's death was from an overdose of propofol, a powerful anesthesia used to put surgical patients to sleep. But a doctor who prescribed drugs to the pop singer using a fake name shortly before the singer's death could be disciplined by the California medical board, according to Christine Gasparac, a spokeswoman for Attorney General Jerry Brown. Searches of Jackson's rented mansion revealed a long list of prescription drugs in his bedroom after his death, according to court documents and the autopsy report.
