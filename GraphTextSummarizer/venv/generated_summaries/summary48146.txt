-- American-born al Qaeda spokesman Adam Gadahn is calling for attacks on U.S. ambassadors around the world. In 2007, he also called for attacks on U.S. diplomats, vowing that al Qaeda would target American diplomats and embassies in retaliation for the Afghanistan and Iraq wars. In a 39-minute video, Gadahn praised the death of Libya's U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens on September 11 last year -- and urged wealthy Muslims to offer militants rewards so they can kill others, according to SITE, a jihadist monitoring group. Specifically, he referenced a bounty set for the death of U.S. Ambassador to Yemen, Gerald Feierstein. Gadahn has made similar videos in the past.
