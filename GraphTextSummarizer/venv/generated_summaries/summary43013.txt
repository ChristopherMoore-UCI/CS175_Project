The report found several Penn State officials concealed evidence that former assistant coach Jerry Sandusky had sexually abused minors. The fate of a 900-pound statue of Joe Paterno remains unclear as the Penn State community debates the former head football coach's legacy in light of a recent report that said several Penn State officials helped empower Jerry Sandusky in sexually abusing minors. Do we cross out his name from the history of State College?" Commissioned to design a sculpture honoring Paterno more than a decade ago, Di Maria attended his first football game in Beaver Stadium and, unbeknownst to the coach, took pictures of Paterno on the field. However, one man, the sculptor, hopes Penn State officials do not rush to make a judgment. A decision will be made in seven to 10 days on whether the bronze tribute will remain on campus, said Penn State spokesman David La Torre.
