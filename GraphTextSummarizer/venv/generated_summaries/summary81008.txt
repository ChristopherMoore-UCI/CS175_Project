"On a top level, the big beer companies are supporting craft beer because it helps bring more people to beer," says Rob Heyns, founder of League of Beers, an online store offering local and international craft beers to enthusiasts in South Africa He adds, however, that craft beer still has a long way to go before it can take on the mass beer producers. " Beer makers have also started using a number of beer festivals and tasting events to raise the profile of their brands and bring their products to a wider audience. Inspired by an international boom for local, independent microbreweries, the business of craft beer has also taken off in South Africa recently, as growing numbers of small producers are experimenting with styles and techniques to satisfy a rising thirst for new flavors and novel brews. "That's the best that way craft beer can win." He says craft beer is a great trend that's about finding something special.
