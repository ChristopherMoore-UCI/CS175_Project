[Breaking news update 1:35 p.m. ET] President Barack Obama knew there would be "glitches" and said ahead of time there would be problems in the October 1 rollout of a key part of his health care initiative, but "there is no question that we did not anticipate the scale of problems with the website," White House spokesman Jay Carney said on Wednesday. Kathleen Sebelius said President Barack Obama didn't hear that there may be problems with the sign-up portal for his signature health care law until it went live on October 1. "We want it to be smooth and easy and let consumers compare plans." Obama: No 'sugarcoating' problems with website Bringing the 'A-Team' A team of high-tech experts from within the government and from Silicon Valley is going to tackle the issues, Sebelius said. "Nobody's madder than me about the website not working as well as it should," Obama said, "which means it's going to get fixed." Calls for resignation Several top Republicans -- including 2012 vice presidential nominee Rep. Paul Ryan -- have called on Sebelius to step down due to the program's problems. And not all of them have necessarily enrolled in health care plans.
