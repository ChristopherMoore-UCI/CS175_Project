These families are forever changed because these men and women have put their butts on the line to fight for freedom, which ain't free, baby. Wounded Warrior Project is giving back to that man or woman who has gone over and put their life on the line and been wounded. -- Country music star Wynonna Judd is a supporter of the Wounded Warrior Project, an organization that helps injured service members and their families. Judd: Part of (my music's) proceeds go to Wounded Warrior Project, which is an absolute American dream. I'm constantly aware that my part in this is to be there to support them, to be a backdrop of everyday life for these families.
