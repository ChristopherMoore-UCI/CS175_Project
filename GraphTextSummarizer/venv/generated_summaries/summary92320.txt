Letta said reforms to pull Italy out of recession must continue, and that political stability is the key to boosting growth and creating more jobs. Amanpour: Berlusconi turns Italy into a political circus Letta, who took office five months ago, argued that the country needs political stability to help its recovery from its economic woes. In an apparent reference to Berlusconi's legal difficulties, Letta told senators Wednesday that they must make a distinction between the judicial troubles of Berlusconi, or any other member of parliament, and the job of the executive. "A government and political crisis would only mean more economic difficulties," he told lawmakers. "I definitely do not believe that this time around Mister Berlusconi can escape his fate," Former Prime Minister Mario Monti told CNN's Christiane Amanpour Wednesday from Rome.
