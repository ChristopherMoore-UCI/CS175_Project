Belgian security services have become increasingly worried about the threat from fighters returning from terrorist safe havens in Syria and Iraq. European officials believe about 2,000 EU citizens have answered the call to jihad in Syria, including the wives of fighters. -- Five people, including a married couple, have been arrested in Europe on suspicion of terrorist activities, a senior Belgian counterterrorism official with knowledge of the case told CNN Sunday. The weapons were recovered in a raid on one of the suspects' Brussels residence on August 6. The couple -- Dutch nationals of Turkish origin -- were arrested August 6 at Brussels Airport on their way back from a two to three day trip to Istanbul.
