Under the lifetime ban, Sterling is prohibited from NBA games or practices, stepping foot inside any Clippers facility, taking part in business or personnel decisions, or having a role in league activities such as attending NBA Board of Governors meetings. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver detailed Sterling's punishment at a news conference eight hours before the Clippers' fifth game of the playoff series with the Warriors. Hours before, Clippers owner Donald Sterling had been banned for life from the NBA for racist remarks revealed over the weekend. "I hope that every bigot in this country sees what happened to Mr. Sterling and recognizes that if he can fall, so can you," said Sacramento Mayor Kevin Johnson, a former NBA All-Star. Asked whether he expressed any remorse, the commissioner said, "Mr. Sterling has not expressed those views directly to me."
