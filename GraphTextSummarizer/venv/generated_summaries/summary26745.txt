Married same-sex couples gain equal tax benefits "The denial of benefits to spouses in same-sex marriages is not rationally related to any ... military purposes," the judge wrote. -- The Department of Veterans Affairs cannot deny benefits to the wife of a lesbian military veteran, a U.S. district judge in California said in a ruling that in part cites this summer's Supreme Court invalidation of a key Defense of Marriage Act section. While Cooper-Harris' case moved through the court system, the Supreme Court in June rejected the part of DOMA that denied federal benefits to same-sex partners, even those legally married. Tracey Cooper-Harris, an Iraq and Afghanistan war veteran who sued the department last year after it denied dependency benefits to her wife -- whom she legally married in California -- because the federal government didn't recognize same-sex marriages. In Thursday's ruling, Judge Consuelo B. Marshall, after noting the DOMA rejection, ruled that the government couldn't use Title 38 to deny benefits to Cooper-Harris' wife, Maggie Cooper.
