" The Cardinals played without Kevin Ware, the sophomore guard who suffered one of the most grotesque injuries in college sports while playing Duke on March 31. " Ware's teammate Luke Hancock was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player, helping pull Louisville out of a 12-point hole to lead the Cardinals with 22 points.
