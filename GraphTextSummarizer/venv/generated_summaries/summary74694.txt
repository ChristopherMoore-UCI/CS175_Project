Storms and tides are natural, but sea level rise is not. We are curious to see how well they could sort out the multiple threats -- wind, storm surge, heavy rain. They do not adequately appreciate that a storm can be violently destructive hundreds of miles from its center, and that it can bring damage from threats other than wind -- threats that are particularly serious for Sandy. The ships could sail north up the Hudson to escape danger, but sea walls and the subways are fixed in space. The tides are the first, and the second is the water pushed coastward by storms.
