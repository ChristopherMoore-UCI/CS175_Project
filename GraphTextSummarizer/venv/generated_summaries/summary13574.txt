"Past trends indicate that television media that performs well during Ramadan carry their ratings earned for months to come," explains M Shaharyar Umar, PARC's marketing director. On Ramadan, it is double that, because people have more downtime; more me- and we- A good portion of Ramadan commercials are rife with clichÃ©s, says Gadallah. An audience measurement system called Tview was introduced in the UAE last year prior to Ramadan, and found that Emirati viewers watched TV for an average of six hours and nine minutes a day during the first ten days, 32 minutes more than during the first six months. In 2006, Gadallah decided to try something different with Nando's, an international fast food chain that wanted to gain more traction with Arab youth.
