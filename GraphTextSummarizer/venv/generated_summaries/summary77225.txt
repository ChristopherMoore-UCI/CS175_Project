Oosthuizen, the 2010 Open champion, fired a one-under par 71 to finish on eight under par, while Grace is one shot further back after carding a 68. The 22-year-old, who sealed a maiden European Tour victory in the Johnnie Walker Championship at Gleneagles last August, finished his round with a birdie to edge ahead of France's Victor Dubuisson (69) and Dutchman Joost Luiten who shot a round of 70. The reigning Masters champion finished 2013 in brilliant form capturing the Australian PGA Championship and Masters titles last November and is well placed for a weekend charge after a round of 66 took him into a six-way tie for fifth. Home favorites Louis Oosthuizen and Branden Grace are fourth and fifth respectively. Meanwhile at the Sony Open in Hawaii, Brain Stuard completed a second successive round of 65 to lead by one from Australia's Marc Leishman and Hideto Tanihara from Japan at the halfway stage.
