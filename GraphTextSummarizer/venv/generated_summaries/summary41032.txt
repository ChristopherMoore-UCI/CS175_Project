Unless Iran is prepared to give up its quest for nukes (and it isn't), we've averted war but not eliminated the threat. It might even pave the way for broader discussions on other key issues that divide Iran and the West. For the past six months, the relationship between Iran and the West has been defined by covert war and much talk of an overt one. But it's hard to see how these will turn into a sustainable deal that can convince the West, let alone the Israelis, that Iran has given up its quest for nukes. Had the Shah not been turned out by the 1979 revolution, Iran would already have nukes.
