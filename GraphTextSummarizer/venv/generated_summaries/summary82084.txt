But now, Instagram is letting iPhone users ditch the tripods and take time-lapse videos on the go with its new app, Hyperlapse. Unlike Instagram, Hyperlapse is more a tool for creating videos than a social sharing app. Hyperlapse videos can run up to 45 minutes on the iPhone 5, 10 minutes on the iPhone 4. -- Time-lapse videos are usually a stationary affair, shot from a fixed location and angle over an extended period of time. Hyperlapse is only available on the iPhone.
