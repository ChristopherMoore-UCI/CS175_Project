Avonte Oquendo, 14, was last seen on surveillance video running out of Center Boulevard School in Long Island City on the afternoon of October 4. David Perecman, the Oquendo family's attorney, told CNN last week that he is taking steps to investigate how Avonte was able to escape school grounds unsupervised. " "I just need to find my son because he needs his family; he cannot fend for himself out there," Vanessa Fontaine told CNN affiliate WABC last week. Police say Avonte was last seen wearing a gray-striped shirt, black jeans and black sneakers. Transportation officials in New York suspended overnight track maintenance on the city's transit system this weekend as workers combed the underground network for a missing teenager with autism.
