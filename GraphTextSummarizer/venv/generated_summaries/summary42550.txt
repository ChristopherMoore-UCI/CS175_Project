" Bryan Corbin, the attorney general's public information officer, released a statement to CNN saying, "The AG's Office noted the confusion and inconsistency for the public that has occurred since Wednesday as most county clerks are issuing marriage licenses to -- and performing marriages for -- same sex couples, but a few clerks are not." "Hundreds of loving, committed couples were finally able to join in marriage this week, and we delivered more than 12,000 petition signatures today asking Attorney General Greg Zoeller not to pursue any appeals of the ruling overturning the state's ban on same-sex marriage," said Kyle Megrath of the group. -- Same-sex marriages are on hold in Indiana after the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals approved an emergency stay request Friday evening. Shortly after the state's ban on same-sex marriage was overturned by a federal judge Wednesday, Indiana Attorney General Gregory Zoeller's office announced it would file an appeal. Hoosiers Unite for Marriage, an Indiana group supporting same-sex marriage, expressed disappointment in the attorney general's office pursuing a stay.
