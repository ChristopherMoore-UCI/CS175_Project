"If you are watching this message," Rosenberg said on the video, "it is because I was assassinated by President Alvaro Colom, with help from Gustavo Alejos," the president's private secretary. Some analysts say they have no knowledge of Colom or others in his inner circle being involved in the killings, but point to Guatemala's history of corruption and large-scale involvement in the drug trade. " Peter Hakim, president of the Washington-based Inter-American Dialogue think tank, said Guatemala has a reputation for corruption and the drug trade. Colom was elected in November 2007 on a promise to lessen Guatemala's horrendous poverty. A video with Rodrigo Rosenberg appears on YouTube in which he accuses Guatemala's leader in his death.
