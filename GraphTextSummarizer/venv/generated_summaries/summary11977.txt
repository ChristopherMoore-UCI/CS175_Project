President Raul Castro, once the world's longest serving defense minister, assumed the presidency in 2006 when his older brother, Fidel Castro, stepped down because of illness -- at first temporarily, and then permanently in 2008. "The Cabinet is now substantially different to what it was in 2006, and substantially different to what it was in 2008," when Fidel Castro officially ceded power, said Julia Sweig, senior fellow at Council on Foreign Relations and recent author of "Cuba: What Everyone Needs to Know." "Of course this is Castro solidifying control," she said, "but it's also an attempt to impose a culture of governance and efficiency" in leadership positions that "under Fidel were very uneven. " Sweig and others contend that recent changes in leadership may be part of broader economic measures intended to streamline Cuba's bloated state sector, which Raul Castro recently said has supported an excess of up to a million workers. -- Cuban President Raul Castro replaced two high-level government ministers Monday -- citing errors and incompetence -- in the latest round of replacements at top-level government posts. Since then, many analysts have speculated that the younger Castro has worked to consolidate power, replacing top government posts with army brass.
