"Three definite hits: biometrics, large screen home displays, video telephone calls," Rogers said. Future Marty has a video call with his coworker and boss, people are able to answer the phone with glasses that are very much like Google glass, and of course hoverboards do exist, though they're not as cool or as high-flying as in the movie. Flying cars zipping through the air, auto-drying clothes that fit to your body, shoes that lace up on their own and time travel are all the norm when Marty McFly  and his girlfriend, Jennifer, played by Michael J. Fox and Elisabeth Shue, land in that year. Futurist Michael Rogers told Newsweek the movie did get a few things right. As for flying cars, there is the  Terrafugia Transition and the AeroMobil, but don't count on coasting the friendly skies in those anytime soon, especially using banana peels and such for fuel.
