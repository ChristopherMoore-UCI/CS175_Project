Over the next three months, I traveled more than 8,000 miles from Miami to New York, to America's heartland and San Francisco's Golden Gate, visiting hundreds of my former students along the way. I said I wanted to spend whatever time I had left visiting with former students. As I had hoped, they recalled favorite lessons and books from class, but, to my great surprise, it was our personal time together that seemed to have meant the most to them. Within hours of posting, I had invitations from students in more than 50 cities across the country. For six years, the only time I wasn't in class was when I was undergoing brain surgery.
