In 2010, MoMA PS1 in New York recognized the modern-day proliferation of fashion--art collaborations with "Move!", a series of performances and installations by fourteen pairs of designers and artists, including Marc Jacobs and Rob Pruitt, Cynthia Rowley and Olaf Breuning, and Proenza Schoulder and Dan Colen. In this way fashion collaborations widen public access to contemporary art and give them a cultural education via the cash register. Handbags and history Art Basel Miami Beach is the most timely example of where art meets fashion, but the mingling of artists and designers is by no means a new phenomenon. But the publicity this work received, particularly the 'Lobster' dress designed with Salvador Dal√≠ and later worn by Wallis Simpson, set the trend for future collaborations between contemporary artists and fashion houses. Whatever the level of creative involvement on the part of the artist, such collaborations between art and fashion represent an important meeting of the two worlds.
