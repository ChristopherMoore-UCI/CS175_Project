-- Eight people were killed Monday after a suicide bomber rammed an explosives-laden vehicle into the home of a senior police official, Karachi police said. The house was badly damaged, but the intended target of the attack -- Chaudhry Aslam -- is safe, said Jamil Khan, a Karachi police official. Six officers who were stationed as guards were killed in the attack, along with a mother and a girl as they were walking to the girl's school, said Shoukat Ali, a senior Karachi police official. Ihsan said the explosion is also a message to officials who work against the Taliban and alongside the United States. "I have been receiving threats from the Taliban for a long time," the police official said.
