The fired officers were in "leadership positions" at Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana, Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James said. But Wilson said Thursday that such behavior actually went well beyond that, having occurred as far back as November 2011 and as recently as November 2013. In addition, Col. Robert Stanley -- head of the 341st Missile Wing and a 25-year veteran -- "relinquished command" and submitted his resignation Thursday morning, said Lt. Gen. Stephen Wilson, the commander of the Air Force's Global Strike Command. Three of their targets in the drug probe happened to work as missile crew members at Malmstrom, which is how investigators got access to their cell phones -- and "found test material on them," according to Wilson. "Leadership's focus on perfection led commanders to micromanage their people," said Wilson, pointing to pressure to get 100% scores on monthly proficiency exams when only 90% was necessary to pass.
