-- Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan, a Christian from the south, was sworn-in on Sunday as his country tries to bounce back from violence unleashed last month by an Islamist sect. Boko Haram, an Islamic group that has challenged Nigerian government, is believed to be behind a series of bombings in the wake of Jonathan's re-election. After he was declared the victor, Jonathan warned that persistent post-election violence could threaten the stability of the country. Explosions in Nigeria's northeastern state of Borno killed a few and wounded dozens in late April in the days leading up to national governorship elections in attacks that police described as attempts to intimidate voters who had picked Jonathan. This year's win by Jonathan, who is from the majority-Christian southern part of the country, sparked violence in the Muslim-dominated north.
