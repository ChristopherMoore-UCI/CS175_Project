It is not the first time that baboons have made an appearance at the Sun City event and animals on the golf course are nothing new in the global game. Luke Donald had to dodge a baboon that cut across play at the Nedbank Golf Challenge in Sun City, South Africa. A three-legged alligator at last year's Zurich Classic in New Orleans gave a new meaning to the golfing term water hazard. Donald holds a one-shot lead over countryman Danny Willett going into the final round. The former world No. 1 jumped out of the way as the large primate bounded between the bunkers during the second round.
