"We sincerely regret the error and took immediate action to apologize, both in the newscast where the mistake occurred, as well as on our website and social media sites," according to Tom Raponi, KTVU/KICU vice president and general manager. The NTSB said it does not release or confirm the identities of crew members or other people involved in transportation accidents. "The names were presented, by the station, to the intern for confirmation," NTSB spokeswoman Kelly Nantel said. The NTSB did not identify the intern, but said, "Appropriate actions will be taken to ensure that such a serious error is not repeated. "Earlier today, in response to an inquiry from a media outlet, a summer intern acted outside the scope of his authority when he erroneously confirmed the names of the flight crew on the aircraft," the NTSB said Friday in a statement.
