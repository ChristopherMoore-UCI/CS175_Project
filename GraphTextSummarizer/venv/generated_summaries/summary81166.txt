" State Department: "We made significant progress in Geneva" The IAEA chief has reason to be optimistic, given that this is his first agreement with Iran in years, said Joseph Cirincione, president of Ploughshares Fund, a public grant-making foundation focused on nuclear weapons policy and conflict resolution. "Geneva talks and IAEA talks are independent, different and separate," Amano said. U.S. senators from both parties have pushed for tougher sanctions to increase pressure on Iran even as the Geneva talks showed early signs of promise last week. Representatives from Iran and those six countries are scheduled to meet again in Geneva on November 20, in another attempt to resolve the decade long dispute. Amano said Iran and the IAEA have agreed to focus on six practical measures that would be implemented in a three-month time line.
