Although the expressions of faith and religious practices might differ, religious faith itself is a constant in black America. The manifestation of that faith is the religious community, which consists mostly of Christian churches that have produced positive spiritual, social, economic and political results for black America. When states passed laws making it illegal to teach black people to read, many learned in church. Even people with little faith had great respect and admiration for the church, if for no other reason than it was a  "surrogate world" for black people, as E. Franklin Frazier noted in his book, "The Negro Church in America," in 1963. The question is whether black churches can continue to be the instruments of empowerment that they historically have been.
