Before Thursday, the last that Estado knew about its reporter was that he was around the city of Zawiya, a scene of fighting between opposition forces and forces loyal to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi. The three -- Feras Killani, Goktay Koraltan and Chris Cobb-Smith -- said that Libyan authorities took them into custody and seized their cameras and other equipment Monday at a checkpoint six miles south of Zawiya. A Brazilian journalist detained by authorities while reporting from Libya was released Thursday and will leave the country Friday, Libyan authorities said. The British newspaper has been in contact with Libyan government officials in Tripoli and London regarding his disappearance, the newspaper reported. On Wednesday, three BBC journalists who had also been detained outside of Zawiya told of beatings and mock executions that they and other detainees were subjected to by their captors.
