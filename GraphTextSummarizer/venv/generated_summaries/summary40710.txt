Also making the "most beautiful" cut this year: Gabrielle Union, Ariana Grande and Laverne Cox. Bullock, 50, joins a long line of actresses to receive the honor, including last year's cover girl, Lupita Nyong'o, and Gwyneth Paltrow in 2013. The selection of Bullock, the oldest woman to receive top honors in the history of the list, is a sign that beauty knows no age, say some. People magazine has anointed Sandra Bullock the world's most beautiful woman of 2015, the publication revealed on Wednesday. " The Oscar-winning star of movies including "Gravity," "The Blind Side" and "Crash" said she's happy with who she is. "As long as I'm healthy and strong and I don't let this mind of mine run amok with insecurities about what I am not, I can look in the mirror and like who I see."
