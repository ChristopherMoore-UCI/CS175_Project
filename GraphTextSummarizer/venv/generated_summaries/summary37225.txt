While Paige's texts indicate that Goldenvoice hasn't had any meetings with Indio city officials to discuss a long-term deal "because there isn't one," Indio mayor Glenn Miller said otherwise. "If the tax initiative of putting $4 million to $6 million onto Coachella gets on the ballot," Goldenvoice president Paul Tollett told the Sun, "we're going to take off [in] 2014; 2015 we'll be at a new facility outside of Indio." "Sam, his slogan should be, 'I want to turn the city of festivals into the city of festival' â€” the Tamale Festival, which is free," said Tollett. The report comes after the newspaper obtained a series of text messages in which Goldenvoice vice president Skip Paige told an Indio official about the plans to move Coachella and also its country music festival, Stagecoach, from the city. " While Coachella 2014 remains uncertain, dates for next year's festival have already been set for April 12th-14th and April 19th-21st.
