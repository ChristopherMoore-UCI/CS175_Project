-- David Bowie will release another album featuring new material, his long-time producer Tony Visconti has told CNN, in a revelation that will delight the singer's legions of fans. Bowie last year released "The Next Day," his first new music for a decade, without any warning, electrifying music lovers who assumed the reclusive legend had retired. " In the meantime a performance by Visconti and drummer Woody Woodmansey, the last surviving member of Bowie's famous Spiders from Mars backing band during his Ziggy Stardust breakthrough years, is as close as fans will get to experiencing Bowie's music live. The pair will perform Bowie's 1970 album "The Man Who Sold the World" in London, Glasgow and Sheffield, starting on Monday. Critical acclaim for the album was followed by rave reviews for the "Bowie Is" retrospective exhibition at London's V&A Museum, which is now touring the world.
