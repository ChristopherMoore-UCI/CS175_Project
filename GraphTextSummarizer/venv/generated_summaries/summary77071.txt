-- Roberto Mancini believes Carlos Tevez should apologize to Manchester City fans after the Argentina star changed his mind and decided to stay at Eastlands. " Mancini is set to recall controversial midfielder Nigel de Jong to his side for the trip to St James' Park. The Dutchman has just served a one-game ban after picking up five bookings, but it was his challenge on Newcastle's Hatem Ben Arfa in the home match in October which gained notoriety, although it went unpunished by referee Martin Atkinson. The saga was reminiscent of Wayne Rooney's situation at city rivals Manchester United, where the England star said he wanted to leave before a very public climb down and apology. Maybe he should apologize," Mancini told the official Manchester City website.
