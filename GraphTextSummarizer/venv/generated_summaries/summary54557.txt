The three men accused of plotting to bomb the New York City subway last year planned to attack trains at Times Square and Grand Central stations, a federal law enforcement source said Monday. The law enforcement source said Zazi would probably have chosen September 14 for the attack, but was also considering the September 15 or 16. The plot was foiled when the FBI began following Zazi and police stopped him on a bridge into New York. Since his arrest, Zazi has given authorities information about the plot. Zazi said that prompted him to dump his bomb materials and return to Denver, Colorado, where he was working as a shuttle driver, authorities said.
