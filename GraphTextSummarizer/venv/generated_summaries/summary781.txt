In the wake of Moore's announcement of their split two years ago, Kutcher tweeted: "I will forever cherish the time I spent with Demi. Kutcher, 35, filed the divorce petition last January -- citing irreconcilable differences -- but Moore, 51, made it clear in November 2011 that the marriage was over. -- Two years after Demi Moore announced she wanted to end her marriage to Ashton Kutcher, their union is legally undone. She was previously married to actor Bruce Willis and rock musician Freddy Moore. Moore and Kutcher began dating in 2003 and married in September 2005 despite a 15-year age difference.
