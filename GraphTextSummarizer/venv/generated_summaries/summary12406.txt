At Kyle's funeral, which, befitting the grandeur of his legend, was held in the Dallas Cowboys' massive football stadium, Taya Kyle did not shy away from her husband's darker side. In his autobiography, Kyle wrote about a confrontation with a celebrity whom he called "Scruff Face," later identified as former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura. Last year, a jury ordered Kyle's estate to pay Ventura nearly $2 million. While he was working to launch a security company -- Craft International, whose motto is, "Despite what your momma told you, violence does solve problems" -- Kyle dedicated much time to helping fellow veterans with mental health issues transition back to normal life after the battlefield. Kyle had taken his friend, Chad Littlefield, and fellow veteran Eddie Ray Routh to the firing range that day.
