The four guards who Faid allegedly held hostage "are safe and sound," said Lille prosecutor Frederic Fevre. He burst his way to freedom by allegedly detonating explosives that destroyed five doors, penitentiary union spokesman Etienne Dobrometz told CNN affiliate BFMTV. " In his autobiography, "Robber: From Suburbs to Organized Crime," Faid chronicled his progression from a petty thief to one of France's most notorious criminals, according to the book's publisher, La Manufacture De Livres. Still, officials from the prison guards' union pressed Taubira to provide better safety measures inside prisons, including more thorough searches of those who enter, BFMTV reported. Police detained a brother of Faid for questioning only, according to a law enforcement source, who did not provide other details about that development.
