-- Soap opera actor Dylan Michael Patton faces a judge Thursday on charges he sold cocaine out of his Los Angeles home. Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies arrested Patton at his home, which they then searched, according to the Los Angeles district attorney's office. Since Patton's Agora Hills home is next to Sumac Elementary School, he is charged with selling drugs within 1,000 feet of an elementary school, the criminal complaint said. Patton was nominated for a Daytime Emmy for outstanding young actor in a drama series in 2010, according to his official biography. Prosecutors said they will ask Patton's bail be set at $30,000.
