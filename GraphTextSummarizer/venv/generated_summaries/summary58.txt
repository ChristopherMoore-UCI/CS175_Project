The paper appears to convey that Bates had paid off a debt, according to Paul Carnahan, a librarian with the Vermont Historical Society in Barre, Vermont. He says records show Bates was born in Williamstown, Vermont, and died in 1808 at the age of 63. It turns out the document originally belonged to Jonathan Bates, a Vermont man who had served in the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War. "What's fascinating is that this turned up in a school classroom so far from Vermont," said Carnahan. The document reveals little else about Bates beyond his military service and his debt payment, according to Carnahan.
