Air marshals, flight attendants want TSA to reconsider Even if I were to concede that small knives no longer pose as imminent a threat as say, bottled water or shampoo, allowing knives stirs up grief and fear for so many. " In other words, knives probably won't endanger pilots, skyscrapers or expensive airplanes, but passengers and flight attendants? In 2004, the 9/11 Commission found that terrorists used knives such as Leatherman tools to overtake the crew. There is a reason knives were banned in the first place -- they killed people and made the 9/11 attacks possible. -- Like most Americans, I am stupefied that the Transportation Security Administration will soon permit passengers to carry some small knives on airplanes, especially since the process that turns checkpoints into maddening logjams -- removing shoes, liquids and computers -- remains unchanged.
