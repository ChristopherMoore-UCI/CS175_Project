Ivory Coast' Salomon Kalou pointed to the long path he and his captain Yaya Toure had taken to victory. As Boubacar Barry broke the deadlock, Ivory Coast legend Didier Drogba reacted to the moment. After saving two penalties, he slotted the winning kick against his opposite number, sending the West African nation into raptures. Millions around the world, including players past and present, took to social media to share their despair and jubilation. A dramatic 9-8 penalty shootout alleviated a turgid scoreless draw, but after a 23-year wait Ivory Coast will not care how they secured the silverware.
