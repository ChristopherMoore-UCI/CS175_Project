The McCarthy Cottage was the first home built by Roosevelt in Warm Springs, who started traveling to the area in 1924 seeking a solution for his polio, said Georgia Labor Commissioner Mark Butler The E.T. Curtis cottage was built in 1928 and was adjacent to the McCarthy Cottage. The so-called McCarthy Cottage and the E.T. Curtis Cottage in Warm Springs were discovered burning around 5:30 a.m. by an employee who lives near the property, according to a news release from the Georgia Department of Labor. "Because President Roosevelt resided there for four years, the McCarthy cottage was the cottage of most historical value." Roosevelt lived in the cottage until 1932 when he moved to the Little White House, also in Warm Springs. Butler said the nation has experienced a great loss with the burning of McCarthy cottage.
