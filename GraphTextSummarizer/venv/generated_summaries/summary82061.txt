-- Portugal's Rui Costa rode to glory in Gap Tuesday as Tour de France leader Chris Froome was left fuming by a late high speed tangle with arch rival Alberto Contador. Britain's Froome came under repeated attack on the final ascent from Contador of Spain, but with help from Sky teammate Richie Porte, each was repulsed. He remained in third place overall, 11 seconds behind Mollema, but four minutes 25 seconds in arrears of the all-conquering Froome, who was clearly unimpressed by Contador's approach. Dutchman Mollema was praised though for his sportmanship in refraining from making a further attack after Contador and Froome were held up by their incident. He made a timely attack on the final second category climb of a testing day's racing to finish 42 seconds clear of second placed Christophe Riblon of France.
