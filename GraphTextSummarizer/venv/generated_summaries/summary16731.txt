But the truth is that many private-sector businesses receive tax credits, tax deductions, government grants and government contracts. The study continues, "Even during the recession from 2007 to 2009, nonprofit jobs increased by an average of 1.9% per year. One might question whether jobs created in the nonprofit sector are really private-sector jobs, since many of the jobs are subsidized by the government through tax-deductible donations and direct grant support. At the same time, businesses averaged jobs losses of 3.7% per year." If nonprofits could receive tax credits, they could sell in a secondary market to businesses to grow more jobs.
