Though it's unclear whether any rebel group is responsible for the attack, Malian forces have battled Islamist militants in the northern part of the nation for years. A North African jihadist group, al-Murabitun, claimed responsibility for the attack, according to Mauritanian news agency Al Akhbar. The U.S. State Department said in January that al-Murabitun is a "newly-formed" militant group that has presence in northern Mali. The extremists toppled the tribe and seized control of a large piece of northern Mali, an area the size of France. A shooting at a bar popular with expatriates in Mali on Saturday killed five people, including French and Belgian citizens, authorities said.
