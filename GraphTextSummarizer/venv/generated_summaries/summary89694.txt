A North Carolina newspaper is reporting that Lowe's will not back down from its decision to pull commercials from TLC's "All-American Muslim," a reality show that offers a positive portrayal of Muslim life. Lamb's statements were made after the company met with North Carolina clergy members who delivered a petition from people opposed to the retailer's decision to pull commercials, according to the Charlotte Observer. " Meanwhile, the Florida Family Association claims that more than a million people sent emails companies who advertised on the TLC show and asked them to stop. Lowe's is based in Mooresville, North Carolina. " "The decision was absolutely not, despite what's been reported in the media, influenced by any one group," said Lowe's vice president of marketing, Tom Lamb.
