The Frenchman, who celebrates his 26th birthday this month, has spent the last 10 weeks dumpster diving -- eating only discarded food -- from France to Poland on a mission to highlight the issue of food waste. Right place, right time Luxembourg, too, is a land of plenty for dumpster divers, according to Dubanchet, something he puts down to its relative wealth and relaxed rules on food disposal. " Germany, he says, was the easiest country for dumpster diving, not because there was more food waste, but because people were more receptive to his mission. Dubanchet says he hopes in the future to work with supermarkets and restaurants to find ways of reducing waste. Sticking to a strict rule of only eating food that had been thrown out or was destined for the trash, Dubanchet asked the permission of supermarket and restaurant staff before rooting through their refuse.
