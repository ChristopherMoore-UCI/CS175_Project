The World Health Organization says 19 countries meet the "best practice for pictorial warnings," which include warnings in the local language and which must cover at least half of cigarette packages. Tobacco companies, including Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris Limited and British American Tobacco, had challenged the act as unconstitutional, saying the government was unfairly taking its intellectual property.

Last year the United States unveiled nine graphic health warning labels that must cover half the area of cigarette packages by this September, joining 41 other countries that mandate pictorial warnings.
