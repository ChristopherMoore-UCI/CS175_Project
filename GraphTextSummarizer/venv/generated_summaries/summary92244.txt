Iran blasted its mock-up of a U.S. aircraft carrier during naval drills on Wednesday, swarming the target with 100 speedboats armed with rockets, shoulder-launched missiles and mortars as well as striking it with cruise missiles, according to reports from Iran's semi-official Fars News Agency. Gen. Hossein Salami, lieutenant commander of the Revolutionary Guard, said Iran wasn't showing off all its capabilities during the games, according to a Fars report. "Iranian naval forces displayed their skills in targeting enemy vessels and destroyed a mock U.S. aircraft carrier during the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps Navy's massive Payambar-e Azam 9 (The Great Prophet 9) wargames in the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz," read a video caption on Fars' website. In 2014: Iran says it built copy of captured U.S. drone Mine-laying exercises were also part of the war games, according to the Fars report.
