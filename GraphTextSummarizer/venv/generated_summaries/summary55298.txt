With the new movie "Boyhood," writer/director Richard Linklater has created something wholly unusual: he took 12 years to film and finish the project, and its central conceit is watching a young boy, Mason, go from child to young man as his older sister and parents have their own maturation, too. While most coming-of-age stories are set in a specific period and have a script that can detail that story from the outset of production, Linklater's had to leave an "openness" to it, Arquette said. It sounds like an incredible gamble of money and time, especially without the certainty that Coltrane, who was just 6 when the film began production, would even be the right casting choice by the time they reached the story's end. Patricia Arquette plays Mason's mom, and Linklater's daughter, Lorelei, plays Mason's older sister. Yet rather than tell the usual "first" stories, Linklater zeroes in on those moments in-between the typical life milestones, creating something that resonates as emotionally and visually authentic.
