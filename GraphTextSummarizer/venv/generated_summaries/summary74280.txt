Reflecting on his most memorable moment attending the menorah lighting through the years, Shemtov, executive vice president of the American Friends of Lubavitch, said, "I was up there (on the stage) on a windy day and my hat blew off, and everyone cheered," even though it was at his expense, he reminisced. Just adjacent to the White House Christmas tree, the 30-foot menorah stands high enough to be seen from afar, and its height is regulated under Jewish law. On Sunday, as he has for more than 20 years, Rabbi Levi Shemtov presided over the annual lighting of the National Menorah. The event dates back to 1979, but it was President Ronald Reagan who officially designated the candelabrum, placed in the Ellipse just south of the White House, the National Menorah. "It's got to be visible, so it has to be at least two and half feet off the ground minimum, and not higher than 30 feet, because the rabbinical authorities deem that to be the height at which a person has to crane their neck to see it," Shemtov said.
