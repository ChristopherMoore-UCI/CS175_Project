-- There are more than 2,500 people serving life sentences without the possibility of parole for crimes they committed when they were juveniles. They include banning life without parole for juveniles convicted of felony murder but not other types of murder; banning life without parole for youths 14 and younger, but leaving undecided the constitutionality of this sentence for older teens; permitting life without parole for juveniles as an option but prohibiting it as a mandatory sentence, as it now is in about two-thirds of states that permit it; and various combinations of these alternatives. The argument in favor of life without parole for people convicted of murder is that the sentence is necessary to deter crime, protect public safety and remove from society those who are thought to be incorrigible. In 2010, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that life without parole for juveniles convicted of crimes other than homicide violated the Constitution's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment, a ruling that extended the court's logic in its 2005 decision to abolish the juvenile death penalty. There is no scientific evidence that sentencing juveniles to long prison sentences deters other adolescents from committing crimes, because the same immaturity that leads teenagers to do impulsive and reckless things makes them unlikely to think far enough ahead to be deterred by the prospect of a serious punishment.
