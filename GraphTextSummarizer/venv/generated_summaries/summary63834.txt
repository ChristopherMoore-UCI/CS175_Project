The four comrades -- Bhuwansing Limbu, Chandra Kumar Pradhan, Deoman Limbu and Nirbahadur Tamang -- are Nepalese and veterans of a detachment of a British Army that harks back to its colonial past. "I always tell my daughter, one day I will definitely go to Argentina," said Pradhan. "Suddenly we were in the coldest part of the country, with clothing and things not suitable for a climate like that," said Chandra Kumar Pradhan, as he recalled his time as a soldier serving with the British Army during the Falklands War in 1982. "They were conscripts -- we knew that later on," Deoman Limbu added. "I was very new at the time, I had been with the regiment for, I think, two weeks," Pradhan said.
