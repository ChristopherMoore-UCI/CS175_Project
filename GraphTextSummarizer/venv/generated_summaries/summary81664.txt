CNN repeatedly contacted the NYPD for comment about Matson's hit-and-run and the department's policy about cycling accident investigations, but did not receive a response. Although New York police and the city's Department of Transportation report increasing bicyclists, the number of bike deaths has remained steady. It's not just the facts of the incident -- or even the tiny particles of debris from the New York City street still in Matson's body -- that have left her upset. "Cyclists and pedestrians are being killed and seriously injured all over our city, once every 35 hours in fact," New York City Councilman James Vacca said at a hearing this year. "While there may be some lawbreaking among the cycling population, very few if any of those transgressions of the law are resulting in death or serious injury," said Paul Steely White, executive director of Transportation Alternatives, a bicycling advocacy group.
