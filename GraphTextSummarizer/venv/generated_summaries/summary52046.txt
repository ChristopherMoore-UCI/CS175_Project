Supermodel Natalia Vodianova's charity plans to build hundreds of play parks for children in her native Russia. Last year she organized a "Love Ball" in Moscow -- a Valentine's Day fundraiser that counted among the guests the likes of designer Valentino, actress Lucy Liu, singer Natalie Imbruglia, and supermodel Eva Herzigova. Vodianova, born and raised in Russia, was in the country during the 2004 Beslan school siege, in which at least 339 hostages, around half of them children, were killed. With an ethos that play is not only therapeutic for children, but a necessity, the foundation aims to provide playgrounds for Russia's urban youth. I go to very remote parts of Russia are far from Moscow and it gives these children an extra message of love.
