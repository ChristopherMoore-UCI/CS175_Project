Former President Bill Clinton said Tuesday that although the conflict in Syria will mean "an extended involvement" for the United States, airstrikes in the region do not mean "a prolonged involvement in a land war. "The strength of this coalition makes it clear to the world that this is not America's fight alone," President Barack Obama said on Tuesday before Clinton's comments. The former President, who in the past has been somewhat critical of Obama's Syria policy, said Tuesday that he backed the President's airstrikes. " "I think it will be an extended involvement with air power and with providing intelligence and other institutional support to the people who are fighting ISIS and trying to create a more inclusive set of governments in the Middle East," Clinton said. A coalition of countries, including the United States, launched overnight airstrikes against the terrorist group ISIS in Syria.
