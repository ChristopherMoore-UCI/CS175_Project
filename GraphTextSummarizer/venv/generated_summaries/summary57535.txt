He has introduced a new constitution, abolished the powerful Great Council of Chiefs, a traditional group of indigenous Fijian leaders who mostly inherited their positions, and done away with electoral boundaries that grouped people according to their ethnicity to the benefit of indigenous Fijians. Fiji's first coup in 1987 saw an elected, Indian-dominated coalition overthrown by indigenous Fijians, leading to the implementation, and later withdrawal, of a constitution that guaranteed indigenous political supremacy. While there are many Indo-Fijians who don't support Bainimarama -- and many indigenous Fijians, particularly among the poor, who do -- many indigenous voters were aggrieved by the changes he had brought about in the name of equality. In the 2007 census, indigenous Fijians accounted for about 57% of the population, Indo-Fijians for about 38%. At the heart of the dispute triggering the 2006 coup was proposed legislation that would have granted pardons to plotters of the previous coup, and two land rights bills that Bainimarama believed would have unfairly favored indigenous Fijians over the Indo-Fijian minority.
