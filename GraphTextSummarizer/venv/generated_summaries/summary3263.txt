The first responders experienced a scene for which no training could ever prepare them: a mushroom-cloud fireball lay waste to 37 blocks, including a nursing home, the local high and middle school, and many houses. They were allegedly abducted off the street in a Cleveland neighborhood by the homeowner, Ariel Castro, 52, who's now facing four counts of kidnapping and three counts of rape. But one of the women -- the one who bore a child by Castro -- finally shouted for help after Castro left the house and forgot to lock a big inside door. The people of Moore, Oklahoma, know it as the most powerful category of tornadoes. Locals call it the "Oklahoma standard" -- "persistence and a great positive attitude by the people to never give in," as University of Oklahoma football coach Bob Stoops puts it.
