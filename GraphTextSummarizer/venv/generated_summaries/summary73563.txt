But what can NATO countries do about it? Any request by Iraq to NATO for aid in fighting ISIS would be "considered seriously," according to NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen, who noted the Iraqi government hasn't reached out yet to the alliance. There was no indication given that NATO, as a group, will be deploying more ground troops anytime soon to any new conflict -- as it has done before most recently following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. "It is definitely a landmark event," President Petro Poroshenko said of the "strong, enormous support" that NATO government leaders have afforded Ukraine at the Wales summit. No one is saying that NATO is about to repeat what it did over 12 years ago, including sending legions of ground troops into a country as it did Afghanistan.
