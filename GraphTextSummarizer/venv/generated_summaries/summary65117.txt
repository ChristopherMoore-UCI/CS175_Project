Presuming that Aereo does, in fact, cease service as it now exists, there are other options out there for folks still unwilling to fork over the money for cable TV. Hulu focuses on new TV episodes (or, at least, newer ... more on that later) while Amazon and Netflix are mostly movies and previous seasons of popular shows. The court, in a 6-3 vote, ruled that the service violated copyright laws, even though it was using miniature TV antennas to access publicly broadcast signals from local TV stations. Also, none of the above-mentioned apps stream TV shows as they are airing. While many cable networks stream via their websites and mobile apps, most, like WatchESPN, require a cable subscription to access them.
