In backing Paul, McConnell will be choosing a favorite out of a Senate Republican caucus that includes several other potential candidates for president -- including Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida. But they've grown closer since then, as Paul helped McConnell fend off a conservative primary challenge and win a hard-fought 2014 re-election campaign against Democratic challenger Alison Lundergan Grimes. They also underscore how quickly Paul has been embraced by institutional figures to whom his father, Texas Rep. Ron Paul, was always an outsider. Just four years ago, the two Kentucky Republicans were squaring off against each other in a Senate primary -- with Paul defeating McConnell's choice for the seat, Kentucky Secretary of State Trey Grayson. Soon-to-be Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says he plans to endorse his Kentucky colleague, Rand Paul, in his widely expected bid for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination.
