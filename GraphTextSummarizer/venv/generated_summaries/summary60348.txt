"There are many challenges about living and working in space, including when a part or a tool is broken or simply is not working correctly, and the spare part is 200 miles away, here on the surface of the Earth," said Bill Hubscher of NASA's ISS Program Science Office at Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, in a video posted on NASA.gov. NASA's International Space Station 3-D printer project manager Niki Werkheiser says it's a historic achievement because it allows engineers "to e-mail our hardware to space instead of launching it." Humans on Mars by 2035? Before the 3-D printer flew to the space lab in September, the team printed a complete set of sample items here on Earth to be used as ground control samples. NASA's sci-fi dream could be reality "Since the inception of the human space program, we have been completely dependent on launching every single thing we need from Earth to space," said Werkheiser in the video. But how do pieces made in space compare with those made on Earth?
