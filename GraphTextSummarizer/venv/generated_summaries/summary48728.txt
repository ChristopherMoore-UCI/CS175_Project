Paul M. Merhige is accused of fatally shooting his twin sisters, Sitton's 6-year-old daughter Makayla -- Merhige's cousin -- and a 79-year-old aunt at a family home in Jupiter, Florida, on November 26. "Before the show even came on, Paul was being surrounded by the people behind me," Jim Sitton said Tuesday in Jupiter, Florida, standing in front of police officers. The couple at the hotel who called police went outside and lifted a tarp to look at Merhige's license plate and verify it was the vehicle sought, he said. -- The father of a 6-year-old girl, one of four relatives who police say were killed by another family member on Thanksgiving Day, said it was "unbelievable" how a tip from a television viewer brought about the arrest of the suspect. A viewer of the television show "America's Most Wanted" recognized descriptions of Merhige and his car and called police.
