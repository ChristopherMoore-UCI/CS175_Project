While most employers don't prohibit talk of politics, says Bryon Peterson, principle of Human Resources Group International Inc., companies tend to differ in policies and regulations regarding political discussion. My recommendation: While we as a company cannot prohibit political discussion, the company can provide recommendations and expectations," says Peterson. " "When you talk about it, you can make some people uncomfortable and not everyone is as passionate as other people might be. "I kind of like to divide and conquer, and discussion with employees is a pretty impactful way to address potential conflict," says Peterson. If you are unsure about your company's policy on political conversation, contact your human resources department.
