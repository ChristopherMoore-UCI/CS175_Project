Of course, there should be lots of conversations between parent and child on all these topics -- lesbian love affairs, affairs with older lovers, sexual desire when you are young -- before a child is launched into the adult world. We can have, as sex educators call it, "a teachable moment" other ways. I am also mystified that Scott talks about the movie as a realistic depiction of young love that teens will identify with. Some maintain that they can encourage sexual experimentation and a change in values in young people, while others disagree -- but as a parent, why go there? How sexually explicit films affect kids is debated among health professionals and sex researchers.
