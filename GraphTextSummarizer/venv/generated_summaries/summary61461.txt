Atletico replaced Barcelona atop the division after a comeback 3-2 win against Levante on Saturday in Madrid. Just as it did last week in the league against Valencia, the home team started slowly and Levante -- which entered the game with two straight victories after losing five in a row -- took full advantage. " Simeone's side is already assured of finishing above city rival Real Madrid come the end of 2013 given it has an eight-point advantage. "We have a lot of heart and (work hard)," Atletico manager Diego Simeone told reporters. Atletico pulled ahead of Barcelona by three points and is guaranteed of staying top heading into January if the defending champion doesn't win at Getafe on Sunday.
