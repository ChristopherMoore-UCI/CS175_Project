The blasts come a day after thousands of anti-government protesters stormed the airports to protest the return of Thai Prime Minister Somchai Wongsawat from the APEC summit in Peru. Passengers face a long wait inside Suvarnabhumi airport with most flights canceled. On Tuesday thousands of anti-government protesters partially shut down Suvarnabhumi Airport, the country's main airport, an airport spokesman said. Continued protests caused authorities to cancel all incoming and outgoing flights there, an assistant to airport director Serirat Prasutanond told CNN. The PAD has been leading protests against the government since May, accusing the government of being a front for ousted former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra.
