Spies with surveillance agencies in the  United States and United Kingdom may have spent time undercover as orcs and blood elves, infiltrating video games like "World of Warcraft" in a hunt for terrorists "hiding in plain sight" online. Unlike traditional console and desktop games in which players compete in a closed environment, massively multiplayer online games (MMOs) allow players from around the world to team up and play together, often in real time using in-game communication tools. A 2008 NSA memo called online gaming a "target-rich communications network" where terrorists could communicate "in plain sight. But apparently so many agents were engaged in playing video games for national security that a "deconfliction" group was created to make sure government agents weren't accidentally spying on each other. It's unclear whether the agencies had surveillance capabilities within the massively multi-player games that normal players would not.
