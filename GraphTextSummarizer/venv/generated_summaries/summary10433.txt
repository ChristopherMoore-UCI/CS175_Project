-- Former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin joined the national battle over Arizona's controversial new immigration law Saturday, appearing with Gov. Jan Brewer in Phoenix to denounce the Obama administration's criticism of the law. President Obama has criticized the Arizona law, saying that in dealing with the immigration issue, "the answer isn't to undermine fundamental principles that define us as a nation. Passed in April, the law requires immigrants in Arizona to carry their registration documents at all times and allows police to question individuals' immigration status in the process of enforcing any other law or ordinance. "And while Mexico's president has begun to crack down on the violent drug cartels and corruption in his own country," she continued, "It's time for the United States government to enforce the rule of law as well." Critics say it will lead to racial profiling, while supporters deny that and say it is needed to crack down on increasing crime involving illegal immigrants.
