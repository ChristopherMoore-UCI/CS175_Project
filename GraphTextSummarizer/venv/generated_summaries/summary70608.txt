Carlos Cruzado, president of the Gesta union of tax agency technicians who work at the Treasury Ministry, said it's unusual for a prosecutor to seemingly side with the princess, who's facing preliminary charges of tax fraud, instead of standing up for the interests of the nation's tax collection agency. On Saturday, Princess Cristina, the youngest daughter of King Juan Carlos, will be the first direct member of Spain's royal family to testify in court while facing preliminary charges for a crime, Spain's royal household has confirmed. But Castro continued his investigation and last month issued a 227-page order, again bringing preliminary charges against the princess, for alleged tax fraud and money laundering through a separate company, Aizoon, in which she had a 50% stake, with her husband holding the rest. Judge Castro last April leveled preliminary charges against the princess in this case, but they were dropped in May after prosecutors appealed to a provincial court, citing insufficient evidence. The royal household two years ago excluded Princess Cristina and her husband from representing Spain at official functions, like one this week in Madrid, when the King, Queen Sofia, Crown Prince Felipe and his wife, Princess Letizia, welcomed the foreign diplomatic corps.
