" By acknowledging what we don't know about God and focusing upon improving our human relationships here on Earth, says the modernist Christian, we become fuller human beings and fuller Christians. Just as controversial are the President's claims that one does not necessarily achieve salvation through Christ alone (that there is more than one "path to grace") or that Christianity is stained by some sort of historical sin of political manipulation. The challenge faced by conservatives is surely not to brand him un-American but rather to answer his specific points in a manner that asserts that our brand of Christianity is just as compassionate and intellectually rigorous. " "The President's comments this morning at the prayer breakfast are the most offensive I've ever heard a president make in my lifetime," said Jim Gilmore, former Republican governor of Virginia. It's strange because the President has missed few opportunities to inject Christianity into his rhetoric -- to an extent that really ought to irritate his more radical liberal allies.
