And while Orman seems to have gained covert support from Democratic leadership, he's also picked up support from a group of moderate Kansas Republicans that includes former Kansas Republican Party chairs and top state legislators who say Roberts and Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback have moved too far to the right. By pulling their candidate, Democrats are hoping independent candidate Greg Orman will unseat Republican Sen. Pat Roberts and join the Democratic caucus in the Senate. Orman hasn't said which party he would caucus with in the Senate, but he's indicated that his success can get Kansas a sweet deal, whichever side he decides to bat for. Democratic strategist Steve Murphy said Democrats have already done all they can do to help Orman take the Kansas seat -- they've cleared the field. But if Orman chooses to caucus with Democrats in the Senate, Birkhead said he likely wouldn't get reelected.
