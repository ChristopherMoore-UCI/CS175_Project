-- Real Madrid snatched a 3-2 victory at Valencia to remain five points behind Spanish leaders Barcelona, who triumphed 1-0 in the Catalan derby with Espanyol earlier on Saturday night. Madrid had twice gone ahead through Garay's fellow Argentinian Gonzalo Higuain but Valencia -- who won last season's corresponding fixture 3-0 -- battled back through Spain striker David Villa and Joaquin Sanchez. Pep Guardiola's team will now head to Dubai for the FIFA World Club Cup, where they will meet Atlante in the semifinals following the Mexican team's 3-0 win against New Zealand champions Auckland on Saturday. The Swede slotted his 11th league goal this season, one behind top scorer Villa, after Xavi went down in the area despite minimal contact from former Barcelona youth player Raul Baena six minutes before halftime. The hosts started with Thierry Henry in the absence of injured European player of the year Lionel Messi, but the Frenchman and Ibrahimovic were unable to take advantage of several chances.
