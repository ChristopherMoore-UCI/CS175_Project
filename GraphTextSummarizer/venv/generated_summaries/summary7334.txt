Some worry that this approach could be overly burdensome on Internet service providers, but the fact is, the FCC can easily apply only the necessary parts of Title II regulation through a process known as forbearance. Indeed, without new rules, service providers could create fast lanes, impose new fees, and even block certain content and promote other content to bolster their bottom line. There are now no enforceable rules to ensure small businesses, nonprofits and individuals can continue to access online content without fear of discriminatory practices or content blocking by Internet service providers who own the information pipelines. Under Title II regulation, telephone service has been robust and accessible. We are proud to join more than 4 million Americans of all political beliefs, as well as companies in our home states and across the country, who have spoken out in favor of strong open Internet rules and against the creation of fast and slow lanes.
