Cuomo, along with New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, told New Yorkers to be calm and staged photo ops of himself riding the subways -- something Cuomo almost never does -- to show the public that the chances of being infected with Ebola through casual contact are slim to none. But the next day, Cuomo and his New Jersey counterpart, Gov. Chris Christie, announced without warning that any health workers arriving at New York-area airports who had dealt with Ebola victims will be held in quarantine for 21 days, the incubation period of the virus. In New York, medical authorities handled the state's first and only case of Ebola more effectively than in Texas -- but that didn't stop Cuomo from doing a flip-flop of his own on the issue. "Since taking office, I have erred on the side of caution when it comes to the safety and protection of New Yorkers, and the current situation regarding Ebola will be no different," Cuomo said. About a week after a courageous physician named Craig Spencer returned from helping Ebola victims in Africa, he developed an elevated temperature -- one sign that the virus may be present -- and was transported to Bellevue Hospital, one of the 11 city-run hospitals in New York City.
