About an hour after the quake, Vaughan said, more than 5,500 people had reported feeling it across Maryland, in nearby Washington, and in states including West Virginia, Virginia and Delaware. The earthquake was the first with a magnitude of more than 3 near Washington since 1974, said Amy Vaughan, a geophysicist at the USGS National Earthquake Information Center. The last earthquake in Maryland occurred on October 8, 2007, according to the USGS website. Washington's Homeland Security and Emergency Management Agency said no injuries or property damage had been reported. -- President Barack Obama told reporters Friday he did not feel the earthquake that rattled parts of suburban Washington early in the morning.
