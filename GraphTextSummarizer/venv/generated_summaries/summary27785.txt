Austin Tice, who was working as a freelancer for McClatchy and other news outlets, last contacted his family on August 13 while in Syria reporting on the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad's government. " The U.S. State Department has said it believes Tice was detained by Syrian officials in August as he was preparing to leave the country. In November, Marc Tice, Austin Tice's father, told reporters that the Syrian government had told his family that it doesn't know where their son is. State Department officials have questioned the veracity of the video, which purports to show Tice in the custody of rebels fighting the Syrian government. He was preparing to leave Syria for neighboring Lebanon when he went missing, according to his family.
