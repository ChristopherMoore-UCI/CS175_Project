Franklin D. Roosevelt (1933-1945) Roosevelt, the longest-serving president in U.S. history, started playing golf as a 12-year-old. Bill Clinton (1993-2001) Clinton was renowned for an entourage featuring Secret Service agents, a police sniper, a man carrying U.S. nuclear codes, various aides and someone with a secure telephone so he could speak to world leaders during a typical round. Obama, the 2009 chairman, follows in a long line of White House incumbents to love golf. On the morning of his address to the nation, President Obama deflected any possible attention away from him by indulging in his favorite pursuit, a game of golf at the Andrews Air Force Base course in Maryland. John F. Kennedy (1961-1963) Video footage of JFK playing golf shows how talented he was, although -- unlike President Obama -- he was reluctant to associate himself with the game.
