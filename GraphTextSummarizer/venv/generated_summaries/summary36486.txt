Recognition that a person's gender is more complicated than any single factor, combined with the inability to identify medically sound testing criteria, led to discontinuation of mandatory sex testing on female athletes 1999. Prejudice, discrimination and unfounded charges of advantage or somehow cheating are nothing new to sports. In 2003, the International Olympic Committee became the first international sports organization to develop a policy of inclusion for transgender athletes. According to IOC guidelines, transsexual athletes must have undergone hormone replacement therapy for at least two years, be legally recognized as the sex in which they want to compete and have had "sex reassignment" surgery in order to compete in their authentic gender. We compete for the same reasons that others do: Because we love our sport, because we are athletes and because we want to continue doing something we enjoy.
