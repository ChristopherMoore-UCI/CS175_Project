AeroShot falls under FDA regulations for dietary supplements. "We plan to work closely with the FDA to meet their requests for information and labeling changes to ensure compliance with dietary supplement requirements," Tom Hadfield, CEO of Breathable Foods, said in a statement. The FDA is giving Breathable Foods 15 working days to respond to the warning letter. " "Your labeling is false and misleading because your product cannot be intended for both inhalation and ingestion," the FDA charges in a letter to the manufacturer Breathable Foods. One AeroShot contains 100 milligrams of caffeine dispensed in three to six "puffs." "For most healthy adults, moderate doses of caffeine -- 200mg to 300mg, or about two to four cups of brewed coffee a day -- aren't harmful," according to The Mayo Clinic.
