He is also -- prosecutors contend -- a former prison chief with Cambodia's Khmer Rouge movement who oversaw the torture and killing of more than 15,000 men, women and children three decades ago. Duch is the first former Khmer Rouge leader to stand trial. Even though Duch was not a senior leader with the movement, many Cambodians were relieved that one of the regime's former leaders was facing justice, said Youk Chhang, head of the Documentation Center of Cambodia. Tuol Sleng was one of 189 similar institutions across Cambodia. If convicted, Duch faces from five years to life in prison.
