"People are really scared," CNN Turk reporter Nevsin Mengu said from Van on Monday. A health services building also collapsed, along with part of a hospital, CNN sister network CNN Turk reported. Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said 55 buildings collapsed in Ercis on the north shore of Lake Van. Some people collected wood from collapsed buildings to burn for warmth, Mengu said. By Monday, more than 2,300 emergency personnel were in the region, Deputy Prime Minister Besir Atalay said.
