The governing body of world football, FIFA, has turned down the request from the Irish Football Association (FAI) to replay their deciding World Cup play-off game against France. The game between France and Ireland was one of six play offs played on Wednesday which decided the final 32 teams heading South Africa in 2010. But despite a letter sent to FIFA by the FAI, and calls from both the Irish prime minister Brian Cowen and Irish justice minister Dermot Ahern for the game to be replayed, the sport's organizing body has refused the request. The world's worst football injustices "The governing body of world football have to step up to the plate and accede to our call for a replay," FAI chief executive John Delaney told reporters. Video replays showed Henry used his hand to stop the ball going out of play in extra-time, before he passed to William Gallas who booked his nation's place with a headed goal.
