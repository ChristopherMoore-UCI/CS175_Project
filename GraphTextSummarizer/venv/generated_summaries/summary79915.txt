Still, residents -- many of whom favor an independent Kashmiri nation in the Muslim majority Kashmir Valley, part of India's northern Jammu and Kashmir state -- came out hurling stones at police and paramilitary troopers who have in turn, opened fire and used tear gas. Referring to the Indian home minister's announcement regarding a plan for dialogue with all sectors of society, Geelani said that by his count, more than "150 rounds of talks have been held since 1947 between Kashmiris and New Delhi which have, however, yielded nothing." Kashmir analyst Abdul Quyoom noted that the proposal "has failed to enthuse the separatist leaders, who have been upping the ante for Kashmir's secession from India." India deployed thousands of troops in Kashmir to guard against what Indian leaders believe was a Pakistan-backed insurgency that began in late 1980s. -- Pro-India groups Sunday welcomed the latest initiative from New Delhi to defuse the crisis in Indian-administered Kashmir, but a hard-line separatist leader spearheading the unrelenting pro-independence unrest dismissed the plan as "an eyewash." The hard-line separatist leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani dismissed the initiative as "an eyewash, as it doesn't address the fundamental issue of accepting Kashmir as an international dispute by New Delhi."
