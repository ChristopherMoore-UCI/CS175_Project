The film enjoyed a healthy 41 percent decline from its previous frame, and if its weekend estimate holds up, Rises will have notched a slimmer third weekend drop than The Dark Knight, which fell 43 percent to $42.7 million during its third weekend, thereby lifting its total to $393.8 million. Ice Age: Continental Drift finished its fourth weekend in fourth place, dipping 37 percent to $8.4 million. 'Expendables 2': 'Last Supper' poster Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days took third place with $14.7 million, the lowest debut by far for a Wimpy Kid film. For star Colin Farrell, whose career held such promise in the early 2000s, Total Recall is the latest in a long line of box office misfires. Sony reboot Total Recall started its run in second place with $26 million, only a touch higher than 1990â€²s Total Recall, which starred Arnold Schwarzenegger and opened with $25.5 million.
