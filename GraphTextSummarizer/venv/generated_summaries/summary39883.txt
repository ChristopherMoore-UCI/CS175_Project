Penn State President Rodney Erickson said the change represents "significant efforts over the past year to make Penn State a safer, stronger institution." NCAA President Mark Emmert, who has been widely criticized for relying on the university's independent report instead of launching his own NCAA investigation at Penn State, said the board was "pleased" to make this decision. Mitchell said more than 120 reforms have been implemented, and Penn State has become a model for reform at other schools. In an unprecedented action, the NCAA is restoring scholarships to the Penn State University football team that were originally lost last year when the school was sanctioned for its handling of the Jerry Sandusky child sex abuse scandal. All three men are facing trial in the spring on charges they lied to authorities and never reported an incident of sexual abuse witnessed in 2001 in the Penn State locker room facilities. But the sanctions against Penn State mostly revolved around an alleged cover-up by the university's former president, vice president and athletic director.
