Naked Harry scandal a watershed moment for UK press How 'soldier prince' Harry tore up royal rule book I know he is young, free and single -- but he is a prince with responsibilities. But this latest naked Harry scandal is a watershed moment -- a moment when it is fair to ask: "Who is wagging the dog?" This is a dangerous precedent and in my view tantamount to returning to the good old, bad old days of royal reporting when in 1936 American and European newspapers freely reported on the affair of King Edward VIII and Mrs. Simpson while an establishment deal meant nothing was reported in the British newspapers. -- Another day, another story about Prince Harry.
