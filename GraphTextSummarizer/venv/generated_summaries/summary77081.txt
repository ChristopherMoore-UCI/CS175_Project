" 'Ashamed, embarrassed' Rob Ford returns as Toronto mayor after rehab Doug Ford, the mayor's brother and a Toronto city councilor, asked reporters "just to give our family a day or so" as they learn more about the situation and determine what to do next -- including deciding whether or not Rob Ford will continue his campaign for re-election. -- Toronto Mayor Rob Ford now has a new fight on his hands: a tumor. " "It is being investigated further and we need to determine exactly what type of tumor it is, and then we can decide on what type of treatment is required," said Dr. Rueben Devlin, the Toronto hospital's president.
