A schoolmate noted Fryberg played football and planned to try out soon for wrestling; then people in the stands applauded him, with enthusiastic whistles and yells of admiration thrown in for good measure. Friend and fellow student Nate Heckendorf explained that this honor means "a lot of people had good hopes for him and thought the best of him." "That (title) means ... But not for Fryberg, according to students there. Fryberg was an avid outdoorsman who liked to go hunting and had guns. It'll never last...." That same day, Luton said he talked to Fryberg at football practice "and he was all fine."
