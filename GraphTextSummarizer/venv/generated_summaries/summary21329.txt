That means the company sold more passenger cars in South Africa than any other brand -- a title VW celebrated for the fourth consecutive year in 2012. In fact, African countries are the second biggest market for car components made in South Africa after the E.U. The company's products dominate the roads, accounting for almost 23% of South Africa's passenger car market according to the National Association of Automobile Manufacturers of South Africa. David Powels, a native of the region and VW's managing director in South Africa, says auto-companies in the area are catalysts for economic growth. And it's not just the jobs VW creates that makes it popular in South Africa.
