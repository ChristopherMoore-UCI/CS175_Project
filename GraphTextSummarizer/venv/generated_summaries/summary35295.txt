In the best of times, investigations of outbreaks of food borne illnesses are complex and hard to solve. Despite the agencies' planning, a government shutdown makes it easier for contaminated food to slip through to consumers and harder for the federal government to identify and respond to outbreaks. Meanwhile, key personnel at the food safety agencies that are tasked with preventing outbreaks are not at their posts, investigating suspect facilities, checking imports or analyzing lab samples. Does this have an impact of food safety? Our national investments in food safety are important tools that can help reduce those numbers.
