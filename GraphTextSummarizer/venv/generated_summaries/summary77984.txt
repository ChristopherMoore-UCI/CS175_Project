[Network executives] were like, 'I don't know if we want dead people eating people on our network.' Ken Tucker's take Interestingly, the biggest new drama of the fall is NBC's "Revolution," which as I've pointed out, plays a bit like "The Walking Dead" without zombies (or people eating people). And if you include "The Walking Dead's" encore telecast in the mix — which is a common habit for cable networks when touting their ratings — the total viewer number rises to 15.2 million. Football has delivered bigger numbers, but that's sports and we're talking entertainment programming. Last night's premiere will probably be remembered as the hour that set a record for zombie killing.
