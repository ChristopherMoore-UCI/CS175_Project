Fifth seed Verdasco, the losing finalist last weekend in Monte Carlo, triumphed 6-7 (3-7) 7-5 6-1 to set up a title showdown with second seed Robin Soderling on Sunday. The 26-year-old has won only once in five meetings with Soderling, who crushed young Dutchman Thiemo de Bakker 6-1 6-4 in Saturday's second semifinal. De Bakker, who has risen to a career-high 67th in the world rankings this month, upset third seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the quarterfinals to follow up his earlier win over clay specialist and former world No. 1 Juan Carlos Ferrero. Verdasco was a break down as he trailed 4-3 in the second set, but battled back to win in more than two and half hours in the claycourt event. The Swede needed just one hour and 16 minutes to end the challenge of the 21-year-old, who fought back to make the scoreline respectable after trailing 4-0 in the second set.
