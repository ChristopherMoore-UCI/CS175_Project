"The fear of giving was very real, said Vohra, 33, who now works for San Francisco-based Muslim Advocates, an agency that was created to address two needs in post-September 11 America: racial profiling of Muslims and charitable giving. But after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, a dark cloud hung over Muslim charities as the federal government heightened scrutiny over terrorism concerns. What's the best way to send our donation?" Because of the widespread concerns, Muslim Advocates decided to upload a guidance video on YouTube. "The government's actions against these three charities were the start of a pattern of conduct that violated the fundamental rights of American Muslims' charitable giving in accordance with their faith," the ACLU wrote in a report published in June. Vohra said the accreditation program, along with new government perspective, can return confidence and comfort to a religious obligation for Muslims.
