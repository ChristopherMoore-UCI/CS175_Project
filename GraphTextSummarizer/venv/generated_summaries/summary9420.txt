-- A Swiss whistle-blower Monday handed over what he said were secret Swiss banking records to WikiLeaks, the website dedicated to revealing secrets. Speaking at the same news conference, lawyer Jack Blum said it was not always possible to determine who, if anyone, had engaged in "criminal tax evasion. WikiLeaks could release the secret Swiss banking records in "a matter of weeks" if it can process them quickly enough, Assange said. Swiss banker Rudolf Elmer handed two discs to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange at a news conference in London. He has been engaged in a long-running battle with Swiss banks over secrecy, he said.
