-- An explosion took place on a road close to Kabul's international airport Wednesday morning, the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force said. The Taliban said the attack was intended to target Americans in the international airport, one part of which is used by military forces and another by civilians. The Afghan interior ministry said the blast took place on Qasabah Road, which is situated to the north of Kabul International Airport. In June, Taliban fighters armed with guns and explosives were killed by security forces after taking over a building near the airport. There were no ISAF casualties.
