Most donations to the campaign are toys, but the organization raised about $30 million last year through corporate donations, direct mail, individual contributions and online donations. " Nationally, corporate cash donations are down significantly, about $1.5 million below where they were this time last year, according to Bill Grein, senior vice president of marketing for Toys for Tots. Last year the economy made it tough for many people, and Toys for Tots was hit hard as well. Last year, Toys for Tots collected or bought 16.2 million toys, books and gifts, down from 16.6 million the year before, Grein said. As an indicator, online donations in November were down 10 to 15 percent from the same time last year, he said.
