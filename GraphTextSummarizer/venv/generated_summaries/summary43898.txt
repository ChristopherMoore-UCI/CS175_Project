Dane Wozniacki, who will end the year as number one following six WTA Tour titles this season, said: "It was still a fantastic week for me. And there was a surprise in the final of the St Petersburg Open in Russia when unseeded Mikhail Kukushkin of Kazakhstan shocked top seed Mikhail Youzhny to win his maiden ATP title. -- Kim Clijsters has regained the WTA Tour Championship title, seven years after last winning it, after a hard-fought three-set victory over Caroline Wozniacki in Doha, Qatar on Sunday. " Meanwhile, Sunday saw three ATP Tour finals take place around Europe with home favorite Gael Monfils claiming his third career title with a 6-2 5-7 6-1 win over Croatia's Ivan Ljubicic in the final of the inaugural Montpellier tournament. It marked a remarkable return for 27-year-old Clijsters, who was appearing in her first tournament since retaining her U.S. Open title seven weeks ago, following a foot operation.
