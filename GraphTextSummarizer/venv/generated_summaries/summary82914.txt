The transgender life: What to know, say and understand I cannot stress to the world enough, gender and sexuality are two completely different things, and the moment people incorrectly connect them is the moment when most people start looking for an exit or a fight. That is when people get scared, cite religion, start whispering, and disconnect. Nothing is completely black or white, hot or cold, here or there, or male and female; there are varying degrees of everything and the quicker we respect that, the faster we all grow and allow people to be who they are. It wasn't until I learned that there were people out there that considered homosexuality "abnormal" or that people needed to put labels on our feelings toward others that I became terrified that I was "different." Fortunately, people have developed more of an understanding of that over time, but there are always going to be people that think differently and we all have to accept that.
