Some productions, including "The Color Purple" and "Chicago," sell a select number of discounted tickets, called rush tickets, at the box office on the day of the show. Like rush tickets, most SRO tickets fall in the $20 to $30 range and can be purchased at the box office on the day of the show. The Roundabout Theatre Company sells tickets for children under the age of 17 at half the price it charges adults. Lining up at the Times Square TKTS booth isn't the only way to get discounted Broadway tickets. Many theaters set aside a limited number of student tickets -- typically running between $20 and $30 -- to sell at the box office on the day of the performance.
