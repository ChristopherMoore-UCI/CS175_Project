-- Authorities conducting autopsies on a family of four found dead in in their home in eastern Missouri said preliminary autopsy results showed that the family may have died from carbon monoxide inhalation, police said Friday. Police had been summoned to the house after the man's co-workers became concerned that he had not gone to work for several days, said police Chief Bill Hammack. Family members told police they had last been in contact with the family Tuesday, when he complained that he was feeling sick and nauseated, Hammack said. "Dangers from poorly maintained heating systems are really going to be the number one cause of carbon monoxide poisonings in the United States," Dr. Paul Garbe said on a CDC online video. The four -- a couple in their late 20s, their 4-year-old son and their 3-year-old daughter -- were found dead Thursday afternoon, said police in the city of St. Clair.
