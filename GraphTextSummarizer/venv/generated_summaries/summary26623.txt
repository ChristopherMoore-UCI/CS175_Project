Pemex, the powerful but much-criticized state oil company, has said it's not clear what caused the blast, which took place Thursday at an administrative building in the Pemex office complex in Mexico City. Workers digging through the rubble of what were offices at Mexico's state-run oil giant have found more victims, raising the death toll from last week's blast to 35. Mexican oil giant chief won't speculate on cause of deadly blast CNN's Mauricio Torres contributed to this report. You could see pieces of the wall falling to the ground," said Joaquin Borrell Valenzuela, an attorney for the Pemex comptroller's office, who was in a courtyard outside the building at the time of the blast. Thousands of people work at the Pemex headquarters, which includes a 54-story building that is nearly 700 feet tall.
