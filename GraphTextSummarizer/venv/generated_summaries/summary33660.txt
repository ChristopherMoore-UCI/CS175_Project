The famed football club, seven-time champions of Europe and 18-time Italian champions, has unveiled plans to build a new stadium in the Portello area of the city with the aim of relocating in time for the start of the 2018-19 season. Italian clubs are looking to follow the example of Juventus, which opened its own super arena in 2011 on the site of the old Stadio delle Alpi. Better stadia is seen by Italian clubs as a way to attracting more fans and thereby generate greater revenue to allow them to compete with their European counterparts. https://t.co/7kRbflkVdV Many stadiums in the country are not privately owned by the teams. Inter's president Erick Thohir has expressed his desire to see his club move into a stadium of its own.
