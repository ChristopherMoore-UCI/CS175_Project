While witnesses did not recount what Reeves said, Cummings said that, whatever it was, "I felt Oulson had enough." Alan Hamilton, a corporal with the Sumter County sheriff's office who was taking in a movie with his wife, said he heard Oulson saying, at one point, "I am trying to text my f**king daughter, if you don't mind" -- using graphic language that Reeves' lawyer said suggested Oulson was angry and threatening. He sat a few seats down from Oulson that January day in the row in front of Reeves. Oulson then allegedly tossed his bag of popcorn at Reeves, who fired a single, fatal gunshot moments later. During the previews, Cummings said he heard Reeves and Oulson talking, and at one point, the latter said, "I'm just texting my 2-year-old daughter." Escobar also sought to portray the larger, younger Oulson as imposing compared to Reeves.
