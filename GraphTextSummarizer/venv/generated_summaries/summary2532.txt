Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge David Horwitz accepted Suleman's no contest plea to a single misdemeanor charge in court Monday after she proved she had paid the restitution to the state and county. The Los Angeles district attorney accused Suleman, 39, of not reporting nearly $30,000 she earned as a topless dancer and adult film actress in the months after she applied for public assistance for her 14 children last year. Suleman, known in the media as "Octomom" because she gave birth to eight babies in one day, must also serve two years on probation and work 200 hours of community service under a plea deal announced Monday.
