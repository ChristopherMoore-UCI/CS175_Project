-- A surveillance video captured a masked gunman on a rampage in broad daylight on an Oakland, California, street that includes the point-blank execution of a teenage boy cowering on a sidewalk , CNN affiliate KTVU said. In addition to the teen, who was killed, two others were injured, according to Officer Kevin McDonald with the Oakland Police Department. The surveillance video shows the teenager putting his hands in the air, but the gunman fires several more shots into the boy point-blank, KTVU said. Police are now searching for the gunman who opened fire Sunday on pedestrians, sending them running for their lives into a busy street.
