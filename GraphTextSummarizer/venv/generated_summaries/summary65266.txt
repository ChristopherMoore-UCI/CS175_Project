Last week's release of jailed activist Darsi Ferrer follows a meeting between President Castro and Vatican Foreign Minister Dominique Mamberti, whose visit came amid signs of growing influence by Cuba's Roman Catholic Church. Zapata's death sparked international condemnation from Europe and Washington and drew a rare statement of regret from Cuban President Raul Castro. Cuba points to a series of clandestine actions by the United States that it says were designed to topple the country's leadership and overthrow a government installed by former Cuban president Fidel Castro in 1959. The Amnesty report described the resulting 48 year-old U.S. trade embargo against the communist government as a "lame excuse" that Cuban leaders use to justify violating human rights. Church officials and human rights groups continue to express their desire for more prisoner releases.
