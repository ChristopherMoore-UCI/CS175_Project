It may just have planted the icy streak of competitiveness which has earned Kvyat the coveted job of replacing Sebastian Vettel at Red Bull next season. The Russian is said to be so focused on his ambitions in F1 that he doesn't even have time for a girlfriend, surely a rarity among F1's leading men. There have been attempts to add Russia to the world championship calendar since the late 1970s but it was the 2014 Winter Olympics -- the most expensive in history -- that was to prove the catalyst for a Russian race. "We got help from the Olympics," Russian F1 television presenter and commentator Alexey Popov explains to CNN. Popov, who is the face of motorsport on Russian state broadcaster VGTRK, says this season each grand prix reaches an average of around two million viewers.
