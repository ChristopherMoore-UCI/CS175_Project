Igbokwe, 22, who lives in Belgium, took the pictures at the wedding of his mother Tina Chenenye Ubatu to Ubatu Peter at Umuahia in Abia state in February this year. The traditional ceremony is called Igbankwu, or wine carrying, because it involves the bride carrying a cup of palm wine to her groom. Describing the wedding day itself, Igbokwe said: "The bride's father fills a cup (Iko) with palm wine and passes it on to the girl while the groom finds a place between the guests. In most cases there is only a symbolic price to be paid for the bride, in addition to other prerequisites such as kola nuts, goats, chicken, wine," said Igbokwe. "During this ceremony, there is also the nuptial dance where the couple dances, while guests wish the newly weds prosperity by throwing money around them or putting bills on their forehead."
