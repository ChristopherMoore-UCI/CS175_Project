The school instead cited very real, troubling and enduring differences in academic outcomes (performance in school, graduation rates) and social outcomes (exposure to drugs and violence, the likelihood of being incarcerated) between black boys and their peers. Yet the teachers at Urban Charter actively fought stereotypes, not simply of boys but of black boys. Some have mistakenly used biological sex differences to justify educating boys and girls separately. A common objection is that the programs are based on gender stereotypes: Boys need discipline and should be free to run around the classroom; girls require gentle care and can be trusted to sit still. In public schools today, black students remain considerably more segregated from white students compared with other racial and ethnic groups.
