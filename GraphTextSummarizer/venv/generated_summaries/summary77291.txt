On Tuesday, exactly 60 years later, Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal recreated the ceremony -- christening a brand new Super Hercules during a birthday party of sorts for Lockheed executives and military dignitaries. Happy 60th birthday to the Hercules -- the oldest continuously produced family of military planes in history. The legacy surrounding the Hercules has been built by 60 years of successful missions, including: In 1989, a flight crew aboard a Hercules named Teal 57 was credited with saving the crew of a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration hurricane hunter airplane. Shooting the scene posed unique logistical challenges, said stunt coordinator Jack Gill in a featurette video about the mission. The Air Force has been developing a so-called "super short takeoff and landing aircraft" that might replace the Hercules after 2020.
