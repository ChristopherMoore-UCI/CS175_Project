The 30-second spot, which hit South Dakota airwaves Tuesday, links Democratic opponent Rick Weiland and Republican-turned-Independent former Sen. Larry Pressler as holding the same positions on gun laws, energy and Obamacare and comes less than a week after Democrats announced their own $1 million campaign to attack Republican nominee former Gov. Mike Rounds. By taking on both candidates, the Republican Senatorial campaign arm is gearing up to deflect Democratic ads against Rounds, which could be a boon for either Pressler or Rounds. Country-singing Senate hopeful 'rocks' South Dakota race A SurveyUSA poll released last week showed the race is a three-way split with Pressler trailing the Republican nominee by just three points, with Weiland another four points behind the independent. The ad features two balloons with Rounds' opponents names, pointing out that "Rick Weiland and Larry Pressler have a lot in common." By the end of the ad, both balloons have deflated because "when it comes to looking out for South Dakota, they both fall flat." "Weiland supports Obamacare, just like Pressler," the ad claims, adding that Rounds' Democratic and Independent opponents also favor "stricter gun laws" and "want you to pay more for your energy."
