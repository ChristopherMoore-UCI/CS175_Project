Kirby noted that U.N. Security Council Resolution 1929 prohibits Iran from undertaking any activity related to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons, including launches using ballistic missile technology. Iran's missiles testing comes just days after Iranian warships reportedly were en route toward U.S. maritime borders, according to Fars. -- Iran is lauding the successful test-firing of new missiles, including one designed to destroy "all types of enemy military equipment," state media said. "Iran's military fleet is approaching the United States' maritime borders, and this move has a message," Iranian navy Adm. Afshin Rezayee Haddad said, according to Fars. The timing of Iran's missile testing is notable for another reason: Fars said it happened on Monday, the eve of the 35th anniversary of the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
