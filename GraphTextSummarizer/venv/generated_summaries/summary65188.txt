-- President Obama told CNN's Larry King on Thursday that he is furious about the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, but his job is to fix things instead of just yelling at people. Obama told CNN that the issue required a broader response than just strengthening border security, and he urged Congress to work with him on comprehensive immigration reform that would tighten the border while requiring illegal immigrants to register, pay back taxes and penalties, learn English and seek citizenship through normal channels. On another topic, Obama criticized Arizona's controversial new immigration law because it could lead to "50 different laws in 50 different states" regarding border security, which is a federal concern. "I would love to just spend a lot of my time venting and yelling at people, but that's not the job I was hired to do," Obama said. " Obama, who is from Chicago and a known fan of the hometown Bulls, acknowledged his response might make people there unhappy.
