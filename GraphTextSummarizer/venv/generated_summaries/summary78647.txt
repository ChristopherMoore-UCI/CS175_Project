A closer look at the Amber Alert system And though these cases didn't get the same national attention as the search for San Diego teenager Hannah Anderson, they are among hundreds that demonstrate why the program is critical to saving children's lives, said Robert Hoever, a director of special operations for the center. " Key moments in James DiMaggio manhunt Riders who made a difference The Idaho horseback riders who spotted Hannah and DiMaggio in rugged terrain sensed something was wrong. Amber stands for "America's Missing: Broadcast Emergency Response," but its namesake was Amber Hagerman, a 9-year-old Texas girl who was last seen alive riding her bike in a parking lot in January 1996, according to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children. When authorities heard that DiMaggio might be heading into Nevada, the alerts were expanded to that state, Hoever said. The riders contacted Idaho State Police, and their tip over the weekend sent FBI agents swarming to the camping spot outside Cascade, in central Idaho.
