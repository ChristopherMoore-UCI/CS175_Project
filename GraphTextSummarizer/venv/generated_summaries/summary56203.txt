Adam Sandler and Seth Rogen star in "Funny People," the new film from Judd Apatow. Watch Apatow and Sandler react to a doctor with an accent » Much of the movie's personality can be summarized in one scene in particular in which Sandler and co-star Seth Rogen are sitting in a doctor's office receiving very bad news that they somehow turn into laughter. So, it's likely safe to assume there are more than a few Hollywood execs nervously biting their knuckles right now, wondering how Sandler's latest big-screen offering, the dark comedy "Funny People" -- written and directed by his longtime friend Judd Apatow ("The 40-Year-Old Virgin") -- will fare. Sandler's biggest comedic blockbusters include "Big Daddy," "The Waterboy" and "The Longest Yard," each of which has earned well over $150 million domestically. Sandler and Rogen talked to CNN about what went into creating that scene.
