The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration describes Los Zetas as "a group of Mexican military deserters...who have kidnapped, tortured, and murdered -- including beheadings -- of law enforcement officials, innocent citizens, informants, and rival drug gangs." Government data shows cells of the drug gang known as Los Zetas are in the area to protect drug trafficking paths between Honduras and Mexico, "intimidating the population with their heavy weapons and threatening farmers to give up their land for criminal activities," AGN reported. A report released by the Stratfor global intelligence company last week said Los Zetas have also "long been active in human smuggling, oil theft, extortion and contract enforcement. "In the end, the large majority of drugs travel through Central America, and the assignment of resources or the financial support of the United States government is not the same as Colombia and Mexico receive," he said. In an interview with CNN en Espanol last month, Menocal said his country needed more help from the United States to combat cartels, which were increasingly carving out new drug transport paths.
