"This list complements the FBI's 'Most Wanted Terrorists' list of individuals indicted in the United States for their alleged involvement in various terrorist attacks or planned attacks around the world against United States interests or persons," the FBI said. The FBI also added a name to its "Seeking Information -- Terrorism" list, which includes people sought in connection with designated terrorist organizations or possible terrorist activity against the United States. Sahiron allegedly worked with Al Harakat al Islamiyyah, also known as the Abu Sayyaf group, to kidnap an American from his home in the Philippines on November 14, 1993, the FBI said. "He was reported to have provided funding and other resources to the Taliban, including explosive vests and other resources and facilitated the activities of anti-coalition militants operating in Afghanistan by raising money in support of terrorist activities." There are now six people on the FBI's "Seeking Information -- Terrorism" list, which was established for individuals not under indictment in the United States.
