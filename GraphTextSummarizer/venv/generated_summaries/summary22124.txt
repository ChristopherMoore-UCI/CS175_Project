Bahrain Grand Prix called off "I have already spoken with FIA President Jean Todt about the possibility of finding a new date and we both agreed that a decision has to be made before the season starts. "I think the teams are sensible enough even to race in Bahrain in the summer break, and despite high temperatures, because this is the way we can support the country. " The sport's rights-holder also suggested the grand prix could be rescheduled for Formula One's mid-season break in July, during the oppressive heat of the Bahraini summer. " Formula One had been set for it busiest-ever season, with 20 races planned for the 2011 campaign, including the inaugural Grand Prix of India in the country's capital New Delhi. " Ecclestone also said a decision on whether or not to hold the race at the country's Bahrain International Circuit could not have been made any sooner.
