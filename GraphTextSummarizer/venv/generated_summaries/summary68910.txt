In the latest attempt, three companies wanted to submit bids to build the KC-X, the next generation of tankers; Boeing, EADS and US Aerospace. US Aerospace is fighting that decision and asking that its bid proposal, which it said will save U.S. taxpayers millions of dollars and produce a better tanker plane, be considered. Chuck Arnold, a spokesman for US Aerospace, said the bid proposal was on time. US Aerospace is a new company that is in partnership with Antonov, a state-owned Ukrainian aircraft manufacturer that used to build planes for the Soviet Union's military and now specializes in building very large aircraft. For about a decade the Air Force has been trying to replace its fleet of KC-135 air refueling tankers, the big jets that act as flying gas stations for warplanes.
