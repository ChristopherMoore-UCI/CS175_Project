"This is irresponsible and sleazy and exactly what people hate about startups sucking the life out of San Francisco," Wired senior writer Mat Honan wrote of ReservationHop on Twitter. -- There's a website that lies to restaurants, making reservations under fake names, and then sells them to you. " And it's just the latest on a list of recent startups that have some critics complaining that, in the go-go Silicon Valley startup culture, almost anything can attract interest, and big investor money, even if it seems to straddle the line between right and wrong or even reality and parody. Its concept: selling you money for more money. " Complaints centered largely on two issues: making money off something that should be free and hurting restaurants by scooping up reservations that, if not purchased, could lead to empty tables and lost revenue.
