During a 10-day visit, the all-American opera singer was challenged to produce a fusion of sound that blended the diametrically contrasting traditions of Western classical music with Mambazo's distinctive take on ancient Zulu melodies. The 56-year-old, who hails from Spokane, in Washington, boasts a discography of more than 150 albums, winning him multiple Grammy Awards, two Edison Prizes and the coveted Grand Prix de Disque -- the highest award for musical recordings in France. He was there to seek out famed South African vocal group Ladysmith Black Mambazo, whose mix of low rumbling harmonies and ululating riffs gained worldwide appreciation when the group appeared on Paul Simon's seminal Graceland album in 1986. It is tempting to contrast the formal, intellectual way that much Western classical music expresses emotion with the mystical, organic way that we hear with Mambazo.
