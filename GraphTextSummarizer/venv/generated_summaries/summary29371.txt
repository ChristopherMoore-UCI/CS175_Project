-- FIFA president Sepp Blatter faces an investigation by world football's governing body after being included in a probe into bribery. It said Bin Hammam had claimed that Warner, a FIFA vice-president, would have told Blatter in advance about alleged cash payments to delegations attending the CFU meeting, and that he "would have had no issue with these. "The accusations contain statements according to which Mr. Blatter, the incumbent FIFA president, was informed of, but did not oppose, payments allegedly made to members of the Caribbean Football Union." The pair have been accused of bribery by FIFA executive committee member Chuck Blazer in relation to a meeting they held with the Caribbean Football Union (CFU) on May 10 and 11 this year. " "Subsequently, the FIFA Ethics Committee today opened a procedure against the FIFA President in compliance with article 16 of the FIFA Code of Ethics," the statement said.
