-- A veteran social activist in India has launched an indefinite hunger strike to seek tough, overarching laws to tackle corruption as a rash of scandals undermined the reputation of the country's government. "I appreciate and share your concern on corruption," the statement quoted Singh as having told Hazare. "This fast-unto-death is a reflection of the people's anger at growing, all-round corruption ... at a time when the scourge is eating into the vitals of our society," said political commentator K.G. Suresh. Singh's office noted in a statement that the prime minister met with Hazare and his colleagues last month. Hazare and his supporters reject the bill in its present form because it does not empower the proposed bodies to prosecute corruption suspects.
