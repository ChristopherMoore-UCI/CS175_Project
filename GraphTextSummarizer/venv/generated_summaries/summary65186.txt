-- Singer Rihanna cleared her schedule to testify next month in the case against singer Chris Brown, who is charged with brutally beating her earlier this year, her lawyer said. Brown's lawyer Mark Geragos was unsuccessful in his effort Thursday to get police records concerning their internal investigation of the leaking of the Rihanna photos. Schnegg also ruled Thursday that a leak of police photos showing Rihanna's bruised and bloodied face would not affect the prosecution of Brown. While Brown's lawyer previously indicated he hoped to resolve the case without public testimony, Los Angeles Criminal Court Judge Patricia Schnegg set on Thursday a preliminary hearing for June 22. After a short motions hearing Thursday, Rihanna's lawyer Donald Etra revealed that prosecutors told him they would call Rihanna -- whose full name is Robyn Rihanna Fenty -- as a witness at next month's hearing.
