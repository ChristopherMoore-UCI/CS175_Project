Victim 1 sues Penn State over Sandusky abuse McQueary also claims he was the only former employee who was not reimbursed for legal fees, and that he did not receive his severance payments on time. -- Former Penn State assistant football coach Mike McQueary, who testified that he saw Jerry Sandusky in a shower with an underage boy, filed a whistleblower lawsuit Tuesday against the university, according to a court document from Centre County, Pennsylvania. In support of McQueary's whistleblower claim, the lawsuit states he was the only assistant football coach who was not invited to interview for employment with the incoming new head football coach after longtime coach Joe Paterno was fired amid the Sandusky scandal. Sandusky, who has maintained his innocence, was convicted in June for abusing young boys over a 15-year-period. The lawsuit states McQueary believes those situations and his employment termination were the result of his cooperation with authorities in the Sandusky case.
