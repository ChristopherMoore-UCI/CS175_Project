Gattuso, 65, had enrolled in a clinical trial for a drug aimed at women who have low sexual desire. Low sexual desire in women isn't necessarily a problem in menopause or later. That's the technical term for when women have a distressing lack or absence of sexual desire or fantasy. Foust works with many women complaining of low sex drive who are in their 30s and 40s. Her physician friends want a solution for low female sexual desire, too, she said; they want to be able to offer female patients something besides "I'm sorry."
