Charlottesville Police Chief Timothy Longo stopped short of calling the man a suspect in the disappearance of Hannah Graham, saying he was still considered "a person of interest. Graham, a sophomore, is described as a straight-A student and an accomplished athlete from northern Virginia. "We were comforted by the evident high esteem in which our cherished daughter is held by her many friends at the University of Virginia and beyond," John and Sue Graham said in a statement. Graham left a dinner with a group of friends around 11 p.m. last Friday. The police chief said he has not given up hope Graham will be found.
