" Nalbandian, currently ranked 231 in the world, has been blighted by injuries in recent years and has failed to repeat the exploits of his younger years. "It's a sad day but the shoulder is not responding well," he told a press conference in Buenos Aires Tuesday. The 31-year-old, who reached the semifinal of every grand slam and finished as runner up to Lleyton Hewitt at Wimbledon in 2002, reached a career high of No.3 in the world back in March 2006. " Nalbandian has been hampered with injuries since undergoing shoulder surgery in 2009. He underwent further surgery on his hip and shoulder in May after suffering injury interrupted seasons for the past three years.
