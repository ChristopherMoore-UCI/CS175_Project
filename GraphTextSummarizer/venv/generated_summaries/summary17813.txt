Swoon Reads has hired Lauren Scobell, former consumer marketing director at Nickelodeon, as its director. Feiwel said that Hall's story connected with Swoon readers and the editorial staff because of its quirky points of view and refreshing lightness. It's exactly the kind of community Feiwel envisioned for Swoon. Hall and other Swoon writers have formed a debut author support group, sharing advice, asking questions and exchanging laughs over email and social media. The publisher's aptly titled Swoon Reads imprint targets readers in the market for a good young adult romance.
