-- Russian carmaker Marussia Motors has bought a significant shareholding in the Formula One team Virgin Racing, meaning the team will be renamed "Marussia Virgin Racing" for the 2011 season. The rebranded outfit's car for the 2011 season will be unveiled in Moscow ahead  of next season, and Virgin's chief executive Graeme Lowdon hailed the deal as good news for his team and for the sport. The rookie team -- who made their Formula One debut this season -- will continue their relationship with Richard Branson, the British businessman whose company created Virgin Racing by signing a sponsorship deal with Manor Motorsport in 2009. Marussia Motors was founded in 2007, and the super car manufacturer -- which has worked as a partner to Virgin during its inaugural season -- hopes the move will help build its reputation. Virgin are yet to pick up a drivers' or constructors' point in 2010, with only this weekend's Abu Dhabi Grand Prix remaining in the calendar.
