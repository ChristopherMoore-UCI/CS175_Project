Detectives are scouring the video frame-by-frame for clues as to who tossed eggs from Bieber's property onto the house next door in the exclusive Calabasas, California, community last Thursday night, Thompson said. A guide Bieber's wake up call Bieber was asleep when investigators knocked on his door Wednesday morning, Thompson said. "We didn't do this search warrant to send a message," Thompson said Tuesday. While the neighbor who accused Bieber of launching the egg assault does not have a similar video system, TMZ did obtain video of the incident recorded by the accuser. "It was extensive," Los Angeles County Sheriff's Lt. David Thompson said of the system.
