For Mr Guo's part, analysts say it is reassuring that he has not been sidetracked by concerns over market weakness. As Chinese companies report their first-half results, there should be little doubt about why the stock market has struggled this year. He believes that economic worries will push Chinese stocks lower again in the coming months. Over the weekend, the securities regulator announced that it would cut transaction fees on stock trading by 20 per cent. Another indication of Mr Guo's commitment to press on with reforms even at the risk of hurting sentiment has been his focus on devising a better system to delist shares.
