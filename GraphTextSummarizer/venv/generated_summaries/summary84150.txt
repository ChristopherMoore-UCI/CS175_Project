Raheem Sterling, one of the players to shine most alongside the Uruguayan last season, opened the scoring with a superb side foot finish from a wonderful Jordan Henderson through ball. "It was frustrating for us because in the second half we pushed on, brought some younger players on who were a little naive but threatened with their pace," Newcastle coach Alan Pardew told Sky Sports. Crucially, they couldn't get a single shot on target and with half time approaching, Bosnian international Edin Dzeko superbly controlled a long ball over the top of the defense before back-heeling it into the path of David Silva who slotted home. Last season had been his best yet, driving Liverpool to a second place finish and narrowly missing out on the club's first Premier League title. Instead, substitute Sergio Aguero fired the ball home at the second attempt in injury time to add some gloss to the scoreline.
