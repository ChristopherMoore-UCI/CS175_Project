The number includes those who crossed U.S. borders illegally, as well as those who came in with temporary visas but stayed past their expiration date, Pew said Monday about its estimate, based on U.S. government data. Immigrants from Mexico are still the largest group within the undocumented population -- 52% as of 2012 -- but the number of recent Mexican immigrants has decreased at higher rates than the general group. Central American immigrants are a part of that, but so are immigrants from Asia and Europe," Lopez said. Lopez said that Southern states such as Georgia and North Carolina have seen an increase in undocumented immigrants because their economies have fared better than California since the 1990s. Texas, a state that weathered the recession better than others, was the only state that didn't see a drop in undocumented immigrants in the past few years.
