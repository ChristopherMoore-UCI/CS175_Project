-- Martin Kaymer's victory in last year's U.S. PGA Championship has given him the "belief and motivation" to add to his major tally at this week's British Open at Royal St George's this week. Looking at the other contenders for the title, Kaymer made a point of singling out U.S. Open champion Rory McIlroy and admitted he watched on in admiration as the Northern Irishman dominated the field at Congressional. Kaymer is paired with defending champion Louis Oosthuizen of South Africa and American star Phil Mickelson for the first two rounds. I need to hit more balls, need to become a better player because he played that golf course almost in a perfect way." Kaymer believes that putting could well prove the key to victory come Sunday on the links course in south-east England.
