Dr. Carolyn Robinowitz, president of the APA, called the figures in the survey "alarming" and urged Congress to devote more money to treating mental health problems arising from service in combat zones. The report was released a day before a scheduled announcement by Defense Secretary Robert Gates aimed at encouraging more service members to seek help for post-combat stress. -- U.S. military personnel fear that seeking help for mental health problems could harm their careers, according to a survey released Wednesday. About half said they thought other people would think less of them if they sought help for mental health problems. "Anything we can do to decrease the stigma, we want to do." A clear majority of troops rated their own mental health as good or excellent, but many reported regularly experiencing common symptoms of mental illness, including difficulty sleeping at least twice a week and a lack of interest in daily activities at least twice a week.
