The ALS Association reports that it, and its 38 chapters, received $4 million in donations in just two weeks. It all started with Pete Frates, a former baseball player at Boston College who has been living with ALS since 2012. "The President appreciates Mrs. Kennedy thinking of him for the challenge -- though his contribution to this effort will be monetary," Principal Deputy White House Press Secretary Eric Schultz said Tuesday. So far, Douglas and White have taken him up on it, with Douglas passing the challenge along to Cleveland Cavaliers star Lebron James and White challenging fellow NFL players Champ Bailey, Larry Fitzgerald and Eric Weems. The Ice Bucket Challenge is a social media campaign that aims to raise awareness and money to fight Lou Gehrig's disease, also called amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS.
