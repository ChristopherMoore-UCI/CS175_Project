Ukraine is a developing country, with more freedom to start a business or to be left alone. Now, pro-Russian protesters are calling for regional independence in the eastern Ukrainian cities of Donetsk, Kharkiv and Luhansk. Russian President Vladimir Putin is continuing the abuse now by sending troops, tanks and soldiers to Ukraine. Until the events in Kiev and Crimea, people didn't think in terms of who was born in Russia and who was born in Ukraine. By annexing Crimea, Putin is punishing Ukraine for standing up for itself.
