-- A bag from a missing plane carrying a member of the famed Missoni fashion house has been found on the Caribbean island of Curacao, according to U.S. Missoni spokeswoman Angela Mariani. According to Mariani, the bag belonged to an Italian tourist whose plane took off just minutes after the Missoni plane departed. Missoni, 58, is a director of the fashion house, which he runs with his siblings, Luca and Angela. Because there was no room on the tourist's plane for his bag, it was put on the Missoni plane. The aircraft was traveling from Los Roques, an archipelago and resort, south to Caracas.
