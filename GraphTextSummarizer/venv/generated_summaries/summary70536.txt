The trial was supported by grants from Charles Wolfson Charitable Trust, Medical Research Council, Alzheimer's Research Trust, Henry Smith Charity, Thames Valley Dementias and Neurodegenerative Diseases Research Network of the National Institute for Health Research, John Coates Charitable Trust, Sidney and Elizabeth Corob Charitable Trust, and Meda AB/Recip AB, which also donated the vitamin and placebo tablets. Certain B vitamins such as folic acid, vitamin B6 and vitamin B12, are known to control levels of the amino acid homocysteine in the blood. -- Daily doses of vitamin B can halve the rate of brain shrinkage in elderly people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), which can be a precursor to Alzheimer's, researchers at Oxford University said Thursday. Chief Executive Rebecca Wood said the results are important but also said they require further study. So, B vitamins -- if it shown to be effective in further studies -- are unlikely to be beneficial for everyone, particularly if you already have healthy homocysteine levels," said William Thies, chief medical and scientific officer of the Alzeimer's Association.
