He jumped a gate at the hotel, snuck in, and was given a number by fellow Palestinian contestant Ramadan Abu Nahli. "My story is about a person who came from a very humble place -- a place referred to as 'the camp' in Gaza," said Assaf. At the Chicago performance, Assaf was the main and final act, following performances by fellow "Arab Idol" finalists Ziad Khoury from Lebanon, and Farah Youssef from Syria. When he was five years old his family returned to Gaza to live in the Khan Younis refugee camp, where he and his six brothers and sisters call home. Assaf is a Palestinian, born in Libya.
