The two spoke for a while about rescue animals and led Johnstone to start volunteering at the local shelter in Raleigh, North Carolina. Shannon Johnstone is an American photographer based in North Carolina. "The saddest thing is there is no alternative for animal overpopulation other than euthanasia, no other tool in their arsenal," Johnstone said. Johnstone knew nothing about homeless dogs until she adopted one of her own after completing graduate school. She paused and thought, "Why is he involved in both waste and animals?" The county animal shelter falls under the same management as the landfill.
