A group of protesters blocked the entrance to the Energy Ministry on Saturday, a move Energy Minister Eduard Stavytsky called a direct threat to the entire energy system. The increase in action comes after verbal clashes between Ukraine's president and opposition leader Vitaly Klitschko on Saturday. CNN's Diana Magnay, Joseph Netto, Victoria Eastwood and journalist Victoria Butenko contributed to this story UDAR warned earlier Saturday that authorities are preparing to provoke peaceful protesters and may plant aggressors among the crowds in an effort to enact emergency rule. Klitschko leads the Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reforms party (UDAR) and plans to run for president in 2015.
