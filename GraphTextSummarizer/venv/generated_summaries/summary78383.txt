Never one to mince words, "The Talk" co-host Sharon Osbourne came right out and asked guest Melissa Gilbert when she knew her sister Sara Gilbert was gay. "You know what, I'll put it to you this way," said Melissa, 47, best known for her role on "Little House on the Prairie." While the question made Sara, 36, who recently started dating Linda Perry, squirm a bit, the audience laughed and cheered. "I took her to dinner when she was in her teens and I sat her down and I gave her this long speech about how much I love you and it doesn't matter and you're my darling and blah, blah, blah " Sara, eager to change the subject, responded, "Don't we have a break coming up?"
