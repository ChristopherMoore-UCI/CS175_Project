-- A knife-wielding attacker killed at least two Japanese tourists and wounded 11 others on Tuesday in a tourist district on the U.S. Pacific territory of Guam Calvo told the same newspaper that he had reached out to Japanese consular officials after the incident. "The people of Guam and the people of Japan have enjoyed a long and close relationship as friends for many decades. Guam's economy is heavily dependent on tourism, with much of it coming from Asian countries. "(This) represents the worst tragedy that this island has seen in many decades," said Mark Baldyga, chairman of the Guam Visitors Bureau board.
