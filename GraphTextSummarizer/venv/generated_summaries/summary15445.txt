Top Yemen commander killed; al Qaeda claims responsibility Residents in Abyan told CNN that the injury toll from mines is far greater than those killed. -- Land mine explosions have killed at least 73 people in Yemen's Abyan province since al Qaeda fighters were defeated two weeks ago, the Yemeni Defense Ministry said. They said that most mines were planted near government institutions, military compounds, checkpoints, and mountainous roads. Hospitals in Abyan and neighboring Aden are full of land mine victims," Ali Hadi, a resident of Zinjibar, told CNN. The ministry said that tens of thousands of land mines were planted before militants were driven out of their key strongholds, as an ambush to retaliate for their defeat.
