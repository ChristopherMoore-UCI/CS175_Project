Karl ZoBell, the attorney for Dr. Seuss' interests and for his widow, Audrey Geisel, says that she doesn't like people to "hijack Dr. Seuss characters or material to front their own points of view." "The Cat in the Hat" was written because Dr. Seuss thought the famous Dick and Jane primers were insanely boring. Dr. Seuss actually said Yertle was a representation of Hitler. He received no credit on screen, so Dr. Seuss wrote to columnists in every major U.S. newspaper to tell them exactly who had sung the song. Tony the Tiger, AKA Thurl Ravenscroft, is the voice behind "You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch."
