"With sales increases in products, such as air conditioners and refrigerators, meeting local needs in India and Brazil, and "HIT solar cells" by maximizing Panasonic Group sales strength in Japan, the positive results have started showing in some regions and businesses," Panasonic said in a statement. The global economic downturn also knocked sales of Panasonic products including flat-screen televisions and digital cameras, which came under "intense price competition," the company said. -- Japanese electronics company Panasonic has plunged from profit to a record annual loss of 772.2 billion yen ($9.68 billion), prompting its shares to fall to a 30-year low. Both companies have struggled with ailing television manufacturing divisions, which have lost to lower cost rivals like Samsung and LG, and are hampered by a rising yen which has cut repatriated profits from overseas sales. Panasonic's poor performance follows record annual losses for rival Sony.
