Davis and Chmerkovskiy were heralded throughout the season for their performances and chemistry with judge Carrie Ann Inaba telling them after their final dance that "The best part of the season was you two." Davis and her pro partner Maksim Chmerkovskiy were declared the champions of Season 18 on Tuesday night. They squared off in the finale against Paralympic snowboarder Amy Purdy and her partner Derek Hough. Former "Full House" star Candace Cameron Bure and her pro partner Mark Ballas came in third. Not only did she win a gold medal with her ice-dancing partner Charlie White during the Winter Olympics in Sochi, but she also nabbed the "Dancing With the Stars" mirror ball trophy.
