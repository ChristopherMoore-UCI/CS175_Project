Iranian Defense Minister Ahmad Vahidi is wanted in Argentina for his alleged role in planning the bombing of a Jewish community center in Buenos Aires in 1994 that killed 85 people. Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and his allies founded the group a few years ago in an attempt, they said, to counterbalance United States influence in Latin America. In remarks during his visit to Bolivia, Vahidi said that Iran is prepared to "deliver a firm response" to any provocations from the United States, the state-run Press TV reported. Vahidi was in Bolivia at the invitation of the country's defense ministry to attend the inauguration of a military academy for members of the Bolivarian Alternative for the Peoples of Our Americas, or ALBA. In a letter to his Argentine counterpart, Bolivian Foreign Minister David Choquehuanca said that Bolivia was "unfortunately unaware" of Vahidi's history.
