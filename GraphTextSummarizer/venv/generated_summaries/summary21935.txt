This political reality stands out: Since states began legislating distracted driving or cell phone use in 2000, none has gone so far as to impose a complete ban on mobile devices behind the wheel, and only one state -- Alaska -- has considered such a blanket prohibition, just this year, said Anne Teigen, senior policy specialist with National Conference of State Legislatures. In the past 10 years the NTSB has increasingly sought to limit the use of portable electronic devices -- recommending bans for novice drivers, school bus drivers and commercial truckers. But the CTIA-The Wireless Association didn't take a position on the NTSB's recommended ban on cell phone conversations behind the wheel. Tuesday's recommendation, if adopted by states, would outlaw nonemergency phone calls and texting by operators of every vehicle on the road. "I don't believe most state lawmakers would say (the NTSB recommendation) is viable," Adkins said.
