As part of the investigation after Cox-Powell's disappearance, authorities last year searched a house in Washington state where Powell, his two sons and his father, Steven Powell, were living. Since September 2011, Josh Powell had been engaged in ongoing custody battle with his wife's parents Judith and Charles Cox, according to Washington state court records. Troyer said many law enforcement agents in Washington state have worked with their counterparts in Utah on the Susan Cox-Powell case, as well as spent time playing, coloring and getting to know her sons. Troyer said the sheriff's department has copies of a brief e-mail that had gone out to Powell's family and friends, "stating that he couldn't live with what was going on." Pierce County Sheriff's Department spokesman Ed Troyer told CNN that the explosion "was done intentionally," saying Josh Powell committed a "double homicide" in addition to killing himself.
