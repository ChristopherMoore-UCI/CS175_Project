The judicial punishment follows a six-month sporting ban given to Brandao, who plays for French Ligue 1 side Bastia, following the August incident when he assaulted Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Thiago Motta. The court was particularly annoyed by the absence of Brandao, who was having surgery in a Saint Etienne hospital Thursday. "This is an extremely severe sentence compared to the criminal record of my client," Brandao's lawyer Olivier Martin told CNN affiliate BFMTV after the three-judge panel's ruling, which also included a $25,000 fine. The 34-year-old can be seen on CCTV waiting around before striking Motta and then running off out of shot with Brazilian-born Motta following in hot pursuit. "It's well known that in many stadiums, suburban or elsewhere, there are similar events that may occur, and it is necessary that professional players lead by example."
