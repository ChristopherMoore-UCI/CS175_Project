Major disagreement One of the primary sticking points in this round of talks has been how to lift sanctions against Iran. Iran insists that like other countries, it has a right to develop nuclear power for peaceful purposes. Hardliners in Iran have insisted that significant sanctions be lifted right away as a sign of good faith from the P5+1 countries. In the United States, Republicans will control the Senate in January, and lawmakers have threatened fresh sanctions on Iran if a deal is not reached. But Western powers have accused Iran of trying to develop nuclear weapons as well.
