-- Drug kingpin Benjamin Arellano Felix, one of the leaders of the major Tijuana cartel, was extradited to the United States on Friday, Mexico's attorney general's office said. He is wanted in the United States on two indictments for conspiracy, money laundering, drug trafficking, operating a drug smuggling organization, and murder. He had been convicted of organized crime activities in Mexico and was serving several sentences in prison. In Mexico, even convicted traffickers have been known to communicate freely and control their organizations from inside prison. The Tijuana cartel, also known as the Arellano Felix Organization, was weakened as a result, but is still considered one of Mexico's major drug trafficking operations.
