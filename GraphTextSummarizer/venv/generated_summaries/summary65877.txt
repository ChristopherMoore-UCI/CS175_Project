-- The mayor of a French town where students were held hostage for more than four hours Monday wants to reassure parents that "schools in France are safe. He was killed by police marksmen using guns with silencers, press reports said. Six girls and their teacher were held hostage for two days in the suburbs of Paris in 1993. CNN's Nina Dos Santos, Isa Soares, Vicky Bennett and Alex Mohacs contributed to this report. About 20 children, aged 4 to 6, were in a classroom when the incident began; five children and their teacher were held until the incident was resolved, Besancon police said.
