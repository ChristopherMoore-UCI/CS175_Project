Lohan, 25, was simply sleeping after working "a grueling schedule the past few days," publicist Steve Honig said. She is in the middle of filming the Lifetime movie "Liz & Dick" in which she portrays legendary actress Elizabeth Taylor. -- Paramedics were called to Lindsay Lohan's Los Angeles hotel room when she did not wake up from a nap Friday morning, but the actress "is fine," her publicist said. LiLo's maybe co-star, porn actor James Deen "She was on set last night at 7 p.m. and worked through the night until 8 a.m. this morning," Honig said. Lohan has spent several stints in substance abuse rehab, jail and home confinement in the past five years.
