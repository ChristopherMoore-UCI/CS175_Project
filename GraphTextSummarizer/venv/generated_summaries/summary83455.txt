Asked Friday if Bush planned on making any recess appointments, White House spokesman Tony Fratto said, "I have nothing for you on that." Fratto added, "We don't talk about or speculate on personnel appointments until we're ready to announce them." -- Senators have left town for the Thanksgiving holiday, but the Senate will technically stay in session -- a move that keeps President Bush from making appointments while lawmakers are in recess. As a result, I am keeping the Senate in pro forma [session] to prevent recess appointments until we get this process on track." "I indicated I would be willing to confirm various appointments if the administration would agree to move on Democratic appointments," he said. Bush has used the power before to install nominees whose confirmation Senate Democrats had blocked.
