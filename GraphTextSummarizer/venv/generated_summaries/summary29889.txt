Last year, Obama ordered a review of U.S. hostage policy, which is never to negotiate with terrorists. Like the $200 million demand for the Japanese hostages, the Foley demand was never a serious negotiation effort as it far exceeded the amounts of money paid for hostages held by jihadist militant groups in the past, which typically have ranged up to several million dollars. So far, ISIS has executed a number of Western hostages, including American journalist Steven Sotloff, and U.S. aid worker Peter Kassig. The other is that every time a ransom is paid it increases the chance that other hostages will be taken to help fill the coffers of a terrorist group. It also includes their worried employers and Western governments such as France that will pay ransoms, and other governments, notably the United States and the United Kingdom, that will not.
