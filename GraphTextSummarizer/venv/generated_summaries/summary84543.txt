The market was the scene of a reported strong-armed robbery by Michael Brown shortly before his fatal confrontation with police officer Darren Wilson. Federal prosecutors are bringing charges in one of the fires in riots that destroyed businesses after the Michael Brown grand jury decision. Police from St. Louis County, Ferguson and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives circulated surveillance camera pictures of a suspect wearing a camouflage jacket in connection with the fire. The Ferguson Market survived disturbances in August after the Brown shooting, but burned after the grand jury decision was announced in November. Investigators said he was seen using an accelerant to set fire to the market, the official said.
