"They can play other types of songs, but nothing that incites violence or justifies crimes," Sinaloa Gov. Mario Lopez Valdez said as he announced the measure this week. -- Mexico's Sinaloa state has named a new target in the government's war on organized crime: bars, restaurants and night clubs that play songs glorifying drug trafficking. Good for (Mario Lopez Valdez)," national security spokesman Alejandro Poire said in a Twitter post. "The rhythm they dance to is that of the violence that harms many families in Mexico," Poire wrote in a blog post on an official government website. On Thursday, he said silencing the songs is a key part of Mexico's "cultural fight" against violence.
