And the war lives on in the hearts and memories of every Iraq veteran, whether they've transitioned smoothly back to civilian life with a job or are still ravaged by their experience and in desperate need of help. Iraq veterans are young hard-chargers now, but as time passes, that will change, just as it does for every person. But those numbers will only increase with time if we slash veteran program funding in a shortsighted rush, as some in Washington have begun chattering about. On May 1, 2003, my men and I were in Kuwait, waiting for orders to move into Iraq. Long term, it's estimated that these wars could cost between $600 billion and $1 trillion, to include the care for more than 2.3 million Iraq and Afghanistan veterans.
