The opposite view: Pray you never need euthanasia, but be glad of option Dr. Jan Bernheim, a leading promoter of euthanasia, admitted that there are problems with Belgium's euthanasia law. It is little wonder that disabled Belgian people fall into terminal despair, but that does not validate euthanasia becoming a "treatment" for depression as it has in Belgium. Earlier in the same debate, Alex Schadenberg of the Euthanasia Prevention Coalition had pointed out that the law in Belgium is just not safe: - Nearly half (47%) of euthanasia deaths are not reported (according to a study carried out in Flanders in 2007): With a 500% increase in euthanasia in Belgium in ten years, it is crystal clear that the law in Belgium is not safe; we cannot stand by as they try to extend that law to children. It is fundamentally unsafe that the most high-profile doctor in Belgium to carry out euthanasia is also the regulator.
