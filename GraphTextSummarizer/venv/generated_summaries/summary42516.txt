"Seems to me Hillary thinks George W. Bush was a terrible President," Paul Begala, a CNN contributor and a longtime Clinton confidant, said before enumerating a number of ways he feels Bush failed, including two "botched" wars, turning "a massive surplus into a crippling debt" and presiding "over an economic collapse. " CNN contributor and progressive activist Sally Kohn said if she were in Clinton's camp, bashing Bush "is exactly what I would be doing." Kohn is an outspoken Clinton critic. In front of a liberal audience at the New America Foundation in Washington last month, Clinton brought out her most fiery Bush rhetoric. "It is a way for her to run against something that is concrete because she can't run against President Obama." To Kohn, Bush is Clinton's foil against the left. From defending her record at the State Department to defining her economic vision, Clinton has used Bush as her primary rhetorical device to both explain her vision for the future and defend her past.
