-- Grigor Dimitrov backed up his undoubted talent with a gutsy display to beat South Africa's Kevin Anderson in a three-hour final at the ATP Tour event in Mexico. In the WTA tournament in Acapulco, Australian Open finalist Dominika Cibulkova beat Christina McHale 7-6 4-6 6-4. That marathon three-setter ended in the early hours of Saturday morning and it left Dimitrov with concerns about his physical condition heading into the title match with the big-serving Anderson. Both of the weekend winners will head to the Masters 1000 event in Indian Wells, California where Dimitrov is set to be a dangerous outsider based on his performances in Mexico. That proved equally close until Anderson hit a backhand long at 5-5 and Dimitrov closed out the match on the next point.
