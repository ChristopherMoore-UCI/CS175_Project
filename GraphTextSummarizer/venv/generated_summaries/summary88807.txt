"The investigation has determined that Mr. Woods is at fault in the crash." Woods satisfied the requirements of Florida law regarding motor vehicle accidents by providing his driver's license, registration and proof of insurance to authorities, Williams said. " Under Florida law, Woods is not obligated to give a statement about the crash. Upon conviction of careless driving, a moving violation, Woods faces a $164 fine and four points on his license, Maj. Cindy Williams of the Florida Highway Patrol said. Woods canceled plans to attend the Chevron World Challenge in Southern California "due to injuries sustained in a one-car accident last week," according to a statement Monday from the golfer. Last week, a story in the National Enquirer alleged that Woods has been seeing a New York nightclub hostess.
