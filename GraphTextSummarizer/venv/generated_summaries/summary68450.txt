Wednesday's performance began at 5:30 p.m. ET and included a set of classics including "Get Back," "Band on the Run," "Helter Skelter" and "Back in the USSR." Paul McCartney performs Wednesday on the roof above the marquee of New York's Ed Sullivan Theater. McCartney will be the first music act to play at Citi Field, and that concert will kick off his summer U.S. tour. To promote his concert at Citi Field this Friday, the former Beatle performed Wednesday afternoon on the roof above the Ed Sullivan Theater marquee before his appearance on "Late Night with David Letterman," which is taped in the theater. Sporting a pink button-up shirt and suspenders, McCartney played to a huge crowd that blocked off traffic near the intersection of 53rd Street and Broadway.
