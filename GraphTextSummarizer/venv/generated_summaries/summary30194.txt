" U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said in January that forcing marijuana businesses to be cash businesses, because they can't access banks, is a public safety problem. Colorado became the first state in the nation to legalize the sale of recreational marijuana, allowing pot stores to open for business on January 1. -- Colorado lawmakers on Wednesday approved a bill that would create financial services cooperatives specifically for licensed marijuana businesses in the state. The legislation comes three months after the Justice Department issued rules for the first time allowing banks to legally provide financial services to marijuana merchants. Because marijuana is illegal under federal law, banks have been "reluctant" to provide services to licensed pot sellers, according to the bill, HB 1398.
