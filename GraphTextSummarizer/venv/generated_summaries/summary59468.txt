John Tomic will face a Madrid court in October after headbutting his son's training partner Thomas Drouet outside a hotel in the Spanish capital in May. Tomic, who coaches his 20-year-old son, has had his credentials for the men's tour revoked and was banned from attending the French Open at Roland Garros. Last year, the 20-year-old Tomic was booed off court at Wimbledon, picking up a code violation after smashing his racket, as he made a first round exit before then requesting that his father should be ejected from the stands at the Miami Masters later in the year. "My Dad is in Paris," Tomic told a media conference after retiring from his first-round match against Romanian Victor Hanescu while 7-5 7-6 (8) 2-1 down due to a hamstring injury. It might be a few weeks away, maybe after the grass," added Tomic, referring to the upcoming grass-court season ahead of the Wimbledon Championships which begin in London next month. Drouet was left with a broken nose following the incident with Tomic's father in Madrid.
