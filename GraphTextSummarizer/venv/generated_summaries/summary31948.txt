On Thursday, British Foreign Secretary William Hague told Patino "that the UK was under an obligation to extradite Mr. Assange to Sweden" and that "the concept of 'diplomatic asylum,' while well-established in Latin America, did not feature in UK law," a spokesman for his office said. Ecuador granted Assange asylum in August, but he faces arrest in Britain if he leaves the South American country's embassy in London. "It is time for the United States to cease its persecution of WikiLeaks, to cease its persecution of our people and to cease its persecution of our alleged sources," Assange, speaking via satellite from London, told a packed conference room at the United Nations, where world leaders were attending the United Nations General Assembly. Top diplomats from Ecuador and the United Kingdom failed to reach an agreement Thursday over the case of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, but they agreed to meet again to discuss the issue. Ecuadorian Foreign Minister Ricardo Patino told reporters after the meeting on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
