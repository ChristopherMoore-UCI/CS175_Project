Rain, however, will not necessarily stop a show, said Philip Butler of Fireworks by Grucci, a Long Island, New York-based fireworks production company that has choreographed shows for presidential inaugurations and the Olympics. " Fireworks shows originating on land have stricter standards for the size of the perimeter, depending on wind speed, because spectators are generally closer to the explosives, Colonna said. Ideal conditions for fireworks are calm winds, comfortable temperatures and clear night skies, Butler said. For many New Year's Eve celebrations in cold-weather states, it's often snowing during fireworks shows. For that reason, fireworks launches over harbors, rivers and other bodies of water can often be larger in scale.
