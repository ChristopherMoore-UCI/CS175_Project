"What we're trying to do is move students out of their comfort zone," said Mike Nicholson, Oxford University admissions director. In the United Kingdom, 90 percent of students are educated at state schools. "At Oxbridge Applications, we have a network of 500 former tutors and former admissions tutors as well," said company founder James Uffindell. That seems to indicate that wealthier students who can afford private schools have an advantage. -- You might expect Oxford and Cambridge universities to ask prospective students to compare the works of Chaucer to Boccaccio or to explain the theory of relativity.
