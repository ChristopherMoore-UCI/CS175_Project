Gustavo Sierra, mayor of the Surquillo district in Lima, said a federal drug law is hypocritical because it allows maximum legally allowed quantities for some drugs and plants but doesn't say where to acquire them, the Peru 21 newspaper reported in a front-page story headlined, "Say yes to drugs?" Sierra said the federal government should adopt his position in its war on drugs, adding that he will take the matter up with the nation's executive branch. -- A mayor in Peru has suggested that the federal government legalize illicit drugs and administer them through the national health ministry, a newspaper reported Friday. Milton Rojas, a specialist with a private, nonprofit, anti-drug organization called Cedro, told Peru 21 that the mayor's initiative would lead to greater drug use. "They are medicinal plants rejected by science because of the false belief that they are drugs." "Legalizing drugs would only bring more insecurity," he said.
