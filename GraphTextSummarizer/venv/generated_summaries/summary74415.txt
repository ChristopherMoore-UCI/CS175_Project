The London-accented voice is all too familiar to anyone who's watched the videos released by ISIS of the killing of Western hostages. The school's intake is 70% Muslim, said Shuter, with many students coming from large housing estates in what is a multicultural area of London. Now 26, Emwazi has gained international notoriety after being identified as the ISIS militant nicknamed "Jihadi John" who's appeared in beheading videos of Western hostages. That's according to Joanna Shuter, his former head teacher at Quintin Kynaston Community Academy in northwest London. She still finds it hard to believe that Emwazi could be the apparent killer with the London accent recorded on ISIS videos.
