In fact, Florida's broad laws regarding access to public documents creates a great likelihood of such a possibility, said CNN legal analyst Lisa Bloom. "As a general rule, matters of a police file are public record, and the media has access to contents of a police file. "Law enforcement files have to be released in Florida, so the media has a very strong argument not only under federal First Amendment laws but also under Florida access laws," Bloom said. SeaWorld also expressed concern that members of the media will be able to gain access to the videos if they become part of an investigative file with law enforcement. The Brancheau family's lawsuit marks the second time this month that a family has asked the courts to intervene in the release of footage depicting dead loved ones. Earlier this month, another family made a similar appeal to the courts involving the release of photos depicting dead loved ones.
