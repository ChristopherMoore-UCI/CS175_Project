" Sacra had been to Liberia with SIM before, and volunteered to go again after he heard fellow missionaries Nancy Writebol and Dr. Kent Brantly had contracted the virus, SIM President Bruce Johnson said. "Dr. Jerry Brown, Dr. Sacra's Liberian colleague, has overseen the care and cure of many Ebola virus disease patients in Liberia, and I trust his expertise," Debbie Sacra said. From Charlotte, North Carolina, she thanked God, her family, and health care workers in Liberia and Atlanta for nursing her back to health. "Rick would want me to urge you to remember that there are many people in Liberia who are suffering in this epidemic and others who are not receiving standard health care because clinics and hospitals have been forced to close. Dr. Rick Sacra is the latest American to become infected with the Ebola virus while working in Liberia for the aid organization Serving in Mission.
