The group of five, who worked for Dr. Abdullah Abdullah, were in a two-car caravan in northwestern Afghanistan on Wednesday when they were abducted, said Sayed Ahmad Samey, the security chief of Badghis province. Abdullah is a former Foreign Minister who is seeking to unseat incumbent President Hamid Karzai in the August 20 election. A month earlier, gunmen in the province of Kapisa killed another of Abdullah's campaign managers in a midnight attack. The workers have now been freed and are in a good condition, according to Sami Panah of Abdullah's campaign office. Five of Dr Abdullah Abdullah's campaign workers were kidnapped and later released.
