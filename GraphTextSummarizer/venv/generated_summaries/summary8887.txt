Tensions between the two countries have flared over Calero Island, a parcel of land on the Atlantic coast, since last year. -- Costa Rica and Nicaragua both must refrain from sending or maintaining civilians, security forces or police in a disputed border area, the International Court of Justice ordered Tuesday, offering each side something it could claim as a victory. In November, Costa Rica's foreign ministry said the country had filed a lawsuit in the court to end a situation that "threatens imminent and irreparable harm" to Costa Rica. By a 13-4 vote, the justices said that Costa Rica could send personnel to the area to protect the environment, but only in a manner that won't escalate tensions. The suit asked the court to stop "the construction of a canal on Costa Rican soil," the ministry said then.
