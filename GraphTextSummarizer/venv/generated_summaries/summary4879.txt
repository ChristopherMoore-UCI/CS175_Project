Luke Crane, who says he works at Kickstarter and describes himself as a self-publisher of role-playing games, floated out a question on Monday evening: "Why are there so few lady game creators?" Women's role in the gaming industry is part of a greater conversation about gender roles and stereotypes in the scientific, techie and geek spheres. One simple tweet can help push the start button for action, thanks in part to the viral nature of social media. Do you have a mentor, or can you think of a good mentor for women interested in the video gaming world, or science and technology? The #1ReasonMentor hashtag popped up to help women interested in the video gaming industry to meet others who are working in the field, and vice versa.
