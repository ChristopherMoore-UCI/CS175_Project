Rather than spending millions on reintroducing free in-flight food on United flights, Continental is staying consistent with its merger-partner and creating room for profit with snack packs starting at $3.95 on coach flights, he said. " Hungry air travelers could blame rising fuel costs, said global aviation consultant Mike Boyd of Boyd Group International. I don't know what they'll cut next, but I'm sure they'll find something." Boyd said snack removal shouldn't be considered a calamity. "We believe complimentary snacks are an appropriate component to the flight," Delta representative Chris Kelly Singley said. Continental stopped serving complimentary snacks to passengers flying coach on domestic routes this week.
