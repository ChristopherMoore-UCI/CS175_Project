Sandusky's comments on child rape allegations "When we force children to submit to unwanted affection in order not to offend a relative or hurt a friend's feelings, we teach them that their bodies do not really belong to them because they have to push aside their own feelings about what feels right to them," said Irene van der Zande, co-founder and executive director of Kidpower Teenpower Fullpower International, a nonprofit specializing in teaching personal safety and violence prevention. While she must treat people with respect, she doesn't have to offer physical affection to please them. " Protection against predators Forcing children to touch people when they don't want to leaves them vulnerable to sexual abusers, most of whom are people known to the children they abuse, according to Ursula Wagner, a mental health clinician with the FamilyWorks program at Heartland Alliance in Chicago. Manners -- treating people with respect and care -- is different than demanding physical displays of affection. "When kids are really little and shy, parents can start to offer them choices for treating people with respect and care," said van der Zande.
