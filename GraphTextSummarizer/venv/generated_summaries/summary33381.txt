Former FBI Director Louis Freeh was seriously injured and hospitalized after a single-vehicle accident in Vermont, state police said. "The thoughts and prayers of the entire FBI remain with former Director Freeh and his family tonight," FBI Director James Comey said Monday. Vermont State Police said Tuesday that Freeh was still hospitalized and being treated for his injuries. Police also said that neither alcohol nor drugs were a factor in Monday's accident. Freeh, 64, was wearing his seat belt when the GMC Yukon he was driving went off the road near Barnard, struck a mailbox and ran over some bushes, police said.
