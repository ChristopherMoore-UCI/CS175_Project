A lesser club than Bayern might have wilted under the disappointment of losing last year's Champions League final inside its own stadium in such heartbreaking fashion. While Arsenal struggled, Bayern appeared to be cut from a different cloth. It took just 21 minutes to leave Arsenal's dream of qualification ripped to shreds as Bayern strengthened its grip on the contest. "We expected a very big start from Arsenal here at home with the fans behind them," Bayern's Arjen Robben told ITV. "I think we did very well and of course if you score two goals you're in a great position." Based on past results in the competition, Arsenal has just a 2.2% chance of progressing to the next stage -- but in Wilshere it has one player with great heart and determination.
