Penny Junor, who has written several books on Britain's royal family, says she suspects Harry may get himself into embarrassing situations more often than his older brother William at least partly because Harry does not expect to become king. " "William formed a bond with his father," based in part on the throne the two men expect to inherit -- which Harry likely never will, Saunders said.
