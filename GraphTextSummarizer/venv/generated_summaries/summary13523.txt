The months leading up to the ongoing 18th party congress, which is held once every five years, have brought contentious back-room horse-trading among the party elite, including party chief Hu Jintao and retired leaders like former president Jiang Zemin, China analysts say. However, Jiang gave it up to Hu in 2004, apparently due to pressure from party stalwarts and military leaders. Deng's successor Jiang Zemin also retained his CMC chair after he handed over top posts to Hu Jintao in 2002. Hu warns party of 'enemy within' Only then was Hu able to solidify his position as paramount leader.
