Reporter Henin and photographer Torres were taken hostage a short time later, on June 22, the French Foreign Ministry said last October. The four men had been held since June last year. Denis Olivennes, chief executive of Europe 1, tweeted Saturday of his "immense joy" at the release of all four journalists and thanked all those who had brought about their release from captivity. The pair went missing on June 6 while en route to Aleppo, having crossed the border from Turkey, the station said at the time. Turkish broadcaster DHA aired video of the released journalists after they arrived in Turkey.
