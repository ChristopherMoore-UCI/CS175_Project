" Butler said Enin is not only a model academic student, but also plays three instruments for the chamber orchestra, sings in an a cappella group, throws shot put and discus for the high school's track and field team, participates in student government and has had a lead role in school plays since the ninth grade. That was the selection made Wednesday by Kwasi Enin, the New York high school student accepted by the eight Ivy League schools -- Harvard, Yale, Brown, Columbia, University of Pennsylvania, Dartmouth, Princeton and Cornell. "Follow your passions in high school and not just follow suit for what you think can get you into these schools," he said. "I applied knowing that going to any of the Ivy League schools would be wonderful," Enin told CNN earlier this month. Butler has been Enin's principal for six years in both middle and high school.
