-- Newly released text messages reportedly from the morning of September 11, 2001, show panicked family members trying to contact loved ones and officials frantically trying to grasp what was happening. " A message from the Secret Service's New York field office sent conflicting messages about where agents should report. Some people witnessing the attacks reached out to loved ones out of fear there might have been more attacks coming and they might die. Companies begin sending out messages asking for head counts on all employees. " Wikileaks will not say if the source was in government, law enforcement, industry or was a private citizen with the capability to intercept messages.
