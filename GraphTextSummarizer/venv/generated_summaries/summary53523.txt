The parents of Pakistani teen activist Malala Yousafzai arrived Thursday in Britain to reunite with their daughter, who has become an international symbol of courage after being shot by the Taliban for demanding education for girls. Malala initially gained international attention in 2009, as the Taliban gained a foothold in her home region of Swat, a Taliban redoubt in northwest Pakistan, near Afghanistan. He ran a school in Pakistan's conservative Swat Valley that kept its doors open to girls -- in defiance of the Taliban. Opinion: Why Malala should not be turned into modern Joan of Arc Malala has been thinking about school even while she lies in her hospital bed, Interior Minister Rehman Malik told reporters after meeting with her family -- she asked her father to take her school books with him. In her writings, which earned her Pakistan's first National Peace Prize, she encouraged young people to oppose the Taliban.
