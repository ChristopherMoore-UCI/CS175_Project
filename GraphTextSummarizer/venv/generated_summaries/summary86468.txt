Days after he left a nursing home, radio icon Casey Kasem was the subject of a welfare check at a residence in Washington state, officials said Thursday. Decades of fame Casey Kasem, who hosted radio music countdown shows "American Top 40" and "Casey's Top 40" for decades, retired in 2009. "These children single-handedly and irreparably shattered the lives of their father, his wife and youngest daughter, the calm of their home and their neighborhood by engaging in uncalled for public demonstrations and personal attacks in the media," she said in court papers, according to CNN affiliate KCBS. "We tried everything to get her to let us see him when she stopped bringing him over to the house," Kerri Kasem told CNN in December. "The Kasem family will do everything in their power to bring their father home," Danny Deraney said.
