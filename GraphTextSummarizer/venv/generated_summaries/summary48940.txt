His hair flecked with gray, sneery and sinewy, Phoenix resembles Montgomery Clift and John Garfield: postwar stars who embodied the anxieties and alienation of the returning GIs in male melodramas tinged in varying shades of noir. -- "We are not animals, we are on a whole different level to that." So claims Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman), who describes himself as "many things," including a writer, doctor, a nuclear physicist, and a theoretical philosopher, but also assumes the more presumptuous role of guru and spiritual teacher, even prophet. The protagonist is one Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix), an Everyman of an especially disheveled, even wretched sort, a lost soul and a drifter who serves in the Navy during World War II and can't get his act together once the war is over. If you've heard anything about "The Master," Paul Thomas Anderson's long-awaited follow up to the magnificent "There Will Be Blood," you will know that Dodd is reportedly based on sci-fi novelist and Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard. Hoffman suggests someone more professorial than preacher: an Old World sophisticate with a New World faith in scientific methodology; charismatic, kindly, even utopian, but a charlatan whether he admits it to himself or not.
