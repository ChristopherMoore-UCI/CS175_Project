William Lee Adams, a Eurovision expert and the editor-in-chief of Wiwibloggs.com, the popular Eurovision website, told CNN that the contest is about national identity as well as music. Moscow annexed Ukraine's Crimea region in March and eastern Ukraine is currently roiled by pro-Russian separatist protests. The organizers describe the event -- known for its combination of over-the-top costumes, kitsch pop songs and sometimes questionable talent -- as non-political. The country with the highest points total wins -- and has the rather expensive honor of hosting the following year's event. " The countries involved in the contest award a set of points from one to eight, then 10 and finally 12 for their favorite songs.
