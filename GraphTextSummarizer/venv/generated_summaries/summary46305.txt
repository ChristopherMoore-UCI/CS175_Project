"His life was taken away from him," said Dr. Anthony Gaspari, an American dermatologist who traveled twice to Indonesia to treat Kosawa. He became involved in Kosawa's case after being approached by a dermatology journal and Discovery Health Channel. The skin treatments didn't work, because they didn't address his weakened immune system, and Kosawa could not afford more medical procedures, Gaspari said. Gaspari continues to monitor Kosawa's progress through e-mails and teleconference calls with Indonesian doctors. The experts are waiting to learn more about Kosawa's reaction to the medical treatments, Gaspari said.
