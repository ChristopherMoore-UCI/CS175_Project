A trauma surgeon contacted by CNN said terrorists could use a variety of techniques to conceal bombs in a human, ranging from crude surgery that would likely result in infections, fever and other complications, to more sophisticated procedures that would take greater skill, but could last a long time before causing problems. TSA spokesman Nicholas Kimball said passengers flying from international locations to U.S. destinations may notice additional security measures in place. But the new intelligence prompted officials last week to brief international airlines and U.S. allies overseas, a Transportation Security Administration spokesman said. The idea of implanting bombs has been discussed in the past, but the United States has obtained fresh intelligence about the desire of terrorists to implant devices, according to the official. -- Terrorists intent on striking commercial aircraft have shown renewed interest in surgically implanting explosives in humans to circumvent airport security, a U.S. security official tells CNN.
