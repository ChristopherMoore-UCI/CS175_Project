-- A group of Texas clinics that provide abortions are asking the U.S. Supreme Court for emergency action to keep their facilities open, in the face of state restrictions that went into effect last week. The Center for Reproductive Rights had sued Texas this past spring, on behalf of a coalition of abortion clinics. Lauren Bean, spokeswoman for the state attorney general's office, said in a statement after that ruling, "This decision is a vindication of the careful deliberation by the Texas Legislature to craft a law to protect the health and safety of Texas women. Critics contend the law, in addition to eliminating abortion across huge swaths of the state, will further deny access to many women in rural communities and will force women to seek dangerous "back-alley" abortions. Supporters said before the bill was enacted, there were 41 facilities in Texas providing abortions.
