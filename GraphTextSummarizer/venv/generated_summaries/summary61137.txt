In his Washington speech, Obama pledged U.S. support for reform efforts across the Middle East and North Africa, warning leaders facing popular upheavals that "strategies of oppression and strategies of diversion will not work anymore." Rebel leaders were pleased to hear Obama call their provisional government "legitimate and credible," remarks that raised hopes of eventual U.S. recognition as the country's rightful government -- and accompanying aid. His call for an agreement based on Israel's pre-1967 borders drew criticism from Netanyahu, who called those frontiers "indefensible," but Obama also poured cold water on Palestinian efforts to seek a unilateral declaration of statehood at the United Nations. Obama's passing reference to Yemen, in which he urged embattled President Ali Abdullah Saleh to "follow through" on his reported agreement to step down after 32 years in power, drew mixed reviews from anti-government protesters there. But we realize that President Obama cannot give as much to the Yemeni people as we can give to ourselves.
