-- Three of the five men wrongly convicted in the horrific beating and rape of a female jogger in Central Park in 1989 said Friday that a $40 million settlement with New York City cannot begin to replace all they lost. The agreement between the city law department and the five men -- who served between seven and 13 years in prison -- averages about $1 million per year of incarceration, a source with knowledge of the settlement told CNN last week. City Comptroller Scott Stringer on Thursday said the settlement was "a prudent and equitable solution for all parties to the lawsuit and closes a very difficult chapter in our City's history." "They should, if they ever want to cleanse their soul, but they'll never admit the reality of what they did." On April 19, 1989, a 28-year-old white Wall Street investment banker jogging through Central Park was raped, viciously beaten and left for dead. "If they had their way," Salaam told CNN in 2012, "we would have been hanging from one of those lovely trees here in Central Park."
