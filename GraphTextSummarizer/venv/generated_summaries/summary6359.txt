The 40-year-old former director of an aftercare program sees people as full of troubled stories but essentially worth connecting to. At the heart of her life and art is a childlike sincerity. I started wondering what would happen if I made up stories for myself and made 3-D finger puppets to tell my story. I did an embroidery piece from the perspective of being behind a crowded street with a lot of people. I don't think it's to say yes to people who want us to do the wrong things.
