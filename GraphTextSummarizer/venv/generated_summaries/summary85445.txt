Poll: Obama's immigration policy popular, but approach isn't House Republicans have approved a measure to challenge Obama's executive order -- and these new deportation numbers could also add fuel to the fire for Congressional Republicans, who say that less deportations will lead to more illegal immigration. As border crossings continue to rise, deportations dropped by about 14 percent in the year that ended Sept. 30 compared to the year before, according to a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement draft report first obtained by the L.A. Times and published Thursday. Nearly 316,000 people were removed from the U.S. A slowdown of deportations might help Obama score higher the Latino community, which overwhelmingly voted for Obama over his GOP challengers, but have been critical of the president's deportation policies, some even calling him a "Deporter in Chief." Notably, higher than usual numbers of immigrants crossing the border in the past year came from countries other than Mexico, including Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, the report reveals, potentially making the process to obtain travel documents and book flights to distant locations more complicated and more expensive. Christensen noted that numerous factors might contribute to fluctuating year-to-year data, including local court decisions, migration patterns and scheduling air transportation.
