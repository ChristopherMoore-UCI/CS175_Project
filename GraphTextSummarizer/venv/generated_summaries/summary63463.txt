Four Western embassies have been closed since August 4, after US intelligence intercepted information that al Qaeda would target American interests in the region. -- Three suspected al Qaeda militants were killed by a U.S. drone strike in Yemen's southern province of Lahj, two local security officials told CNN on Saturday. "Pro-government fighters have made it difficult for al Qaeda militants to move around in the province after their defeat last year," he added. Drone strikes against militants in Yemen have been intensifying as the U.S. Embassy there and in other Middle Eastern and African countries have been closed amid terrorism fears. Security presence has decreased over the past two days in the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, after hundreds of additional troops were deployed after the terror alert on August 3.
