If you suspect a family member or friend is developing Alzheimer's, take a look at these 10 warning signs of Alzheimer's Disease, put together by the Alzheimer's Association: 1.Memory changes that disrupt daily life 2.Challenges in planning or solving problems 3.Difficulty completing familiar tasks at home, at work, or at leisure 4.Confusion with time or place 5.Trouble understanding visual images and spatial relationships 6.New problems with words in speaking or writing 7.Misplacing things and losing the ability to retrace steps 8.Decreased or poor judgment 9.Withdrawal from work or social activities 10.Changes in mood and personality Rather than diagnose Alzheimer's disease at home, head to your doctor's office. But while early diagnosis leads to early intervention, some news out of the 2013 Alzheimer's Association International Conference is troubling: An expert panel found 16 online tests for Alzheimer's disease scored poorly on scales of overall scientific validity, reliability and ethical factors. At the same conference, another study concluded that the misdiagnosis of Alzheimer's disease in Medicare patients who actually have vascular dementia or Parkinson's disease leads to substantial excess costs of care. More than 5 million Americans are living with Alzheimer's today, with another person developing the disease every 68 seconds. "Self-diagnosis behavior ... is increasingly popular online, and freely accessible quizzes that call themselves 'tests' for Alzheimer's are available on the Internet," says Julie Robillard, who presented the data this week in Boston.
