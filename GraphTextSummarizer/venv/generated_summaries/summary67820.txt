Human Rights Watch voiced concern in February that Venezuela was censoring the news media and highlighted Maduro's efforts to take CNN off the airwaves. -- A CNN team has been denied credentials to cover upcoming local elections in Venezuela. When the crew asked for an explanation, the official said that "they didn't understand why CNN needed to send an anchor to cover local elections when there are two correspondents accredited in Venezuela. Students were jailed and, in solidarity, protests began in other cities. " The CNN team, including reporter Fernando del Rincón, intended to travel to the state of Táchira, where the most violent protests erupted in February in the southwestern city of San Cristóbal.
