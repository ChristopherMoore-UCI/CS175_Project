-- National Hockey League veteran Rick Rypien was found dead at his rural Alberta home Monday. The 27-year-old forward was found dead at his Crowsnest Pass home, Royal Canadian Mounted Police officials told the Toronto Globe and Mail. "Rick has been a beloved member of the Canucks family for the past six years," Vancouver said in a statement. "We are deeply saddened to confirm Rick's passing," said a statement released by the Winnipeg Jets Hockey Club. Rypien, who had spent his entire six-season NHL career with the Vancouver Canucks, signed a one-year contract with the Jets last month, the team said.
