"TSA is conducting an investigation to determine how an individual without proper credentials accessed the secure area of Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport via an airline employee parking lot." Delta is re-emphasizing the checking of employee identification at Delta employee parking lots, according to the airline. "Airports are responsible for implementing security programs that restrict access to secure areas," said TSA spokesman David Castelveter in a statement. She didn't notice she was pulling into a Delta employee parking lot, where she said she was waved through two security checkpoints and allowed to park. "We have taken aggressive action with our security vendors at the parking lot to emphasize that all security procedures, especially verification of credentials, are strictly adhered to," said Delta spokesman Morgan Durrant in a statement. "Here I was sitting in the middle of the C Terminal without having to go through security or do anything," Reynolds said.
