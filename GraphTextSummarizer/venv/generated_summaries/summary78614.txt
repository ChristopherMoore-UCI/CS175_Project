The main reason for Utah's growth is a "natural increase" -- births minus deaths -- said Census Bureau demographer Greg Harper. "Utah has a strong rate of natural increase and domestic migration, where more people move into the state and [are] not moving out," he said. "Second is Arizona," Harper said. "Nevada was last year's fastest-growing state, but it fell to eighth," said Harper. -- Utah is the nation's fastest growing state, increasing 2.5 percent from July 2007 to July 2008, according to new population estimates from the Census Bureau.
