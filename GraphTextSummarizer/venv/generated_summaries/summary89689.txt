But European Union finance ministers welcomed Ireland's request for assistance, according to a joint statement issued soon after Cowen's announcement. In addition, Cowen said he'd push new policies that would make Irish banks "significantly smaller than they have been in the past ... so they can be brought on their feet. On Sunday Ireland formally requested substantial "financial assistance" from the European Union and IMF, Prime Minister Brian Cowen said. "I want to assure the Irish people that we have a better future before us," Cowen said in announcing the request, as well as pledging substantial budget cuts and tax hikes. In part to meet its loan requirements, Dublin also will set out a comprehensive four-year plan detailing its deficit-reduction and other measures to shore up the Irish economy, according to Cowen.
