In the other Group C matches, Slovenia claimed a vital 1-0 win in Estonia to move up to second place in the table, level with Italy who still lead the way on goal difference. After a goalless first half, Joachim Loew's side made their class tell after the break courtesy of goals from Miroslav Klose, Mario Gomez and Lukas Podolski. The visitors led 3-2 with three minutes left but Belgium scored two quick-fire goals before an injury time Martin Harnik goal secured the point for Austria. Portugal are up to second place in Group H after a 3-1 victory in Iceland, who remain bottom of the table without a point. Disturbances in the area of the Marassi stadium where visiting Serbian fans were congregated meant the kick-off had to be delayed by more than 30 minutes.
