In the vicinity, police were alerted to another shooting victim, Pagan's 47-year-old grandson, who was critically injured with a gunshot wound to the head and found outside the Staten Island house where he lived with his mother and girlfriend. Police were still trying to sort out what led Heriberto Pagan to drive from his home in Brooklyn to his daughter's Staten Island house Friday and shoot two people before taking his own life. "There [were] a lot of problems in that house, I could say, but it never really exploded the way it [did] today," an unidentified neighbor told CNN affiliate NY1 News. "This is like a nightmare," neighbor John Rina told CNN affiliate WCBS. A 4-month-old boy was found unharmed in the home and placed in the care of child welfare authorities, police said.
