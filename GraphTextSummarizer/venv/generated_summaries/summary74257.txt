In 1979, Nancy Garces broke out of the women's prison in Chino, California, where she was serving a sentence in a credit-card forgery case, said Lt. Paul McCaffrey, spokesman for Santa Barbara police. Police received a tip that she would be arriving by train Tuesday in Santa Barbara at 11:30 a.m. (2:30 p.m. ET), McCaffrey said. Garces, 56, was traveling under her assumed name of Lydia Mendez of Albuquerque, New Mexico, and told authorities she even has kids under that name, McCaffrey said. "We made contact with her, and she gave us her assumed named, Lydia Mendez," McCaffrey said. "I can tell you she was very surprised," McCaffrey told CNN.
