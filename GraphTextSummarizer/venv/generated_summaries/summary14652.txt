The Irish government ordered a recall Saturday of all pork products linked to pigs slaughtered in Ireland, after laboratory tests found the presence of dioxins in animal feed and pork fat samples. Most dioxin exposure occurs through diet, with more than 95 percent coming from the consumption of animal fats, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Dioxins are environmental contaminants, often present in industrial waste. The Food Safety Authority advised consumers not to consume Irish pork and bacon products for the time being. Dioxin levels in food are regulated.
