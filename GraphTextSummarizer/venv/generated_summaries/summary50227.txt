Amid the whine of F3 engines and the clatter of pneumatic tools, 21-year-old Sun Zheng -- one of mainland China's small but growing pack of motor racing drivers -- considers his form for the next day's racing at the Macau Grand Prix. "Of course, all F3 drivers want to be F1 drivers and Macau is like doing college," he says, adding that his ambition is to become China's first F1 driver at a Federation Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA)-sanctioned event. I have a 60-70% chance I'm going to go for it.'" As a street circuit, the concrete canyons of Macau's Guia Circuit can throw up some chilling moments, even for experienced drivers who take some corners at upwards of 240 kph (150 mph) on each lap. New drivers need experience so they come back two or three times but if you do succeed at Macau, then all the Formula One people are watching -- it's a calling card for your career. While advances in the carbon fiber monocoque design have made the racers safer than they were 20, and even 10 years ago (F3 racers now fitted with thick panels that protect drivers from intrusions into the cockpit), the last thing a driver wants is 'to go in', says Hieatt using the pit vernacular for having a crash.
