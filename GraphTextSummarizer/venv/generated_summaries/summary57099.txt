Robertson, 17, is the granddaughter of family patriarch Phil Robertson and daughter of Willie Robertson, current CEO of Duck Commander, the family business on which the show is based. "Duck Dynasty" member Sadie Robertson left small-town Louisiana this week for New York Fashion Week -- and, she can't wait to do it again. "So extremely blessed to be a Sherri Hill model and [to] get to walk in New York Fashion Week. She is also the latest reality TV personality to model designer Sherri Hill's prom collection, following in the footsteps of Kylie and Kendall Jenner. It just depends on what opportunities I get," Robertson told People.
