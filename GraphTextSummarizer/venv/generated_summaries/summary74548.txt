Stuart Gulliver, HSBC's chief executive, said when he announced annual results last week that he would "fixate on costs" over the coming year and promised to find a further $1bn of annual savings in 2013. If HSBC maintained the recent rate of staff cuts to cost savings, the number would be closer to 10,000. But even with that stripped out the cost-income ratio was still 56 per cent, as revenue numbers were held back by anaemic economic growth in much of the world. HSBC has already exceeded its target of finding $2.5-$3.5bn of cost savings by 2013, announcing $3.6bn of "sustainable annual savings" with its 2012 results. Last year the ratio, which measures overheads as a proportion of revenue, spiralled upwards to 62.8 per cent.
