Anwar spent six years in prison after being convicted on corruption charges in 1999 and on sodomy charges involving his wife's former driver in 2000. -- A Malaysian court Monday found opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim not guilty of sodomizing a former male political aide, bringing an end to a politically charged trial and shaking up expectations for elections this year. Investigators arrested Anwar in July 2008 -- four months after a loose coalition of opposition parties that he led won 82 of 222 parliamentary seats in elections. Anwar had been on trial for nearly two years in the Kuala Lumpur High Court on allegations that he sodomized the former aide, Saiful Bukhari Azlan, in June 2008. With the government expected to call elections in the coming months, Anwar said he was ready to start campaigning again.
