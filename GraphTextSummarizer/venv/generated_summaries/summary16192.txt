New South Wales Minister Linda Burney was at Cannes Film Festival to make the announcement and told CNN: "Part of the reason for this announcement is to make it more attractive for international producers, international films ... to say to the international film community, 'We want your business.' But in the last two years, there have been some fundamental changes in the backing for films that give cause for hope in the industry. We are saying to the rest of the world, 'Come to Sydney, come to our state, make films and we will look after you.'" Brian Rosen hopes that more money will mean films with broader international appeal. I think we will be doing films with broader audience appeal which will have a much bigger success. The government and film officials hope that this new offset could be the catalyst for a turnaround in the industry's fortunes, increasing the production value of Aussie films from around $600 million (AUS) ($576 million) a year to $1 billion (AUS) ($960 million) over the next few years.
