" Ruskin "devoted so much of his time in the 1980s" to the merger of the two actors' unions -- SAG and AFTRA, -- which became a reality in 2012, Howard said. "Joe was the epitome of the actor who takes care of all the other actors while keeping one foot firmly planted on the stage or the set," SAG-AFTRA President Ken Howard said. He was the first Western Regional Vice President of Actors Equity Association and served a decade on AFTRA's national board. He served on the Screen Actors Guild board from 1976 through 1999, including eight years as 1st national vice president, the SAG-AFTRA release said. His first professional performances were at the Pittsburgh Playhouse and the Rochester Arena Stage after he left the U.S. Navy following World War II.
