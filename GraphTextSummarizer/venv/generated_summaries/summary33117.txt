All are charged with aggravated assault, simple assault, recklessly endangering another person and criminal conspiracy, CNN affiliate WPVI reported. They could not be charged with a hate crime for the same reason lawmakers held their news conference -- people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender are not covered under Pennsylvania's hate crime law. Lawmakers gathered in the Pennsylvania state capital in Harrisburg on Tuesday to propose a major change in the state's hate crime law to extend protection to those who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender. Kevin J. Harrigan, 26, Kathryn G. Knott, 24, and Phillip Williams, 24, surrendered to police on Wednesday, according to WPVI. Later, Ferlo, who will be leaving the state Senate in November, said his remarks weren't planned.
