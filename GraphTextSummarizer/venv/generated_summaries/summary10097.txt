Breastfeeding advocates raised legitimate concerns about breast milk alternatives (corn syrups for babies?) Yes, we can use breast pumps to provide babies with breast milk.

One woman listed the accessories she invested in: a special "Boppy" nursing pillow, a rocking chair, nursing bras, a pump, and herbal supplements (rumored to enhance milk supply).
