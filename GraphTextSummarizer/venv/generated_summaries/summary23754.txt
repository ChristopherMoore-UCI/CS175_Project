He is accused of breaking into military, NASA and civilian networks, and accessing computers at the Pentagon; Fort Benning, Georgia; Fort Meade, Maryland; the Earle Naval Weapons Station in Colts Neck, New Jersey; and the Johnson Space Center in Houston, among others. -- Computer hacker Gary McKinnon will face no charges in the United Kingdom over what the U.S. government says is the biggest military computer hacking of all time, British prosecutors said Friday. The Crown Prosecution Service announcement follows a decision two months ago by Home Secretary Theresa May to block his extradition to the United States to face trial on health grounds. In one case, McKinnon allegedly crashed computers belonging to the Military District of Washington. The 46-year-old has Asperger syndrome and depressive illness, as well as schizophrenia and other mental health issues.
