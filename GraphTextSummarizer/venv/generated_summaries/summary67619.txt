Hadi has also ordered the closure of all Houthi-controlled media -- including Yemen TV and Saba TV. Supreme leader Al Houthi spoke live Thursday night in Yemen on al-Masirah TV, saying, "If any army tries to invade our country, we will prove that Yemen will be a grave for those who invade us." "I ask you, based on the principle of self-defense in Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, and on the basis of the Charter of the Arab League and the treaty of joint Arab defense, to provide instant support by all necessary means, including military intervention to protect Yemen and its people from continuous Houthi aggression," read the letter, which was posted by Saudi Arabia's Foreign Ministry. The nations stepping into Yemen's civil war are predominantly Sunni Muslim, and they are working to rescue a government that has strong Sunni support. A coalition of Middle Eastern forces continued pounding rebel targets in Yemen from the air on Friday, the second day of a campaign aimed at the Houthi group.
