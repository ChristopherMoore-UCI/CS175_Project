The Middletons stayed in the recently updated, 500-year-old Restormel Manor, which sleeps 18 and has a tennis court and heated swimming pool. It's believed the active pair will end their trip in Alberta's Rocky Mountains, following in the steps of William's grandmother, great aunt and great grandmother, all of whom have stayed at the Fairmont Jasper Park Lodge's six-bedroom Outlook cabin -- the so-called Royal Retreat. Camp "tents" have thatched roofs, verandas and bathrooms, and are arrayed around a central lounge with swimming pool. The private, three-mile-long Indian Ocean coral atoll is surrounded by clear turquoise water, and is reached by private plane. -- Prince William and Kate Middleton have never been the stay-at-home types.
