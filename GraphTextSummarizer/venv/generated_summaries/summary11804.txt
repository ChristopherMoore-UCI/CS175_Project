We need to understand better how people are getting C. diff," said Dr. Cliff McDonald, a medical epidemiologist at the CDC. The CDC is so concerned that they're starting a new study to try to assess nationally whether people are getting C. diff in doctors' offices. The CDC study, published Wednesday in The New England Journal of Medicine, said 150,000 people who had not been in the hospital came down with C. diff in 2011. The CDC is hoping its new study will help determine cause and effect, because it's possible the patients had C. diff to begin with and went to the doctor to get help. Powerful broad-spectrum antibiotics wipe away good bacteria in your gut that fight off the bad bacteria, which leads the way to C. diff.
