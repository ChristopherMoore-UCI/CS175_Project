The new ENMAC Quran MQ3500 phone, launched last month in India, comes with Islam's holy book translated in 29 languages and a compass that directs users toward Mecca. An Indian company is hoping that among India's Muslims, it will be the new Quran mobile, a smartphone loaded with Islamic features. The $76 phone also features an Islamic calendar, downloaded holy books, a calculator for zakat (donation to charity) and an automatic ring silencer that can be set up for prayer times at mosques. More than 800 million Indians -- from the poorest rickshaw pullers to wealthy entrepreneurs -- own mobile phones. But for millions of other faithful, the Quran phone could just very well be the "in thing."
