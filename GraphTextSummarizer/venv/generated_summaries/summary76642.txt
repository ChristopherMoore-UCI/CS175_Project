The claims of military victories came a day after Sri Lanka ordered an end to combat operations against the rebels by curtailing "the use of heavy-caliber guns, combat aircraft and aerial weapons which could cause civilian causalities," a statement from the Presidential Secretariat said. Last week, India's foreign secretary and national security adviser met with Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa to express their concerns about the situation in the north, including casualties among civilians. The Sri Lankan military says up to 20,000 civilians continue to be held hostage by Tamil "terrorists," adding that its forces will continue humanitarian operations to rescue them. A rebel Web site, Tamilnet.com, reported an "intense barrage of heavy weapons" through Monday evening. India has a large Tamil population that sympathizes with the plight of Tamils in Sri Lanka.
