-- Gary David Goldberg, the writer and producer who created classic TV comedies "Family Ties" and "Spin City," has died, CNN has confirmed. Goldberg teamed up again with Fox in 1996 for the comedy "Spin City," which Goldberg co-created with Bill Lawrence. Goldberg contributed to "M*A*S*H," "The Tony Randall Show" and "The Bob Newhart Show" during the '70s before taking inspiration from his life and the lives of his friends to create "Family Ties." " Actress Courteney Cox, who played Lauren Miller on "Family Ties," also fondly remembers Goldberg as a supreme educator. "A wonderful man who taught me so much." Charlie Sheen, who worked with Goldberg on "Spin City," echoed that gratitude in his tweet, calling Goldberg his "sitcom mentor" and a "genius."
