Latino immigrant doctors have a harder time than other immigrants transitioning into the U.S. health system, according to Dowling. "I personally know at least 20 more (Latino immigrant) doctors who are delivering pizza, and instead they could be working as doctors if they had the help I had," say Chavez. Sanchez's story is common among Latino immigrant doctors. The IMG program provides test prep classes and clinical observations with UCLA doctors. Instead of treating patients, Dowling says, many doctors spend years cleaning houses or working on construction sites and in fast-food chain restaurants.
