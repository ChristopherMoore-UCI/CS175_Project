According to Suki Chung, workers in southern China are now worried about long-term job security, leading them to ask for more than just higher wages. China's massive manufacturing sector has slowed in recent months, and many companies have shifted production to China's inland provinces or countries with cheaper labor. "This is a result of the long-term exploitation of this big enterprise," said Suki Chung, the executive director of Hong Kong nonprofit Labor Action China. Workers have walked off the job at one of the world's largest shoe factories, leading apparel maker Adidas to temporarily shift its production. As many as 50,000 employees are on strike at Yue Yuen Industrial, a major Adidas and Nike supplier in the southern Chinese city of Dongguan.
