The initiative plans to broadcast millions of health messages every month to phones across South Africa. "This is the largest ever use of cell phones for health information," said Gustav Praekelt, one of the project's originators. In South Africa, more than 80 percent of the population has one -- the country has a population of 49 million, and it is estimated that 43 million have cell phones. -- One million free text messages will be sent every day for 12 months from Monday in South Africa in a bid to raise HIV awareness and encourage testing for the disease. The United Nations estimates that there are currently six million people living with HIV in South Africa and just one in 10 get the treatment they need.
