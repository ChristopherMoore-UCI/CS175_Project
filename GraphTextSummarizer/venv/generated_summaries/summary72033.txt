-- North Korea kept the world on tenterhooks Wednesday, when the funeral of leader Kim Jong Il was expected to take place in Pyongyang. As loved as he might be among the North Korean people, he said, "Kim Jong Il is no Kim Il Sung. While Kim Il Sung was 83 to Kim Jong Il's 69, the elder Kim was thought to be in excellent health. So could Kim Jong Il's 70th birthday on February 16 -- still within the mourning period -- or the 100th birthday of Kim Il Sung on April 15. On Wednesday morning, state television began broadcasting previously aired video of Kim Jong Il's son Kim Jong Un and other mourners paying respects in front of the late dictator as his corpse lay in state.
