"The community could be trucking for two weeks or two months, it just depends on the weather," according to Lower Colorado River Association spokeswoman Clara Tuma. "All outdoor watering is now prohibited and customers are strongly urged to cut out all nonessential use of water immediately," the company said in a news release on January 24. Two trucks filled with about 8,000 gallons of water reached Spicewood Beach Monday afternoon and the precious liquid was immediately pumped into community water tanks. "We're going to run out of water," resident Joe Barberra told CNN affiliate YNN Austin. Besides trucking in water, the LCRA is looking at other alternatives for water, including digging another well, Tuma said.
