In Italy, Inter Milan's hopes of qualifying for the second-tier Europa League suffered a blow as striker Diego Milito missed a penalty in Saturday's 2-2 draw at home to struggling Bologna. "The members were voting for the future of this club," said president Josep Maria Bartomeu, who was appointed after Sandro Rosell stood down in the wake of the Neymar revelations -- the club later paid an extra $18.5 million in taxes after being hit with fraud charges. Involved in a tense La Liga title race, locked in a Champions League battle with Atletico Madrid, facing a transfer ban due to alleged irregularities involving the signing of youth players, plus a tax investigation over the murky deal to buy Neymar -- it has been a testing season for the Catalan outfit. Before Saturday's 3-1 win at home to Real Betis, a big flag in the Camp Nou stated "Don't touch La Masia" -- a response to FIFA's punishment for infringing transfer rules relating to players under the age of 18. With star player Cristiano Ronaldo injured, record signing Gareth Bale took center stage with an opportunist long-range strike to put Real 2-0 up after Asier Illarramendi's opener.
