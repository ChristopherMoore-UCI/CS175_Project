Dumped unceremoniously by English soccer's most successful club Manchester United less than a season into his six-year deal, David Moyes is the new coach at Real Sociedad. And, crucially, Moyes seems to have grasped this idea of identity in his dealings with Sociedad president Jokin Aperribay. Ironically, after a defeat to Everton on his first return as United manager, Moyes was sacked in April, just 10 months after taking charge, with the club lying in seventh place. Despite that backing from Ferguson -- who won 13 Premier League titles and two European Champions League crowns during a trophy-littered spell -- Moyes lasted barely 10 months. The 51-year-old follows a pair of British managers to have coached Real Sociedad, based in the town of San Sebastian, 14 miles from the border with France on Spain's northern coast.
