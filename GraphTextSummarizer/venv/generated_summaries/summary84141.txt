By electing the libertarian Rand Paul to the U.S. Senate and a Democratic governor, Steve Beshear, who has implemented health care reform on the state level, Kentucky voters have proven that they are willing to elect politicians with a wide array of views. -- Democratic candidates who run from President Obama in red states where he is unpopular are making a big mistake. Having forthrightly identified herself as a Democrat, Grimes can go on to explain what kind of Democrat she is -- a Clinton Democrat, a moderate Democrat, a Kentucky Democrat, a Blue Dog Democrat, or simply a woman who has shown voters that she is wise and if elected, will work hard to put their interest first -- not simply try to score partisan points. Grimes is more than a match for incumbent Sen. Mitch McConnell. For an incumbent to be stuck below 50% is a danger sign, and Mitch McConnell is the ultimate incumbent -- a figure of Washington, D.C., not Kentucky.
