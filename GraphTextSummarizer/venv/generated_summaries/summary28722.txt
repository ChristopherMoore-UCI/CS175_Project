This should not be as much of a problem for newer devices, such as the iPhone 5, 4th generation iPad and iPad Mini, or the latest iPod Touch. Although iOS is coming out the same time as a pair of brand new iPhone models, it can also be installed for free on some older devices. Apple is releasing its latest operating system for the iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch today. The camera adds a square-photo option and new filters, while the photos app drops the map view and sorts your images into events by date and location. How is it different from what's already on my iPhone or iPad?
