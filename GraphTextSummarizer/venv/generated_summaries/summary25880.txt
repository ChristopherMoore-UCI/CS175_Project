Thousands of potential school crimes, including violent ones, have been averted on campuses across the country because students alerted school officials before the crime occurred. Students and families using a hot line in Colorado were credited with preventing more than 206 incidents of school violence from 2004-06. That lack of information has helped obscure the important roles that students and their responsive teachers play in preventing school violence. Students who know what to do when they witness school violence, or when they have a strong sense of impending violence, will become anonymous heroes. Chief among them is that school staff and security should patrol campuses, especially violence-prone areas, during and after school events.
