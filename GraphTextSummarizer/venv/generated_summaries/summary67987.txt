-- More than any other Republican lawmaker, Sen. Rand Paul has aggressively gone after nontraditional GOP voters in the past year, trying to lure Democrats and independents into his party's column as he considers a presidential bid. Rand Paul responds to GOP criticism of his foreign policy views His joke was the latest in a string of comments last week expressing frustration with the Obama administration over the Bergdahl swap. " Rand Paul criticizes the Clintons, urges GOP to engage minorities Six analysts agreed that Paul's comment is unlikely to have a long-term effect if he decides to run for president. " Paul is also trying to place daylight between himself and other potential Republican candidates, O'Connell continued, as the GOP still lacks a clear frontrunner for 2016. " Sometimes jokes can hurt a person politically if the comments mirror a deep-seated public fear about that individual, said presidential historian Doug Wead.
