Thursday morning, Chavez wrote on his twitter account, @chavezcandanga, "Good morning, happy World! Chavez, who recently admitted he is battling cancer, is no longer using the slogan that defined his first decade in power: "patria, socialismo o muerte" (motherland, socialism, or death). Since he returned from Cuba earlier this month after undergoing cancer treatment that included a surgery, Chavez has been using the slogan "viviremos y venceremos" -- we will live and we will come out victorious. Good morning, to Living! Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has a new populist slogan.
