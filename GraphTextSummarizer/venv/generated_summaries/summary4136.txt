After having the initial conviction overturned, Marissa Alexander was sentenced Monday to 65 days in jail on two counts of aggravated assault, with credit for time already served since her 2012 conviction. "She was sitting in prison with a 20-year sentence," one of her lawyers, Bruce Zimit, told CNN affiliate WJXT. Alexander said her husband had read cell phone text messages that she had written to her ex-husband, got angry and tried to strangle her. One of the prosecutors said she offered Alexander a plea bargain that would have resulted in a three-year prison sentence, but Alexander chose to take her chances at trial, where a conviction would bring an enhanced sentence for the use of a firearm. Authorities said Alexander needed to be prosecuted because she fired in the direction of a room where children were standing.
