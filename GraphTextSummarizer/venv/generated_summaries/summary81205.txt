"Mr. Karzai is under a lot of pressure right now," said Mahmoud Saiqal, a former deputy foreign minister who served as a diplomat for several years under President Karzai. President Karzai has faced a drumbeat of criticism from Western governments in recent months, urging the Afghan government to crack down on corruption. In private conversations, Western diplomats often accuse Ahmad Wali Karzai of having links to Afghanistan's booming opium industry, charges Karzai routinely denies. At the time of the overthrow of the Taliban, nearly nine years ago, Mahmood Karzai ran several Afghan restaurants in the United States. "The question is ...is this a pressure tactic that's being used on the part of the American diplomatic corps to get a more vigorous response to the corruption question?" In his phone interview with CNN, businessman Mahmood Karzai said he had not yet been contacted by American officials regarding the reported investigations, but vowed to cooperate fully with U.S. prosecutors if they came calling.
