"Every fireman on the scene was, 'You're not going to believe this guy -- he came out of a ladder out of his master bedroom wearing a SCUBA tank, a SCUBA mask and a snorkel,'" said Phoenix Fire Captain Jeff Peabody. Early July 5, 2009, fire engulfed Marin's Biltmore home. " Marin's brick wall proved to be his 10,000 square-foot home in the Biltmore Estates, an exclusive enclave in Phoenix. Late Monday or early Tuesday, Marin's adult son received a delayed e-mail from his father "telling him that if things don't go good in court, Marin's wills are in place and his car can be found at a Mesa location," Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio told reporters. Investigators determined that Marin had ordered the quick-acting poison -- typically used in agriculture and gold mining -- from a California-based company and that it was delivered by FedEx to his home in 2011.
