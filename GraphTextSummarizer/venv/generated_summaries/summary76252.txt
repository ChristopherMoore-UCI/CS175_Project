While consumer price inflation numbers were a little brighter, with the headline nationwide index rising 0.5 per cent year-on-year, core CPI in Tokyo (excluding food and energy) fell by 1 per cent in April from a year earlier, deteriorating from -0.9 per cent in March. Industrial production rose a less-than-expected 1 per cent in March from February, while manufacturers said they planned to cut output by as much as 4.1 per cent in May. "While it is positive that the BoJ acted, it is not sufficient to recover its long-lost credibility as an inflation-fighter," said Takuji Okubo, chief Japan economist at Société Générale. It also kept interest rates at between zero and 0.1 per cent. In February the central bank surprised markets by adding Y10tn to its asset-purchasing programme while adopting a firmer goal for inflation of 1 per cent, touching off a fall in the yen.
