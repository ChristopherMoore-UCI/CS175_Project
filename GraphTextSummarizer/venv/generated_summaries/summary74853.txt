Hosting one of the largest gatherings of African Leaders in Washington, the U.S. is showing the world -- and sending a signal to its closest rival, China -- that it can and will have African influence, which it can convert into commercial opportunities that can translate to receipts. If President Obama can create real tangible jobs, then the U.S. can start to claw back China's grip on the African continent -- whoever builds Africa's infrastructure, provide cheap products for African markets and loans to support government initiatives will have influence over African affairs. If the U.S. pushes for better African governance, enforcement will be difficult. If the U.S calls for trade opportunities to be linked to better, open and transparent democracies then it will be possible for U.S. businesses to make the commercial advances on the African continent. As the Ebola virus spreads across West Africa, many Africans are relying on the U.S. to support failing and fragile health care structures in the areas of financing, technology and science as a bridge to halting the spread of this deadly virus.
