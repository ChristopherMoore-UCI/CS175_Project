Guidroz, 57, has been charged with first-degree manslaughter after he confessed to the crime, said Pierce County Prosecutor Mark Lindquist on Tuesday. Guidroz buried Wallace near the Tacoma waterfront and then called police to report him missing, prosecutors said. There were "several inconsistencies in Guidroz's account of the events from the day Wallace went missing," the release said. Guidroz resurfaced in Louisiana in March 2011 after reports that he had been charged in the killing of his wife, who is not the mother of Wallace. Miller traveled to Louisiana to question Guidroz about Wallace's disappearance.
