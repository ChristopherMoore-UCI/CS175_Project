" Researchers were amazed to discover a colossal 100 kilometer (62 miles) stretch of phytoplankton blooming under Arctic ice, north of Alaska, in July last year. If someone had asked me before the expedition whether we would see under-ice blooms, I would have told them it was impossible," said ICESCAPE mission leader Kevin Arrigo of Stanford University, at a press conference announcing the publication of findings in "Science" this month. It had previously been assumed that sea ice blocked the sunlight necessary for the growth of marine plants. -- Scientists in the Arctic have discovered the largest ever under-ice bloom of phytoplankton, likening the discovery to "finding the Amazon rainforest in the middle of the Mojave Desert. Scientists now believe that pools of melting ice actually function like skylights and magnifying glasses, focusing sunlight into sea water, providing the perfect conditions for the intense phytoplankton bloom, which makes the water look like pea soup.
