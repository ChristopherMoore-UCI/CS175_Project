The vast majority were from Prescott, said Wade Ward with the Prescott Fire Department. "In normal circumstances, when you're digging fire line, you make sure you have a good escape route, and you have a safety zone set up," Morrison said. State forestry official Art Morrison said the firefighters were members of a "hotshot" crew, tasked with digging a fire line and creating an escape route. The fire has grown to 1,000 acres, damaged three homes and forced the evacuations of residents in the communities of Peeples Valley and Yarnell, Morrison said. " The crew was fighting the Yarnell Hill fire, which broke out Friday northwest of Phoenix.
