Days after the execution, Jang's wife suffered her third stroke, according to Kang Myung-do, a defector who was son-in-law to North Korea's ex-Prime Minister, Kang Sun San. The aunt of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un suffered a fatal stroke while she was on the phone with him, arguing about her husband's execution, according to a defector from the secretive nation. Kim Kyung Hee was the sister of Kim Jong Il, the North Korean leader who died three years ago and left his son in power. She was on the phone with the North Korean leader when she suffered the stroke, Kang said. "In the seething period of the effort for building a thriving country last year, we took the resolute measure of removing the factionalists," the North Korean leader said in a New Year's address shortly after the execution.
