According to recent OECD figures, Japan has some of the most highly educated women in the world, yet ranks among the bottom of developed countries when it comes to employing women with college degrees; only 69% are in the workforce. Japan has more government debt than any other developed nation -- nearly 230% of its GDP according to the CIA World Fact Book -- and has struggled to sustain steady economic growth. From the 12th century until the mid 19th century, Japan was a feudal society dominated by military leaders known as shoguns. Some conservative elements in Japan suggest there remains insufficient evidence to prove that the military directly recruited women as sex slaves. Despite the country's financial challenges, compounded by an ageing population, Japan has some of the world's most valuable companies and remains a source of global innovation and cultural trends.
