-- Spanish airline Spanair went bust early Saturday, forcing many passengers to find seats on flights with other airlines at short notice. A spokeswoman at Madrid's Barajas Airport said there were not large numbers of stranded passengers there, and that other airlines have been able to get passengers on to other flights. Normally there would have been 27 outbound Spanair flights from the airport Saturday, and passengers on 15 of them have been able to get other flights with other companies, the spokesman said. Iberia "has implemented a contingency plan, deploying a large team that is now working intensely to help resolve this situation on the best possible terms for Spanair customers." Spanair, which is headquartered in Barcelona, said those who were due to fly with it should get in touch via phone or its website for more information.
