But in its April decision in McCutcheon v. FEC, the Supreme Court struck down limits on the overall campaign contributions individual donors can make to candidates, political parties and political action committees. Meredith McGehee, policy director at The Campaign Legal Center, a non-partisan organization that analyzes campaign finance laws, said she hopes there are enough provisions in the bill that raise the ire of enough Democrats and Republicans to stop it, otherwise it candidates will now be in the business of asking for even larger donations than they already are. A proposal to let rich donors give more money to political parties - slipped behind closed doors into a huge government spending bill -- is the latest in a string of setbacks for restrictions on money in politics and will  be a "disaster for the American people," according to good government groups. One campaign finance reform advocate noted that if these provisions become law, mega-donors who would have maxed out on individual contributions will have to hold onto their seats in the face of a flood of new "asks" from politicians and parties. The fear is that allowing more big money in politics places more power in the hands of big donors, effectively taking it away from individual voters.
