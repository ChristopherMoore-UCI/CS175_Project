The British police practice of keeping DNA records of anyone they arrest is a human rights violation, The European Court of Human Rights ruled unanimously Thursday. The European Court of Human Rights says the UK should not be keeping DNA records of everyone they arrest. It ruled the British practice was a violation of the "right to respect for private and family life" under Article 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights. "The government mounted a robust defense before the court, and I strongly believe DNA and fingerprints play an invaluable role in fighting crime and bringing people to justice. " "DNA and fingerprinting is vital to the fight against crime, providing the police with more than 3,500 matches a month," she said in a statement released by the Home Office Thursday.
