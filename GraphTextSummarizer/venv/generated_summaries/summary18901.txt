Tiger Woods finished third on 18-under par thanks to a final round 66 with Phil Mickelson (66) and Dustin Johnson (70) tied for fourth on 14 under. The victory takes McIlroy's career tally of PGA Tour victories to five, three of which have come this season. The 14-time major winner picked up $544,000, helping him become the first player to surpass $100 million in PGA Tour earnings. McIlroy, who regained the world No.1 spot with victory in last month's U.S.PGA Championship, surged to the top of the leaderboard early on in his final round, firing five birdies on the opening nine. The Northern Irishman finished on 20-under par, one stroke in front of overnight leader Louis Oosthuizen, who fired a final round 71.
