A landslide information and relief effort Facebook page has also been set up with information on relief efforts and how residents can find resources. Additional updates can also be found on their slide news and resources page. The United Way of Snohomish County has also established a recovery fund for mudslide relief. All donations are tax deductible and 100% of the money will go towards local disaster relief. The Salvation Army also has volunteers on the ground - with plans to help restoration efforts going forward.
