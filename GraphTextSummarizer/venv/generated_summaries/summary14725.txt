I wasn't really afraid," a man walking his dog in downtown Los Angeles less than an hour after the quake told CNN affiliate KTLA. A 4.4-magnitude earthquake shook the Los Angeles area on Monday morning, jolting some people awake just before sunrise but bringing no immediate reports of serious damage. Geophysicist Paul Caruso said that significant damage or casualties generally wouldn't be expected with earthquakes weaker than a 5.5 magnitude, though results vary by region, often depending on construction codes and types of rock that exist underground. The quake, centered about 6 miles north-northwest of Westwood and about 15 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles, happened at 6:25 a.m., the U.S. Geological Survey said. " The USGS's online ShakeMap showed that strong to moderate shaking would have been felt near the epicenter, with lighter vibrations felt in Los Angeles proper.
