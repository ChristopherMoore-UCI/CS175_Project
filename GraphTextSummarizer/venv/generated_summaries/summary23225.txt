The troops staged their rebellion on the second day of BDR Week, when officers and troops from various BDR outposts along the border were in the capital for celebrations. The BDR is a paramilitary force distinct from the army, but its commanders are career army officers. Discontent had been bubbling for years in the ranks of the BDR, who complained their army superiors dismissed their appeals for more pay, subsidized food and their requests to participate in United Nations peacekeeping operations -- which pay far more than what they make at home. The standoff started Wednesday when BDR troops rebelled against their commanders. Fifty of the dead were confirmed to be army officers, shot or stabbed to death.
