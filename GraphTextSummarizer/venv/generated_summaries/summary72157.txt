Wilson died Thursday at Piedmont Medical Center in Rock Hill, South Carolina. "He was a good man," said Christopher Hope Wilson Sr., Wilson's son. Wilson came to national attention when he publicly apologized to Georgia Rep. John Lewis. "Maybe Mr. Wilson will inspire others to come forth," Lewis said. He and his friends attacked Lewis at a bus station in South Carolina some 50 years ago.
