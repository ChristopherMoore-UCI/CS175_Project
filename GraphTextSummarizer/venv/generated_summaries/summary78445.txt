Although the Southeast was lucky in landfalls in 2010, the lack of rainfall that usually accumulates during hurricane season is expected to intensify the drought situation in the region. That makes 2010 the third busiest season when considering all named storms, and second busiest season on record when considering hurricanes. The good fortune of relatively minimal impact on the United States in spite of 19 storms, 12 of which were hurricane and 5 of which were category 3 or 4, will serve as yet another reminder that from a hurricane readiness viewpoint, one must prepare every season as if a major hurricane will impact them," said Bill Read, director of the National Hurricane Center. Jack Hayes, director of the National Weather Service, said the season's forecast was a success. "We can have quiet seasons overall that are devastating to communities, and very busy seasons like this one with hardly any U.S. impacts," said James Franklin, branch chief of the Hurricane Specialist Unit at the National Hurricane Center.
