Speaking to reporters at the Asian Cup last month, Salman said: "The period best suited for hosting the 2022 World Cup in Qatar will be in November and December because for sure it needs to be played in the winter." FifPro, the players' union, is keen on a winter World Cup on health and safety grounds but still expresses reservations surrounding a number of human rights issues associated with staging the tournament in Qatar. "The prospect of a winter World Cup is neither workable nor desirable for European domestic football," an English Premier League (EPL) spokesman told CNN ahead of the announcement. Prior to Tuesday's announcement, Shaikh Salman bin Ebrahim Al Khalifa, who is head of the Asian Football Confederation and also leads the task force, had stated his belief the 2022 World Cup would take place in November/December. There are still seven years to go until the World Cup in Qatar so domestic leagues will have time to make plans to avoid as much disruption to their season as possible, but a switch to November and December is likely to provide a major headache for top-flight leagues and clubs.
