Now she's a big supporter of the program, which places holiday wreaths on his gravestone and the resting places of other war dead at Arlington National Cemetery. Thanks to a surge in donations, wreaths will cover more than half the gravestones at Arlington this year. Two weeks ago the group Wreaths Across America only had enough money for 95,000 wreaths at Arlington, far short of its goal of 135,000, said Amber Caron, Wreaths Across America spokeswoman. Caron said the ultimate goal is to cover every gravestone in Arlington, which is marking its 150th anniversary next year. Last year, more than 400,000 wreaths were donated -- 100,000 to Arlington alone -- and placed at cemeteries in all 50 states.
