Its political landscape has been characterized by chronic squabbling between numerous parties across the political spectrum, which has thwarted attempts to form stable governments and reform its political system. This has often resulted in a weak coalition government, with a number of parties vying for control. But many countries where voting systems regularly produce minority or coalition governments seem to manage their economies perfectly adequately. Discussions between parties often take place prior to an election because of a general acceptance that no one party is capable of an outright majority. Elsewhere in the world, Israel has always been governed by alliances between its various parties, with power traditionally alternating between a center-right-led Likud government in coalition with several right-wing and religious parties and periods of rule by the center-left Labor in coalition with several left-wing parties.
