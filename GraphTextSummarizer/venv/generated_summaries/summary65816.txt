The deaths have shaken residents on popular holiday island, which takes up only 21 square kilometers (8 square miles) amid bright blue waters in the Gulf of Thailand. Provincial police chief Kiatthipong Khaosumarng said that experts carried out the tests on DNA samples from 11 migrants working on the island and two British brothers, one of whom had shared a room with the male victim. Police had previously asked the two British brothers, Christopher and James Ware, not to leave Thailand, saying they were "under watch." Kiatthipong declined to comment on reports that the two brothers have now been allowed to leave Thailand. Police are now trying to find other people who were caught on surveillance video the night the two tourists -- Hannah Witheridge, 23 and David Miller, 24 -- were killed, he said.
