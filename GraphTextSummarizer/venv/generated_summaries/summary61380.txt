This 5.1-magnitude tremor was about the same distance from Tokyo as the first and about 107 kilometers (66 miles) east of Miyako -- which was among the areas devastated by the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami -- according to the U.S. Geological Survey. -- A 6.2-magnitude earthquake struck off Japan's eastern coast early Tuesday, the U.S. Geological Survey reported. Tuesday's second quake was much deeper than the first, rooted about 38 kilometers (23.6 miles) below sea level. With a depth of 9 kilometers (5.6 miles), the tremor was about 96 kilometers (almost 60 miles) east-northeast of Miyako and 550 kilometers (342 miles) north-northeast of Tokyo, according to the U.S. agency. A little more than 30 minutes after this first earthquake, another significant, if slightly weaker one, hit the same general area.
