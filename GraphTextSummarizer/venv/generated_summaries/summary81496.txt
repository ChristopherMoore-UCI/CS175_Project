CNN announced Wednesday that it will premiere a new, "unconventional" weekend show hosted by comedian D.L. Hughley. "D.L. Hughley Breaks the News," as the show is currently titled, will feature Hughley's humorous take on the week's events. The show will resemble the late-night talk shows of Jay Leno and David Letterman more than Jon Stewart's "Daily Show," according to Hughley. "D.L. Hughley Breaks the News" is scheduled to debut Saturday, October 25. -- When news breaks, D.L. Hughley will be ready to mock it.
