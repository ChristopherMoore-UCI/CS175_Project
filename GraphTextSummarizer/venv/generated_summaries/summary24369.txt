At least seven possible tornadoes were reported Tuesday in eastern Florida as  Tropical Storm Fay battered parts of the state with high winds and heavy rain, the National Hurricane Center said. "This storm is going to be with us for a while," said Florida Gov. Charlie Crist. At midday, the hurricane center issued two tornado warnings -- for St. Lucie and Indian River counties, and tornado watches were in effect for several areas, most of them ending at 4 p.m. A possible twister hit Wellington in Palm Beach County, where the violent weather ripped a small barn off its foundation and left a horse standing unhurt on a concrete slab, authorities said. For residents in Punta Gorda, in southwest Florida, the storm and its trail of damage are a reminder of  the devastation from Hurricane Charley in 2004. " A hurricane watch has been issued for Florida's east coast, from north of Flagler Beach to Altamaha Sound.
