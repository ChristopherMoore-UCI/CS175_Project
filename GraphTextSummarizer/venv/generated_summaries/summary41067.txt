The EPA notes in an accompanying report released Friday that global warming could make ozone pollution worse in some parts of the United States. "This finding confirms that greenhouse gas pollution is a serious problem," EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson said. "This finding confirms that greenhouse gas pollution is a serious problem now and for future generations," EPA Administrator Lisa P. Jackson said in a release, later adding, "The science clearly shows that concentrations of these gases are at unprecedented levels as a result of human emissions, and these high levels are very likely the cause of the increase in average temperatures and other changes in our climate." " But critics say the finding will just produce a "glorious mess." "Today's action by the EPA is the beginning of a regulatory barrage that will destroy jobs, raise energy prices for consumers and undermine America's global competitiveness," said Sen. James Inhofe, R-Oklahoma, the ranking member on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. The EPA announcement comes amid efforts by Congress to enact a limit on global warming pollution.
