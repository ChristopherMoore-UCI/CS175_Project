The top ranking is at stake in the men's game when Rafael Nadal meets Novak Djokovic in Sunday's French Open final. A bad back and Stanislas Wawrinka, likely in that order of significance, stalled Nadal in January's Australian Open final. Djokovic stretched Nadal to five sets last year in the last four, undone by a freak occurrence when he touched the net deep in the fifth. Their historic 41-match rivalry has seen streaks of the roller-coaster variety, and second-ranked Djokovic is the man in the ascendancy at the moment, capturing four straight tussles including the final of the Rome Masters last month. Djokovic broke near the end of the fourth set and to his relief served out the match comfortably to achieve a second French Open final.
