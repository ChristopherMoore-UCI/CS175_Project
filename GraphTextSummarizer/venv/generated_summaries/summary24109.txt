"Epstein required Jane Doe #3 to have sexual relations with Dershowitz on numerous occasions while she was a minor, not only in Florida but also on private planes, in New York, New Mexico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands," the filing states. The court filing last week claims that Roberts "was forced to have sexual relations" with the prince in London, New York and on Epstein's private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Roberts and another woman are seeking to join two other women who are arguing in federal court for the U.S. government to take a fresh look at its case involving Jeffrey Epstein, who pleaded guilty some years ago in Florida to a state charge of prostitution solicitation. Prominent U.S. attorney Alan Dershowitz, facing a similar accusation, did the same in a CNN interview. "We intend only to litigate the relevant issues in Court and not to play into any sideshow attempted by anyone," Roberts' attorney Brad Edwards said in an email to CNN on Friday after Dershowitz was quoted elsewhere in the media making similar remarks.
