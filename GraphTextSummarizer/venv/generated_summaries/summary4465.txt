"Syria and Iraq are badly in need of water but our Iraqi brothers feel the need much more ... it is why this meeting is so important," Turkey's official Anatolian Agency quoted Syrian Irrigation Minister Nader al-Bounni as saying at the start of Thursday's tri-partite meeting to address water resources. Over the past decade, some environmental and political analysts have written about the scenario of a "water war" possibly breaking out in the Middle East as countries affected by climate change compete over dwindling access to fresh water. Iraq is suffering a drought that its officials are calling a "catastrophe." Baghdad and Damascus want Turkey, where the source of the Tigris and Euphrates is located, to increase the flow of water passing through its network of dams. "Water is not plenty in Turkey, and therefore we cannot exceed the determined amount too much." Turkey provided Syria and Iraq 500 cubic meters of water a second, Yildiz said.
