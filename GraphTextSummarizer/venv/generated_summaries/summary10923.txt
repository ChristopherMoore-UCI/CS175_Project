Schwartzel played on the Royal Johannesburg and Kensington club's West Course, while Mulroy and Elson carded 64s on the more testing East Course. The 26-year-old, seeking his sixth European Tour title, fired a flawless 10-birdie effort to claim a tie for the lead with fellow South African Garth Mulroy and England's Jamie Elson at the halfway stage. The tournament finally began on Friday morning, with American golfer Ryan Palmer seeking to become the fourth player to defend his title at Waialae. The world No. 32 is the highest-ranked player in the co-sanctioned Sunshine Tour event. Joseph Bramlett, the first African-American golfer to get through qualifying school since 1985, is one of 27 rookies making PGA Tour debuts.
