For District Attorney Sam Sutter, prosecuting fallen NFL football star Aaron Hernandez carries a kind of pressure unprecedented in his six years of service. A crush of cameras and journalists follows Hernandez, the former New England Patriots tight end, each time he appears in court, including Thursday, when a grand jury indicted him on a first-degree murder charge in the execution-style shooting death of friend Odin Lloyd. Authorities have said Hernandez, Carlos Ortiz and Wallace picked Lloyd up from his Boston apartment. The grand jury also has indicted Tanya Singleton, Hernandez' cousin, for contempt of court. Co-defendant Ernest Wallace, who was allegedly in the car with Hernandez the night Lloyd was killed, also was indicted.
