Alexander Nicholson, executive director of Servicemembers United, said the Navy "undoubtedly did the right thing in reversing its decision," made in March, to discharge Jones, who dozed off beside another male sailor while watching television on February 5. Jones hired civilian attorney Gary Myers, a former JAG officer who is one of the most experienced civilian military defense attorneys in the country, to fight his discharge, and Servicemembers United worked closely with Jones and Myers to help publicize the case and persuade Navy leaders to retain Jones, according to the Servicemembers United statement. He then woke up his friend, Navy Petty Officer Bryan McGee, who, according to Jones, immediately left the room. Petty Officer Stephen Jones, who is stationed at the Naval Nuclear Power Training Command in Charleston, South Carolina, has said that the Navy's effort to discharge him for "unprofessional conduct" was a trumped-up charge based on the command's suspicion that he might be gay. Jones, who says nothing sexual happened, said that they were both clothed -- him in pajama pants and a white T-shirt and McGee in boxers -- and that they were not under the covers together.
