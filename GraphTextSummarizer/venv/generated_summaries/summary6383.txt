Complicating firefighters' efforts was a thunderstorm, which brought little rain, but kicked up strong winds, said Brett Haberstick, an incident command spokesman. -- Firefighters on Friday battled a massive wildfire that has so far claimed more than 100 homes in northern Colorado. Nick Christensen, an executive officer with the Larimer County Sheriff's Office, said Friday that 112 homes have been destroyed. Helicopters flew back and forth Friday, dousing the flames with water. Hundreds of firefighters have arrived from across the United States to help local departments.
