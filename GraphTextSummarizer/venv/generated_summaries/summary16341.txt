"We can provide resources, but there must be ownership by the Haitians themselves and especially by the Haitian authorities," Dominique Strauss-Kahn said during an exclusive interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour. Sachs said Haiti needs a sustained international effort coordinated not by the U.S. government but by an organization such as the Inter-American Development Bank. -- Haitians have to be in the driver's seat as they try to rebuild their shattered country after last week's devastating earthquake, the head of the International Monetary Fund told CNN Friday. His comments came three days before an international donors' conference in Montreal, Canada, that will raise money for Haiti and look at long-term prospects for recovery. Repeating his call for some kind of Marshall Plan like the one that rebuilt Western Europe after World War II, Strauss-Kahn said, "We need to have the entire international community working together -- I call it a Marshall Plan."
