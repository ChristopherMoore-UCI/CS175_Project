If you love someone on Facebook but don't love the new Facebook.com/us pages, here's more news, however, that might bother you: It's impossible to get rid of them. This means the person viewing the friendship page may see each post elsewhere on Facebook, like on either friend's timeline or in news feed. "As a reminder, selecting to 'hide' an object from your timeline or friendship page does not remove it from Facebook, and the object may show up in other places such as news feed. If you would like to remove a story you posted from Facebook altogether, you can do so by selecting delete post or untagging yourself from photos." "Mr. Zuckerberg: by all means keep giving people new tools -- as you did when you created Facebook," she wrote, referring to Facebook's co-founder, Mark Zuckerberg.
