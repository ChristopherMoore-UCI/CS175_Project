This time it's for disorderly conduct, possession of marijuana and for carrying a gun, Atlanta police said. Officers approached the friend -- later identified as Radric Davis, which is Gucci Mane's real name -- and began speaking with him. The arrest took place early Saturday morning on an Atlanta street after a man flagged down officers who said he was concerned about the way his friend was acting. In March, Mane was arrested for hitting a man over the head with a champagne bottle at an Atlanta night club. In 2010, he was arrested in Atlanta for violating a number of traffic laws.
