-- Attorney General Eric Holder made clear Thursday that the Obama administration recognizes the authority of federal courts, including the Supreme Court, to rule on whether the 2010 health care reform law or any other laws passed by Congress are constitutional. Nevertheless, Smith and Judges Emilio Garza and Leslie Southwick then ordered the Justice Department to submit by noon Thursday Texas time a three-page, single-spaced letter addressing whether the Obama administration believes courts do indeed enjoy that power. Carney said it was "preposterous" to suggest Obama does not respect the power of courts to rule on the constitutionality of legislation. The declaration by Holder came in a letter to a federal appeal's court that had ordered the government to respond by Thursday in a legal and political spat over the health care law championed by President Barack Obama.
