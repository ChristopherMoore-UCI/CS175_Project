Radovan Stankovic was convicted in Bosnia in November 2006 for crimes against humanity, including rape, sexual assault and enslavement of women and young girls during Bosnia's 1992-1995 war. "I hope that this arrest reflects an increased commitment of the authorities of Bosnia and Herzegovina to support the process of bringing to justice those responsible for the grave crimes committed on their territory in the early 1990s. -- Bosnian police have recaptured a former member of Serb paramilitary forces who escaped from prison nearly five years ago, authorities said. "Today's apprehension of Stankovic significant for the victims of the grave crimes he has been convicted for," the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia said in a statement Saturday. He escaped from a Bosnian prison in May 2007.
