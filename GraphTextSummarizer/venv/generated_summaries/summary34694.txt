"A4A strongly opposes TSA's elimination of the regulatory regime that rejects congressional intent by removing the cap on the TSA fee increase per enplanement as it will disproportionately harm airline passengers who rely on service to small and rural communities." Passengers flying round-trip with a connection each way will see their fees increase $1.20 to $11.20 per round trip, versus $10 before the fee increase. The trade group Airlines for America has generally objected to government raising more funds from airline passenger travel and specifically objected to this fee increase and the elimination of the fee cap. Southwest Airlines added the fee to its list of taxes and fees charged to customers starting today. "Southwest customers can view a complete fare breakdown at the time of purchase, which includes the current security fee." Delta Air Lines and United Airlines, which both declined to comment, also appear to be putting the entire cost on passengers.
