Okinawa, where multiple U.S. military facilities are situated, regularly finds itself in the path of big typhoons. "This is a beast," said CNN International Meteorologist Tom Sater. But it could still be producing strong winds late Wednesday when it's forecast to hit Kyushu, the southernmost of Japan's main islands. "It'll brush Okinawa -- maybe Category 1, Category 2 winds," Sater said. The Japan Meteorological Agency on Monday issued an emergency warning for the region around Miyako Jima, a small Japanese island that lies between Okinawa and Taiwan.
