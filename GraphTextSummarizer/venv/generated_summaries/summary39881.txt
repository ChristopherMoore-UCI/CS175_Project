Two women have accused Assange of sexually assaulting them in August 2010 when he was visiting Sweden in connection with a WikiLeaks release of internal U.S. military documents. Its founder, Julian Assange, was arrested in Britain in 2010 over allegations of rape and sex crime charges in Sweden. Assange has been fighting extradition ever since, saying the allegations are retribution for his organization's disclosure of American secrets. It has also published hundreds of thousands of classified U.S. documents relating to the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. A representative for the WikiLeaks founder said Assange will not honor a notice that British police served him requiring that he surrender to authorities.
