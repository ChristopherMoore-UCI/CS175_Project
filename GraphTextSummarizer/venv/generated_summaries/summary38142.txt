About one-third of Facebook's 750 million active users worldwide access the service via mobile phones. If you use Wi-Fi on your phone, depending on how your mobile browser or Facebook app handles security, someone might snoop on your login credentials ("sidejacking") and use them to impersonate you on Facebook. Sidejacking is a Wi-Fi-related risk for many online services, not just Facebook. " MobileActive's guide did not address third-party services (such as PicPlz) that can be used to post photos or video to Facebook, Foursquare and other services. MobileActive notes that some older or more primitive browsers (probably including many browsers that come pre-installed on feature phones) may revert the connection to "http," which is not secure.
