Ultron was a sentient robot who was the creation of a scientist named Dr. Henry Pym — also known as Ant-Man, which means Avengers 2 will likely introduce the hero of Edgar Wright's upcoming Marvel movie. So will Hank Pym actually NOT be part of Ultron's story? Might we see Marvel retcon this bit of lore to make Tony Stark the creator of Ultron. But Age of Ultron was also the name of an apocalyptic series of comics by Brian Michael Bendis that was published this year, featuring the robot villain taking over the entire planet and leaving it in ruins, while superheroes turn refugee and hide away while plotting a counter-attack. One thing is certain — the movie can't be totally faithful to the books, which prominently feature Wolverine and Spider-Man, among other heroes that are licensed to other studios.
