The Downadup or Conficker worm exploits a bug in Microsoft Windows to infect mainly corporate networks, where -- although it has yet to cause any harm -- it potentially exposes infected PCs to hijack. These will be machines that have not installed a patch from Microsoft known as MS08-067. It is a Windows worm and almost all the cases are corporate networks. Mikko Hypponen, chief research officer at anti-virus firm F-Secure, says while the purpose of the worm is unclear, its unique "phone home" design, linking back to its point of origin, means it can receive further orders to wreak havoc. The worm will also scan company networks trying to guess your password, trying hundreds and hundreds of common words.
