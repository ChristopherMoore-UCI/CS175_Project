French lawmakers voted Wednesday in favor of making it an offense to pay for sex, a move toward criminalizing use of prostitutes. He said he was backing the law on two grounds: "on the one hand, the fight against mafia and pimping, on the other hand, social protection and help for prostitutes to reintegrate." According to the draft bill, research suggests that there are about 20,000 prostitutes in France, of whom 85% are women. At the same time, 99% of the clients are men. Prostitution is currently legal in France for both the prostitute and the client.
