Montreal and Quebec City have their own haute cuisine scenes With almost no outside interference, Montreal has forged its own strange culinary identity, bringing formal French education and homegrown ingredients to rich, meat-heavy Quebec staples. Quebec's biggest party is also when it's coldest Carnaval du Quebec is held every February in Quebec City, the provincial capital, and the success and sheer size of the event is a testament to Quebecers' defiance toward the cold. In Quebec City, where the cooking scene is more youthful, there's a fierce commitment to using only made-in-Quebec ingredients. The roads are in bad shape Blame the weather, the materials used or government ineptitude, but Quebec roads don't seem to hold up as well as those of their American or Ontarian neighbors. Because cooking school is subsidized by the provincial government, trained chefs in Quebec tend to come from more diverse backgrounds.
