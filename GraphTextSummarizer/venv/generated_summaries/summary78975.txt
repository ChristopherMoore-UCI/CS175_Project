-- Gen. David Petraeus, the outgoing top commander of the NATO forces in Afghanistan, formally  transferred authority Monday to incoming commander Marine Corps Gen.  John Allen. On Monday, three service members with the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force were killed in a blast in eastern Afghanistan. "Throughout, we will keep our eyes on the horizon -- the future  of Afghanistan, " Allen told the audience, " a nation of free people at  peace, governed under its constitution, pursuing economic enterprise and  development, in a secure and stable environment free from the extremism and  terrorism that has plagued this wonderful country and its people for more than a  generation. He took over in Afghanistan on July 4 last year  unexpectedly after a Rolling Stone magazine article prompted the  resignation of Gen. Stanley McChrystal. He inherits a force that is coming under renewed attack just as NATO prepares to begin the first phase of handing over provincial security to Afghan security forces.
