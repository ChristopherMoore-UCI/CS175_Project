But in the end, a 15-inch beagle named Miss P strutted away with the Best in Show award at the 139th Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show on Tuesday night. Among the other finalists: Portuguese water dog Matisse, the cousin of Obama's dog Sunny. So was the famed pooch of kidnapped heiress, bank robber and actress Patty Hearst. Miss P also defeated Rocket, the shih tzu co-owned by Hearst. The award-winning cousin of President Obama's dog was in the mix.
