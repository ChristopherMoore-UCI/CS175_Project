Talks will resume next week on the future of Iran's nuclear program with the goal of beginning to draft a comprehensive agreement in May, a senior Obama administration official said on Friday. The administration has communicated to all parties that violating limits on Iran's oil exports could trigger new economic sanctions. New concerns have also been raised over reports that Russia is laying the groundwork for an oil-for-goods deal with Iran, which could violate the terms of the interim agreement and derail future talks. While officials in Washington are optimistic that negotiations are progressing on track, a number of significant potential roadblocks need to be worked through if a long-term agreement is to be reached. The next round of negotiations will seek to build on the work that has been done since January, when an interim deal between Iran and the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council took effect.
