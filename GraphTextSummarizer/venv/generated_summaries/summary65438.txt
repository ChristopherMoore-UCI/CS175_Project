FIFA presidential hopeful Luis Figo is selling, but can he tempt 209 football federations to buy into his campaign to topple Sepp Blatter? "After many conversations with football leaders, one of the consistent themes fed back to me is the way FIFA currently distributes revenues to its member associations is very inefficient and ineffective -- especially for developing football across all associations," said Figo at a media conference to launch his campaign at Wembley Stadium. "By increasing the number of teams participating in the World Cup, we not only make sure that we include more countries from across the world, but also enable FIFA to raise significant increased revenues that can be used to invest in the growth of the game globally. Ethical issues arguably have been a bit of minefield for FIFA in recent years and Figo pledged to "lead by example, with the highest ethical and moral standards." Figo's "For Football Manifesto" promised that 50% of FIFA's revenues -- $2.5 billion -- would be handed to the national associations over four years to help fund global grassroots football development.
