-- A chain link fence now stands between Tim Lambert's land and the impact site of United Airlines Flight 93, which crashed here on September 11, 2001. "If I knew the National Park Service was going to be able to use eminent domain to acquire property within the park boundary, I would had fought that at the time the park boundary was established to keep as much property out of the park as possible," Musser says. That is where Randy and Linda Musser live -- on more than 100 acres of land, 62 of  them within the memorial park boundaries. "We've held off using it until we've got here, really at the very last stage of this where we have no other choice," says National Park Service associate director Steve Whitesell. "This eminent domain cloud hangs over this whole piece of property now," Randy Musser says, standing by a pond where he likes to fish.
