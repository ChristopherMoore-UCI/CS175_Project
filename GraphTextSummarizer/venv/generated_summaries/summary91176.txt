"We've been working very closely with the Korean government since we had the initial claims," said Lt. Gen. John Johnson, who is heading the Camp Carroll Task Force. Two of his fellow soldiers corroborated his story about Camp Carroll, about 185 miles (300 kilometers) southeast of the capital, Seoul. A joint U.S.- South Korean investigation is being conducted at Camp Carroll to test the validity of allegations. The first tests are being carried out by a joint military, government and civilian task force at the site of what was Camp Mercer, west of Seoul. The tests follow allegations of American soldiers burying chemicals on Korean soil.
