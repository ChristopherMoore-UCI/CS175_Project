-- Three-time Indianapolis 500 winner Dario Franchitti was injured in a serious crash that also left 13 spectators hurt during Sunday's Grand Prix of Houston, authorities reported. Judd tweeted Sunday evening that she was on her way to Houston, thanking fans for their prayers. The spinal fracture does not require surgery, according to Dr. Michael Olinger, director of medical services for IndyCar. The wreck occurred in the last lap of the race, when Japanese driver Takuma Sato bumped Franchitti's car, sending it airborne into the protective fencing. Franchitti will be kept overnight at Memorial Hermann-Texas Medical Center in Houston.
