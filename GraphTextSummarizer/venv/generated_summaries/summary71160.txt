The opportunity has arisen since the Internet Corporation for Names and Numbers (ICANN), the body which manages internet domain names, voted earlier this year to allow new varieties of top-level domains -- the suffix of an internet address. A major benefit of the ".africa" domain would be that proceeds from African domain registrations would remain on the continent, rather than flowing offshore. Research by her company suggested 80% of African domain name registrants had opted for ".com" or ".org" suffixes instead, which were price competitive, reliable to register and had wide recognition. Bekele said that if her group was successful in its application to establish and operate the domain, it would look offer domains at prices competitive to ".com" registrations -- $5 for students, or between $9 to $19 for small- to medium-enterprises. -- A proposed new ".africa" internet domain name will provide a stronger brand identity than current little known country domains, while preventing registration revenues flowing abroad, say backers.
