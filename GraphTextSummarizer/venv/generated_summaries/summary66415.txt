"Thrilled" at the results he and his team have managed to produce, Stubbs is hopeful the park will be attracting visitors long after the Olympics has left town. David Stubbs, head of sustainability for the London 2012 Games, was part of the original team that drafted London's successful bid. London 2012 "can build the confidence to wider society that sustainability is not a theory but infinitely do-able," said executive director of the United Nations Environment Program, Achim Steiner during a visit in April this year. With shiny new stadiums and visitor facilities nestling among the lush landscaped grounds, every detail of the 500-acre Olympic Park has taken into account environmental concerns, prompting 2012 organizers to bill it as the first sustainable Olympics. "If you can put sustainability at the heart of a project which is the largest logistical exercise in peace time -- across 26 different sports, with thousands of people attending and millions watching -- then you can do it anywhere," Stubbs said.
