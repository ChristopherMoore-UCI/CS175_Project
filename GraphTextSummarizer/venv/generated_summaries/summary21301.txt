Twelve years ago, the fate of the presidency hung in the balance as Florida elections officials scurried to recount ballots to determine whether Republican candidate George W. Bush or Vice President Al Gore, a Democrat, would emerge as victor from the close contest. Florida Gov. Rick Scott has said the purge — which comes months before the general election — was both legal and necessary to keep non-U.S. citizens from voting illegally. On Tuesday the Department of Justice filed a lawsuit to keep Florida from potentially purging thousands of voters from its registration rolls. So they were shocked to find her name on the list of voters who could potentially be purged from Florida's rolls. State officials also say they "are not aware of any eligible voter who has been removed through this process; we are only aware of ineligible voters on the list," said Chris Cate, spokesman for the Florida Department of State.
