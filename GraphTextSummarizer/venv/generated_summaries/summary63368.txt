Kathleen Connors stopped at L&M Diner on Saturday after a 12-hour overnight shift at Central Vermont Medical Center, where she works as a surgical nurse. "She got her usual breakfast," L&M manager Tayler Merriam told CNN. I love where I work, I love where I live and I love the people around me," Connors told CNN affiliate WCAX. Connors is a regular, and she's known around Barre for her "bubbly" personality and easygoing nature, according to Merriam. On a chilly morning in Barre, Vermont, a random act of kindness warmed the hearts of strangers and spurred another -- and another after that.
