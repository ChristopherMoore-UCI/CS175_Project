-- German Chancellor Angela Merkel joined U.S. President Barack Obama on Tuesday in saying Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi must step down, expressing support for the NATO military mission even though her country abstained from the U.N. Security Council vote that authorized it. In his toast to Merkel at the start of the dinner, Obama presented her with the medal and noted she was a young girl in what became East Germany when the Berlin Wall went up in 1961. " Obama also referenced his unique status as America's first African-American president, as well as Merkel's as Germany's first female chancellor. Earlier, Obama and Merkel emphasized the cooperative and vital relationship between their countries, with Obama paying special tribute to the German chancellor. She also noted that Germany has increased resources to the U.S.-led mission in Afghanistan to free other countries to contribute to the Libya mission.
