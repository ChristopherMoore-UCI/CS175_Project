-- The prosecution and defense have made their cases, and now Judge Thokozile Masipa must decide: Did Oscar Pistorius intentionally kill his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp? Oscar Pistorius trial closing arguments end Who was Reeva Steenkamp? But if Masipa is not convinced that Pistorius knew Steenkamp was behind the door -- if there is any reasonable doubt of that -- he will not be convicted of murder. First -- and most important -- did Pistorius know Steenkamp was behind the door in his bathroom when he fired four shots through it on Valentine's Day last year, killing her? There is no minimum sentence for culpable homicide in South African law -- Masipa will decide the punishment herself, taking South African precedent into account.
