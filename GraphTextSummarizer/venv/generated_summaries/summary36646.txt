Confronted by surviving victims and images of their dead loved ones, hearing offsetting pleas to "move on," balancing the real suffering in the courtroom against the  imagined punishment of life that awaits Tsarnaev, I expect the jury will vote 10-2 (or 9-3) for death. And then there's Tsarnaev's lack of remorse -- opening day, the prosecutor's final shot of Tsarnaev locked up, giving the security camera the finger. The prosecution's emphasis: The killings involved "substantial planning and premeditation" and a betrayal of the United States -- the very country that gave Tsarnaev shelter and citizenship. So now the real trial is underway: What does the surviving Boston Marathon bomber, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, deserve and why? Worse, the historical record and headlines in the next day's anti-death penalty news organizations will probably proclaim:  "Jury Chooses Life for the Marathon Bomber" -- even if overwhelmingly the people's representatives were to vote for death as the more appropriate punishment.
