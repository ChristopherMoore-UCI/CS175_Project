This refers to the three days of Easter that begin with Good Friday, proceed through Holy Saturday, and conclude with Easter Sunday. Why do Christians make so much of this springtime week, and make so much of Easter weekend? We find ourselves emptied out in small ways, nailed to our own trees in life, embarrassed or broken by life. Easter is unique on the Christian calendar, a major point in the cycle of the religious year, and one that has always been able to resist the commercialization and culture warring that surrounds Christmas. That's in part because Easter is genuinely about how religious impulses, and patterns, can operate in ways that affect our lives.
