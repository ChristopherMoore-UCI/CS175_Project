After the service, he had his first professional photo shoot with celebrity photographer Jason Bell. The latest set of pictures, released to mark his birthday this week, show George on a day out at the Natural History Museum in London. " When George was eight months old, Bell was brought back in and took another picture of the family ahead of their tour in April to New Zealand and Australia. We didn't see George again for another three months when he appeared bright eyed and wriggling in his father's arms for his christening at St. James Palace. It wasn't taken by a professional outsider who would burst the bubble -- rather it was a family snap taken by George's grandfather, Michael Middleton.
