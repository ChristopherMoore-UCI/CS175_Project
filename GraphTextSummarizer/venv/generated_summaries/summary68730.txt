-- A 62-year-old Michigan man was severely burned when a homemade rocket strapped on his back exploded while he slid down a snowy hill on a sled, authorities said this week. The man, whose identity is not yet known, was hospitalized with significant damage to one of his eyes and could face criminal charges, authorities said. "He is known for doing 'crazy things' at his parties," an Oakland County sheriff's department statement said. The rocket stunt was the grand finale on Saturday during the man's annual sledding party at his Oakland County, Michigan, home, the sheriff's department said. Inside the makeshift rocket, the victim placed gunpowder, heads from matches and gasoline.
