There was to be no repeat in rain-drenched Cape Town, as Portugal found form after the disappointing opening draw with the Ivory Coast and claimed second place in Group G ahead of Friday's final round of matches. Meireles, who scored the winner in the second leg of Portugal's qualifying playoff against Bosnia, broke the deadlock when he ran onto a fine threaded pass from midfielder Tiago and slotted coolly past Ri Myong-Guk. Tiago added his second just a minute later with a powerful header from a cross by another replacement, Miguel Veloso. Captain Cristiano Ronaldo and then Tiago again compounded the Koreans' misery, giving the Portuguese a massive goal-difference advantage over the Ivorians ahead of their eagerly-anticipated showdown with leaders Brazil. Portugal took a big step to escaping the World Cup's so-called "group of death" by crushing North Korea 7-0 in a rematch of the two nations' famous 1966 clash in South Africa on Monday.
