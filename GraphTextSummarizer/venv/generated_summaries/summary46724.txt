" Assemblyman Mike Gatto, D-Los Angeles, introduced a bill in the state Legislature on Tuesday that would outlaw the defense at trial or during post-trial sentencing, according to a news release from Gatto's office. A judge agreed, saying that if Couch violated the terms of his probation, he could face up to 10 years of incarceration, according to a statement from the Tarrant County, Texas, Criminal District Attorney's Office. Affluenza snared national headlines late last year when Texas teen Ethan Couch received 10 years of probation after slamming into a parked car south of Fort Worth. It appears to be mere coincidence that a California lawmaker's bill to ban the defense of "affluenza" comes the week before the television debut of "Rich Kids of Beverly Hills. "Perhaps the notion of personal responsibility seems antiquated to some," Gatto said in a news release this week.
