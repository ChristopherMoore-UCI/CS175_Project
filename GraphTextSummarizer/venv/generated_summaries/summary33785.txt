Earlier Thursday, the court said Byrom, convicted of a murder to which her son has confessed multiple times, would not be executed Thursday, as the Mississippi Supreme Court continues to review her post-conviction motion. Byrom's motion for the court is still pending, and there is no word on when the court's decision on that particular motion will be made, court spokeswoman Beverly Pettigrew Kraft said. -- The Mississippi Supreme Court has denied the state attorney general's motion to set an execution date for Michelle Byrom, according to an order filed by the court Thursday afternoon. During Michelle Byrom's original trial, prosecutors said she plotted to kill her husband, Edward Byrom Sr. The nine-member court could issue a decision regarding the Byrom case Thursday, but there is no requirement on the timeline for the decision.
