"The tornado hit across the street from the hospital -- really just one block away -- and there is stuff and debris everywhere," said JoAnn Hettinger, director of patient care at Avera Weskota Memorial Hospital. "Most of the folks (in damaged homes) are bunking up with friends and relatives." Gov. Dennis Daugaard has ordered 100 South Dakota National Guard soldiers to the community to help with recovery and cleanup, a statement from his office said. As much as three-fourths of the town of 350 is gone, Stanton County Sheriff Mike Unger has said. In all, 11 homes and three businesses were damaged, according to Roger Dwyer, the Jerauld County emergency management director. -- A tornado hit the south-central South Dakota town of Wessington Springs on Wednesday evening, briefly trapping some people in their homes.
