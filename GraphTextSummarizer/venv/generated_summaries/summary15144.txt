"If I knew back then about the choices in family planning, I would've been able to control having children," said Lopez, who has 12 children. " Young people in the Philippines lack health services and education, said Daniels from the U.N. Population Fund. The proposed law requires the government to provide contraceptives, information on modern family planning methods at public health centers and comprehensive reproductive health curriculum in schools. Instead, we have a situation where children are having children." Poor women are the ones having more children.
