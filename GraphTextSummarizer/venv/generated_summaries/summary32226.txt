"We can't speculate as to motive," Chief Ralph Godbee said in a news conference Monday. The shooting has led to the reassessment of security measures by police officials. According to the chief, Mayor Dave Bing has committed to bringing in resources necessary to provide a safe environment, and interim measures will be put in place. Two of the four officers wounded in the shooting were hospitalized in stable condition Monday, Godbee said. " Lamar Deshea Moore, 38, walked into a police precinct Sunday and "indiscriminately began firing," Godbee said.
