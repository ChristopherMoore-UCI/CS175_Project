"When it came to trying to understand ... why we are not making as much progress having more women on boards, you had male board directors who basically said, 'You know what, there's not enough supply,'" said Groysberg, who created a class at Harvard Business School focusing on ways to get more women on corporate boards. For the eighth year in a row, the group found no significant change in the number of female members of corporate boards, with women holding 16.9% of board seats in 2013 versus 16.6% last year. Men and women see different reasons for why there aren't more women on corporate boards, according to a survey of more than 1,000 board members from around the world in 2010, 2011 and 2012 by Harvard Business School professor Boris Groysberg and researcher Deborah Bell. Tom Falk is chairman and chief executive officer of Kimberly-Clark Corp., one of the 20% of companies where women hold one-quarter or more of executive officer positions. Last year, women had 14.3% of executive officer positions, and this year the percentage is nearly the same, 14.6%.
