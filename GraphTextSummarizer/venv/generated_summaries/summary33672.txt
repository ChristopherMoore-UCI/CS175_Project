Initially, the Federal Aviation Administration said the crew reported a possible nose gear problem before landing, but later amended that to say that after it reviewed air controller tapes, no issues were noted ahead of time. Pilots can land safely with only the main gear operable and such incidents occur from time to time. Southwest said three flight attendants had reported being hurt, while Bosco said the six-member crew had been taken to a hospital for observation. In addition to the 10 injured aboard the plane, a Port Authority police officer was treated for heat exhaustion, Bosco said. LaGuardia was closed to arriving flights as emergency vehicles surrounded the disabled jet, but the airport was back open for arrivals and departures by 7 p.m., Bosco said.
