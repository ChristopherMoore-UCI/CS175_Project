The Radiohead singer-songwriter initially booked studio time for the group -- which was banded together to perform live songs from his 2006 album, "The Eraser" -- because of how great they sounded during rehearsal for the string of eight concerts held in 2010. -- Put Radiohead's Thom Yorke and Nigel Godrich, drummer Joey Waronker, the Red Hot Chili Peppers' Flea and percussionist Mauro Refosco into a studio for three days, and you know the sound coming out of that session is going to be otherworldly. " Yorke and Godrich then edited that mountain, combining it with other laptop and studio work they'd done until it turned into a nine-track album. The move toward an album was an organic one, Yorke explains in an interview in Rolling Stone. Yorke and Godrich agree that their intent on "AMOK" was to "step into the unknown," as Godrich put it.
