Jason Boswell, vice president of sales for Okabashi credits Irvani for bucking that trend. "Our shoes get to the American consumer after traveling an average of 800 miles," Irvani said, "compared to Chinese shoes which can travel 12,000 miles on average." "We left Iran because the government took over not only our businesses but our personal assets as well," said 59-year-old Irvani, whose family had been manufacturing shoes there for over 50 years. Irvani's factory employs around 200 workers that produce up to 20,000 pairs of shoes each day, with his sandals selling for as little as $12. All the materials Okabashi use are entirely recyclable, Irvani says.
