At an event outside Detroit, where the former secretary of state endorsed Democrats Mark Schauer and Gary Peters, Clinton spoke glowingly of their support for the 2008 auto bailout that invested billions into the United States struggling auto industry. "We'll see what happens," Romney told New York Times Magazine last month. Obama would regularly say that he "refused to let Detroit go bankrupt." Clinton's comments are particularly striking given the probability that she runs for president and the recent chatter that Romney will try to run for president for a third time. "They," Clinton said, referring to people who wanted the companies go into bankruptcy, "were willing to walk away from the people of this state, the jobs, the auto industry, the future. Though Clinton never mentioned Romney by name, the comment appeared to be directed at him, as well as Schauer's and Peters' Republican opponents.
