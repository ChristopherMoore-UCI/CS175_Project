The father, who CNN is not identifying, told Volusia County emergency dispatch Friday that 18-year-old Raymond Frolander was close to the family and was in the apartment while the father was out. Frolander, who is being held in Volusia County Jail without bond, faces a charge of sexual battery of a child. The father has not been charged, and when CNN affiliate CFN 13 asked Daytona Beach Police Chief Michael Chitwood whether he had any issue with the father's reaction, he responded Friday, "Not as a police chief and not as a father. It also says Frolander told police, "I'm guilty." An official in the criminal division of the Volusia County Clerk's Office told CNN this is a confidential case because of the age of the victim, so no public record of the suspect's plea or attorney's name is available. According to the charging affidavit, the 11-year-old victim told authorities that Frolander had performed oral sex on him and instructed the boy to fondle him.
