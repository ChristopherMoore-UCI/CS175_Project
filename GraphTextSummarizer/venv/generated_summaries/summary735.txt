And all the disruption off the pitch continues to transmit into poor results on the pitch, as goals either side of half-time from Tim Cahill and Mikel Arteta gave Everton a deserved win. The result lifts Everton up to 11th place but only goal difference now separates Liverpool from lying bottom of the table, their lowest-ever Premier League position. After a goalless first half, City took the lead whan captain Carlos Tevez flicked home a cross from substitute David Silva. Both teams came into the match struggling near the foot of the table, with Everton 17th and Liverpool 18th in the 20-team division. Arsenal, Manchester United and Tottenham are all level in third place on 14 points, with the Gunners ahead on goal difference.
