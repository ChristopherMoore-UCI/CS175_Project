Regarding the threat of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula compared to al Qaeda Pakistan, the official said "this is not a zero sum game." A U.S. official said Monday the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency continues to expand its intelligence operations in Yemen with more operatives and analysts working closely with the Yemen government and other U.S. partners inside the country. The United States is thought to use drones to fire missiles at suspected terrorists in Pakistan, among other locations. Al Qaeda Pakistan remains very dangerous even though it is under intense pressure by the United States because of drone missile attacks. Yaqoub said it "would not surprise" him if the United States increased its covert activities in his country in the wake of the foiled bomb plot, but that "as a Yemeni citizen"  he did not like the idea of unmanned U.S. drones.
