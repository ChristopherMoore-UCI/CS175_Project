One of CNN's resident experts is producer Mohammed Tawfeeq, who was in Baghdad when President George W. Bush dodged a flying shoe at news conference in the U.S. Embassy in December 2008. "Most often, lower-status people and poor men could not wear shoes," Shirazi said. " Tawfeeq, who occasionally visits the United States, was surprised to learn shoe throwing was not considered an offense in North America. "Throwing a shoe on someone means throwing dirt on that person." Professor Faegheh Shirazi, with Middle Eastern Studies at the University of Texas, agreed, saying it is offensive "regardless of the religious practices. For example, in the King James Version of the Old Testament, Psalm 60:8 says: "Moab is my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe: Philistia, triumph thou because of me."
