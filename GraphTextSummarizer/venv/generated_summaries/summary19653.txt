Egypt and the United States helped broker the cease-fire last week after Israel launched a series of military strikes on Gaza with the stated goal of halting Israel-bound rocket attacks from militants in the Palestinian territory. Hamas police and ambulance operators said Israeli soldiers injured two civilians when they fired at Palestinian homes east of Rafah City in Gaza. The continued talks are a key part of the agreement, which called for "total cessation of all hostile activity" and discussion of topics such as opening border crossings and easing Israel's economic blockade in Gaza.
