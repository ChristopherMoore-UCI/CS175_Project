Hours after the wedding, groom William Riley Knight, 49, of Crown Point, Indiana, was struck and killed. Knight was acting as a good Samaritan on Saturday night when he stopped to assist Linda Darlington, whose vehicle had slid into a ditch along a road in Crown Point. "He was very outgoing, always wanting to help somebody," said friend Rob Biella, CNN affiliate WLS reported. They had just left their reception, according to Patti Van Til, a spokeswoman with the Lake County, Indiana, Sheriff's Department. According to CNN affiliate WBBM, which spoke to Knight's ex-wife, he had four children, including two stepchildren.
