South Korean companies benefited from the extremely low cost of North Korean labor. Yoo's company, SJ Tech, operates out of Kaesong, which is just north of the Demilitarized Zone in North Korean territory. About 125 South Korean companies operate out of Kaesong, employing more than 50,000 North Korean workers. An official from the South Korean government's Unification Ministry, who according to policy spoke to CNN on condition of anonymity, says companies at Kaesong pay their North Korean workers an average of $155.50 a month. The official did not rule out the possibility that penalties could be imposed on South Korean companies if they individually agree to raise employee salaries.
