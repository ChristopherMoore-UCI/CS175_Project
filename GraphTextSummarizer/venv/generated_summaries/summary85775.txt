Meanwhile, after a year out of the control tower, Adams returned to his regular job Wednesday at Newark air traffic control. Scovel found merit in Adams' concerns, concluding in a report two months ago that "questions about the safety of the runway 22L-11 approach configuration at Newark persist. The alert comes after repeated instances in which planes above the Newark airport flew too close to each other in violation of safety standards. Last week the Office of Special Counsel raised the matter with President Obama, writing that "we found a substantial likelihood that FAA officials were engaging in conduct that constitutes gross mismanagement and a substantial and specific danger to public safety." On November 5, the DOT wrote to the Office of Special Counsel confirming the computer system had been put to use at Newark on October 26.
