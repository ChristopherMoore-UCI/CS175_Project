Japanese food imports make up less than 4% of food imported into the United States, the FDA says. But radioactive caesium has also been detected in Japanese food, which can linger for years and cause long-term problems for food production and human health, according to the agencies. India has also ordered radiation tests of Japanese food at its ports and airports. A radiation physicist from the Office of Atoms for Peace said the agency will work with the country's health ministry to do random checks of imported food from Japan. Japan's Consumer Affairs Agency listed specific export bans on food items from Ibaraki, Tochigi and Gunma Prefectures, but did not list similar restrictions on the same food items for domestic consumers in those areas.
