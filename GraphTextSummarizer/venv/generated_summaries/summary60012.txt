Xinhua reported the flooding submerged some power supply facilities and led to blackouts in parts of the city. The "heaviest rain in six decades" in the Chinese capital of Beijing has left at least 37 people dead, the state news agency Xinhua reported Sunday. Local television broadcast heroic stories of search and rescue efforts and people helping each other, but online, people were critical. The average rainfall Saturday was 6.7 inches, but one suburban district recorded 18 inches, Xinhua said. Many complained that authorities seemed ill-prepared despite heavy rain having been forecast days in advance.
