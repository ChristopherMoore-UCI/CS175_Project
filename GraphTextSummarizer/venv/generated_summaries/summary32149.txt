It is unclear whether the American Jobs Act -- consisting largely of targeted tax cuts, infrastructure spending and new job training assistance -- can win over enough skeptical congressional Republicans, particularly in light of Obama's falling approval ratings and the looming presidential campaign. With $900 billion in spending cuts already enacted, the special joint deficit committee created under last month's debt ceiling agreement has started work on finding another $1.5 trillion in deficit reduction steps that Congress can pass by the end of the year. The special congressional deficit committee has until November 23 to approve more than $1.5 trillion in new deficit reduction steps, and Congress would then have to pass the plan -- unamended -- by December 23. The Obama plan is part of the president's effort to resurrect a comprehensive deficit reduction deal with Republicans that would include reforms of the tax code and entitlement programs such as Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid to accompany government spending cuts. Cantor, R-Virginia, made clear he opposed new infrastructure spending and some other aspects of the Obama plan.
