If Lohan violates the rules of her rehab program or fails a drug test before her next court date on February 25, she will be sent to jail for 180 days, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Elden Fox told her. -- Actress Lindsay Lohan must remain in a drug rehabilitation program until January 3 instead of going to jail for violating her probation with a failed drug test, a judge ruled Friday. Fox allowed Lohan to live in her West Hollywood, California, home as long as she followed a new set of rules, including regular drug testing. Fox, who took over Lohan's three-year-long case in August, said he thought Lohan's "epiphany may have been encouraged by the fact that (she) went to jail. Staying clean and sober until then would end Lohan's supervised probation, and she can "put this long episode behind you," Fox said.
