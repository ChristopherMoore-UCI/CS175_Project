While some folks may (and certainly do) take issue with this endeavor, Kraemer's view is that his work is no different from using selective breeding to produce superior animals. See the rest of Clone Farm at VBS.TV During the visit, we were introduced to a few of his cloned animals: Dewey, the first of his cloned deer; Bruce, a bull created from the 15-year-old cells of a dead bull who'd been resistant to brucellosis, a bacterial infection that causes spontaneous abortion in cattle; and CC, or Carbon Copy, the world's first cloned cat, who has successfully given birth to several kittens of her own. In order to put a heart-stake in this perennial bugaboo, we traveled to Texas to visit with Dr. Duane Kraemer, a leading researcher and authority on in-vitro fertilization, and the man responsible for the world's first cloned cat, which currently lives in his back yard. Considered a leader in reproductive science, Kraemer was the first scientist to successfully transfer nonhuman embryos resulting in offspring. Having grown up on a dairy farm in Wisconsin, Kraemer left for school intending to learn animal husbandry and take over the family business.
