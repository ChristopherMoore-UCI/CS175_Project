We know there is other sexual abuse, but this has come about because of rampant sexual abuse by Catholic Church clergy," he said. Daniel was an 11-year-old altar boy at St Patrick's Church in Maitland in the Hunter Valley, north of Sydney, when the abuse began at the hands of Father James Patrick Fletcher, who died in prison after being found guilty of child abuse -- including that of Daniel. Katie and Emma Foster's abuser is buried in the Catholic Church crypt at Melbourne Cemetery. As she announced the establishment of a Royal Commission into institutional responses to instances and allegations of child sex abuse, Gillard said the inquiry would not target any one church but would encompass all religious institutions, state institutions, schools and not-for-profit groups like scouts and sports clubs. "Our girls were assaulted at school by the local Catholic priest," Anthony Foster told CNN.
