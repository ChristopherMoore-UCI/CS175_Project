Testing shows that the counterfeit pills contain excessive amounts of sibutramine, a prescription drug and controlled substance that can place people with cardiovascular disease at risk for higher blood pressure, heart attack or stroke, said Janet Woodcock, director of the FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. Woodcock said possible symptoms of excess sibutramine are heart palpitations, sleeplessness, anxiety, dry mouth, nausea and shakiness. According to Alli's Web site, sibutramine is the active ingredient in the prescription diet drug Meridia. "Unfortunately, many people with high blood pressure or heart disease are trying to improve their health by losing weight, and we are concerned that such individuals might be exposed to the counterfeit drug," Woodcock said. The FDA warned consumers this week that fake versions of the over-the-counter drug are being sold, mainly on online auction sites.
