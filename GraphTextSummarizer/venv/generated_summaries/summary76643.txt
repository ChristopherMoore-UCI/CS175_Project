Over 35 million tweets were sent during World Cup hosts Brazil's humiliating 7-1 semifinal defeat by Germany to set a new record for the most-discussed live event on Twitter, with 672 million tweets relating to the tournament delivered. Balotelli might have had the most retweeted message during hte World Cup, but the Liverpool forward's Twitter account of just over three million followers is dwarfed by that of Real Madrid star Cristiano Ronaldo who surpassed the 30 million mark this year. The Twitter spokesman added: "The 'Royal Photobomb' moment at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow was when Australian hockey player @_JaydeTaylor had her selfie photobombed by HM Queen Elizabeth II, starting a trend of 'Royal Photobombs'." Arguably 2014's most memorable sport selfie was Lukas Podolski's photographic celebrations to commemorate Germany's World Cup final win over Argentina. Balotelli's irreverent promise to kiss Britain's Queen Elizabeth II if Italy beat Costa Rica in their World Cup group game was retweeted nearly 173,000 times and favorited over 88,000 times.
