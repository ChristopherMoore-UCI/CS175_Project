Disgraced cyclist Lance Armstrong is the latest celebrity to sit down with Winfrey for a "no-holds-barred" two-part chat set to begin airing on her network Thursday night. "All of the celebrity advice people that she's spawned like Dr. Phil and Dr. Oz, it's all about saying you take personal responsibility for yourself, and focusing on this idea that everyone has to figure out some magic formula to make themselves a better person." Indeed, the best outcome for anyone walking through Winfrey's confession session would be the opportunity to hit the restart button -- a goal that may have factored into Armstrong's choice to come forward now and talk to Winfrey. In essence, this is the persona that Winfrey has crafted over the years as she's moved from newcomer host on "AM Chicago," to the queen of daytime TV with "The Oprah Winfrey Show," to the current chief executive officer of OWN, the Oprah Winfrey Network. In an interview with "CBS This Morning" on Tuesday, not even Winfrey could say definitively why Armstrong decided at this point to come forward, but she did say it was a difficult interview and that Armstrong "brought it." But perhaps Winfrey's CBS interview was the most interesting confession of all in this scenario, suggested the University of Minnesota's Squires.
