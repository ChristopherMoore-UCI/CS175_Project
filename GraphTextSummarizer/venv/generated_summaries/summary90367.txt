"The UAE calls on Syrian President Assad to respect the right of peaceful protesters, yet it is expelling Syrians from its country for exercising this basic right," said Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director at Human Rights Watch, in HRW's statement. The rights group said, "Syrian protesters forced out of the UAE face a significant risk to their personal security if they return to Syria. ... The United Arab Emirates is one of the six Gulf Cooperation Council countries to have expelled Syrian envoys and to have recalled their Ambassadors from Syria in response to the government's crackdown there. According to HRW, other Syrian nationals in the UAE are not speaking out about their expulsion because they are afraid they will be deported to Syria.
