"Technology permeates modern life and we thought it would be revealing to see how knowledgeable people were about some core concepts and history," said Aaron Smith, author of the report. This week, Pew released the results of a survey seeking to see just how much Internet users know about the Web and the people, tools and technology that make it work. "Policy makers, tech designers, and those orienting their organizations around digital life can profit from knowing just how 'technology literate' people are and where gaps in their knowledge might be. Pew notes that "knowledge of the modern technology landscape varies widely across a range of topics." Just because people use these gadgets a lot doesn't necessarily mean they know everything about how they work and where they came from.
