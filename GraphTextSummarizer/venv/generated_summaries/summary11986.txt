But until Kiprotich's success on Sunday, its only other podiums were another runnerup placing in the ring for John Mugabi at Moscow '80 and bronze for 400m runner Davis Kamoga at Atlanta '96. Two-time world champion Abel Kirui had to make do with silver, while fellow Kenyan Wilson Kipsang claimed bronze. Leo Rwabwogo won boxing silver at the same Games, having won bronze four years earlier in Mexico when Eridadi Mukwanga took home silver. Coached by Benjamin Longiross, who placed 62nd for Uganda in the marathon at Seoul '88, Kiprotich denied Kenya -- a country where he has trained in recent years -- a second successive men's title. "I never saw John Akii-Bua run, but there are a lot of memories of him," Kiprotich told reporters after claiming a surprise victory in the men's marathon on the final day of London 2012.
