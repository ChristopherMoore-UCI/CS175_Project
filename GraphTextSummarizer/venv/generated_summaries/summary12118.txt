To explain: ISIS is the most powerful fighting force across northern and eastern Syria. And if Washington is hoping for a civilian uprising to topple ISIS in Raqqa, it might have to wait until the Armageddon jihadists are predicting will occur in Syria. Throwing money, arms and training at Free Syrian Army units will not defeat ISIS. Relying on insignificant Free Syrian Army units will not be enough to topple the ISIS behemoth. Despite facing a punishing air bombing campaign, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria continues to march across Syria.
