Here we collect some of the best new examples of companies using advertising to get social with customers, including coffee company Douwe Egbert, which created a yawn-activated drink dispenser in a Johannesburg airport using facial recognition technology, and the frozen food firm Birds Eye, which created a pop-up called The Picture House in three British cities to allow diners to eat for free in exchange for sharing a snap on Instagram. -- Social media is revamping the way businesses reach their audiences, transforming boring billboards and cold commercials into a land of interactive wonders. Anyone who passes the machines can send a message to Walkers on Twitter and out pops a free bag of a new line of potato chips chosen by the public. The dispensers are run by Walkers, which is known as Lays in the US and Chipsy in Egypt. (Sample flavors: Ranch Racoon and Chip Shop Chicken Curry).
