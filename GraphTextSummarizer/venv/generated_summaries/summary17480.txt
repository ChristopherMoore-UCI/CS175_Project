The Senate will vote Saturday night on the $1.1 trillion package that would fund the government through next September, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid announced on the Senate floor. Senate lawmakers wanted votes on amendments that would address those issues. Amendment votes could have been risky, because if either measure passed, the spending bill would have to go back to the House to be voted on again. The Senate was facing a Saturday deadline to approve the spending bill and avert a government shutdown, but that was pushed back. Reid tried to get unanimous consent for an adjournment until Monday when there would be enough votes to end a filibuster, but Sen. Mike Lee, a Republican from Utah, objected because Reid would not guarantee a vote on an amendment dealing with immigration funding.
