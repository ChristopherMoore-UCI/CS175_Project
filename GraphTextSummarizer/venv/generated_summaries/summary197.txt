"We want to keep them up there, floating around for eventually up to 100 days," Nigel Snoad, Google.org Crisis Response Product Manager and Google Project Loon team member said on CNN's News Stream. "That way we can have a ring of balloons we hope can provide Internet access to a whole range of places that are really difficult to get to with normal technology." A group of 50 pilot testers in Christchurch and parts of Canterbury on New Zealand's South Island were equipped with special Internet antennas to connect to the Loon balloons, including Charles Nimmo -- the first person in the world to connect to Google's balloon-powered Internet. Project Loon uses a fleet of super-pressure balloons made out of very thin polyethylene plastic. The need for the connectivity that Project Loon promises is immense.
