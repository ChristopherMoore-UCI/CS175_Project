Actress Sharon Olago, who played promiscuous party girl Violet in "Shuga," believes the Kenyan show has been so successful because it mirrors the complexities of modern young life, without falling into a moralistic, conventional narrative on safe sex. Both Mutuma and Olago have become of the vocal campaigners spreading the message of safe sex and helping educate communities about HIV and AIDS. While the MTV and UNICEF campaign driving the show emphasizes the importance of safe sex and HIV testing, it also talks about "how HIV/AIDS is not a death sentence -- and that's a really, really important thing," according to Nyong'o. For many young Africans, the three-part TV series about a group of students in Nairobi living under the constant specter of HIV/AIDS is the story of their own lives -- and is the reason "Shuga" took the continent by storm when it debuted late last year. "If one catches it early on, you can live a healthy life with HIV," the actress, who is currently enrolled in a drama course at Yale University in the United States, told CNN.
