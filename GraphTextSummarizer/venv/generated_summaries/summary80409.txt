-- Of all the parts that make up my somewhat quirky life, there are few things that raise a stranger's eyebrows faster than discovering I love country music. Because of Travis, I have developed lifelong friendships with some amazing people who work in and perform country music. Not a "I like that one song by Lady Antebellum" kind of love for country music either. Before Travis, I used to think "soul music" had one certain sound. Because of Travis, I learned Waylon Jennings was the man who sang "The Dukes of Hazzard" theme song.
