"By providing him with this common palliative procedure, we've given Joseph the chance to go home and be with his family after spending so much of his young life in the hospital," said Dr. Robert Wilmott, chief of pediatrics for SSM Cardinal Glennon Children's Medical Center in St. Louis. "Obviously, it's been a very difficult day for the family today," said spokeswoman Emma Fedor. Joseph was "very peaceful, in no pain whatsoever, no distress," when he died, Fedor said. The London Health Sciences Centre -- the hospital where Joseph was initially treated -- in March said that "there are clearly differences in the approach of these centres to the management of end-of-life care in this tragic situation" and that "the medical judgments made by LHSC physicians remain unchallenged by any credible medical source." The parents said that they, rather than physicians, should make a judgment on quality of life, Fedor said.
