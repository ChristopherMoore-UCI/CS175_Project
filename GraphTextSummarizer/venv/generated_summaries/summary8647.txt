Nine cases of Pappy Van Winkle rye were also missing. "It's highly coveted,"  said Franklin County Sheriff Pat Melton, the man leading the investigation. While the listed retail price is $130 per bottle, the bourbon is so rare that consumers usually end up paying much more to get a bottle, if they can find one, said Tom Fischer of bourbonblog.com. "There is a lot of mystery around how to even get one," he said. The Buffalo Trace Distillery in Frankfort noticed this week that it was missing some of its 20-year-old Pappy Van Winkle, one of the rarest and most sought after bourbons in the world. Just how coveted is Pappy Van Winkle?
