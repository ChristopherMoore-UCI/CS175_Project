Colonial forces killed thousands of fighters and detained others, including Kenyans who were not part of the rebel group. The abuse occurred from 1952 to 1961, when fighters from the Mau Mau movement battled British forces for land and freedom. The plaintiffs said they endured torture at the hands of British forces, including castration, brutal beatings and detention. The African nation went on to gain independence from Britain in 1963. Before that ruling, Britain had argued that it transferred the powers and liabilities of the colonial administration to Kenya after independence.
