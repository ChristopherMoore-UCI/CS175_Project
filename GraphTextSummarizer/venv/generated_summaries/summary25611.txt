"They started killing police officers when they were going home or getting into police cars," Mayor Jose Reyes Ferriz told reporters last week. Last year, more than 100 police were killed in Ciudad Juarez in attacks blamed on organized crime. Violent deaths reached record levels in Mexico last year as drug cartels battle each other and the Mexican government. Narcotraffickers have adopted a campaign of intimidation against authorities, and the deaths of police, mayors and other officials have become common. Police Chief Roberto Orduna had received death threats from local drug cartels and resigned after the recent deaths of eight police officers under his command.
