Environmental groups have been calling on Obama to issue such regulations on coal plants, the largest source of carbon emissions in the United States. Obama argued that the benefits of reduced carbon emissions will far outweigh the costs of implementing new rules. Obama cautioned that the impact of his plan would be felt over time, but now is the moment to further prepare the nation to reduce carbon pollution and protect Americans from climate change. Obama said the United States must use less "dirty energy," waste less, and transition to cleaner sources, and redouble efforts to reach a new global agreement to reduce carbon emissions with "concrete action" that is ambitious, inclusive and flexible. The Georgetown University speech came as environmental constituents and climate change advocates press him to take more aggressive action and to push harder for clean energy alternatives.
