According to a GlobalPost story on Friday, its CEO and president, Philip Balboni, said in a speech marking World Press Freedom Day that the outlet has a "very high degree of confidence" that Foley was "most likely abducted by a pro-regime militia group and turned over to Syrian government forces. -- A U.S. journalist missing in Syria for nearly six months is most likely in Syrian government custody, according to the GlobalPost, an online international news outlet, and the man's brother. According to the report, Balboni said that GlobalPost representatives were meeting with the Syrian ambassador to Lebanon in Beirut to muster support. The Syrian government, however, has so far not acknowledged knowing of Foley's whereabouts. " "We have obtained multiple independent reports from very credible confidential sources who have both indirect and direct access that confirm our assessment that Jim is now being held by the Syrian government in a prison or detention facility in the Damascus area," Balboni said.
