Bazelon erroneously cites Tyler's prior health history and its significance to the case: he was never diagnosed with Bipolar disorder, and Asperger Syndrome is not a recognized risk factor for suicide. It seems likely that these factors contributed to Tyler's decision to commit suicide, Bazelon wrote. " When presented with Lowen's statement, Slate deputy editor Julia Turner responded with one of her own: "Emily Bazelon's central concern about 'Bully,' expressed in her review for Slate, is that the movie presents a one-sided and incomplete version of the events leading up to the suicide of Tyler Long. Perhaps more important for this conversation, no one disputes that Tyler was on the autism spectrum, and considerable research links Asperger's and autism to an elevated risk of suicide. Bazelon suggests that Tyler was NOT bullied in the days, weeks and months before his death.
