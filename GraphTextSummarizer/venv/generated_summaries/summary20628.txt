" Theresienstadt was a ghetto-labor camp to which the SS deported and then incarcerated certain categories of German, Austrian, and Czech Jews, based on their age, disability as a result of past military service, or domestic celebrity in the arts and other cultural life, according to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. Her family surrounded her at her bedside before she died Sunday, her grandson Ariel Sommer told CNN. Her mother was a playmate of composer Gustav Mahler and as a child Herz-Sommer often played with German-language novelist Franz Kafka who came to her home for Sunday lunch. The son said that his mother somehow "managed to protect him from the worst realities of life at the mercy of the Nazis." Herz-Sommer and her son returned to Prague after being liberated by the Soviet Army in May of 1945, according to the film. The world's oldest known Holocaust survivor has died at age 110, her grandson told CNN Sunday.
