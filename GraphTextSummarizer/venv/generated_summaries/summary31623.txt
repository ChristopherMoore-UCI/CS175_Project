" In wide-ranging comments on the region, she also said the Obama administration will work to improve relations among even its harshest critics in the Western Hemisphere, including Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, and is looking to the Castro brothers in Cuba for some reciprocal action in response to the president's easing of travel and other restrictions. On Cuba, Clinton said the United States is awaiting a response from Cuban leaders Ra√∫l and Fidel Castro. Later, Clinton appeared to be fighting back tears when she spoke at a ceremony to honor Foreign Service officers who had been killed in the line of duty. Adkins' name and those of three other Foreign Service officers were added to a plaque in the State Department entrance.
