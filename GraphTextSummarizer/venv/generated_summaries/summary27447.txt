The Airbus 310 plane tried to land at the airport in Moroni, then made a U-turn before it crashed, Comoros Vice President Idi Nadhoim said. The French military has detected a rescue beacon, but rescue workers say the wreckage is difficult to reach in deep waters. It originated in Yemen's capital, Sanaa, and went down just miles from Comoros' capital, Moroni. One more flight between Sanaa and Moroni is scheduled for Sunday, but all flights on the route are canceled after that, Yemenia said. The Comoros Islands are between the east African country of Tanzania and the island nation of Madagascar.
