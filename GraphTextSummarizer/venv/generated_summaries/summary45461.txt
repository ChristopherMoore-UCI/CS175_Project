Now we may get a yes just as fast, but there's logistics to consider: 'OK, but where are you?'" So for the new album, some participants were recorded in New York (such as Solange and Kendrick Lamar, who guests on "YOLO" with Adam Levine), some in Los Angeles (Pharrell and Too Short, who guests on "The Compliments"), and some on Skype. And Samberg will soon be decamping to Los Angeles to start shooting his new television comedy, "Brooklyn Nine-Nine. "When we made albums in the past," Samberg said, "it wasn't always because someone was on the show when we asked them, but in their minds, they were like, 'There's a chance this is for the show.' I wish we could have shot it in Brooklyn -- I still love New York. Even though its members -- Andy Samberg, Jorma Taccone, and Akiva Schaffer -- are often apart because they live on different coasts, they're still united in the studio as well as a series of Wack Wednesday videos -- seriously, how many artists drop a video for just about every song on the album anymore?
