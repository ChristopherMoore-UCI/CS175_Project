The Philadelphia couple made it through the list before baby Shane was born at 2:25 a.m. Thursday, according to their Facebook page, "Prayers for Shane." "Today at 6:15 a.m., after meeting his entire family and being baptized into the Catholic faith, baby Shane died peacefully in his Mother's arms," the couple said on "Prayers for Shane." He said he was amazed by the "outpouring of Love and Warmth" on the "Prayers for Shane" Facebook page and "humbled" by the couple's love, courage and determination to give the boy "a life time of love in whatever time God gave you with him." In the post, signed "Shane's Pop-Pop," he said he joined Facebook last week so he could read the "heartfelt messages and comments" for baby Shane and his parents. The priceless moments were part of a bucket list that Jenna Gassew and Dan Haley created after Shane was diagnosed in the womb with anencephaly, a birth defect in which a baby is born without parts of the brain and skull.
