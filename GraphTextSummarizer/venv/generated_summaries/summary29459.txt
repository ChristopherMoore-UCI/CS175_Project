Attorney General Eric Holder urged other countries to enact new criminal laws to help prevent possible terrorist attacks from returning Syrian fighters. But Holder said the use of such operations could help countries thwart attacks. Open visa access among European countries and the U.S. means "the problem of fighters in Syria returning to any of our countries is a problem for all of our countries," Holder said in his speech, excerpts of which were provided in advance by the Justice Department. "But the world cannot simply sit back and let it become a training ground from which our nationals can return and launch attacks." To combat the threat, Holder is calling on countries to pass laws to criminalize the preparatory steps that suspects often take before an attack, and to allow police to conduct undercover investigations. Holder said the United States, along with Norway and other European countries, face similar danger from "violent extremists fighting today in Syria, Iraq or other locations" who "may seek to commit acts of terror tomorrow in our countries as well." U.S. intelligence estimates that nearly 7,000 foreign fighters have traveled to Syria, including dozens from the United States.
