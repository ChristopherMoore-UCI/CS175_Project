Houston's death certificate, filed Wednesday, listed her cause of death as "deferred," meaning it was delayed pending more information. "With respect to Ms. Houston, we have an average of 50 cases a day," he said. Houston visited a Beverly Hills ear, nose and throat specialist four days before she died, a source familiar with her visit said Wednesday. Authorities are trying to determine the source of Houston's prescription medication found in the hotel room where she died, officials said Wednesday. The source told CNN's Don Lemon that Houston ordered the drinks before 10 a.m. last Wednesday and Thursday from the bars in the lobby and pool area.
