"While it is styled as a request for instruction, the Petition in fact appears to be a blatant attempt to alter the disposition of assets Mr. Williams specifically planned and provided for." "We're puzzled a little by the tone of the opposition," Susan Williams' attorney, James Wagstaffe, tells The Hollywood Reporter. The dispute centers on the two houses Williams owned at the time of his death — one in Napa and one in Tiburon, California. They point out lines in the trust that give Susan the Tiburon house and its contents with the exceptions of items gifted in other stipulations. " But Williams' kids read the trust differently — they argue that it grants them every category of item listed in addition to the property in the Napa house, not every category of item confined to the Napa house. But Susan's petition anticipates their counterargument, and in the event a judge finds the paragraph applies to the Tiburon house, she wants categories like "memorabilia" and "jewelry" narrowly defined.
