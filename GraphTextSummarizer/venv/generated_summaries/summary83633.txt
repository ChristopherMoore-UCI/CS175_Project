By staying in touch with those who are suffering with mental disorder, we are in the best position to help them -- and their parents -- to forestall any possible slip into violence. There are a large number of withdrawn, socially awkward young men in our society; some have mental disorders and some don't. Getting support and services to the people who matter to those with mental disorders is where the answer lies. But most people with mental disorders aren't in treatment. Besides they may be afraid to reveal problems to professionals who seem out of touch with their lives.
