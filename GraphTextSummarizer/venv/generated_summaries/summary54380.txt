"It will be everything you hope a Christmas movie with Mariah Carey would be." Lest we forget how much sparkle she can bring into our lives, check out this collection of Mariah Carey throwing shade. She's come a long way from "Glitter" Carey was ridiculed for the dismal 2001 film "Glitter," but she has more than since redeemed herself with small roles in the critically acclaimed Lee Daniels films "Precious" and "The Butler." Producer Jonathan Shestack confirmed that he is working on the yet-untitled project with Carey's good friend director Brett Ratner co-producing. All we want for Christmas is you, Mariah Carey!
