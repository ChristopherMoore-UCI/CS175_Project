An independent state of Scotland will reinforce its own laws, embrace new forms of political thinking, new creeds, new political parties, and new positions of argument. And at this vital time when the big battalions of political thinking of Westminster are mustering their final offensive against Scottish Independence, the very act of this coercion creates in the Scottish character a defiance and an understanding of their true spirit; a spirit which despite overbearing adversity remains fiercely independent in its constitution. The political systems of New Labour, Conservative and Liberal Democrats have atrophied in the UK; atrophied to such an extent that the dividing line between these ideologies have become increasingly blurred by each party's pragmatic desire for political power. This vote is not about nationalism, it is about social democracy, and for myself and the people of Scotland, social democracy is at the root of our desire for Independence. Independence will allow a new system to be put in place, and in Scotland's case, and for the people of Scotland, a system of social equality where the yoke of the old feudal ideologies are finally dismantled.
