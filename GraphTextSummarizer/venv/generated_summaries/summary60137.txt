Madden is the grand champion of bus riders, the winner of the lifetime achievement award. But in a chaotic and confused world, full of noise and anger and deadlines, the allure of cruising in splendid solitude through the country, seeing America mile by mile, the journey itself being the ultimate victory. . .
