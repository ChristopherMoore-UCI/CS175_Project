After his father's prison stint, Karl King said his mother continued to hold the family together while his "workaholic" father financially provided for the family during his rise to fame as Don King the promoter. When he's out of the limelight, King is a family man often quiet and deep in his thoughts, according to his son, Karl King. When asked about the odds of this event actually coming together, King says, "It's very difficult to believe, I understand that." Understanding King may help explain why he believes he can make this event happen. King heads back into his office, asking the ambassador the progress of the North Korea project. King knows the odds of the North Korea endeavor are not in his favor.
