In a letter Droukdel wrote last year and which was found by the Associated Press in Timbuktu last month, AQIM's leader criticized his subordinates in northern Mali for trying to introduce Islamic law too quickly in the  region and for imposing harsh punishments which he said jeopardized their whole project. Belmoktar and Zeid, while frequently bitter rivals, had both established camps in the Ifoghas as a precaution against international efforts to rid northern Mali of Islamic militants. He also sent an envoy to northern Mali to announce that Belmoktar had been relieved of his command. If both Abou Zeid and Belmoktar have been killed "it would be big news," according to Andrew Lebovich, a Senegal-based analyst who recently spent time in Mali, and has long followed the evolution of AQIM. Both men are -- or were -- Algerians, but had seized new opportunities in northern Mali, enriching themselves with smuggling and kidnapping operations, and taking advantage of their intimate knowledge of the desolate geography of the region.
