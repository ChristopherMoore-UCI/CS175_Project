Under the program, uniformed behavior detection officers scan passengers in line and engage them in brief verbal exchanges, identifying passengers who exhibit certain behaviors. The GAO said TSA tests of the program were flawed, and decades of published research on behavior detection "also draw into question the scientific underpinnings" of the program. "Behavior detection techniques have been an accepted practice for many years within the law enforcement, customs and border enforcement, defense, and security communities both in the United States and internationally," the TSA wrote in a response to the GAO. "The report released today by GAO displays what I have been saying for years -- that TSA's (detection) program is fundamentally flawed, cannot be proven effective, and should no longer be funded with taxpayers dollars," Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Mississippi, said in a written statement. Ten years after the Transportation Security Administration started a program to spot terrorists by observing passenger behavior, the agency has spent more than $900 million on the program but has yet to prove its effectiveness, congressional overseers say.
