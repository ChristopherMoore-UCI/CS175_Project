Djokovic has been a four-time runner up on the hard courts in Ohio and lost to John Isner in the quarterfinals last year. The world number one exited at this stage in Cincinnati Thursday to Spain's Tommy Robredo, beaten in straight sets, 7-6 7-5. Earlier, Isner had two match points against former Wimbledon and U.S. Open champion Andy Murray before the Briton emerged the winner in three sets. Fresh off his honeymoon and with his first child due, Djokovic went out to eventual winner Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in Toronto last week. "Just many, many, many things are not clicking these two weeks on hard courts," Djokovic told the official ATP Tour website.
