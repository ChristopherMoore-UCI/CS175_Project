Despite speculation, Facebook said at the time that it has no plans to merge WhatsApp, which lets users send unlimited messages for no more than 99 cents a year, with Messenger. "Taking messages out of the Facebook app also lets us focus on making Messenger even better for everyone rather than working on two separate Facebook messaging experiences." Once both apps are installed, tapping the "message" icon on the Facebook app will simply send the user to Messenger. In November, after Facebook launched Messenger 3.0, the company discontinued messaging in the core Facebook app for people who already had Messenger. Instead, they'll need to download Messenger, the dedicated texting app Facebook rolled out in 2011.
