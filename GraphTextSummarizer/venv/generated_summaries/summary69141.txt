It's familiar terrain to anyone who watched "Breaking Bad" and got to know Saul as Walter White's shady attorney, who aided the high school chemistry teacher's transition into a drug kingpin. The premiere of the new AMC series about Saul Goodman, the frenetic attorney from "Breaking Bad," is fast approaching. To get fans primed, the network unveiled a two-minute trailer, the most extensive look yet at the anticipated spinoff starring Bob Odenkirk. The trailer was part of AMC's day at the Television Critics Association's winter press tour. The trailer shows Saul fighting for his clients using every method possible, many of which are less than effective.
