-- "Slow and steady wins the race" may be the moral of a children's tale, but the adage didn't hold up over the weekend in the case of Clark the tortoise vs. California police. " Alhambra Police did not speculate whether drugs played a role in Clark's decision to lead them on a low-speed chase. But he was no match for local police, who found the creature wandering the streets east of Los Angeles. In short order, police say, Clark was reunited with his family. Locals chimed in on Facebook, most celebrating Clark's safe return.
