Since the blog was published last year, Nisanyan said, prosecutors have taken him to court simultaneously for this passage in three separate courts across Turkey. According to Turkey's semi-official Anatolian Agency, Nisanyan received a one year and 45-day jail sentence for "openly denigrating the religious values held by a certain portion of the population." International press freedom organizations have slammed Turkey in previous years for having more journalists in prison than any other country. "When I attacked the Islamist establishment they felt I overstepped my boundaries," said Nisanyan, who is a member of Turkey's tiny Armenian ethnic minority. Anatolian reported that Nisanyan's initial nine-month jail sentence was extended because "the crime was committed through the press." Turkey is a majority Muslim country.
