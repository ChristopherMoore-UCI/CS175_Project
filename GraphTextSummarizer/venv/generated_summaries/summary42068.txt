The project has been a labor of love for producer Debra Martin Chase for more than a decade. "We still live in an age where we don't have enough stories really dealing with African-American women, and dealing with their tensions and their conflicts," said black film historian and author Donald Bogle, who chronicled the original "Sparkle" and many other films in his seminal tome "Brown Sugar: Over 100 Years of America's Black Female Superstars. " "We still need movies about African-American women and not just movies like 'The Help,' where it's all about how they relate, basically, to white people. "Just thinking back to why this movie was important to me as a teenager and I know why it was important to Whitney; it was really the first time we saw the fabulous women of color on the screen, who were glamorous, the men were gorgeous, the clothes were gorgeous," Martin Chase told CNN this week. It's hard to believe that it's finally coming into fruition," Martin Chase said.
