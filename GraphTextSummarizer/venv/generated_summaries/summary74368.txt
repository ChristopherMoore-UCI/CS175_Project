-- Manchester United fans all around the world will be eagerly scouring for transfer news and gossip over the possible arrival of new players during the close season. Jones said shirt sales are dominated by the biggest clubs and figures would "closely mirror" the top of the "Football Money League" rich-list which would Real Madrid and Manchester United as the two biggest shirt-sellers worldwide. The world-record transfer of Cristiano Ronaldo to Real Madrid could be worth up to $75m a season in revenue to the Spanish giants, according to research commissioned by Weber Shandwick Sport with one of the world's leading sport business experts. The "Football Fans' Inflation Index" released earlier this year by Virgin Money has showed large increases in the cost of an average game day for fans which could result in a drop in kit sales. The new shirt, which is on sale now, certainly meets the approval of Chelsea winger Salomon Kalou who told the club's Web site: "The new kit is nice, so now let's see what happens in it during the new season." Of course, football kits are not just a way of visually separating two teams on a playing field; they are increasingly an important part of a club's commercial operations.
