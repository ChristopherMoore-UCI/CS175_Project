Like Murray, the Serbian is playing in his first tournament since Flushing Meadows, and wasted little time in beating Argentina's Carlos Berlocq in straight sets. It was the Scot's ninth win in a row after his U.S. Open triumph where he beat Novak Djokovic in the final in New York. " Murray holds a 7-4 winning career record against Wawrinka, who beat Jeremy Chardy of France 7-6 6-7 7-5 in a tight last 16 encounter. But Serbian pair Ana Ivanovic and Jelena Jankovic were third round casualties, losing to Romina Oprandi and Carla Suarez-Navarro respectively. In the accompanying WTA tournament at the same venue, Russia's Maria Sharapova began with a 6-2 6-2 win over Romania's Sorana Cirstea.
