The plane had been headed on a medical mission in the Mexican state of Baja California and lost radio contact with the ground on Friday afternoon, said Flying Samaritans President Victor Jones. -- Four Americans were killed in a small plane crash in northwestern Mexico, the president of the volunteer organization Flying Samaritans said Saturday. Flying Samaritans transports medical and support personnel to clinics in Baja California -- which is just south of California, the American state -- where they provide free medical services and supplies to those who lack medical care. The wreckage of a Beechcraft A36 plane and the bodies of the four volunteers were discovered Saturday "after an extensive ground, air and water search," Jones said in a statement Saturday. Radio contact with the plane was lost shortly after the pilot reported to the Ensenada airport on Friday when it was about 10 miles south of the airport, Jones said.
