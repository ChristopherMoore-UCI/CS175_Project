National outrage grew over Paterno's reaction to a graduate assistant's 2002 report that he had seen former Penn State defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky performing anal sex on a young boy in the shower room of the football complex. " Paterno, 84, the all-time winningest football coach in Division I history, was fired last week amid an outcry over the handling of abuse claims involving former Penn State defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky. -- Jay Paterno, Penn State's quarterbacks coach and son of legendary coach Joe Paterno, spoke out after weeks of public and personal challenges for his father. The family learned of the diagnosis after Paterno's follow-up visit last weekend for a bronchial illness, Scott Paterno said. Paterno said that he'd never been told the graphic details revealed in a grand jury report about sex abuse allegations, but that he nevertheless passed the allegations on to his boss.
