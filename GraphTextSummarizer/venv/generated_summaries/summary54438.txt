Ansaar Sharia, an extremist militant group with links to al Qaeda, took over large areas in Abyan province last May after government forces evacuated hundreds of troops from their original posts. At least 11 suspected al Qaeda militants were killed in Yemen's southern province of Abyan in clashes that erupted Tuesday night and continued for at least 14 hours, according to officials and local residents. A senior security official in Abyan said that government troops shelled militants' hideouts to force them out of Abyan. Security officials in Abyan told CNN that at least 65 foreign fighters were killed in Abyan since May. "They started entering the province in large numbers two months ago. He added, "Clashes with the militants were strong over the last four days -- and troops will not step down until the entire province is back in the hands of the government." Eyewitnesses in the area confirmed that at least four of the killed were foreign fighters, one of them from Saudi Arabia. "Because clashes were in the middle of the town, the bodies of foreigners laid on the roads for hours," said Abdullah Abu Kareem, a local in Zinjibar.
