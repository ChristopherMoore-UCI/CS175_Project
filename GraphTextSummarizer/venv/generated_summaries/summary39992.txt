Regional politics aside, the root cause of Karzai's apparent insecurity lies in Afghan domestic politics. It will be hard for needy Afghan forces to defend against these groups without strong logistical and financial backing. The donor community needs to reassure the Afghan people in the face of these fears and extend the hand of friendship that has generated Afghan support for a continued international presence in the country. Karzai's frustration to a large part stems from the inability -- perhaps unwillingness -- of Western forces to confront terrorists and extremists who are based in cross-border sanctuaries, with the exception of al Qaeda and, lately, outfits like the notorious Haqqani network. This does not mean that the Afghans, including Karzai, should blindly agree to Western terms.
