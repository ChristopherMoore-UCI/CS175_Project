-- Vowing to help return democracy to Pakistan, former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto ended eight years of self-imposed exile and returned Thursday to her native country, where she was greeted by a massive crowd of supporters. Minutes after her arrival at Karachi International Airport, Bhutto called for a return to democracy to repair Pakistan's tarnished image as a haven for terrorists. Hear Bhutto talk with CNN by phone upon arriving in Pakistan Â» Throngs of police and security guards fortified the city, strategically placed on rooftops and other posts in efforts to secure a peaceful homecoming. Some of Bhutto's critics warn that her desire to return to office is not simply about restoring democracy in Pakistan. Earlier this month, Musharraf cleared the way for Bhutto's return after agreeing to drop outstanding corruption charges against the former prime minister and a number of other politicians, as part of his own bid to stay in power.
