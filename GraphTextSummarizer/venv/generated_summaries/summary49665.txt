By 2020 some estimates put the amount of fuel ships will need at as high as 400 million tons -- just to sustain the increase in business they receive from the growth in global trade. They emit 20 percent of all sulphur dioxide emissions; • 30 percent of all nitrogen oxide emissions;  • As much as 1.2 billion tons of carbon dioxide;  • Ships are responsible for at least 60,000 pollution-related deaths a year -- Up until very recently, conventional wisdom held that shipping was a minor player in terms of greenhouse gas emissions. If the leaked documents from research submitted for the Interanko report are to be believed, the shipping industry's contribution is more than twice the amount previously believed (600 million tons) -- which would mean ships emit as much as 1.2 billion tons of greenhouse gases a year. Global trade pushes shipping The reason the shipping industry's carbon footprint is so large is essentially because of global trade.
