" Many younger gay men believe him: They say the seemingly anti-gay messages Ravi sent to his friends fall far short of proving the kind of hatred they think is worthy of a hate crime conviction. A new generation of gay people believe that Ravi is far from being an outright bigot. " Writing in Slate, 24-year-old gay editor and columnist J. Bryan Lowder said that while he certainly was not "excusing Ravi for his actions," he believes that "these civil rights statutes are being stretched to go after teenagers who acted meanly, but not violently.
