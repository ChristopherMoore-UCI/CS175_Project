This campaign was and will remain the great honor of my life, and my heart is filled with nothing but gratitude for the experience and to the American people for giving me a fair hearing before deciding that Sen. Obama and my old friend Sen. Joe Biden should have the honor of leading us for the next four years. He also congratulated Sen. Barack Obama. A little while ago, I had the honor of calling Sen. Barack Obama to congratulate him. Sen. Obama believes that, too. Sen. Obama has achieved a great thing for himself and for his country.
