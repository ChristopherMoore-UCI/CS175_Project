"Even the bread doesn't taste the same" Zaatari is the main collection point for Syrian refugees in Jordan. Their destination, like so many thousands before them, is the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan. This was our first day in Jordan, and nothing could have prepared us for the scene in front of us: Hundreds of refugees from Syria making the long walk to safety in Jordan, one long jagged line stretching out into the open desert. The population demographics in Zaatari are skewed towards women and children but also a surprising number of elderly residents. These are the scenes I remember the most from our journey from the Syria-Jordan border to Zaatari.
