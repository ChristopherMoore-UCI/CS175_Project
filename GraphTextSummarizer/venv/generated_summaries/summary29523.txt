Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey will monitor the expected flood streaming in through the official #AskObama hashtag. He is verbally answering questions from Twitter users, who were urged to use the hashtag #AskObama.

He's not typing and tweeting," White House spokesman Jay Carney said last week. White House officials have said the so-called "Tweetup" is a fresh opportunity for the president to engage with Americans beyond the Beltway.
