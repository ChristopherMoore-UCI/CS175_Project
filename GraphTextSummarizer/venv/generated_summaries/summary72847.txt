Bush tried to get the last laugh by telling Osbourne that Barbara Bush was a big fan of albums like "Sabbath Bloody Sabbath. Her rep tells the Washington Post that Lilo is going to be a guest of Fox News host Greta van Susteren, who must be a closet fan of "I Know Who Killed Me." For example: - In 2002, bat-biter Ozzy Osbourne attended and evidently stole the show from then-president George W. Bush. But I'm guessing nobody had time to wonder why these C-listers were in the building; guests must have been too busy gaping at Stephen Colbert's explosive speech. - This year, Lindsay may be upstaged by another headline-grabbing guest: Uggie, The Artist's adorable, heroic Jack Russell Terrier.
