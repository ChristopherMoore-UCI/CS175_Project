The manuscript sports the approval signature of the district's then-superintendent and reveals that Molly Ringwald's character, Claire Standish, was originally to be named Cathy Douglas, according to the Tribune. "One day a few weeks ago, one of the assistants was going through a filing cabinet and found a file that had a manuscript from 'The Breakfast Club' dated Sept. 21, 1983," Ken Wallace, superintendent of Maine Township High School District 207 in suburban Chicago, told the newspaper. The file was discovered at Maine South High School as district officials prepared to move to a newly acquired building next door. The movie was filmed at the Maine North High School building, which was auctioned off by the district years ago and is now occupied by the Illinois State Police, according to the Tribune. Wallace told the Tribune that he would like to find a way to display the script as a piece of film -- and district -- history.
