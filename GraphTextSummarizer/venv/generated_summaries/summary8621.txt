A 10-year deal has been signed with Goodwood Racecourse which is being described as the 'single biggest sponsorship deal ever done for the benefit of British racing.' It's been one of the most memorable labels in British horse racing history but to the undoubted dismay of traditionalists, Glorious Goodwood is no more. "The sponsorship demonstrates Qatar's further commitment to British racing and, with such huge prize money on offer, we hope it will help to attract international runners from all over the world as well as continuing to see the best in Britain, France and Ireland. Our partnership with Qatar will make an enormous contribution to horse racing in the UK." "We look forward to working with Lord March and the team at Goodwood and taking the racing festival to a world class racing platform."
