For much of his time at United Giggs was part of a group of homegrown players affectionately known as the "Class of 92" -- referring to the year United won the FA Youth Cup. Few players could have controlled a top-level match the way Giggs did this week, orchestrating United's 5-0 demolition of Bayer Leverkusen in a Champions League group match. On Sunday Giggs could make his 954th appearance for United in its match against Tottenham Hotspur. Giggs, David Beckham, Paul Scholes, Nicky Butt and Gary and Phil Neville all broke into the first team together and went on to achieve era-defining success under the tutelage of legendary United manager Alex Ferguson, who retired last season after 26 years at the helm. United manager David Moyes, who took over from Ferguson at Old Trafford, is still a keen admirer of Giggs' talents.
