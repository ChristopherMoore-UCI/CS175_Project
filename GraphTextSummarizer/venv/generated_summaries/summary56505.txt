Twitter says the new profile will highlight specific tweets and allow people searching through profile pages to find the kind of tweets they want. Among the first Twitter users to get the new profile design: first lady Michelle Obama (@flotus), boxer Floyd Mayweather (@FloydMayweather), actress Kerry Washington (@kerrywashington), and the band Weezer (@weezer). Calling the changes "a whole new you," Twitter announced Tuesday that it will be rolling out a fresh design and new features to user profile pages. The new profile pages are currently available only to a small group of existing users as well as those new to Twitter. For example, followers can choose to see just tweets with photos and videos or replies in Twitter conversations.
