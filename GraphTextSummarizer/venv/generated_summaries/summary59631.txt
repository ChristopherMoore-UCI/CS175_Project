Since the IWC's moratorium on commercial whaling came into force in 1986, Japan has continued to hunt whales under the guise of "scientific research," making a mockery of the moratorium. But its collective failure means that 24 years after the establishment of the moratorium on commercial whaling, Japan, Iceland and Norway will continue again to hunt whales with impunity. And yet, the IWC continues to close its doors and ears to the reality of Japan's commercial whaling. By claiming that slaughtering thousands of whales, in waters designated a whale sanctuary no less, is a scientific experiment needed to understand whales, Japan has violated the spirit and intention of the moratorium as well as the Southern Ocean Whaling Sanctuary. All three whalers claimed that whale meat was routinely embezzled, with the full knowledge of government and whaling fleet operator officials.
