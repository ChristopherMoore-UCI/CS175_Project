Rolling Stone: Kanye reveals new album title The bagged air gag has inspired a rash of similar items like "Ziplock bag of air from Garth Brooks concert" and "Kanye West Concert Air-Infused Bay Leaves," with the latter tagged with a $4,999 opening bid. (Rolling Stone)Kanye West fans are used to seeing thousand-dollar price tags attached to the rapper's Air Yeezy sneakers when they're put up for sale on eBay, but the auction site is now being overrun by sellers offering up plastic bags full of air allegedly captured at West's concerts. While that auction was ultimately pulled from the auction site, eBay has since been flooded with similar auctions promising air bagged from a Yeezus show, even though the copycats lacked certificates of authenticity proving the air -- likely carbon dioxide -- was grabbed at a West concert. In other Kanye eBay news, following the soft launch of his Yeezy 750 Boost, his first footwear collaboration with Adidas, pairs of those sneakers are now littered throughout the site with prices ranging from $1,700 to $5,000. The gag started Friday when one ambitious seller attempted to sell a Zipperseal bag with "Air From Kanye Show," with 90 bidders driving the price tag to over $60,000, the Telegraph reports.
