-- A top European Union official expressed concern Thursday about the condition of former Ukrainian prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko, saying she was roughed up in prison. "Today the Ukrainian Ombudsperson's Office confirmed that Ms. Tymoshenko was subjected to physical violence during the transfer from her cell to a hospital on 20 April," read a statement from Ashton's office. Last October, a Ukrainian court found Tymoshenko guilty of abuse of authority for signing overpriced gas contracts with Russia and sentenced her to the seven-year prison term. Thursday, however, the spokesman for EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton said Tymoshenko's claim was confirmed. Amnesty International has slammed the verdict as "politically motivated" and called for the release of Tymoshenko, who was prime minister from January to September 2005 and December 2007 to March 2010.
