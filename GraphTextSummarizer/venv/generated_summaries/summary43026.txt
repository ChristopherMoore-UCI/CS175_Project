Video of the car striking Valencia sparking nationwide debate on what type of force police should use to go after armed suspects. Officer who drove into suspect justified, chief says KVOA obtained police inquiry tapes on which Rapiejko tells investigators why he chose his car as a weapon. Valencia's attorney, Michelle Cohen-Metzger, told CNN last week that "it is miraculous that my client isn't dead." Valencia, who is in Pima County Jail, is scheduled to appear in court again on May 18. Officer Michael Rapiejko ran his car into Mario Valencia in February as the suspect carried a rifle he had just fired in the air. Rapiejko sped around another officer as Valencia walked through a business park, hit the man from behind with the left side of his front bumper.
