Sevilla's fifth win of the season took them above Real Sociedad and into the European places on 17 points, nine behind leaders Real Madrid. Goals from Alvaro Negredo and Alejandro Alfaro sealed victory for the hosts -- a task that was made much easier when Valencia midfielder Mehmet Topal was shown a straight red card. Sevilla striker Luis Fabiano wasted two good early openings for the home side while at the other end Juan Manuel Mata forced Javi Varas into a smart save. But the game turned on 25 minutes when Mehmet Topal flew into a challenge on Martín Cáceres and got his marching orders. But it was 2-0 on 77 minutes when Alfaro headed home Mouhamadou Dabo's cross from close range.
