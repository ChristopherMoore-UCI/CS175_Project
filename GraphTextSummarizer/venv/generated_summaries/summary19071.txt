-- I was walking down 125th Street in Harlem last week when my iPhone beeped to alert me that New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg had proposed saving obesity-prone urbanites from themselves by banning restaurant sales of large sugary sodas and teas. Autocratically imposing public health measures rather than persuading people of their worth can easily backfire. Moreover, the force of law can have disproportionate effects on segments of society: In this case, the obese are more likely to be poor people of color who can least afford the premium they will end up paying for their supersize drinks. The center also elevated social expectations around problems such as binge drinking and violence, not via punitive bans and "sin taxes," but by education and celebrity examples that helped to transform unhealthy activities into socially unacceptable activities. Bloomberg attempts to convince us that the sugar consumers are hurting others, feeding urgency by declaring that the city spends $4 billion a year on medical care for overweight people.
