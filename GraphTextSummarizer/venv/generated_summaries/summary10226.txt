Emirates Team New Zealand have been one win away from clinching the Auld Mug since last Wednesday, but Oracle Team USA never looked like losing Monday's race at San Francisco Bay. -- Oracle Team USA's improbable America's Cup comeback gathered further momentum on Monday after a fifth straight win over challengers Emirates Team New Zealand. " Emirates Team New Zealand skipper Dean Barker remains confident his team can win the series despite Oracle's recent charge. The boat's just going fantastic," Oracle Team USA skipper Jimmy Spithill told the official America's Cup website. In order to prevent defeat, Oracle Team USA need to win the final three races of the competition, starting with race 17 on Tuesday, with race 18 scheduled to take place the same day should it be required.
