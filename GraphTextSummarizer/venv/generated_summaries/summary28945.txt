Sharapova has history in setting fashion trends -- the diamond-encrusted 'Little Black Dress" she wore on the way to winning the 2006 U.S. Open was widely acclaimed. "Since I was young, the artistic expression that fashion embodies has inspired me," Sharapova said. Sharapova is intimately involved in the design process of the outfit to which she lends her name, coming up with sketches and design ideas. "The carefully-constructed vents with mesh inlays along the bodice reflect the breathable gills of a powerful shark or super-charged race car and help keep Sharapova cool and ready to attack. " When Sharapova does decide to hang up her rackets, it is fair to assume that she will utilize her flair for design and business savvy to extend her fashion empire.
