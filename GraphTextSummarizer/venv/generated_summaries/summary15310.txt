The spokeswoman told CNN the emphasis should be on academics, and noted squads express their spirit during school hours at several schools in different ways. Before the compromise was announced, she told CNN affiliate WFLA that her "shorter than mid-thigh" skirt was a part of tradition: The football players and cheerleaders wear their uniforms each Friday during school on game day. The decision to prohibit cheerleader skirts during classroom hours had been ridiculed as short in spirit by some Countryside High School cheerleaders and parents. School leaders said the uniforms just weren't appropriate for classrooms and didn't fit into student dress codes. Jeana said dressing up for game day is a way for students to get excited for the football game.
