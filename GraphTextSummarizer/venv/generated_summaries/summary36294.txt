A note that was "threatening in nature" was found near where her 17-year-old daughter discovered her lying unconscious in the dining area of her home in El Cajon in San Diego County last Wednesday, Redman said. Shaima Alawadi, a 32-year-old mother of five, died of a severe head injury after she was taken off life support Saturday, El Cajon, California, Police Chief Jim Redman said at a news conference. Although the investigation is "still in the early stages" and police "have not drawn any conclusions," Redman did say evidence leads them to "strongly believe that this was an isolated incident." Detectives obtained a search warrant for the family's home because a court order is "just the best way to recover evidence," Redman said. And so the day they hurt her, they left it again and it said the same thing." Hanif Mohebi, executive director of the San Diego chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said the family came to the United States from Iraq in the mid-1990s.
