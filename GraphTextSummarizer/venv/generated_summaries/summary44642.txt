" Militants in the southern oil-producing region, who have been fighting for years over fairer distribution of the country's oil wealth, have abducted oil workers, and people engaged in criminal activity have snatched up citizens to get ransom money. Kidnappings and rape in Abia state are common and have become more frequent in recent years. The bus driver and the school teacher who were on board are in police custody and helping law enforcement efforts. As foreign oil workers improved their personal security, the kidnappers have increasingly targeted Nigerians. A statement from the president's office said the Nigerian leader order the Inspector-General of Police and heads of other security agencies "to take all necessary steps to rescue the abducted children and return them safely to their parents."
