FAA air traffic controllers and company employees are sometimes permitted to ride in cockpit jump seats so they can learn about life "on the other side of the frequency," as it's sometimes called. -- A company dispatcher who was seated in the cockpit jump seat as Southwest Airlines Flight 4013 landed at the wrong Missouri airport has been placed on paid leave pending the outcome of the investigation, the company told CNN on Tuesday. The dispatcher will give investigators another source of information and open up another line of questions surrounding the landing at M. Graham Clark Downtown Airport near the resort community of Branson, Missouri. An industry official said the Federal Aviation Administration, which is conducting its own investigation, has reviewed the actions of air traffic controllers at Branson Airport and "indicate that there appears to be no controller issue." The pilots of Sunday's flight, which departed from Chicago's Midway airport, remain on paid leave.
