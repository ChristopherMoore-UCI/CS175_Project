-- France and some other NATO nations may begin to withdraw some troops from Afghanistan next year -- but the move is not tied to a threat issued against the country supposedly by Osama bin Laden, the country's defense minister said Thursday. Al Qaeda has issued a series of threats against France in the past, and French citizens have been killed by groups in Africa claiming affiliation with Bin Laden's group. In the tape, a man believed to be bin Laden warns France to get its troops out of Afghanistan and not to oppress Muslims at home. Minister Herve Morin told French radio station RTL that France will begin to transfer the control of certain districts to Afghans in 2011. France has 3,750 troops in Afghanistan, according to NATO's International Security Assistance Force.
