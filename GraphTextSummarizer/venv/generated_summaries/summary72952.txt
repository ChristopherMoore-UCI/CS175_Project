-- The two women shot and wounded by Los Angeles police during the manhunt for renegade ex-officer Christopher Dorner are "not doing well," their attorney said Thursday at a news conference to announce a resolution to the loss of their bullet-riddled pickup truck. Dorner died February 12 while holed up in a cabin that caught fire when police fired tear gas canisters into it. Margie Carranza, 47, and her mother, Emma Hernandez, 71, will receive $40,000 to replace the truck, Los Angeles City Attorney Carmen Trutanich said. Carranza and Hernandez were shot as police searched for Dorner, a former police officer who was wanted for killing several people in early February. "They're not doing well," attorney Glen Jonas said.
