The decision halts a move that could have thrown doubt on future efforts to prop up the euro and gives embattled Chancellor Angela Merkel breathing space. Berlin has been pouring money into the economies of Greece and Ireland in an effort to save the common European currency they all share, the euro -- a move that has angered many Germans and badly hurt Merkel's popularity. The court ruling is a partial victory for Merkel, but it limits the future ability of a German government to pump cash into weaker economies. The ruling means in the future the chancellor will not be able to move quickly to prop up problem euro zone economies. Lawmakers "must remain in control of fundamental budget policy decisions," the court said in ordering "mandatory approval" by parliament of bailouts in the future.
