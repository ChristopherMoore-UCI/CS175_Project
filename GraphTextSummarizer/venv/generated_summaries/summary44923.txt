"It's a Wonderful Life: The Rest of the Story" will be written by Bob Farnsworth, known primarily as a music producer, and Martha Bolton, whose resume largely consists of her work done on Bob Hope specials in the 1980s and '90s. To help bridge the two films, producers announced that Karolyn Grimes, who at 6-years-old played Zuzu Bailey alongside Jimmy Stewart and Donna Reed, will reprise her role. According to a news release from film financier Allen J. Schwalb and his company Star Partners, "It's a Wonderful Life: The Rest of the Story" will tell what happened to the Baileys of Bedford Falls after the first movie ended. Schwalb has financed a long list of films -- including "Rain Man," "The Color Purple" and "Thelma and Louise" -- but most of them were hits in the last century, and his credits as a producer appear to be minimal. For his part, Schwalb says this new movie would continue the classic story for "an entirely new generation of moviegoers" and he is proud "to be involved in moving this story forward."
