-- From a Chinese pop idol to a champion of ethnic minorities in China, singer Dadawa is a musician like no other. It struck a chord with a global audience -- it was the first time in 45 years that a Chinese album had been launched globally -- but also brought criticism from across China including those in Tibet. " Her imagination and travel led her away from the Chinese pop scene to Tibet that inspired the 1995 album "Sister Drum". Zhu has recorded four albums as Dadawa since her 1995 debut, but she has also spent much of her time promoting the ethnic culture and music of China as a U.N. Goodwill Ambassador.
