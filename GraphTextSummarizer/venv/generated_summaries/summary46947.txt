In a statement, Walmart said the crash had been a "terrible tragedy" and that it wished full recoveries to Morgan and two others injured with him, comedian Ardley Fuqua and Morgan's personal assistant Jeffrey Millea. According to the complaint filed by lawyers acting for Morgan and three others, the truck driven by Walmart employee Kevin Roper collided with the rear end of Morgan's vehicle. Morgan has been released from a rehabilitation center and will "continue his recovery at home with an aggressive outpatient program," his representative, Lewis Kay, said Saturday. -- Comedian Tracy Morgan is suing Walmart over a deadly limo bus crash on the New Jersey Turnpike that left him critically injured. The fourth plaintiff in the lawsuit is Millea's wife, Krista.
