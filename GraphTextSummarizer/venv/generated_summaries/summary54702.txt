Fifth-placed Tottenham also suffered frustration ahead of Tuesday's Champions League quarterfinal first leg away to Real Madrid, being held goalless by bottom team Wigan. Eighth-placed Bolton lost 2-1 at Birmingham, a victory which lifted the League Cup winners out of the bottom three as veteran striker Kevin Phillips and midfielder Craig Gardner scored before Johan Elmander's consolation. Liverpool's bid to catch Tottenham and secure a Europa League place faltered after a 2-1 defeat at former manager Roy Hodgson's new team West Brom. Slovakia defender Martin Skrtel headed Liverpool into the lead five minutes after halftime, but Chris Brunt leveled with a penalty just after the hour and then netted the winner from the spot with a minute to go as Nigeria striker striker Peter Odemwingie was fouled both times. Newcastle moved up to ninth place with a 4-1 win over second-bottom Wolverhampton, who remained behind West Ham on goal difference.
