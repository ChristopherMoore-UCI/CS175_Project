Celebration Cruise Line said in a statement that passengers were told to put on life vests and the ship returned to port after the boat hit something while leaving Grand Bahamas Island around 9 p.m. Friday, "No passengers were ever in any danger, and everything was handled in an organized and efficient way by ship, corporate and Bahamian personnel," the cruise line said. And Bimini SuperFast helped return the cruise ship's 960 stranded passengers and crew to Port Miami on Saturday evening, Resorts World Bimini spokeswoman Heather Krasnow said in a statement. Hours after the alarm first sounded, passengers made it off the boat, Fana said. "As we were walking out of the room, the whole boat just went black." Passengers started to panic, he said. Ultimately, passengers were housed in resorts on the island, Celebration said.
