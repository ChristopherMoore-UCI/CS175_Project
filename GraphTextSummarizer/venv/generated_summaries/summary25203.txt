Federer's route to a second success in Estoril has been made easier by the withdrawal of Croatian second seed Ivan Ljubicic, who has pulled out due to the stomach strain that ended the world No. 14's campaign in Rome. -- World No. 1 Roger Federer got his European clay season up and running at the second attempt with a routine win in his opening match at the Estoril Open in Portugal on Wednesday. Meanwhile, top seed Marin Cilic won his opening match at the BMW Open in Munich, moving into the second round as he completed a rain-delayed 6-4 6-2 victory over Michael Berrer on Wednesday. The 28-year-old, returning to the tournament that he won on his debut there in 2008, will next play another seeded player in Friday's quarterfinals when he takes on French veteran Arnaud Clement. The Swiss superstar was upset by young Latvian Ernests Gulbis in Rome last month, but had no such problems against German journeyman Bjorn Phau as he triumphed 6-3 6-4 in the third-tier ATP Tour event.
