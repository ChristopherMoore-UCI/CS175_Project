In an eerily similar incident in May 2004, former Springbok rugby player Rudi Visagie was awoken by his wife, who heard a car in their driveway in Nelspruit, South Africa. Visagie was a household name and had represented South Africa in a series of international rugby games. " Pistorius left jail last week after posting a cash bond of about $11,200, with an additional $100,800 due by March 1. "I heard Rudi growling," his wife, Frieda Visagie, said. People in such situations go through a lot of emotions, including fear, anger and helplessness, Frieda Visagie said.
