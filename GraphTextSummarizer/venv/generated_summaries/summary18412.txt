Federal spending must immediately be drastically slashed across the board: Abolish the useless departments of Education and Agriculture, among others; get rid of the EPA; and repeal the stimulus bill and other pork spending. The Tea Party endorses massive reductions of federal spending before any consideration of new taxes is brought to the table. The federal government is addicted to spending, and the consequences are now staring us in the face. We do not understand nor approve of Washington's insatiable appetite for spending, because that's not the way we as individuals live. Foreign aid and Pentagon spending must be equally constrained and reduced.
