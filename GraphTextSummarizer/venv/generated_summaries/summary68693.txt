-- Registered child sex offenders in Simi Valley, California, will not have to post a sign outside their home this Halloween reading in part "no candy," but they still are prohibited from decorating their houses and handing out candy, a federal judge ruled Tuesday. The Simi Valley law placed the following Halloween restrictions on child sex offenders within the city who appear on a statewide database: -- Post a sign stating "No candy or treats at this residence" -- Leave all outdoor lighting off during the evening -- Attorney told CNN before the ruling that she believed the signs would attract more attention to her clients' homes and could incite vandalism or violence. "Plaintiffs have, however, made a clear showing that they are likely to succeed on the merits of their facial challenge to the sign posting requirement of the Halloween Ordinance and that they are likely to suffer irreparable harm absent a temporary restraining order," Anderson wrote. "This requirement, if enforced, would have branded registrants and placed them as well as member of their families at significant risk of harm.
