-- French shoemaker Christian Louboutin is seeing red -- and will likely be seeing a lot more of it -- after a  judge in Manhattan denied an injunction that would have kept fellow designer Yves Saint Laurent from selling shoes with red soles. In fact, Louboutin's red soles have graced many a red carpets, adorning the feet of celebrities Oprah Winfrey, Heidi Klum and Sarah Jessica Parker. " "Everyone sees the flash of red and associates the red with Louboutin," attorney Harley Lewin said Thursday about his client. In his decision Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Victor Marrero acknowleded that in choosing a red sole for his shoes, Louboutin had "departed from longstanding conventions and norms of his industry," to create a product, "so eccentric and striking that it is easily perceived and remembered." However, Marrero went on to say that, "Louboutin's claim to the 'the color red' is, without some limitation, overly broad and inconsistent with the scene of trademark registration. Judge Marrero's decision drew parallels between painters and fashion designers, calling them both members of a creative industry where no one should be barred from using color to achieve their aesthetic.
