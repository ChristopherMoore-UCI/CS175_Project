Australia batsman David Warner struck young England counterpart Joe Root in an Australian-themed bar in the English city of Birmingham in the early hours of Monday morning. " The 26-year-old was fined $5,500 for a Twitter tirade he directed at Australian cricket journalist Robert Craddock Warner, who also aimed slurs at Craddock's colleague Malcolm Conn, took exception to an article Craddock had written about the Indian Premier League (IPL). The last Ashes series, which was held in Australia between November 2010 and January 2011, was won 3-1 by England. As well as being fined $11,000, he cannot play for Australia until the first Ashes Test against England begins on July 10. Warner had to sit out Wednesday's Champions Trophy match with New Zealand, and Cricket Ausrtalia announced Thursday that he will miss the rest of the limited-overs tournament.
