"The bus hurtled down several hundred meters from the serpentine mountainous road ... killing 18 passengers on the spot while 14 injured were evacuated to hospital," Dilbagh Singh, inspector general of police in the Jammu zone, told CNN. Highway accidents are common in the area because of bad road conditions, overloading and speeding. "We pressed into service army choppers to ferry the injured to hospital for specialized treatment. A senior police officer said the bus rolled into a deep gorge beside the Jammu-Srinagar highway after it skidded off the road when the driver lost control. He said some of the injured were in serious condition.
