The San Giorgio, a navy ship that was converted to rescue migrants under Mare Nostrum and which was the primary rescue vehicle, is still active in such missions and was used last week to rescue those on board the burning Greek ferry, Norman Atlantic. " Ships equipped with cells, quarantine areas While Operation Mare Nostrum is over in name, Italian naval assets are still carrying out rescues in cooperation with Frontex vessels, which call them in to help. Faced with a crisis off its shores, Italy launched Operation Mare Nostrum ("Our Sea") to try to find and rescue stranded migrants.
