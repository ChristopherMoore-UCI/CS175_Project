-- Anders Behring Breivik boasted Tuesday that he had carried out "the most sophisticated and spectacular political attack in Europe since World War II" when he killed 77 people in Norway last summer. Breivik faces trial on charges of voluntary homicide and committing acts of terror in the July 22 rampage. Breivik says his rampage was meant to save Norway from being taken over by multicultural forces and to prevent ethnic cleansing of Norwegians. A court translator initially said Breivik was claiming self-defense as the justification, but court officials corrected that Tuesday, saying the correct legal term was "necessity." "He is very satisfied that he has been able to explain himself today as he wished," Lippestad said. She ruled that his testimony would not be broadcast, and court papers indicated the five judge hearing the case did not want the trial to become a platform for Breivik to air his political views, or for them to distract from the legal issues involved.
