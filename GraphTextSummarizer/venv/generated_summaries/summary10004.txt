Ashlynn's stepfather, Jesse Browning, is a logger who appears on the reality show the History Channel describes as a series about "the treacherous life of Pacific Northwest timber cutters." The child was pronounced dead on arrival after she was flown by helicopter to a Portland hospital, Williams said. -- The stepdaughter of Jesse Browning, the star of a reality show about loggers, was attacked and killed by the family's dog in Astoria, Oregon, an investigator said.
