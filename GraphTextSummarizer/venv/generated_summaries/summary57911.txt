-- French soccer star Nicolas Anelka has decided to quit English Premier League club West Bromwich Albion following his punishment for making a controversial "quenelle" gesture. " Anelka joined West Brom on a one-year deal in August, and his two goals against West Ham on December 28 were his first for the club. "I have taken the decision to free myself and put an end to the contract linking me with West Bromwich Albion," Anelka wrote in French on his Twitter page on Friday -- his 35th birthday. Anelka was widely criticized by performing the "quenelle" -- which involves pointing a straightened arm downwards while touching the shoulder of that arm with the other hand -- after scoring against West Ham. " West Brom, however, said Friday it had yet to hear officially from Anelka -- whose ban was due to start this weekend, with the club outside the Premier League's bottom three on goal difference, having 10 matches to play.
