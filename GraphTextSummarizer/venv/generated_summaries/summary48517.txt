Coast Guard members and Boston Harbor Cruises conducted checks to ensure the boat's safety before it headed back to shore, Clegg said. -- After more than 12 hours stuck at sea, passengers aboard a whale-watching boat off the Massachusetts coast reached shore and safely docked in Boston on Tuesday morning, the Coast Guard said. On Tuesday morning, the line entangling the propeller was released, Coast Guard Petty Officer MyeongHi Clegg said. Three Coast Guard crews had been on the scene, with one vessel offering medical support as needed. The Coast Guard vessel Tybee helped escort the boat.
