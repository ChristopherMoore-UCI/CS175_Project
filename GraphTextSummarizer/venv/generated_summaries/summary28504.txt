Also last year, five activists were arrested, tried and convicted for publicly insulting top UAE officials, committing acts that pose a threat to state security, undermining public order, opposing the government system and instigating others to break laws. Unlike many other nations in the region, the UAE was never affected by Arab Spring inspired protests. According to Samer Muscati, Middle East researcher for Human Rights Watch, at least three online activists have been detained in recent weeks. UAE officials have not yet commented on the closures. According to the NDI, while the organization has a regional office in Dubai, it does not have any programs in the UAE.
