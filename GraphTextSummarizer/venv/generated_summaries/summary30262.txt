-- He is still a long-shot to win -- but centrist candidate Hassan Rouhani has suddenly injected fresh intrigue in Iran's upcoming presidential elections. He's the only cleric among the eight candidates, has close ties to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and served in Iran's parliament for two decades. But there are strong signs that Rouhani is trying to revive Iran's dormant reform movement -- and some observers say that could give the 65-year-old cleric a fighting chance. During his exchange with the show host, Rouhani did what few Iranian politicians dare do -- accuse Iran's state-run media of censorship and lies. Despite his growing popularity among opposition circles, Rouhani has long been a part of Iran's ruling establishment.
