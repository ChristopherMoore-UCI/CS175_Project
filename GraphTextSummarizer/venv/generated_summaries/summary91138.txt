Airlines collect $6 billion in baggage fees After top-scorer Virgin America, Southwest Airlines and JetBlue Airways, which both scored an 85, rated highly for their check-in ease, cabin-crew service and baggage handling. The full report is available to subscribers online at ConsumerReports.org and in the July issue of Consumer Reports magazine. Survey respondents were asked to rate their airlines' check-in process, cabin service, cabin cleanliness, seating, in-flight entertainment and baggage handling. "While other airlines on the list like Southwest and JetBlue have done a very good job of satisfying fliers, Virgin America is a cut above in the eyes of our readers," said Amanda Walker, a Consumer Reports senior editor, in a statement. -- Virgin America topped the latest airline satisfaction rankings from Consumer Reports, the first time the 6-year-old airline has appeared on the list.
