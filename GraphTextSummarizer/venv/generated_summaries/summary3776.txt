According to the Federal Aviation Administration, government inspectors discovered that new Colgan crew members were trained using a type of halon fire extinguisher found on Saab 340 aircraft, instead of the type installed on the Q400 planes they were staffing. "We hope the facts presented in our response result in the proposed fine being reduced or removed," said Eric Epperson of Pinnacle Airlines Corp., Colgan's parent company. -- Colgan Air, a regional airline, faces a nearly $1.9 million fine after it allegedly allowed 84 flight attendants to fly for a week after the airline was informed they had been trained on fire extinguishers that were different from those used on their aircraft. "Colgan Air was using the same type extinguisher for both the Saab 340B and Q400 training, although the Q400 extinguisher has a hose," Epperson said. "Upon notification and out of an abundance of caution, Colgan updated our training manuals and retrained all flight attendants to ensure full flight attendant understanding," he said.
