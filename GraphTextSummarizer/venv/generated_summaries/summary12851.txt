Penalties ensued somewhat inevitably and it was Argentina which held its nerve with goalkeeper Romero the hero. While Brazil had leaked goals in its shambolic defeat by Germany, Argentina displayed true grit and then calm under pressure in a penalty shootout to book its place in the World Cup final for the first time in 24 years -- the fifth in its history. Robben's low effort forced Sergio Romero into a routine save in an otherwise unremarkable opening 15 minutes of extra time. "I'm very happy because we reached the final and now we will see what we can do," Argentina coach Alejandro Sabella told reporters. This was the result which Brazil feared -- the scenario it never wanted to face, to have Argentina, its oldest foe, walk out at the Maracana on Sunday just 90 minutes away becoming world champions.
