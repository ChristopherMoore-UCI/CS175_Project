The list does not include missing women from neighboring East Cleveland, which has a separate police department. Cleveland police say they are doing the best they can and acknowledge their list of missing people is incomplete and difficult to keep accurate. On Wednesday, groups of local residents went into wooded areas and several abandoned homes in East Cleveland, looking for bodies or signs of missing women who might have been kidnapped or assaulted. "I would predict that 500 women are missing in the city of Cleveland and East Cleveland," said Art McKoy, leader of a group called Black on Black Crime. With the discovery of the three missing women's remains, the question is being asked often here: What's happening to women in Cleveland?
