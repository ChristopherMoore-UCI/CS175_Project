Residents of Pine Mountain Lake and another area were to be allowed to return home beginning Saturday evening. While the Rim Fire has consumed 12,000 acres in the northwest section of Yosemite National Park, so far it has had little or no direct impact on Yosemite Valley, a popular spot for tourists and home to many of the famous cliffs and waterfalls in the park. The inferno threatened the Yosemite gateway communities of Groveland and Pine Mountain Lake just outside the Stanislaus Forest. "We are on a voluntary evacuation order," Riley told CNN on Saturday afternoon. Fire crews strengthened lines above Pine Mountain Lake, a resort neighborhood.
