"The sheriff's office believes Sylar did not wander from the campground, and he is presumably dead," Yavapai County Sheriff Steve Waugh said Monday. Emmett's disappearance is believed to be unrelated to the case of Sylar Newton, another 2-year-old who was reported missing July 25 from a camping site in Rimrock, Yavapai County Sheriff's Office spokesman Dwight D'Evelyn said. -- A second 2-year-old boy has gone missing in 10 days from Yavapai County, Arizona, authorities said Tuesday as they announced a major search effort under way for the toddler, identified as Emmett Trapp. Emmett was reported missing by his mother at 8 p.m. Monday, the sheriff's office said in a news release. When the mother awoke from a nap Monday evening, Emmett -- last seen wearing a pajama top and a diaper -- was missing.
