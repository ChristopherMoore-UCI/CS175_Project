. Government spokesperson Simon Kedikoglou cited chronic corruption and mismanagement of funds as reasons for the closure. At least several of ERT's three TV channels and radio services went off the air early Wednesday. "At a time when the Greek people are enduring sacrifices, there is no room for delay, hesitation or tolerance for sacred cows," Kedikoglou said in announcement shown on the broadcaster. Hundreds of employees gathered outside the ERT Athens headquarters to protest the move. Existing employees will be able to apply for new positions.
