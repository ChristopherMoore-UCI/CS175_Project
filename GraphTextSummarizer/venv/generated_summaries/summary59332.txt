In one, Bryan Cranston plays a nuclear engineer with a tragic past who's racing to expose the truth about a series of seismic anomalies, Aaron Taylor-Johnson is his estranged soldier son, and Ken Watanabe and Sally Hawkins are a pair of exposition-spouting scientists trying to keep straight faces while talking about electromagnetic pulses and mankind's hubris. As an appetizer, though, he gives us a pair of ''MUTOs'' (massive unidentified terrestrial organisms) â€” a male and female duo of giant, Giger-esque creatures with sleek pincer jaws that resemble humongous staple removers. I was one of those kids who wasted their youth watching "Creature Double Feature" smackdowns between Godzilla and his arsenal of enemy combatants such as Mothra and Ghidorah. Unlike last year's disappointing Pacific Rim, Godzilla actually shows us its monsters without a scrim of rain and a cloak of darkness.
