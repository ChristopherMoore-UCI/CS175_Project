"I intend to be faithful to my oath of office and keep working to protect the Idaho Constitution and the mandate of Idaho voters in support of traditional marriage." "When same-sex couples are married, just as when opposite sex couples are married, they serve as models of loving commitment to all." The 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals struck down current bans on same-sex marriage in the two states, and later ordered its ruling to go into effect immediately. Utah is among the states where marriage licenses were issued to same-sex couples for a brief period before stays were issued by the courts earlier this year, leaving a good deal of uncertainty over whether those marriages were valid. Colorado and Utah announced Tuesday it would order county clerks to begin issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples.
