Shayanna Jenkins, the fiancee of former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez, revealed for the first time Monday she suspects marijuana was in a box she was instructed to remove from the couple's home the day after the slaying of Odin Lloyd in 2013. Hernandez has been charged with murder and has pleaded not guilty to orchestrating the death of Lloyd, the boyfriend of Shayanna Jenkins' sister and semipro football player who was found dead June 17, 2013. On Monday, Shayanna Jenkins was asked about what she called  an "on-again, off-again" relationship with Hernandez, her high school sweetheart. Home surveillance video played inside the courtroom Monday showed  Shayanna Jenkins hoisting a black garbage bag from her home and putting it in a trunk of her sister's car. After Hernandez proposed in October 2012, Jenkins said she continued to tolerate his infidelity.
