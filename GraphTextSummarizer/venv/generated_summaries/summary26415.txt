-- Billionaire Donald Sterling opposes his wife's effort to sell the couple's ownership of the Los Angeles Clippers for a record $2 billion because he was negotiating a big broadcast deal with Fox that would be worth more, he testified Tuesday. Spar, a specialist in geriatric psychiatry who examined Donald Sterling on May 22, said Sterling suffers "mild global cognitive impairment" and "the overall picture is consistent with early Alzheimer's disease, but could reflect other forms of brain disease," court papers said. Tuesday's proceeding began with testimony from Dr. Meril S. Platzer, a neurologist who was one of two physicians who examined Donald Sterling and certified him as being mentally incapacitated and unable to continue as trustee. Shelly Sterling is trying to sell the basketball team to former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, but Donald Sterling is opposing the proposed sale. Earlier in the trial's second day, the attorneys for Donald Sterling cross-examined a physician who had certified Sterling as mentally incapacitated.
