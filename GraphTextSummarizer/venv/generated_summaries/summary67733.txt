The only goal of a largely disappointing match came just before half-time when Park superbly adjusted his body to divert Nani's deflected cross past 20-year-old Arsenal goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny, who was making his league debut for the London side. Neither team found their top form in a game of mistimed passes and niggly tackling, but United had the best of the chances with England striker Wayne Rooney missing a golden opportunity to stretch the advantage in the 73rd minute. But their flowing passing football deserted them and it was United who nearly snatched a second goal late on, when Rooney's clever lob was superbly clawed away by Szczesny. Gunners manager Arsene Wenger brought on big-name players Robin van Persie and captain Cesc Fabregas, who was returning from injury, in an attempt to get back into the game. Arsenal defender Gael Clichy was adjudged to have handled the ball in the penalty area but Rooney's spot-kick flew high and wide of the visitors goal.
