While FDA inspectors typically didn't inspect farms until after an outbreak of illness, Farrar said under the new rule, "We will be beginning routine inspections of egg farms throughout the United States." About 1,300 cases of salmonella have been linked to eggs from Wright County Eggs and Hillandale Farms of Iowa, forcing a recall of their products in at least 17 states, the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control reported. The FDA said some companies that bought and resold eggs from Wright County or Hillandale could issue sub-recalls, meaning they would ask their customers to return the products. The new regulation went into effect July 9, requiring egg producers with more than 3,000 hens to take measures designed to prevent the spread of salmonella. FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg said on Sunday night that farms involved in the recall fell short of safety standards.
