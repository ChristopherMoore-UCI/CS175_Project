Poland's Agnieszka Radwanska eased into the quarterfinals when she beat Hungary's Greta Arn of Hungary 6-3, 6-4. Elsewhere former women's world number one Ana Ivanovic lost to 21-year-old German wild-card Mona Barthel in the first round of Stuttgart's clay-court WTA tournament. Last year's beaten finalist David Ferrer also cruised into the third round by beating the Serbian Filip Krajinovic 6-0, 6-3. After battling back from a serious knee injury, the world number two won his first title in ten months last week after finally beating rival -- and world number one -- Novak Djokovic in the final of the Monte Carlo Masters. "There was something special, because Ana used to be a bit of a role model for me," Barthel told AFP.
