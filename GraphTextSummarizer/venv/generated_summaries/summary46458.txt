" Leakey's Turkana Basin Institute is trying to understand how climate change is affecting the Turkana. Climate change does affect the Turkana people, says Ikal Angelei from the Turkana Basin Institute. "With the increase of drought it has made the communities unable to adapt to the changes, because it happens so often," Angelei said. " On the shores of Lake Turkana -- the largest desert lake in the world -- they don't need to know the science of climate change. Sometimes it is hard to see the effects of climate change, but not at Lake Turkana. -- Richard Leakey has spent a lifetime exploring Kenya's Turkana Basin searching for the origins of man.
