Smuggling tunnels Hamas started off using tunnels to burrow under different Gaza border -- the one with Egypt. The Israeli military says it is trying to demolish a sophisticated network of tunnels that run through parts of northeast Gaza, under the border and into southern Israel. The Israeli military says it believes there are "tens" of tunnels still to be found -- and some of the fiercest fighting it has encountered has been around the tunnel entrances, suggesting a strong desire by Hamas to hold onto them and protect them. The tunnel network has also been used during combat inside Gaza, the Israeli military says, allowing Hamas fighters to pop up and fire on soldiers or toss grenades before dropping back out of sight. The Hamas fighters were disguised as Israeli soldiers, according to the Israel Defense Forces.
