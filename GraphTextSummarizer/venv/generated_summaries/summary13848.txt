Guatemala has the world's highest per capita rate of adoption and is one of the leading providers of adoptive children for the United States. Asked if he would like to see prosecutions, Alvarez answered, "I hope so." Alvarez said he has attended several reunions of abducted children -- now adults -- and family members. Alvarez acknowledges that many more children possibly were taken. Alvarez said corrupt lawyers and notaries were the driving force behind many of the army abductions of children. Some unscrupulous lawyers and notaries, who have greater power in Guatemala than they do in the United States, have taken advantage of the extreme poverty and limited government oversight over adoptions to enrich themselves.
