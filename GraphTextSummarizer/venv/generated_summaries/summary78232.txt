Guardianship with Gray was necessary to protect Winter from further abuse, Kretzmer said in the document. The lawyer filed a petition on behalf of Gray on October 3, alleging Winter was the victim of ongoing physical abuse, insults about her weight, deprivation of food and attempts to "sexualize" a minor. "It's all untrue, it's all untrue," Chris Workman told People about allegations in a court document relating to guardianship of Winter. Kretzmer also contended in the court document that guardianship was necessary because Chris Workman receives checks for Winter's work on "Modern Family" and has control of a related financial account. Last month, a Los Angeles judge ordered the young actress be placed in temporary guardianship of her older sister, Shanelle Gray.
