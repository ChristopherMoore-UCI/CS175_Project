When implanted in the human body, a device made from spiders silk would encourage the surrounding cells to "repopulate the device with actual human living tissue," Skaer says. Thread of life Skaer, now the CEO of biomaterials producers Orthox explains that silk produced by spiders is not just naturally tough -- 25 times the strength of steel -- it is also "biocompatible." As a boy, Dr Skaer loved hunting for creepy crawlies -- but was never a fan of spiders. Today, Skaer's day-job involves persuading people to implant the creatures' silky secretions under their skin -- with the promise that the fiber will weave together damaged tissue. That's if they don't eat each other first, explains Dr. Nick Skaer.
