United threw away a two-goal lead at Everton last weekend and they looked to be heading the same way until Berbatov intervened to become the first Manchester United player since Stan Pearson in 1946 to score a hat-trick against Liverpool. -- Dimitar Berbatov scored a stunning hat-trick as Manchester United recovered from throwing away a two-goal lead to defeat Liverpool 3-2 in a thrilling English Premier League game at Old Trafford. In the day's other match, Argentine striker Carlos Tevez scored one and created the other goal as Manchester City moved into fourth place in the table with a 2-0 win at struggling Wigan. The Bulgarian striker rose above the visiting defence with six minutes remaining to secure the three points after Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard had scored twice in six second-half minutes to haul his side back into the game. But Liverpool came back into the game just five minutes later, Gerrard scoring from the penalty spot after Fernando Torres had been fouled in the area by Johnny Evans.
