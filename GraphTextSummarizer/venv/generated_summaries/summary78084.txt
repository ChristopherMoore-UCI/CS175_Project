Sri Lanka's Tamil insurgency made extensive use of female suicide bombers; between 1987 and 2008, women were better represented among their Black Tiger suicide commandos than they now are in either house of the United States Congress. We need a better understanding of what drives women to take part in, and even give their lives for, violent movements that insist on their inferiority. Women and girls have scant rights under the medieval control of the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham, or ISIS. The recruitment of women and girls is an important element of the modern threat landscape. If the United States is to offer a narrative of opportunity to the world—and strategically it must—then that narrative must include women and girls.
