Qualification for next year's Olympic Games would be even better than this year's success, says Lekic, but the way in which the team's heroics brought about something like national unity was something more valuable than a boost to Macedonia's sporting profile. "I talked to a lot of older players and they said you can play longer with a (European) passport; I didn't even think about it, I just said yes." For Lekic, Macedonia's adventure at EuroBasket was "one magical story," but he is realistic when it comes to the future for the team that he says remains underfunded and lacks adequate government backing. After graduating from the University of New Orleans, McCalebb was ignored by NBA teams and moved to Europe, playing for teams in Turkey, Serbia and now in Italy for Menssana Siena. It was a surprise to get a call from Lekic, he admits, but unconcerned by any culture shock (or loss of U.S. citizenship) he also saw the chance to represent Macedonia as a way to boost his own career. Country profile: Macedonia In 2001 the country was racked by months of violence between extremist groups from the country's ethnic communities and the Macedonian military.
