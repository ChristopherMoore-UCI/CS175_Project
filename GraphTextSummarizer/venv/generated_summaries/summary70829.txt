Thousands of people have died in sectarian violence in India since Hindu extremists razed a Muslim mosque on the site in 1992. Hindu groups have pushed to build a temple in Ayodhya, to replace the mosque torn down by Hindu extremists. India's government was determined to prevent sectarian violence over the Ayodhya ruling. India beefed up security across the country as it braced for the verdict, deploying hundreds of thousands of troops in anticipation of possible violence. In fact, only two other countries, Indonesia and Pakistan, have more Muslims than India, although India is only about 13 percent Muslim, according to the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life.
