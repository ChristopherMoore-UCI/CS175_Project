" "Surrogates" director Jonathan Mostow, whose film credits include 2003's "Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," said he was drawn to the concept of surrogate robots as an extension of current technology. The robot's vaguely humanoid curves, roughly adult height and ability to move around using technology similar to that of the Segway are important steps up from current teleconferencing technology, Blackwell said. "Another major reason to create humanoid robots is, they can use all of our tools," Wilson said. Would I let my children play outside if I knew there were robots outside walking dogs?" he said. although NASA employs robots in space, the highly technical work often required for space walks still requires a human touch -- at least for now.
