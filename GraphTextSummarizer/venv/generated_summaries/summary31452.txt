In 2009, following an arrest involving another stolen car, McVay told police he had planned to travel to Washington where he intended to harm Vice President Joe Biden. This week, Secret Service agents again interviewed McVay. McVay waived his right to remain silent and continued talking, police said, outlining his plan to travel to Washington to kill Obama. Stopped by police Saturday near Madison, Wisconsin, some 450 miles away from the killing, McVay confessed not only to the stabbing, but to a crime he said he hoped to commit: the assassination of a president. But, McVay told the reporters, his feelings hardened against Biden and Obama while he was in solitary confinement.
