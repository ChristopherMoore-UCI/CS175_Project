News of Hekmati's conviction is the latest turn in a series of allegations of espionage and plotting between Washington and Tehran, following the capture of a U.S. surveillance drone by Iran. Iran claims to have arrested a dozen CIA spies and there have been U.S. allegations that Iran sought to kill Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the United States. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said last month Hekmati is being falsely accused, but had no further comment. " Hekmati was convicted of "working for an enemy country ... for membership in the CIA and also for his efforts to accuse Iran of involvement in terrorism," Iran's semi-official Fars news agency reported Monday. In December, Sherri Condon, a software engineer who worked with Hekmati in 2008 and 2009 on an effort to develop a two-way, hand-held electronic translator for U.S. troops, said, "it just doesn't sound like Amir to me."
