Regardless, a clear consensus emerges among those heard on the recording: The young man in the street -- later ID'd as Michael Brown, an 18-year-old days away from starting classes at a technical college -- was shot dead by a Ferguson police officer. As Brown's body lay prone -- for minutes with no one, not even a police officer, in the camera's sight -- onlookers quickly establish one key fact amongst themselves: He wasn't armed. Complete coverage on the Ferguson shooting CNN's Chandler Friedman contributed to this report. But in the minutes after the shooting, the irate crowd on the Ferguson street comes to a different consensus, summed up by the video's narrator: "They just killed this (man) for no reason." The onlookers yell out at police and talk passionately with each other, their anger mixed with disbelief.
