-- Taliban insurgents in Afghanistan will be unable to withstand mounting U.S. pressure and their only option will be to break with al Qaeda and join a peaceful dialogue on the country's future, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Friday. And they cannot escape this choice," Clinton said in a major address on U.S. policy in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Clinton announced that retired veteran diplomat Marc Grossman, a former U.S. ambassador to Turkey who served in Pakistan early in his career, will be the new special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, replacing Richard Holbrooke, who died in December. Warning that Pakistan is at risk of major instability that would hamper the war effort in Afghanistan, she urged the Pakistani government to implement broad reforms and stop fomenting anti-American sentiment. Also being launched, she said, is a "diplomatic surge to move this conflict toward a political outcome that shatters the alliance between the Taliban and al Qaeda, ends the insurgency and helps produce a stable Afghanistan and a peaceful region.
