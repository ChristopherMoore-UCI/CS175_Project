The birds are thought to have been illegally shot in a single incident in November, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Kentucky Department of Fish & Wildlife Resources said Thursday. Anyone with clues should get in touch with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service or the Kentucky Department of Fish & Wildlife Resources. The birds, which were fitted with radio transmitters, had arrived in Kentucky -- where they'd spent the previous two winters -- only in mid-November. The first bird was reported injured on November 25 in Hopkins County, the news release said. According to Kentucky's Courier-Journal newspaper, the male of the pair became well known to Louisville-area residents in 2007 when it fell behind during its first tricky migration south.
