-- Making great wine is like making a great film, according to director Francis Ford Coppola -- it's defying the impossible. One of the 1970s group of Hollywood film directors including George Lucas and Martin Scorsese known as the "movie brats," Coppola broke new ground in the "The Godfather," showing the ruthless Corleone gangster's family values, casting them in a sympathetic light. Coppola started his career making low budget films as the protege of "King of the Bs" Roger Corman. Francis Ford Coppola is the movie-making talent behind some of the greatest films ever made -- he is also a successful winemaker. He successfully solved the puzzle and the film and went on to win the coveted Palme D'Or at Cannes film festival and a place in movie history.
