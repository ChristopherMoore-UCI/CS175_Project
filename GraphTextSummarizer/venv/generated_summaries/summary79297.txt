In his latest barb on Monday, O'Brien revealed that the mayor of a neighboring New Jersey city, Elizabeth, had sent him a letter welcoming him "with open arms to Elizabeth." O'Brien was, of course, referring to his continuing comical conflict with the city of Newark, New Jersey, and its mayor, Cory Booker. Talk show host Conan O'Brien is locked in a playful feud with the mayor of Newark, New Jersey. It all began on September 23, when O'Brien, in his nightly comical spiel, joked that Booker's plan to improve citizens' health care in New Jersey's largest city "would consist of a bus ticket out of Newark." O'Brien then launched a "campaign to surround and crush" Newark and the "drunk on power" Mayor Booker by making courteous tongue-in-cheek overtures to other adjacent towns, forming a "geographic toilet seat around the city of Newark."
