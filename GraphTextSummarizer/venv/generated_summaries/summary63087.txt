The three-story, 250-room hotel, which opened last week at Legoland resort in California, is the only Legoland hotel in the United States. Each room is decorated after one of three themes -- Pirate, Adventure or Kingdom (why no Space?) -- and all have a separate children's area with a bunk bed and trundle bed, accommodating up to three children. For families with young kids -- or just any one who values uniform snapability -- the new Legoland Hotel in California is irresistible. If kids at Legoland wake up early from sheer plastic fever -- or if someone punctures a foot on one of those maddening little pieces in the middle of the night -- they can access the park before it opens at 10 a.m., ahead of the public. Additional cute feature: rooms come with a treasure hunt game, keeping you, er, your kids, busy hunting for a Lego treasure chest.
