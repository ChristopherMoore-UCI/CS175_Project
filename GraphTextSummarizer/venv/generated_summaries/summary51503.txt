I know that the president has a chance to go outside party politics and make significant changes to immigration policy that could stop the suffering of millions of families by stopping deportations and giving work permits to undocumented adults. Asking myself this question is how I kept my emotions in check as I watched President Obama announce his policy on immigration Tuesday. The first time I watched President Obama speak about immigration, I felt the excitement in my stomach. Undocumented workers continue to be targeted by the Department of Homeland Security, even in my hometown of Chicago, where a series of operations led to the detention of scores of workers, including more than a dozen day laborers detained while looking for work. It was sometime early in his presidency, when many of us still believed he would make significant changes in immigration policy during his first term.
