-- Over the past two years, 12 Americans have been charged with supporting militant groups fighting in Syria or have died while fighting with such groups. Of the dozen Americans drawn to fight with ISIS or the al Qaeda affiliated Nusra Front, a profile does appear to be emerging: They are young, typically high school graduates and college students, who are self-recruited online by what they view as exciting video propaganda pouring out of ISIS and Nusra, and they seek to reach the Syrian battlefields by traveling via Turkey. Once individuals are radicalized and are convinced to join ISIS or Nusra, they often decide to travel to Syria through Turkey. Even in the case of Moner Abu Salha, who returned from training in Syria to the States in May 2013, a tip to the FBI from a friend he tried to recruit when he was back in the States placed him on the FBI's radar. -- Abdella Tounisi from Chicago was 18 when he was charged last year with seeking to support Nusra in Syria.
