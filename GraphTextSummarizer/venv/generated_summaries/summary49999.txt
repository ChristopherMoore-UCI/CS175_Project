One student reported "non-consensual sexual contact that did not happen within the fraternity's facility nor did it involve a member of the fraternity, but its occurrence was a result of the student's incapacitation," said the letter from Russell Carey, executive vice president for planning and policy, and Margaret Klawunn, vice president for campus life and student services. A separate federal investigation of dozens of colleges and universities centers on Title IX, under which a school must ensure that students are not denied or limited in the ability to participate in or benefit from its educational programs or activities on the basis of sex. Brown University has sanctioned two fraternities for holding unregistered parties last fall that officials said facilitated sexual misconduct. The action by the Rhode Island university -- outlined in a letter signed by two of its vice presidents -- comes as the U.S. Department of Educations investigates whether dozens of colleges and universities throughout the nation illegally handled sexual violence and harassment complaints. Brown said no individual member of either fraternity was charged with sexual misconduct.
