-- Nico Rosberg survived an investigation by race stewards to claim a controversial pole position for the Monaco Grand Prix Saturday ahead of disgruntled Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton. Rosberg took the season-opener in Australia when Hamilton failed to finish, but has had to settle for second place to the Briton in the last four rounds, with signs of tension between the two men in their own private battle for the world championship. Hamilton leads Rosberg by three points in the title race after winning the last four races, but pole position on the tight street circuit in Monte Carlo virtually guarantees victory come Sunday's race. But it left Hamilton clearly fuming and insisting at the post-qualifying press conference that he was "on target" to take pole before his teammate went off. Rosberg claimed he had "tried to push just that little bit more and went over the edge," refuting any suggestion that it had been a deliberate ploy to deny Hamilton his chance of pole.
