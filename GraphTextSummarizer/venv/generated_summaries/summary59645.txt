Spain defeat U.S. to reach Davis Cup final "Canada was one of the strongest opponents we could have drawn, not only for the quality of the team led by Milos Raonic but also for the fact that we are the away team and only a week after the Australian Open," Corretja told the Spanish Tennis Federation's website. World No.1 Federer boasts an 11-5 record against Berdych, but was beaten by the No.6 at the recent U.S. Open. The Czechs will begin next year's quest for glory with a tie against Switzerland, which throws up the intriguing prospect of Tomas Berdych facing 17-time grand slam winner Roger Federer. -- Spain will face a testing tie in the opening round of the 2013 Davis Cup after being drawn against Canada.
