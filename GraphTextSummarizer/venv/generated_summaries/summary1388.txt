-- Double world champion Sebastian Vettel suffered a disrupted second practice session ahead of Sunday's Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, with McLaren's Lewis Hamilton setting the pace on Friday. Latest F1 standings after Indian GP "I lost the car on the entrance to turn one," Vettel, who clinched the 2011 championship with third place in Japan last month, told the sport's official website. Vettel, who has won 11 of 17 races in 2011, recovered to rejoin practice with 10 minutes remaining, but finished in sixth position on a track where he has won for the past two years. Red Bull driver Vettel was back at the track where he claimed the first of his two world championships 12 months ago -- the youngest driver to achieve the feat -- but the German spun out on the first corner of the Yas Marina Circuit. Hamilton, world champion in 2008 but only fifth overall after a disappointing season, led second-placed teammate Jenson Button ahead of Saturday's qualifying.
