Durrant has fitness equipment at home that she uses as well: a punching bag, an ab lounger, hand weights, kettlebells and workout DVDs. From the very beginning, becoming physically strong was just as important to Durrant as losing a lot of weight. "We have made weight loss fun." "In the past, if I ate what I considered non-diet food, I thought I had ruined everything, and I would quit whatever diet I was on," Durrant said. In 2012, after years of alternating between dieting and splurging, Durrant had gone from "chubby little girl" to a morbidly obese woman.
