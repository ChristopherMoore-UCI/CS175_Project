Here's what Obama said about several other issues Friday: KEYSTONE PIPELINE -- President Barack Obama said the Keystone XL pipeline -- which Republican congressional leaders have said they intend to approve legislation to authorize early next year -- is "not even going to be a nominal benefit to U.S. consumers." Obama didn't threaten to veto a bill that would take approval of the 1,179-mile, Canada-to-Texas pipeline out of the State Department's hands. President Barack Obama prodded Congress to eliminate the United States' decades-old Cuba embargo Friday, saying that improving relations with the communist country will help open its "hermetically sealed society" -- even if changes come in "fits and starts. " Obama touched on the clashes that are guaranteed to come once Republicans take full control of Congress in January, setting up showdowns over Obama's signature health care law, the Keystone XL pipeline that conservatives would like to green-light, financial regulations and more. He identified international trade and tax reform as areas he might be able to find common ground with the GOP-led House and Senate, and said staff-level conversations will take place between Obama's White House and GOP congressional leadership between now and the Jan. 20 State of the Union address about individual and corporate tax reform. "There's very little impact, nominal impact, on U.S. gas prices -- what the average American consumer cares about -- by having this pipeline come through," Obama said.
