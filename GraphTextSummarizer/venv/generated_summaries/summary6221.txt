Messi's free kick saw Carles Puyol head home the second in the 44th minute and on the stroke of halftime a move involving Andres Iniesta and Krkic set up Messi for the simplest of third goals. But Real put on a performance to warm their fans huddled in the giant stadium, with Gonazalo Higuain putting them ahead with a stunning eighth minute strike as he cut inside to fire past Dudu Aoarte. Higuain crossed for Esteban Granero to score Real's second on 50 minutes as he volleyed past Aoarte. Barca, who went into the late kickoff temporarily trailing Real, who had won 2-0 at home to Real Mallorca, made a slow start and might have been behind. Granero should have notched a clinching third soon afterwards as his fierce shot from a Kaka cutback was brilliantly turned away by Aoarte.
