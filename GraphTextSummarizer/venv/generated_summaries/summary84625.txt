" Tsarnaev only began "responding" to government law enforcement investigators Saturday evening under the "public safety exception" allowing interrogation without Miranda rights. Generally, suspects charged with crimes in an initial criminal complaint are to be brought before court within "one business day," even those hospitalized like Tsarnaev. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers said he was "concerned that these proceedings, which included mandatory administration of Miranda rights, could have been conducted in a manner that prematurely cut off a lawful, ongoing FBI interview." Tsarnaev faced a judicial "first appearance" on Monday at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center three days after being taken into custody for the April 15 bombing that killed three people and injured more than 260 others. -- The Justice Department faces questions over whether it prematurely ended interrogation of Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzohkhar Tsarnaev before a court appearance at his hospital bed. There were indications that Dzohkhar Tsarnaev was offering more basic personal information not related to the investigation -- such as his family and work history.
