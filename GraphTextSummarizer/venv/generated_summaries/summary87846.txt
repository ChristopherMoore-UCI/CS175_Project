Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta said last week that Al-Shabaab, the al Qaeda-linked militant group active in Somalia, wasn't responsible for the Mpeketoni attack. Instead, he blamed local political networks for the attack that witnesses said turned a World Cup viewing party into a bloodbath. Kasakakairu is approximately 34 kilometers (21 miles) from Mpeketoni, a southeastern Kenyan coastal town where a terrorist attack killed dozens of people earlier this month. -- Men armed with guns and machetes attacked residents of a Kenyan village before dawn Tuesday, killing at least five people, witnesses told CNN. Armed men stormed the city center, shooting and hacking people to death before moving into a residential area, where they went from door to door, the witnesses said.
