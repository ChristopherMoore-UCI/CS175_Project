Serious soldiers have lighthearted moments and comedic foils are portrayed in serious moments. "Borderlands 2" took what was fun from "Borderlands" and added interesting characters with a range of emotions, and a deep, telling storyline worth following. You'll sell off a lot, but end up spending that money on more ammo or better shields. Do you keep a pistol because it does acid damage or opt for the shotgun with more power? Players can connect with them and that sense of immersion raises the level of "Borderlands 2" from just a simple shooter to something more.
