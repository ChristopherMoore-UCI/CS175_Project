I recently booked a room at the Holiday Inn French Quarter-Chateau Lemoyne in New Orleans through its central reservations phone number. I would have followed up with the manager and not let Holiday Inn off the hook until you had a number. Since Holiday Inn didn't have a cancellation number, it probably means there was no cancellation. He couldn't cancel my reservation because I had made it through Holiday Inn's central reservations number. You followed up with Holiday Inn, and you were persistent but polite.
