-- While his comment about Anne Frank drew criticism from around the world, pop star Justin Bieber and his camp have remained silent on the issue -- and plan to keep it that way. "The Anne Frank House was pleased to welcome Justin Bieber to the Anne Frank House last Friday," an official Facebook post said Monday. A 'chill day' Bieber, who is in the middle of a European tour, stopped by the Anne Frank House between his concert in Antwerp, Belgium, and a Saturday performance in Arnhem, Netherlands. An expert on Anne Frank came to Bieber's defense Monday. Bieber: From tween sensation to adult icon Frank was 13 when she and her family began hiding in a dark and damp "secret annex" of the house to escape the German roundup of Jews in Holland in July 1942.
