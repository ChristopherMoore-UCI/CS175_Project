A total of 14 rockets have been fired into Israel from Gaza this month, according to the Israeli military, The renewed violence comes as London based al-Hayat newspaper reported that Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal arrived in Cairo to discuss, among other things, a deal for the release of captive Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit. Separately, the Israeli air force carried out airstrikes on Tuesday against members of the Hamas military wing in central Gaza, killing one militant and injuring three others, according to a news release put out by Hamas. Asked about the report, Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak told Israeli radio "there was a grain of truth" in the rumors but he "preferred not to say anything because it doesn't help." An Israeli army unit opened fire on a man near the fence that separates Gaza from Israel late Tuesday night, according to an Israel Defense Forces spokesman. The Israeli military said the attack came as a response to the firing of two long-range rockets fired from Gaza Monday night that hit the southern Israeli city of Beer Sheva.
