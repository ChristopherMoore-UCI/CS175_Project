A beached 30-foot sperm whale near Tampa, Florida, attracted hundreds of onlookers Thursday afternoon as biologist decided to euthanize the animal, according to CNN affiliate WTSP. "Although it looks large and scary, it is a very humane thing to do," said Erin Fougeres, a marine mammal biologist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Sperm whales are rarely seen close to shore, and this whale appeared to be emaciated, according to biologists. She added the technique has been used many times before on large whales. The whale carcass was towed away, and scientists plan a necropsy on Friday.
