The new Portuguese champions hammered their Spanish opponents 5-1 in the first match, making the second leg appear a formality, but Villarreal gave themselves early hope by going ahead in the 17th minute when Cani slotted home after a one-two with Marco Ruben. However, Villarreal came back into the match and won on the night thanks to a volley from Joan Capdevila and a Giuseppe Rossi penalty after Nicolas Otamendi had fouled Ruben in the area. Meanwhile, Porto comfortably secured their place in the final 7-4 on aggregate, despite losing 3-2 at Villarreal in the second leg of their semifinal encounter. Meanwhile, Colombian striker Radamel Falcao broke Jurgen Klinsmann's record for most goals in a European season, as he notched his 16th goal as Porto comfortably secured their final place. Benfica had beaten Braga to the Portuguese title last season, and held a narrow 2-1 advantage from the first leg in Lisbon.
