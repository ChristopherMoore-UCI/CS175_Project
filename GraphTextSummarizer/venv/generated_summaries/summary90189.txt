They've found that the closest relatives to the new virus are viruses that were isolated from pigs in the United States in the past few years. Anyone who is building pig farms or poultry farms in a hot zone of emerging infectious diseases should increase security, look out for new diseases in livestock or people, and investigate any novel diseases rigorously, he said. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has found that each gene segment of 2009 H1N1 had its closest ancestor in swine influenza virus, and officials hypothesized that the reassortment of these genes occurred in pigs, said Nancy Cox, director of the CDC's Influenza Division. "There's a lot of mixing, and a lot of potential for viruses," Daszak said. There's a large trade of pigs from the United States and Canada, as well as pig trades from other countries, each year into Mexico, he said.
