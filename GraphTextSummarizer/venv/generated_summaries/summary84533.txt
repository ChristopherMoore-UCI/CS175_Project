--Bonny Tillman, Acworth, Georgia RealSimple.com: Easy ways to unwind Songs sung by the White Stripes' lead singer, Jack White, pull me out of a dark cloud. Sunny hues remind me of my childhood bedroom, which was painted goldenrod, and of umbrellas, flowers, and other wonderful elements of spring. In the spring and summer, I see fast-moving hummingbirds, red-plumed cardinals, and yellow finches, who gravitate to our cornflowers. This childhood pastime has become the way that I lift my spirits and celebrate life. Since then, I've discovered that banging out a favorite tune, such as the Beatles' "You Can't Do That," improves my mood in a matter of minutes.
