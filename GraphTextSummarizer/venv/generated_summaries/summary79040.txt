"Not all animals that eat chocolate will automatically die, but it is clearly evident that wild animals can consume enough chocolate to reach a lethal dose," Timmins said. The death of these four bears is the largest number of documented black bear deaths related to chocolate consumption that Timmins is aware of, he said in an interview with CNN. Hunters will attract bears to a location by using bait and then take a bear with a firearm or a bow, according to Timmins. Four black bears that died in the New Hampshire woods last year overdosed on chocolate bait, wildlife officials said this week. The bears were found dead in September within 50 feet of where a hunter said he placed 90 pounds of chocolate and doughnuts as bait, officials said.
