-- Petrol bombs and stones were thrown at police protecting a gay pride march Sunday in Belgrade, the capital of Serbia, an interior ministry representative told CNN. CNN's Bharati Naik contributed to this report. "It is very important that the event, which might be disagreeable to most of Serbia's citizens, goes by without incidents," Dacic said in Belgrade. Interior Minister Ivica Dacic had urged people to allow the march to go ahead without incident, Serbia's Tanjug news agency reported Saturday. Last year's march was canceled due to security concerns after a wave of anti-gay graffiti appeared before the event, news reports at the time said.
