Standing on stage with five other former or current secretaries of state, Kissinger -- who served as secretary of state under Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford -- highlighted the work of diplomats and foreign service officers as he spoke at the groundbreaking for the United States Diplomacy Center, a museum set to honor diplomatic work. Joining Kissinger and Clinton on stage for the groundbreaking were former secretaries James Baker, III, Madeleine Albright, and Colin Powell -- along with current Secretary of State John Kerry. "When I became secretary of state, I spent a lot of time thinking about my illustrious predecessors -- not primarily the ones who went on to become president," Clinton said to laughter. " While Kissinger's joke was not an obvious joke about Clinton, the former top diplomat has been known to tease his successor about running for president. "At least four secretaries of state became president," Kissinger joked during remarks at the annual Atlantic Council awards dinner in Washington.
