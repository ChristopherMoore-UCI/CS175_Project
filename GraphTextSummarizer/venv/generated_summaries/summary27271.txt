American Airlines said it would add extra flights, use bigger planes where possible and reflow passengers to other flights. About 28,000 households had no power into Sunday night, said Drew Elliot, spokesman for Progress Energy. Passengers who were affected can switch flights with no change fees through Thursday, said Charley Wilson, airline spokesman. -- Airlines were scrambling to accommodate passengers affected by the cancellation of hundreds of flights after a monster weekend winter storm that blanketed a swath of the East Coast. Continental Airlines said though flights are extremely full because of the holidays, it is working on a "case-by-case basis" to ensure passengers get home for the holidays.
