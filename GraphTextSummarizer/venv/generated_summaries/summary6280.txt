The show, with music and lyrics by U2's Bono and Howell (aka The Edge), is the most expensive in Broadway history, but production has been beset by cast injuries and technical problems. The show's producers acted on the guidance of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the New York State Department of Labor, according to spokesman Rick Miramontez. He called for lawsuits against Taymor and others invested in the production, such as musical stars Bono and David Howell Evans. "Nothing is more important than the safety of our Spider-Man family and we'll continue to do everything in our power to protect the cast and crew." Tierney was initially listed in serious condition at Bellevue Hospital. Earlier, Broadway actor Adam Pascal called for the prosecution of the show's director, Julie Taymor, because of a series of recent mishaps, including Tierney's injury.
