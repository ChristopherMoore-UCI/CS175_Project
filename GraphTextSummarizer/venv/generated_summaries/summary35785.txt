The key lesson here is that American workers need to be trained to complement the raw processing and networking power of computers with uniquely human facilities, like evaluating subtle social cues and crafting macro strategies. In response, there emerged what's called "freestyle" chess, which pairs a human and computer together -- the machine crunches the numbers and the person consults on broader strategy. The fact is there is a fundamental shift underway that we must address to get the economy humming again: the steady substitution of human labor with computers. A recent study by Oxford University researchers projected that up to 45% of U.S. jobs could be replaced by computers within the next two decades. They note it's futile to try to outcompete; the flip side of the John Henry legend is that humans will eventually lose any direct competition with machines.
