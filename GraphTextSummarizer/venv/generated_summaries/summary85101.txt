Pentagon police officers, as well as several construction workers in the area, heard at least five shots fired around 4:50 a.m., Pentagon officials said. Several law enforcement agencies, including the FBI and Pentagon police, are looking at surveillance footage and doing ballistics tests of the bullets found thus far, among other measures. -- A Pentagon official said he believes the shooting early Tuesday at the U.S. Defense Department headquarters was a "random incident. Asked if there were any ties between that and the Pentagon shootings, a law enforcement official said that "except for the similarity in the incidents -- windows shot out at military facilities -- there is nothing to connect these incidents at this point. Tuesday's shooting follows a similar incident overnight Sunday at the National Museum of the Marine Corps in Triangle, Virginia, near the entrance of Marine Corps Base Quantico.
