If the upper house ticks off on the bill, Tasmania will become the first state in Australia to legalize same sex marriage. Moore, 30 and Hastings, 27, both feel same sex marriage in Tasmania, at least, is inevitable. The Federal Parliament in the meantime is readying to vote on changes to the Marriage Act to allow same sex marriage. New Zealand is also likely to pass same sex marriage laws. Croome estimates more than 50% of Tasmania's same sex couples will rush to the alter and many thousands will flock to Tasmania from other Australian states and territories to do the same.
