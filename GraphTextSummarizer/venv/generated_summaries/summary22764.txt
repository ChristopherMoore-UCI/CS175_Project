It appeared that the boy was trying to lift his grandfather from the bed when he was overcome by the smoke and fire, fire officials said. Ebmeyer said he received calls from fire departments from Maine to California, saying something should be done to honor Tyler. Penfield Fire Company has kept an honor guard standing by the remains of the boy during calling hours since Monday, and at the end of a church service on Wednesday, Penfield Fire Chief Chris Ebmeyer will declare Tyler an honorary firefighter and present his family with a special fire helmet inscribed with the boy's name. At the service, firefighters from multiple fire departments will stand at attention in formal "Class A" dress uniforms with bagpipers playing -- the hallmarks of a traditional firefighter's funeral, Ebmeyer said. -- Tyler Doohan, the 8-year-old upstate New York boy who rescued six relatives from a fire but died while trying to save his grandfather, will be laid to rest Wednesday with a ceremony and honor befitting a fallen firefighter, according to local fire officials.
