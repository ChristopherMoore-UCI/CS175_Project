Snow is expected to spread into Oklahoma and north Texas on Wednesday and into Wednesday night, said CNN meteorologist Dave Hennen. Much of Oklahoma is under a winter storm warning, but snow and sleet are predicted as far south as central Texas, with 2 to 4 inches expected to coat the Dallas-Fort Worth area, the National Weather Service said. "Maximum temperature departures are expected to run 30 to 40 degrees below average for the central U.S. (Tuesday) with the same departures sinking south into Oklahoma and north Texas on Wednesday," the Weather Service said. Rain is likely across most of the Southeast on Wednesday and Wednesday night. A historic storm left its mark on at least 30 states last week, dumping about 2 feet of snow on the Chicago area and prompting Oklahoma's governor to declare a state of emergency.
