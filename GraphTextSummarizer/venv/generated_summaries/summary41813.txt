Benepe said there is a theory the coyotes make their way to the city from suburban Westchester. The little troublemaker was caught and tranquilized in Trinity Cemetery on 155th street and Broadway, and then taken to the Wildlife Conservation Society at the Bronx Zoo, authorities said. According to Adrian Benepe, New York City Parks Commissioner, coyotes in Manhattan are rare, but not unheard of. One wily coyote traveled a bit too far from home, and its resulting adventure through Harlem had alarmed residents doing a double take and scampering to get out of its way Wednesday morning. "The coyote is under evaluation and observation," said Mary Dixon, spokesperson for the Wildlife Conservation Society.
