" Protest leaders: Police didn't stop attackers A source familiar with the Hong Kong government said leaders expect a prolonged faceoff and know the conflict won't resolve itself in two or three days. -- Thousands of pro-democracy protesters jammed the streets of Hong Kong's central business district Saturday night and early Sunday, clapping and cheering just hours after an ultimatum by government leaders: Let city workers back in their offices soon, or else. Joshua Wong, the 17-year-old leader of student group Scholarism, told CNN's Kristie Lu Stout that the Hong Kong government should "pay responsibility of this accident." Beijing worries that Hong Kong could become an anti-communist base and that pro-democracy protests could gain traction in other Chinese cities, the source said. Protest leaders said Friday's violence -- scuffles between protesters and counter-protesters in Mong Kok, a nearby district -- reinforced their resolve.
