"We object to the cruelty with which animals are treated," says Pramada Shah of Animal Welfare Network Nepal. Last year his son was successful -- and on Saturday he was one of tens of thousands of people killing the animals at the temple of Gadhimai in southern Nepal as part of the biggest religious mass slaughter in the world. Courts in India also directed the Indian government not to control the unnecessary export of animals to Nepal. But animals continue to flow into Nepal through the porous and open border. Meanwhile, on Friday morning tens of thousands of people gathered around the temple in Bara district, southern Nepal, waiting for the sacrificial ritual to begin.
