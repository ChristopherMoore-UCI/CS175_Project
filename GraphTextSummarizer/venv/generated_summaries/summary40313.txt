The business Web site CNET.com wrote that the change in models may have been made with the "racially homogeneous" Polish market in mind. On Microsoft's official page on the social network site Twitter, a posting calls the swap "a marketing mistake" and offers "sincere apologies." A black man in an online Microsoft ad was replaced with a white man, bottom, on the company's Polish Web site. -- Software giant Microsoft apologized Wednesday for the apparent bad judgment that led to the head of a black model being swapped for that of a white model in an online advertisement. The ad -- which showed three business people, one Asian, one white and one black -- was altered on Microsoft's Web site for Poland to place the head of a white man on a black man's body.
