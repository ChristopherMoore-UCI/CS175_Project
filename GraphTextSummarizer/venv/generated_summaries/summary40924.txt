One crutch for Sony -- and all other of Japan Inc.'s exporters from automobiles to tech and optics -- has arrived in the form of currency devaluation. In its most recent quarter, Sony bled $123 million from its books with gaming-related sales falling 15.1% year-on-year while its ailing television division saw sales plunge 23.3%. Sony is also rumored to be working on an online TV service to rival cable companies which would prominently use the PlayStation console. But if Sony does not report a profit for the fourth quarter of 2012, the company will post five full years of consecutive losses. While Sony's PS2 is still the gaming world's best-selling console with more than 150 million units, estimates put PS3 sales at about half that at 77 million.
