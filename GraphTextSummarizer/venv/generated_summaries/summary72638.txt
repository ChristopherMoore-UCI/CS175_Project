"Why do we need to have flags and borders?" Valle said that in recent years, increasing amounts of Badjao are transitioning to a life on land. Although the type of diving Valle did with the Badjao can be dangerous, he did it without an oxygen tank. Valle sought to photograph the Badjao as part of a larger project about stateless people that has taken him to places such as Kosovo, China, South Sudan and the Palestinian territories. The soft light and the way the Badjao pose in the water reflect the "imaginary stateless nation" Valle wanted to convey, causing the viewer to examine the relationship between place and identity. Despite the pull toward a more modern way of living, there are still Badjao who choose life at sea.
