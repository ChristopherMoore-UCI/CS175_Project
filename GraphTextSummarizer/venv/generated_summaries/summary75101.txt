Florida mother Esther Anderson knows the feeling well thanks to 15-month-old Ellia. "I just wanted to show that this is part of life being a mom," said Anderson, who documents her adventures as a first-time mother on her blog, "Story of This Life. Anderson fetched her DSLR camera, set it up in front of the machines and went back to work, letting Ellia do her worst as she filmed the results. As Anderson moved clothes from the washer to the dryer Ellia intervened. As she attempted to sweep the floor and unload the dishwasher, she indulged Ellia's mischief longer than she normally would for the sake of the camera, and to prove a point: "At the end of the day you look at your house and it looks like you've done nothing all day long."
