"These two heroes ran into a burning building -- got people out of the building," said Boston Mayor Martin Walsh. More than 150 firefighters and between 20 and 30 trucks responded to the incident, according to Boston Fire Department spokesman Steve MacDonald. He identified those killed as Lt. Edward Walsh, 43, and Firefighter Michael Kennedy, 33. The area is west of downtown Boston, near the Charles River. Walsh had worked with the Boston Fire Department for close to 10 yeas, while Kennedy had 6 1/2 years on the job.
