-- Just one week after suffering an on-field cardiac arrest, soccer player Fabrice Muamba was able to watch most of his team Bolton's emotional victory over English Premier League relegation rivals Blackburn Rovers on Saturday. "The fact he was able to watch a large part of the game, given where we were a week ago, is great news," Bolton manager Owen Coyle told the club's website on Monday. His continued recovery has been described by the head of world football, FIFA president Sepp Blatter, as "a miracle" and his plight has attracted international attention, with players across Europe taking to the field in t-shirts expressing support for the Kinshasa-born player. He is still in intensive care and it's important that he doesn't have too many visitors as he continues his recovery, step by step." Fans lay shirts outside the stadium showing their support for Muamba before the match, then inside they held up cards which spelled out his name and shirt number in a huge mosaic.
