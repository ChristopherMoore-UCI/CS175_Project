Either way, a new Old Spice commercial dubbed "Momsong" has the Internet buzzing. Within a day, the term "Old Spice" was tweeted over 50,000 times, according to social analytics company, Topsy, and the video has had more than 1 million views since it was posted a few days ago. A series of commercials featuring pitchman Terry Crews won the internet's heart a few years ago with his pectoral flexes and ear shattering screams. One mom is seen hiding behind the door in her son's bedroom as she sadly sings about her boy quickly becoming a man after using Old Spice. The commercial, part of a series called "Smellcome To Manhood," promotes a new line of Old Spice body sprays.
