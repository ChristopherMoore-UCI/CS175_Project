Bobbi Kristina Brown "was not breathing" when Nick Gordon -- the man she has referred to as her husband -- and a friend, who's been identified as Maxwell Lomas, found her inside her townhouse in the Atlanta suburb of Roswell. Bobbi Kristina Brown had said she was married to Gordon, who had lived with Houston and her daughter since he was 12 years old. However, Bobby Brown attorney Christopher Brown said the two were never married. Other family members, including Bobbi Kristina's father, singer Bobby Brown, have been in Atlanta for days. After Houston's death, Bobbi Kristina talked of pursuing a career in acting and music, just like her mother.
