Cruises divide travelers Rough weather isn't the only reason that cruise ships change itineraries. Unlike an island resort, which pretty much has to sit there and take it, ships move out of the way of the hurricane," Brown said. Consider Hurricane Irene, which forced many ships to change course last week. If a hurricane forms, cruise ships have sophisticated weather tracking systems and can keep their distance from any rough weather. "We monitor the storms closely and make strategic changes to the itineraries to keep them away from the storm," said Jennifer de la Cruz, a Carnival spokeswoman, during Hurricane Irene.
