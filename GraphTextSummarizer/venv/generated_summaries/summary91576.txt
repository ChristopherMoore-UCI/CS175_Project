Tsunami warning sirens blared Wednesday in parts of Indonesia, and the other steps taken show that "governments are more prepared," said CNN weather anchor Mari Ramos. In this case, the plates moved more horizontally, and therefore a large tsunami was not generated." "Even though the epicenters were only about 200 miles (about 320 kilometers) apart, they occurred on different tectonic plates," CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller added. While it was not immediately clear how many people headed to higher ground Wednesday, some videos from the region showed people apparently leaving low-lying areas. "In 2004, the quake was closer to the coast, stronger and was a different kind of earthquake," CNN meteorologist Dave Hennen said. A 9.1-magnitude quake is 3.2 times larger, and more than 5 times stronger, than an 8.6-magnitude quake, CNN meteorologist Sean Morris said.
