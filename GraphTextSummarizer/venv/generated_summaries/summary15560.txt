Experts expect elevated flu activity in parts of the United States for several more weeks, especially in states where flu activity started later. "We are committed to the development of better flu vaccines, but existing flu vaccines are the best preventive tool available now," Frieden said. "Widespread" means that more than 50% of geographic regions in a state -- counties, for example -- are reporting flu activity. Adults between 25 and 64 account for more than half of flu deaths this season, according to the CDC, compared with less than a quarter last year. Twenty-four states reported widespread flu activity that week.
