The decision paid off, with Federer and Wawrinka snapping a four-match losing streak in doubles together in the Davis Cup by easing past Richard Gasquet and Julien Benneteau 6-3 7-5 6-4. But after his Switzerland beat France in the pivotal doubles tussle Saturday, the Swiss are one win away from wrapping up the final in Lille -- and it's Federer who has first crack at completing the job. Gasquet was out of sorts in the doubles Saturday, and Clement would raise many an eyebrow if he opted for Benneteau. It might explain why Tsonga didn't play with Gasquet after they practiced together Saturday morning and excelled in doubles in the semifinals against the Czech Republic. He was forced to withdraw from the final of the World Tour Finals last Sunday with a bad back and then looked unlike his usual self in a crushing loss to Gael Monfils on Friday.
