Criminal suspects in Massachusetts and California were convicted, in part, after phone numbers, text messages, and addresses obtained from personal electronic devices linked them to criminal drug and gang activity. But California officials say for constitutional purposes, a cellphone is no different than a wallet when it comes to initial searches of criminal suspects. Not lost on the larger national debate over government searches was the fact the justices accepted these two petitions the same day Obama justified the electronic surveillance efforts by the National Security Agency. The Constitution's Fourth Amendment protects against "unreasonable searches and seizures." That has left judges nationwide divided recently over how to apply a 40-year-old high-court precedent, which allows searches of items a suspect possesses following arrest.
