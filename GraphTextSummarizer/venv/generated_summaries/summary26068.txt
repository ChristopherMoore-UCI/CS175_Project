Police said Greene has had four prior run-ins with law enforcement, including a 2005 assault case for which he was sentenced to a year in jail and an arrest in February for alleged possession of a rifle, heroin, marijuana, prescription drugs and drug paraphernalia. There also were numerous written items containing instructions on making explosive materials and bombs, police said, including the collection of pages that had a cover page saying "the terrorist encyclopedia. " Fearing the substance to be an explosive material, police evacuated several buildings in the area Saturday morning. Police say officers discovered the explosive substance at the couple's Greenwich Village apartment while serving a warrant related to four counts of felony grand larceny against Gliedman involving credit card theft in February. Shortly after her arrest, Gliedman went into labor and gave birth to a daughter, whom she named Melody, according to Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne.
