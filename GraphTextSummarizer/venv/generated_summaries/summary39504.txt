-- House Republicans are going forward with plans to sue President Barack Obama and will base their legal case on the sweeping health care law he championed and they despise. Obama defiantly challenged Republicans last week, saying he would continue to take steps he felt were necessary with or without the support of congressional Republicans. Speaker John Boehner said the suit, which also highlights an ironic Obamacare twist, will follow the argument Obama violated the Constitution by circumventing Congress and alone delaying the law's requirement for businesses to provide coverage. The White House expressed disappointment in a statement, saying Boehner and Republicans are wasting time and taxpayer resources on a "political stunt." "As the President said today, he is doing his job -- lawsuit or not -- and it's time Republicans in Congress did theirs," the statement said. The case magnifies a toxic partisan climate that has engulfed Congress and come to define Obama's relations with Republicans in general.
