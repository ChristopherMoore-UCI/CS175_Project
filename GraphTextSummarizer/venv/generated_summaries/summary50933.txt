A majority of women are now family breadwinners, and they hold more college degrees than men. Republicans should note that one of the studies in the Shriver report shows that women of color -- a key demographic with whom the party desperately needs to make inroads -- overwhelmingly believe government has a role to play in providing adaptive workplace structures and policies that support today's contemporary families. It describes how government support structures could allow for better and more affordable child care, enabling women to balance the roles of caregiver and breadwinner. This could cut the poverty rate in half for struggling working women and it would represent an economic stimulus of half a trillion dollars. Republican lectures about marriage and family values will not work to solve poverty.
