Monday's report found that 40% of all U.S. adults get news "at least sometimes" on mobile devices, compared to 85% of Twitter news consumers and 64% of Facebook news consumers. On Twitter, 40% of news consumers have at least a bachelor's degree, compared to 30% of Facebook news consumers and 29% of Americans overall. The analyses showed that breaking news, not opinion, made up the majority of Twitter news content. -- Nearly one in 10 U.S. adults get news from Twitter, and they tend to be younger, more educated and more mobile than news consumers overall, says a new report. The Pew report includes analysis of Twitter conversations related to major news events, such as the acquittal of George Zimmerman, the Florida man accused in the shooting death of teen-ager Trayvon Martin.
