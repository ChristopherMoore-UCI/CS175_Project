They argued, among other things, that a single measure would be unfair to institutions with large proportions of disadvantaged students, including community colleges. Indeed, testing expert Gary Phillips of the American Institutes of Research, who once ran NAEP, has sketched a persuasive vision of a new experimental test that could make cross-state comparisons and also provide achievement data for different groups of institutions, from community colleges and liberal arts schools to Ivy League universities. A growing number of colleges use this survey, which doesn't measure learning directly but asks students about things such as how often they write long papers or talk with professors outside class. Tests of what college students know are nothing new, of course, within individual classrooms and institutions. An intriguing new initiative led by Massachusetts will compare student learning across nine states by evaluating work such as student papers and lab reports.
