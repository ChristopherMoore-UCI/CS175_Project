-- One of China's most prominent activists and his wife are under house arrest and have been beaten by authorities, two human rights groups, China Aid and Chinese Human Rights Defenders said Friday. In a home video released Wednesday by U.S.-based rights group China Aid, Chen Guangcheng described the dire and frustrating conditions of his house arrest, since he was released from jail in September. Last month, in the lead up to Chinese President Hu Jintao's visit to the United States, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called for the release of Chen, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo, along with other political prisoners who are "enduring enforced disappearances." On Friday, the Hong Kong-based China Human Rights Defenders reported Chen and his wife Yuan Weijin were severely beaten after the public release of the video showing Chen discussing his house arrest at home. "I've come out of a small jail and entered a bigger one (house arrest)," Chen, 39, said in the video, wearing sunglasses and a black jacket.
