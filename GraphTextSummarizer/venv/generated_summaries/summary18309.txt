Some of the profits from the untitled book, which is set for publication February 15, will go to New Hope Baptist Church in Newark, New Jersey, where Cissy Houston served as minister of music for 50 years, the publisher said. Watch: Houston's family plans reality show "Cissy Houston is known for being so guarded and so caring that until now she has never spoken about her daughter," Sharkey said. Whitney Houston drowned in a hotel tub February 11, with "effects of atherosclerotic heart disease and cocaine use" as contributing factors, the coroner ruled. Cissy Houston, who is a Grammy-winning singer in her own right, said she wanted to "give her fans something to treasure, the way we all treasured Whitney." The book will explore Houston's turbulent marriage to singer Bobby Brown and "her misunderstood struggles with drug abuse with a candor, honesty and respect that have long been missing in numerous accounts of her daughter's life," the HarperCollins statement said.
