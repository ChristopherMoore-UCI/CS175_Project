With what Zuckerberg called "frictionless sharing," Facebook users can have the stories they're reading on certain other websites pushed straight to their News Feed for friends to share. Charging for Facebook would inevitably decrease the number of users. That addresses one big privacy complaint Facebook has been hit with in the past, when new features started automatically, requiring users to opt out instead of opting in. Earlier this week, an Australian blogger posted data that he said shows information being sent to Facebook by users even when they're not logged into the site. Users will still be able to use their Spotify settings to control what information gets sent to Facebook, though.
