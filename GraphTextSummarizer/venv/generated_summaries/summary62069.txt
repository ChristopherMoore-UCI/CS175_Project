The victory earned Al Ahly a place at next month's FIFA Club World Cup, where the team will play either New Zealand's Auckland City or the champions of host nation Japan in the quarterfinals. "Mass celebrations across downtown #Cairo, complete with horizontal fireworks," tweeted Cairo-based journalist Bel Tew. Egypt's leading soccer club Al Ahly won the African Champions League title for a record-extending seventh time on Saturday, despite its domestic league having been suspended for nine months following the death of 74 fans in the Port Said stadium tragedy. "We wanted this trophy so much to offer it to the families and the souls of the Port Said martyrs," El-Saied said in quotes reported by the Ahram Online website after Ahly beat defending champions Esperance 2-1 in Tunis for a 3-2 aggregate victory. The first leg two weeks ago was played at a military facility near Alexandria rather than at Ahly's home ground in Cairo due to security fears.
