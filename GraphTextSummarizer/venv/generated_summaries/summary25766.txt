Seau was one of a string of NFL players -- along with Dave Duerson, Shane Dronett and Ray Easterling -- who took their own lives and were later diagnosed with CTE. In a recent study, researchers found CTE in 34 of 35 deceased NFL players whose brains were donated by family members. Seau's family donated his brain to the NIH for research, and this month it released a statement saying "abnormalities were found that are consistent with a form of (CTE). " According to the NIH's pathology report, five researchers -- two NIH neuropathologists and three independent experts -- examined slides of Seau's brain, and all confirmed that there were signs consistent with CTE. But it will send a message that the NFL needs to care for its former players, acknowledge its decades of deception on the issue of head injuries and player safety, and make the game safer for future generations," the family said.
