Angelica Castillo's complaint, filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court, comes less than a year after Stone's former nanny sued accusing her of violating labor laws and and making derogatory comments about her ethnicity. The suit says Castillo suffered severe pain when she hurt her back while carrying Stone's groceries in June. The former nanny's lawsuit, filed in May, said she was fired because she refused to return overtime pay that Stone told her she did not deserve. -- Sharon Stone's former maid filed a wrongful termination lawsuit against the actress on Monday, contending Stone fired her because she was injured carrying groceries. "While the plaintiff was still in severe pain, Stone repeatedly yelled at plaintiff for performing her duties more slowly, and called her 'crazy' and 'stupid,' " the suit said.
