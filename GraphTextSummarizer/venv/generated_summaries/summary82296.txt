"I offered several days ago to give up my position if Mr. Zelaya would stop inciting his followers to violence," Micheletti told CNN en Español. Asked in an interview with CNN en Español late Friday night why he did not go farther into Honduras, as he had vowed to do, Zelaya said he did not want to cause any violence. He declined to say in an interview with CNN en Español whether Zelaya would be arrested if he crossed into Honduras. Ousted Honduran President Jose Manuel Zelaya returned to Nicaragua late Friday night after briefly entering his home country from which he was removed in a military coup nearly a month ago. Zelaya crossed a few yards into Honduras on Friday afternoon and then hunkered down while he carried on extensive telephone conversations and press interviews.
