Khalifa told CNN, "I want to be close to my people, supportive of them and the revolution." Stark choice for Syrian artists Khalifa's recent outspokenness shows how artists have survived for years under artistic oppression in Syria, said Christa Salamandra, an anthropologist who lived in Syria off and on until 2010.

The New York Times reported Syria's art scene might be the Next Big Thing, quoting a California travel agent scoping out Damascus so she could entice rich collectors to go on a buying tour. Those who churned out hugely popular soaps and television shows thought Syria's president, in his mid-30s when he took power in 2000, wanted to be known as a modern leader who defended free expression. So the writer is doing what few established artists still living in Syria are, especially those who made their professional mint "working" with the regime to produce television shows.
