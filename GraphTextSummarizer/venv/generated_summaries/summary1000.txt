As of 9:30 p.m. ET, Google users in China could still access Google.cn but results on politically sensitive search terms, such as "Tiananmen Square massacre" or the outlawed religious group "Falun Gong," were being blocked when searched from Beijing -- suggesting that although Google is no longer self censoring, China state censors of "the Great Firewall" may be. In the chess game between Beijing and Google, Google has redirected all search traffic from mainland China to Google's Hong Kong site, google.com.hk rather than pulling out of China. -- China state media said Google's decision to quit censoring its China Web site "violated its written promise" and was "totally wrong." According to the page, YouTube, Google Sites and Google's Blogger apps were blocked, with some others partially blocked, such as Picasa. The company on Monday also launched a dashboard page, which it promises to update regularly each day, that will show which Google services are available in China.
