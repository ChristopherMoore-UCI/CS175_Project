Meanwhile, Turkey's main opposition party said it will back a motion to authorize ground operations as long as they are limited to rescuing Kobani and repelling ISIS, Anadolu also reported. "The events of last week have made it clear that urgent and rapid steps are needed to halt [ISIS'] military capabilities," State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said, "and Gen. Allen and [diplomat Brett] McGurk will make that clear in their meetings with Turkish officials." ISIS is fighting to take the Syrian town of Kobani, a predominantly Kurdish town just steps from Turkey. But Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Thursday it's not "realistic" for the world to expect Turkey to launch a ground operation against ISIS alone but that, "once we reach a joint decision Turkey will continue to act and do its utmost." " In other words, Turkey is willing to help fight ISIS, if the United States can make certain commitments.
