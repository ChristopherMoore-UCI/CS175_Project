I still remember the story of how each of them identified themselves one by one -- Luis Franklin, Nicolas, Nathalia, Laura -- and Luna would say "Luna Gomez, too." Luna and Jackie and Sydney and Sofia and Ana, a string of little ones right behind them, went on adventures to the water park yelling "agua, agua" and eating loads of rice and beans. Rosanna had left their own babies behind in the Dominican Republic to come care for the babies of families in the United States. I first met Rosanna weeks after our daughter, Luna, was born. Luna became calm almost as soon as Rosanna picked her up.
