According to Guinness World Records, which officially confirmed the record today, Microsoft sold an average of 133,333 units per day between November 4 and January 3. "The sales figures here speak for themselves," said Gaz Deaves, gaming editor for Guinness World Records in a statement from Microsoft. " In comparison, it took the Nintendo Wii about two years to pass the 10 million sales mark (although to be fair, Nintendo's system was about $100 more expensive at launch than Microsoft's sensor). (Mashable)  -- Microsoft has sold more than 10 million Kinect systems for the Xbox 360 to retailers, the company announced Wednesday. If sales had continued at the newly announced record rate, Microsoft would be announcing it had sold more than 18 million units instead of 10 million.
