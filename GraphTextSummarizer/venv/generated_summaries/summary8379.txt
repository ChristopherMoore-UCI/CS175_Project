"They are very lucky â€” they didn't have any signal device," said U.S. Coast Guard spokesman Mark Barney. The Coast Guard said it washed up on the beach in Fort Lauderdale on Saturday afternoon. "A lot of people don't wear life jackets because they don't have intention of being in water," Barney said. -- Some off-duty public safety workers ended up with an unusual catch when they went fishing off the coast of Florida on Saturday morning. " About 8 a.m. Saturday, two Broward sheriff's detectives, a Broward firefighter and one of the officers' father-in-law noticed splashing in the water from their boat, the sheriff's department said.
