"Hurricane season is upon us, and to anyone who lives or works in hurricane-prone areas, to any of you who have family or friends in hurricane prone areas, NOAA's message is clear -- be prepared, have a plan," NOAA Administrator Jane Lubchenco said. Of the hurricanes, NOAA predicts that one to three will be major hurricanes -- storms classified as Category 3 on the Saffir-Simpson scale of storm intensity -- with winds of 111 mph or higher. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration forecasters predict a 'near normal' hurricane season. The weather agency will release an updated hurricane outlook in August, ahead of what it says is historically the peak period for hurricane activity. "While we cannot prevent hurricanes, we can prepare, and we must," Commerce Secretary Gary Locke told reporters at Reagan National Airport, just outside of Washington.
