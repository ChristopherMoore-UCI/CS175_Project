Heart transplant recipient and cancer survivor Kyle Garlett will compete in October's Ironman World Championship. Following in his footsteps Garlett is on a trail blazed by Dwight Kroening, the first heart transplant recipient to complete the Ironman, last year in Canada. -- If all goes according to plan, cancer survivor Kyle Garlett will compete in October's Ford Ironman World Championship, a grueling triathlon made up of a 2.4-mile ocean swim, a 112-mile bicycle ride and a 26.2-mile run. As a result, heart transplant recipients must warm up thoroughly to get their heart pumping properly. Haykowsky studied Kroening for research on exercise habits of heart transplant recipients.
