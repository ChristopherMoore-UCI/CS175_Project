This led to a 2006 National Geographic magazine assignment to document changing glaciers in various parts of the Northern Hemisphere and South America. We do this because shrinking glaciers are the canary in the global coal mine, the most visible, tangible manifestations of climate change on the planet. When the future looks back at the late 20th and early 21st centuries, people will be as astounded at our mule-headedness about dealing with climate change, as we now are at the foibles of earlier societies. We must make a major effort to stop climate change right now, and not think we can absolve ourselves of responsibility by educating our children to do things differently. Through time-lapse imagery and other innovative methods, EIS documents and communicates environmental impacts from global warming and other human-made causes while inspiring action among citizens and policymakers.
