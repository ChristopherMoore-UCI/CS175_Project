"This picture of violence against humanitarian organizations and staff is reflective of the violence that has been inflicted on hundreds of innocent people by militants and criminals across Pakistan in the same period," it said. The forum said Dale's killing was the latest incident in a long line of targeted attacks against humanitarian agencies and staff. The past four years has seen an increase in targeted attacks against national and international humanitarian organizations and staff across Pakistan by violent militant groups and criminals. The Red Cross has been working in Pakistan since the country's independence in 1947, providing health care, physical rehabilitation and other assistance for victims of violence and natural disasters. The forum called on Pakistan's government to condemn such acts of violence and do more to protect aid workers.
