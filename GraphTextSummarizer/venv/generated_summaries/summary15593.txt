"What's amazing about 'The Real World' is that every four years, in a sense, a new audience grows up into it," Murray said, adding that he always hears people say things like, "'That Vegas season was the best (yet),' and they've never even heard of that first Vegas season (which premiered in 2002) with Trishelle (Cannatella). "We've seen certain shows like 'Newlyweds' or 'The Osbournes' or 'Jersey Shore' come along, and somehow, 'The Real World' keeps coming back while some of those other shows have their super bright nova in the sky," Murray said. Alcaide's drinking problem, which eventually resulted in her temporarily leaving the show to enter a rehab center, shed a light on how young people cope with substance abuse, Murray said. "'The Real World' was definitely the first show to put people into a house to live together," said Jonathan Murray, co-creator and executive producer of the series. It also introduced the "confessional" -- a room where cast members can go to speak directly into the camera and comment on their actions, Murray said.
