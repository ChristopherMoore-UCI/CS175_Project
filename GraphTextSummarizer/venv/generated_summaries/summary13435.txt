In President Obama's and Romney's cases, fathers -- present or absent -- are a large part of that cloth. In the nature-versus-nurture debate, psychologists say fathers play an important role in the men their sons become. For Romney, Cloud says it would be possible for a strong father figure to push his child down a lesser path. Mitt Romney worshiped his father. "You see a path in [Romney's] maturing over the years, in what some people might call 'flip-flopping' could be explained as a maturing path into finding his own stance," Dr. Henry Cloud, a clinical psychologist and author of "The One Life Solution: Reclaim Your Personal Life While Achieving Greater Professional Success," explained of Romney.
