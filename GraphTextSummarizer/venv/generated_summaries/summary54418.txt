"This is an extraordinary settlement for retired NFL players and their families -- from those who suffer with neuro-cognitive illnesses today, to those who are currently healthy but fear they may develop symptoms decades into the future," said the two lead attorneys for the players, Christopher Seeger and Sol Weiss. The settlement will provide eligible retired players with baseline neurological exams and include monetary awards for diagnoses of ALS, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and early and moderate dementia. Players with less than five years of experience will receive smaller awards. A federal judge approved Monday a preliminary settlement in a class action lawsuit filed by thousands of former NFL players against the National Football League. "We are grateful to Judge (Anita) Brody for her guidance and her thoughtful analysis of the issues as reflected in the comprehensive opinion she issued today," said NFL Senior Vice President Anastasia Danias.
