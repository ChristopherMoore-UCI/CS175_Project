Pro-Russian separatists wielding automatic weapons and grenades attacked Ukraine border service vehicles Saturday near the city, Ukraine's State Border Service said. A U.S. National Security Council spokeswoman Saturday condemned that attack, saying officials were "deeply concerned about the situation in eastern Ukraine, including by the fact that militant and separatist groups have received heavy weapons from Russia, including tanks, which is a significant escalation. "President Obama made clear that de-escalation depends upon Russia ceasing support for separatists in eastern Ukraine and stopping the provision of arms and materiel across the border, and we urge Russia to do so." Video posted to YouTube claimed to show the plane being shot down. If the latest reports are confirmed, the statement added, "this would mark a grave escalation of the crisis in eastern Ukraine in violation of Russia's Geneva commitments. It also accused Russian officials of having been "repeatedly misleading and evasive regarding their roles in both Crimea and eastern Ukraine."
