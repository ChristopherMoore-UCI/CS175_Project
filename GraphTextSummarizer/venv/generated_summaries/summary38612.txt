That corresponds with what the woman's parents told CNN affiliate Tolo News, saying their daughter suffered from mental health problems for the last 16 years. A group of women were shouting at the eventual victim, accusing her of burning the Quran, according to Nahid. Mark Bowden, acting head of the U.N. Afghanistan mission, said that burning the Quran hurts efforts to promote "understanding and mutual respect between cultures and religions." "However, the brutal murder of this woman is an unspeakably horrendous act," Bowden said, "that should result in those responsible being prosecuted, to the fullest extent possible, under Afghan law." Nahid, a 45-year-old woman who goes only by one name, told CNN what she saw and heard outside the Shah Do Shamshera shrine, which is opposite a mosque by the same name. As of Saturday, 11 people had been arrested in connection with the woman's death, according to Interior Ministry spokesman Sediq Seddiqi. What motivated the mob, according to witnesses, was a belief that the targeted woman had burned the Quran.
