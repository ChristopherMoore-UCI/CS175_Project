Tony Nicklinson, 58, had been refusing food since last week, contracted pneumonia over the weekend, and "went downhill rapidly," said his lawyer, Saimo Chahal. "All too often, well-meaning able-bodied people just assume that if a person is so severely disabled that he needs assistance to commit suicide, he must automatically be unable to deal with such choice," he said in June. In a statement given via his computer last week after the decision, Nicklinson said: "It's not the result I was hoping for but it isn't entirely unexpected. Speaking to CNN in June, Jane Nicklinson described her husband before the stroke as a man who was the "life and soul of the party," making his current severely restricted existence even harder to bear. The former rugby player was left paralyzed from the neck down by a catastrophic stroke seven years ago, and lost a High Court battle last week to gain a legal right to end his life when he chose.
