The victory was especially meaningful for Franchitti, coming a year after his friend Dan Wheldon earned the checkered flag at Indy and seven months after the Englishman died after crashing during a race in Nevada. "We'll all be driving with heavy hearts," driver Marco Andretti told CNN hours before the grandson of renowned driver Mario Andretti ran well but ended up spinning out with 13 laps to go. I think we just have to think of what a happy person he was and how much he loved the sport and Indy in particular. " The race featured a record-setting 35 lead changes, as well as a number of cautions -- including two in the final 13 laps -- as drivers fought for position, according to ABC. Wider cockpits, wheel guards, a smaller engine, vertical wings on the side panels and energy absorption foam have all been added to keep drivers safer on the track and in the event of an accident.
