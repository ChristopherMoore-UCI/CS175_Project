-- Iranian opposition leader Mehdi Karrubi has not been seen for six weeks and may be facing psychological torture by the government, activists claimed Monday, citing sources in the country. Iran media said Monday that that Karrubi was being kept in an unknown location but did not include any comments from Iranian officials. "We are extremely concerned for the health and well-being of Karrubi, who is 74 years old, and no one has heard from him for six weeks, not his wife, any family or associates," said Hadi Ghaemi, the director of the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran. International journalists have been limited in their ability to gather news in Iran, where the government has squelched the media and maintains tight control over state-linked news organizations. An opposition website said February that both Karrubi and Mir Hossein Moussavi, another opposition leader, had been detained.
