-- Formula One legend Alain Prost has just "one big regret" -- his portrayal in an award winning film about his arch rival -- the late, great Ayrton Senna. No one has died in F1 racing since that fateful weekend and it provided the producers of the movie with a chilling conclusion which left many film goers in tears as they left cinemas. " Senna scriptwriter Manish Pandey defended Prost's portrayal in the film but admitted it was "very, very diffficult to compress those 10 years (of the F1 legend's career) into 100 minutes." In a recent poll by CNN, Prost was mentioned in dispatches by viewers in our quest to find the greatest F1 driver of all time, with Senna and Argentine maestro Juan Manuel Fangio acknowledged as the best of their eras. " Prost is still intensely proud of the era which saw the pair dominate F1 racing.
