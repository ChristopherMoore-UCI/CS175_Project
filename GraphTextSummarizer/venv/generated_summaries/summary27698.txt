However, it was not such a good day for 28-year-old American Roddick, who had a match-point in the final set of his quarterfinal, before going on to lose 7-6 (7-5) 4-6 7-6 (8-6) to fifth seed Gael Monfils. The Spaniard will next face Serbia's Viktor Troicki, who put out Guillermo Garcia-Lopez -- Nadal's conqueror in last week's Thailand Open semifinals. Second seed Vera Zvonareva thrashed French Open champion Francesca Schiavone 6-0 6-2 to also reach the last four, where the Russian will take on home hope Li Na. Isner, ranked 22 in the world, upset fourth seed Nikolay Davydenko of Russia 7-6 (7-2) 6-4 to book his match-up against the world number two on Saturday. The 20-year-old Dane, who will be officially unveiled as Serena Williams' successor at the summit next week, will play Shahar Peer on Saturday after the Israeli 15th seed ended the run of young Swiss prospect Timea Bacsinszky with a 7-6 (7-4) 6-4 win in the final last-eight match.
