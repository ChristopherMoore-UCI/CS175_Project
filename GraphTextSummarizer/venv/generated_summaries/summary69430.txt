Howard has been a mainstay in goal for the English Premier League team and if not for a back injury two years ago, likely would have matched -- and exceeded -- Neville Southall's Everton record of consecutive league appearances. " A calf injury ruled Howard out of the Everton lineup for nearly two months before he returned last week in a 1-0 loss at Chelsea. Howard is taking a break from the national team this season to spend more time with his two U.S.-based children though is hoping to return to Jurgen Klinsmann's side and reclaim the starting position from Aston Villa's Brad Guzan. "When Alex Ferguson left I think there was a lot of people probably in the media (licking their) chops, excited for and looking for the slaughter that was about to come -- that was impending because unless the next manager came in and was absolutely perfect that was what was going to happen," said Howard, who moved to Everton from United. The Scot didn't last a season when he replaced Manchester United legend Alex Ferguson at Old Trafford but is now having success in Spain with Real Sociedad.
