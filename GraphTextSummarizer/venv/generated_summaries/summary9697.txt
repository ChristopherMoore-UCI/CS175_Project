And because computing produces data, and that data equals surveillance, we have created a world of ubiquitous surveillance. Specific individuals were targeted for surveillance, and maximal information was collected on them alone. Corporate surveillance has been on a path from minimal to maximal information. When surveillance information was expensive to collect and store, companies made do with as little as possible. The former always collected information about everyone, but over time, collected more and more of it, while the latter always collected maximal information, but over time, collected it on more and more people.
