Park said the South Korean government would "redouble its efforts to further promote peace on the Korean Peninsula and lay the groundwork for peaceful reunification." Dennis Rodman leaves North Korea without meeting Kim Jong Un North Korea in 2014: A country on the ledge Analysts have said that the purge of Jang could be a sign of instability inside North Korea and that Kim could seek to focus attention away from domestic issues by carrying out a provocative act, like another new rocket or nuclear test. "In the seething period of the effort for building a thriving country last year, we took the resolute measure of removing the factionalists lurking in the Party," Kim said in a New Year's address, referring to the North's ruling Workers' Party of Korea.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Wednesday praised the recent purge of his uncle and former protector, saying it brought greater unity within the secretive, nuclear-armed state.
