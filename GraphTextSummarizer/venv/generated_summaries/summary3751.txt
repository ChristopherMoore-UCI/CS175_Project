The NFL simply cannot handle criminal cases involving domestic violence, child abuse or sexual assault. Will players who are arrested and investigated (Ray McDonald) be treated differently than those that plead no contest to a less offense (Adrian Peterson) or for pretrial programs (Ray Rice)? Instead, NFL owners unanimously agreed to a policy that's clearly about saving face, keeping players on the field, profits in their pockets and the power in Commissioner Roger Goodell's hands. The investigation, not arrests or charges being filed, determine whether or not Ray Rice is put on paid leave. The guidelines could have created a monumental moment in NFL lawmaking.
