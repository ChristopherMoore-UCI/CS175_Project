But while of particular interest to the electrical storm specialists at Cardiff University, lightning is just one of the many extreme weather phenomena encountered by planes when in the air. Watch this: Superjumbo visits in tiny French village At Cranfield University just outside London a team of engineers specialize in analyzing the formation of ice around engines and on aeroplane wings. "There is a lightning strike every second around the world (and) every single aircraft is hit by lightning once a year," said Professor Manu Hadad of Cardiff University's Institute of Energy. But Hammond is hopeful that other discoveries on how planes react to extreme weather will arise during the process of the group's studies. The idea is to recreate the conditions present when lightning strikes a plane at 35,000 feet, testing the fortitude of composite materials and conductor strips found on modern planes.
