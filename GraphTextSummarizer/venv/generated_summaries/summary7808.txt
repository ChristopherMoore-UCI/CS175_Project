When Wavy Gravy said, "What we have in mind is breakfast in bed for 400,000," that's what it felt like: hundreds of thousands of friends and loved ones taking care of one another. Forty years ago this summer I wound up opening the Woodstock festival when the four acts scheduled before me were stuck in massive traffic jams and delayed in getting to the concert site in Bethel, New York. I sang every song I knew, and when they asked me to go back on one more time, I improvised "Freedom." When you see me in the movie tuning my guitar and strumming, I was actually trying to figure out what else I could possibly play! Folk singer Richie Havens, who died Monday at 72, was the opening act in 1969 at Woodstock, the historic counterculture music festival, catapulting him to fame and securing his status as an icon of the baby-boomer generation. On the 40th anniversary of the Woodstock festival, Havens wrote this reflection for CNN.com in 2009.
