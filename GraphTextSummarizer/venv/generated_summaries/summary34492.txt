But rather than giving Addison her papers and letting her go, the court detained her again and sent her to Gleno prison outside Dili, a U.S. State Department official said. For her first five days in Gleno prison, Addison was held on her own, according to Kero. She said she hopes a meeting Friday between U.S. State Department officials and the Timorese ambassador might help move the case forward. After working for 10 years as a vet and saving money, Addison quit her job, sold her home and belongings and set out to travel the world, setting aside a small nest egg for when she would eventually come home, Kero said. Kero said embassy staff have been "extremely supportive" in the case -- they brought Addison a birthday cake recently.
