In June, Burns and his team brought almost 300 volunteers to Curitiba, one of the 12 host cities for this year's World Cup. " Since 2006, Burns' group has enlisted more than 500 volunteers to work on construction projects, educational programs and soccer clinics that have helped nearly 6,000 children. Burns and his volunteers will return there to teach English and coach soccer for years to come. "Whether you're in a host city or back at home watching it on TV ... it captures you," said Jon Burns, a lifelong fan of English football. His UK-based nonprofit, Lionsraw, mobilizes soccer fans to volunteer in cities hosting the World Cup and other major tournaments.
