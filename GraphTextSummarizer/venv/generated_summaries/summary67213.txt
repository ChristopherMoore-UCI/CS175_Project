Germany and other friendly countries complained when Snowden's disclosures last year revealed U.S. surveillance of foreign leaders as well as screening of foreign phone calls and Internet contacts in investigating terrorist ties. -- President Barack Obama and visiting German Chancellor Angela Merkel acknowledged Friday that differences remain between their governments on surveillance programs in the aftermath of disclosures by classified leaker Edward Snowden. The issue ignited public anger in Europe, including Germany, and Merkel said talks with U.S. officials so far failed to bring agreement. The Obama administration responded that all countries conduct surveillance on each other, but the President also has ordered changes in U.S. programs. Obama told reporters at a joint news conference at the White House that "we're not perfectly aligned," noting the United States has no "blanket no-spy agreement" with any country, including close allies.
