Nathan Nicholson told the agents that at his father's behest, he made trips to California, Mexico, Peru and Cyprus, where he met with Russian government representatives who gave him payments totaling more than $35,000 in cash. According to court records, the elder Nicholson and his son put the plot into motion after Nathan Nicholson complained to his father about the family's precarious finances. According to court documents, Nathan Nicholson, 26, cooperated with prosecutors in their case against his father after FBI agents confronted him about frequent international travel.
