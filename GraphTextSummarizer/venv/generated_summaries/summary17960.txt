The symptoms of mad cow disease aren't always the obvious stumbling or odd posture seen in video of mad cows from England over a decade ago. Since 2004, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has required that cattle be able to walk to slaughter after an inspection by a USDA veterinarian -- largely as a precaution against bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or mad cow disease. However, some strongly disagree with this decision, including Dr. Linda Detwiler, a former USDA veterinarian who trained other veterinarians to detect mad cow disease. U.S. Agriculture Secretary Ed Schafer said Sunday in a statement that the recall was prompted "because the cattle did not receive complete and proper inspection" and were determined to be "unfit for human food." Only rarely does a cow pass pre-slaughter inspection, somehow become unable to walk, and then get re-examined by a veterinarian and pass for slaughter, according to Dr. Kenneth Petersen of the USDA. This rule was put in place when the first cow with mad cow disease was found in Washington state at the end of 2003.
