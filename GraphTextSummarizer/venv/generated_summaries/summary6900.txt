But since then the situation has changed dramatically, with Russia finding itself in a bitter stand-off with the West over the crisis in Ukraine and the new status of Crimea that has become part of Russian territory. The Russian president warned the West that Russia was prepared to defend itself militarily, should the need arise, and was not going to allow anyone to achieve military superiority over it -- unimaginable a year ago. To sum it up, the Kremlin appears to have no taste for any drastic economic measures and will continue to pursue the line that Western sanctions hurt not just Russia but the West as well. He also made the point of insisting that had the crisis in Ukraine not happened at all, the West would have found some other pretext to try to undermine Russia's economic standing. He even went as far as saying that this policy of containment of Russia by the West dates back years, decades and even centuries: obviously music to the ears of those people in Russia who always said trusting the West was a bad idea.
