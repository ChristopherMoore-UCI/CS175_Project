Diamond Jubilee celebrations marking six decades on the throne for Queen Elizabeth II officially began last month and continue through June, when London will mark the anniversary of her coronation with festivities including up to 1,000 boats sailing up the River Thames. Prince Harry boarded a media boat after a mechanical failure stopped the Royal Bahamas Defence Force boat he was riding to Harbour Island on Sunday. Prince Harry's Diamond Jubilee celebrations began Friday in the Belize capital Belmopan, where the prince danced and drank in a street party along the newly named HM Queen Elizabeth II Boulevard. -- A speedboat carrying Britain's Prince Harry broke down in the Bahamas, but that didn't slow the royal down during his Caribbean tour. Throngs of cheering crowds met him on the island, which the 27-year-old son of Prince Charles and Diana visited as part of a tour celebrating the 60th anniversary of his grandmother's accession to the throne.
