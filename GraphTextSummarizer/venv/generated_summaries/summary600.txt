"There's no doubt he's the best jockey in the U.S. today," said jockey agent Ron Anderson, who has been in the business 40 years and worked with such riding legends as Gary Stevens. Triple Crown dreams A jockey hasn't won America's prestigious Triple Crown -- which includes the Kentucky Derby, Preakness Stakes and Belmont Stakes -- in over a decade. The country's top earning jockey usually wakes around 7 a.m., trains for a few hours, races, and plays sport with his friends when he can. This Saturday all eyes will be on Rosario and wonder horse Orb as they attempt to take the second race in the coveted treble -- the Preakness Stakes. While other jockeys wake at dawn and spend entire days at the stables, Rosario prefers to play his beloved baseball or golf in the afternoons.
