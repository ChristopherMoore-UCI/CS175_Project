The curling stones used in Sochi are made of two types of granite: Ailsa Craig common green and blue hone. With $1.5 million already knocked off the asking price, Ailsa Craig admittedly does come with a certain amount of baggage. Every one of those can lay claim to being a stone of destiny, and remarkably all of them originate from exactly the same pocket of Ailsa Craig, a 220-acre island 10 miles from mainland Scotland. It is still an active quarry where blasting is allowed, a process banned on Ailsa Craig due to its bird sanctuary. As things stand, curling's very long-term future looks likely to rest in the hands of a nature conservation body, which wants to remain nameless but has tabled an offer for Ailsa Craig.
