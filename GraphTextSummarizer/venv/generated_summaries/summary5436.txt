Such a rule would afford terrorists multiple opportunities to attempt to penetrate airport security by 'electing not to fly' on the cusp of detection until a vulnerable portal is found. Pistole, who addressed a Senate Homeland Security Committee hearing on air cargo safety on Tuesday, veered off topic to plead with the American public to see airport security "as a partnership. In a letter to aviation authorities, Rep. John Mica, R-Florida, raised the idea of privatization at transport hubs, which he said could improve efficiency and enable airports to opt out of TSA safety regulations. Chesley "Sully" Sullenberger -- the hero pilot who safely landed a crippled US Airways jet on the Hudson River last year -- joined, in part, an increasingly vocal opposition to heightened airport security procedures. It is not clear whether private screening is more efficient than TSA procedures or whether such screenings would meet federal safety standards.
