-- Romanian opposition leaders called for a series of protests beginning on Thursday to demand the resignation of government leaders and early elections. On Tuesday, thousands marched on the streets nationwide, asking for the resignation of President Traian Basescu and early elections. "Early elections are the best solution we have to end the protests," opposition leader Crin Antonescu said. After receiving a loan of 20 billion euros from the International Monetary Fund and the European Union in 2009, the government cut salaries in the public sector by 25% a year later to enforce austerity measures recommended by the IMF. The opposition leaders met with Prime Minister Emil Boc on Wednesday to discuss the situation Romania is facing, following six days of citizen protests.
