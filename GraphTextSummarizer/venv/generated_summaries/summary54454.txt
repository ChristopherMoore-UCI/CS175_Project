Different from Whedon's fully involved "Buffy" series on Dark Horse, the occasional "Serenity" books feel like brief visits with old friends. "Float Out," released Thursday by Dark Horse, is written by actor, comedian and "Firefly" devotee Patton Oswalt based on an idea he floated to Whedon. In 2005's "Serenity: Those Left Behind" and 2008's "Serenity: Better Days" -- both produced by Whedon for Dark Horse Comics -- we get to see Captain Mal and friends in action. The one-off book opens with three friends of Wash (full name: Hoban Washburne) pausing to remember him before christening a new ship -- It focuses on Wash, the wise-cracking ace pilot whose stunning death at the end of "Serenity" can still bring some devoted browncoats to tears with a single mention.
