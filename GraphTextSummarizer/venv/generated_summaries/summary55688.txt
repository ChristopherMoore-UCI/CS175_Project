" Overcome complications Complicating the search -- which the Australian Maritime Safety Authority suspended Thursday night and will resume Friday morning -- is the fact that the debris field is probably far away from where it was when it was spotted in satellite images shot four days ago. "It could be just a false lead," Taylor told CNN's "New Day." John Blaxland, senior fellow at Australian National University and an expert on Australian radar, agreed. "Our experience is that there is debris out there -- from ships, for example, falling overboard," he said. " Search Four planes were involved in Thursday's search, which covered 8,880 square miles (23,000 square kilometers) about 1,600 miles (2,500 kilometers) southwest of Perth, according to the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. "We are in the most isolated part of the world," Australian Defense Minister David Johnston told Sky News.
