Ian Livingston, BT's chief executive officer, told Marketplace Europe the "consumerization" of business -- the trend for personal consumer devices such as smartphones and tablet computers to be used in the workplace -- was redefining the way we do business. "The reason we start with customer service, apart from the obvious fact that customers like better service, is actually the biggest cost of our business and any telecoms business is the cost of failure. The soaring popularity of smartphones and tablets is eroding the distinction between our business and personal worlds, says the head of British telecoms giant BT. "That cost transformation has got more to go, and it also frees up money and people to invest in the future of business." "One of the things that we are seeing is the barrier between business and consumer is beginning to come down," he said.
