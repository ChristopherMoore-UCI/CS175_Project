Quethelie Alexie and her sister-in-law, Nadine Alexie, both testified in the sixth week of the trial of Smith's boyfriend-lawyer Howard K. Stern and Drs. -- Prosecutors in the Anna Nicole Smith drug trial paid rent, utilities and moving expenses so a key witness could testify this week, according to testimony Wednesday. She told prosecutors when she arrived in Los Angeles on Sunday that she needed additional financial help to pay her rent and utilities for her home back in the Bahamas, she said. Both women worked for Smith in the Bahamas for several months after the birth of her daughter in September 2006. The defense also worked to cast doubt in jurors' minds by questioning Quethelie Alexie about the financial arrangements she made with prosecutors before she agreed to testify.
