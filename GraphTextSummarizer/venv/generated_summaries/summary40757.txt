One call was made on the phone from a heavily wooded area near other residences, said Marshall, who declined to provide details. As of Wednesday afternoon, when simultaneous vigils were held for Watson, nearly 21,000 people had become members of a Facebook page about her disappearance. Watson was on a Thanksgiving break from Mercyhurst College in Erie, Pennsylvania. Authorities consider Watson's disappearance a missing-person case, Marshall said. "It was amazing today to see the turnout during fall break," college spokeswoman Debbie Morton said of the vigil held there.
