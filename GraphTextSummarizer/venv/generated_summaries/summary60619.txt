My target was the overall limits on an individual's fully disclosed contributions to federal candidates, national political parties and political action committees. Allowing individuals to donate to as many candidates as they wish would draw contributions away from PACs and bring money directly to candidates, giving underdog candidates a fair chance in the political arena. During my political science course as a freshman at Georgia Tech University, I learned about the Supreme Court's landmark 1976 decision that political activity was entitled to that protection. My objective is to assist challengers in raising funds, and to encourage smarter political ideas. I clearly am not one of those special interests, nor am I one of the billionaires who have become political targets.
