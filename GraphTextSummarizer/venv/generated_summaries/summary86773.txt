-- A top Ugandan opposition leader was arrested again Thursday during a "walk to work" campaign to protest rising food prices and increased cost of living. Besigye has vowed to "walk to work" to protest every Monday and Thursday, contending the government is manipulating prices of fuel and other commodities. President Yoweri Museveni has warned that anyone taking part in the walk is breaking the law and will be prosecuted. Besigye, a former doctor to Museveni, lost previous presidential bids in 2001 and 2006. During his latest arrest Thursday, men in civilian clothing smashed his car and pepper-sprayed him.
