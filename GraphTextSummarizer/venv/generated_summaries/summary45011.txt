AirTran passengers scheduled to travel either to or from Atlanta between 7 p.m. Wednesday and noon Thursday will be permitted to change their reservation without penalty as long as the travel is completed within three days of the originally scheduled departure date, the statement said. Delays were reported at Washington's Reagan Airport and Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport on Thursday, according to the Federal Aviation Administration's flight status website. "Winter weather in the Midwest and Southeast has impacted travel to, from, and through Iowa, Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, Georgia, Tennessee, and Kentucky," said an advisory Wednesday on the website for Delta Airlines, the largest carrier in Atlanta. Scores of traffic accidents were reported Wednesday night and early Thursday. The brunt of the system is poised to hit Kentucky, Virginia and West Virginia, but several inches of snow are forecast for portions of Indiana, Ohio, Tennessee and North Carolina, as well as Minnesota and the Dakotas.
