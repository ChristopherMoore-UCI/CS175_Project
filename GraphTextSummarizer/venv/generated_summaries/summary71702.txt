Peter Bregman says good times persuaded people to sacrifice what they loved for money. Of course, losing money can break people apart; we fight about money, people lose jobs and get depressed; tension rises as mortgage bills sit on the kitchen table unpaid; resentment builds when one person doesn't live up to his own and others' expectations. Losing money can bring you closer to your values; can actually bring people together. The first year I made more money than I had in the previous three combined, the second year I doubled that and by the third year I began to fantasize about retiring within the decade. Above a basic threshold, more money doesn't make us happier.
