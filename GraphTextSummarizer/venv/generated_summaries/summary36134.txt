Hansen is the fourth rider disqualified and suspended in cases involving capsaicin: Germany's Christian Ahlmann was suspended for four months, Brazil's Bernardo Alves for three-and-a-half months, and Irish rider Denis Lynch got a three-month ban. The United States won gold, beating Canada in a jumpoff in Hong Kong, where the equestrian events were staged last August. The fourth-placed Switzerland team of Steve Guerdat, Christina Liebherr, Niklaus Schurtenberger and Pius Schwizer will now be awarded the bronze medals by the International Olympic Committee. This is done to encourage horses to jump higher because striking an obstacle becomes more painful. Without his scores, his teammates -- Morten Djupvik, Stein Endresen, and Geir Gulliksen -- drop out of medal contention.
