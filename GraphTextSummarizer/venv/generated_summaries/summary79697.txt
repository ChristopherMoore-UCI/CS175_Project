-- The World Health Organization on Monday raised its pandemic alert level in response to the outbreak of swine flu that originated in Mexico. Meanwhile, Israel and New Zealand were investigating unconfirmed cases of swine flu. In Israel, doctors are running tests on a man who recently returned from Mexico with light flu symptoms. "Sadly, 149 people have died, of which we are working to confirm if they are linked to the swine flu," Mexico Health Secretary Jose Angel Cordova Villalobos said. The total was expected to rise as more cases are confirmed, especially in Mexico, where as many as 149 deaths are thought to have been caused by the virus, the country's health secretary said.
