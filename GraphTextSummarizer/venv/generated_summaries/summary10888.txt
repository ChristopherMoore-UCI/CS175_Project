While coral reefs in other parts of the Caribbean have suffered from coral bleaching caused by rising sea temperatures, Mexico's reefs have largely escaped this partly due to the hurricanes that have battered this coastline in recent years. In Mexico and across the world, the fragile ecosystems of coral reefs are under threat from human activity. An occasional storm can actually have a beneficial effect on coral reefs, says Sanchez-Navarro, because the turbulence allows the coral to break off and spread. Coral reefs also provide essential protection from storms, acting as a buffer that prevents coastlines from feeling the full force of a storm surge. Coral reefs drop the intensity of the storm significantly: the surge can become 75 percent less.
