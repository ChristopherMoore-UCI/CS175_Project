-- Rio de Janeiro will host the next World Youth Day, Pope Benedict XVI announced Sunday to hundreds of thousands of young Roman Catholic pilgrims at the close of this year's event in Madrid. The World Youth Day organization said it was spending about $70 million on the event, which is celebrated on a global scale every few years and which this year included activities that cut traffic in central Madrid on Thursday and Friday, before moving to the airbase over the weekend. Madrid will see economic benefits as a result of the large number of visitors and the attention from international news media, Spain's chief government spokesman, Jose Blanco, told a news conference Friday. "I am pleased now to announce that the next World Youth Day will be held in 2013, in Rio de Janeiro," the Pope told the faithful assembled to celebrate Mass at a military airbase on Madrid's western outskirts. Benedict ended his four-day visit to Madrid on Sunday, with Spain's King Juan Carlos I and Queen Sofia escorting the Roman Catholic leader to the steps of his outbound jetliner.
