ETA has been waging an armed struggle since the late 1960s for an independent Basque homeland in northern Spain and southwestern France. We are not going to change this until ETA ends its violence," Spanish Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba told reporters Thursday after the arrest was announced. Gogeaskoetxea's arrest comes a day after that of ETA suspect Daniel Derguy, who was detained in the town of Cahors, in southern France. Members of ETA allegedly tried to kill Spain's King Juan Carlos when he attended the inauguration of the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, in October 1997. El Pais reports that his brother Ibon Gogeaskoetxea, an alleged ETA leader, was arrested in February last year in France.
