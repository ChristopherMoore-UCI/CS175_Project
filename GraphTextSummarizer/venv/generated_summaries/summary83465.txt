"TSA screens every bag placed on an airplane, whether taken as carry-on or checked with an airline," said TSA spokesman Ross Feinstein, via e-mail. On Friday, a 26-year-old woman was arrested at Oakland International Airport after the TSA allegedly discovered marijuana in her three checked bags, according to the TSA. "As is common practice, TSA notified the Alameda County Sheriff's Office of the discovery, who responded and took possession of the marijuana," said Feinstein. But if you pack your suitcases with 81 pounds of marijuana, TSA officers screening your checked baggage are very likely to notice. Some 81 pounds of marijuana in three separate checked bags?
