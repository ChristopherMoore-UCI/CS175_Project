They, too, called for government to improve basic services and not to evacuate them from government buildings and institutions. Dozens of protesters in Kut, part of another predominantly Shiite province about 110 kilometers south of Baghdad, Thursday demanded the resignation of Wasit's provincial governor, Latif Hamed, according to a Wasit police official and an Iraqi Interior Ministry official. Iraqi security forces, from the army and police, sported machine guns as they surrounded the demonstrators. Elsewhere in Baghdad on Sunday, another 100 people rallied just outside the heavily fortified Green Zone that houses Iraqi government offices and the U.S. and British embassies. Iraqi police opened fire, ostensibly to disperse the crowd, and wounded three protesters in the process, the officials said.
