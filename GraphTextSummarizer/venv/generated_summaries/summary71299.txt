Protest leaders have said they want to rid Thailand of the influence of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, the older brother of Yingluck Shinawatra. The unrest came as demonstrators hoped to force Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra from office. Gunmen opened fire on peaceful protesters in Thailand Friday night, killing one and wounding three, national security chief Paradon Patthanathabut said. That's an ambitious goal in a country where every election since 2001 has been won by parties affiliated with Thaksin Shinawatra, a billionaire who built his political success on populist policies that appealed to Thailand's rural heartland. In protests near that complex, one police officer died and scores of people were injured, according to police.
