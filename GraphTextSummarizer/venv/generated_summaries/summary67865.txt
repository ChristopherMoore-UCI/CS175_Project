Although the posts did not carry Harpham's name directly, Law Center officials said they had come to know him by his writing, and recognized his work as it appeared on line. " Many of the postings the Southern Poverty Law Center cited Harpham as writing on white supremacist websites were written under the pseudonym "Joe Snuffy," military slang for a low-ranking soldier. -- A suspect in the attempted bombing of a Martin Luther King Jr. Day parade frequently posted his beliefs on white supremacist websites, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, which monitors hate groups. The attempted bombing was an unwelcome reminder for many residents of the region's past with white supremacist and neo-Nazi groups. Those who say you can't win a war by bombing have never tried," another posting purportedly by Harpham read, according to the Law Center.
