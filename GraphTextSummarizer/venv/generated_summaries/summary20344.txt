-- Lindsay Lohan's had enough of people's false accusations while she's trying to get her career back on track after five years of legal troubles, her publicist said Tuesday. Lohan and her lawyer, Shawn Holley, will visit the Los Angeles County sheriff's West Hollywood substation Tuesday to request an investigation of Marisa Sullivan Dugas, the woman who accused Lohan of battery. "I know it's hard when people are following you all over the place, but that's the life you chose," Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Stephanie Sautner told Lohan, advising her to "live your life in a more mature way, stop the nightclubbing and focus on your work. Lohan was at home watching television at the time of the alleged nightclub scuffle, Honig said. But bad news coverage could reinforce concerns that film and TV producers have about hiring Lohan for projects at a time that she's trying to prove she's dependable and ready to stay out of trouble.
