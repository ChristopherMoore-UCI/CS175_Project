Aruba Solicitor General Taco Stein said no witnesses have come forward to say they saw Gardner and Gary Giordano snorkeling off Baby Beach. He told HLN's Nancy Grace on Wednesday evening that Gardner wasn't the type to go into deep water, and would more likely stay by the pool. "He is suspected of involvement in the disappearance of Miss Gardner," Angela said, adding that the man is a 50-year-old U.S. citizen. Robyn Gardner, 35, of Maryland, was last seen August 2 near Baby Beach on the western tip of the Caribbean island, said Ann Angela, spokeswoman for the prosecutor's office. The Natalee Holloway Resource Center -- named after a young American woman whose disappearance in Aruba made international news -- said Forester brought their attention to the case Monday.
