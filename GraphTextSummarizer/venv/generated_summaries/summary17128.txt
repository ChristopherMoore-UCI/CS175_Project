Sure, go ahead and be outraged over Joan Rivers' and Seth MacFarlane's jokes if you must, but let's show some anger about the fact that almost 10,000 Americans died in gun violence last year and still Congress hasn't passed a universal background check to ensure that criminals and mentally ill people can't legally buy guns. Any chance they wanted the public backlash to make the show, which has seen ratings woes in recent years, more relevant? Instant outrage, however, is not just reserved for comedians; it crops up all over the news cycle. And please save some (actually a lot) of outrage for Congress, which has become the political equivalent of Lindsay Lohan: We only see it in media coverage doing bad things. In fact, it's my third favorite country in North America.
