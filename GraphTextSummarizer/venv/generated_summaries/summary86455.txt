Meanwhile, Stuart, who also runs poetry and performance workshops, says the multi-layered format "democratizes poetry" by "offering an equal platform to poets working in all languages on the continent, and to established and emerging poets. "A lot of publishers right now aren't publishing a lot of poetry, (and) we don't want that to be what stops us as poets from having thriving careers. And in a time when traditional publishers are shying away from printing poetry due to lack of sales, the project offers poets a new outlet for presenting their work in a digital age. It is the first 'living archive' focusing solely on poets from Africa and the diaspora. "Africa has a history of a lack of documentation and we really didn't want this to happen to our poets." Kaoma, 29, is part of the team behind the Badilisha Poetry X-Change, the largest online archive of African poetry, accessible via mobile phone, in the world.
