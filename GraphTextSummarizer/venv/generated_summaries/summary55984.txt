Cities leading the way in video data collecting include London -- an early and strong adopter of widespread camera surveillance.

Images of the two suspects were available in public data bases, but the computers that searched that data missed them, CNN's Tom Foreman reported last year. Last year's Boston bombings investigation showed how fast police were able to sift through mountains of surveillance data. But the broader issue of centralized data surveillance poses serious privacy questions for millions of people in cities around the globe.
