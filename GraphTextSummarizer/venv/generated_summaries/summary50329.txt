As he has repeatedly in recent weeks, Obama again pressed for Congress on Tuesday night to "meet their responsibility, put their party politics aside and take action on jobs right now." -- Shortly after his $447 billion jobs plan stalled Tuesday in the Senate, President Barack Obama vowed to break the broad initiative down into numerous, separate bills -- potentially setting up even more showdowns between Democrats and Republicans on how to boost the economy and where to get the money to do so. He then outlined his intention to work with Senate Majority Harry Reid and produce several smaller bills derived from the bigger plan. The provision was added by key Senate Democrats to make Obama's bill more acceptable to his own party. The 2009 measure "was a success in terms of job creation," House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California, insisted later in the week.
