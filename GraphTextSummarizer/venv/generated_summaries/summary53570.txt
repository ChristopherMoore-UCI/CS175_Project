The killings took place at the hospitals of Maciel and La Espanola in Montevideo. One of the men worked in the neurosurgery department at La Espanola; the other worked in that same department, as well as in the cardiology ward at Maciel. The police had been investigating suspicious deaths of patients at the hospitals for weeks after a tip from a worker at Maciel. One patient had their discharge order signed one day before his death, said Interior Minister Eduardo Bonomi. The government has set up an office to provide support to the families of the victims, said Health Minister Jorge Venegas.
