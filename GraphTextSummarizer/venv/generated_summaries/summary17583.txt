"Michael," Jackson's first album of new music in nine years, also includes duets with rapper 50 Cent and rocker Lenny Kravitz, according to Epic. -- A Michael Jackson duet with Akon recorded in 2007 will be released Monday morning as the first official single from the late pop star's next album, Epic Records announced Friday. The song is familiar to Jackson fans because an unfinished version of the song leaked onto the Internet in 2008, but Akon returned to the studio to complete a new version, Epic said. "Hold My Hand" featuring Akon was chosen to be the first single because the estate found a handwritten note from Jackson that indicated his desire that it be the first single on his next project, the company said. There are also earlier compelling tracks," Epic said.
