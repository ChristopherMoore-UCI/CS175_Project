How nut allergies made me monogamous About 4% to 6% of U.S. children under age 18 have food allergies, and the latest statistics show this percentage may be on the rise. For the new estimate, the researchers looked at both direct medical costs like hospital visits, co-payments and medication purchases, as well as other costs that are unique to families of children with food allergies â€” including special child care arrangements, allergy-friendly summer camps and even changing schools. Why so many kids are experiencing allergies to common food items still isn't clear, although experts suspect that some of the trend can be attributed to improved public health and sanitation efforts that may have made us too clean to build strong enough immunity to common allergens found in food and the environment. Why we're going nuts over nut allergies While other studies have investigated the economic toll of food allergies, few have studied in detail how these costs affect a family's finances. A 2011 study published in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, for example, calculated that the national cost was much lower at about $500 million, but the authors acknowledged that they underestimated the prevalence of food allergies, and excluded some other costs families cover, such as higher fees for special foods and lost productivity of parents who had to sacrifice their jobs to care for their children.
