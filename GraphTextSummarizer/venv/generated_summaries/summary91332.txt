The NTSB said the single-engine Super Decathlon "collided with terrain while maneuvering in remote mountainous terrain approximately eight miles west-northwest of Mammoth Lakes, California, destroying the plane and killing the pilot." Officials eventually discovered the wreckage at an altitude of about 10,000 feet in the Sierra Nevadas near Mammoth Lakes, California, after a hiker reported finding Fossett's personal effects, including identification cards, about a half-mile from the wreckage. Fossett also set world records in round-the-world sailing and cross-country skiing. Details from a National Transportation Safety Board report released Thursday present facts about the accident that occurred September 3, 2007, after Fossett, 63, took off from the airport of the Flying M Ranch outside Minden, Nevada. The cause of death was "multiple traumatic injuries" and "the airplane was severely fragmented and a severe post crash fire burned most of the structure and surrounding vegetation."
