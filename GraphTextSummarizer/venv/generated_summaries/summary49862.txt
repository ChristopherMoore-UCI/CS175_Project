According to a 1996 immigration law, it doesn't matter how long ago people committed their crime and the types of crimes eligible for deportation are vast and expanding. As with all deportations, the president has the "inherent power to choose which cases to act on," said Richard A. Boswell, immigration law professor at the University of California's Hastings College of the Law. But immigration advocates believe the number has gone up since Obama came into office, not only due to an increase in deportations, but also because of anecdotal evidence. But for many legal immigrants, they don't have the resources to hire top immigration and criminal attorneys to help navigate the system. You might not care about the Canadian and his "beliebers," but the 20-year-old's misbehavior and run-ins with the law raise some serious questions about immigration law enforcement.
