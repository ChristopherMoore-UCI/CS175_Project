According to court records, Aldawsari conducted online research into how to construct an improvised explosive device, or IED, using several chemicals as ingredients. On February 6, the affidavit alleges, Aldawsari sent himself an email titled "Tyrant's House," in which he listed the Dallas address for former President George W. Bush, investigators said. In a personal journal found in Aldawsari's apartment home, Aldawsari wrote the events of September 11, 2001, had produced a "big change" in his thinking and that he had been inspired by the speeches of Osama bin Laden, the affidavit said. Aldawsari was arrested in Lubbock on a federal charge of attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction in connection with his alleged purchase of chemicals and equipment necessary to make an improvised explosive device, according to the Justice Department. Authorities said Aldawsari described his desire for violent jihad and martyrdom in blog postings and a personal journal.
