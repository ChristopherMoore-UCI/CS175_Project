The night before the shootings, Clemmons threatened to kill police officers, but witnesses did not report those threats until after the slayings, Troyer said on "Good Morning America. Witnesses say Clemmons was shot during the attack, and police believe he is losing blood, Pierce County sheriff's spokesman Ed Troyer said. Police surrounded a home in eastern Seattle's Leschi neighborhood for about 12 hours, but Clemmons was not found in the home when the siege was lifted Monday morning, Seattle police spokesman Jeff Kappel told reporters. His escape was "an unlucky thing for us, and a lucky thing for him," Troyer said Monday night. Huckabee's statement brought a sharp response from Troyer on Monday.
