This has led to calls from commercial ship owners for a military blockade along the coast of Somalia to intercept pirate vessels heading out to sea. Dozens of ships have been attacked in the Gulf of Aden by pirates based in largely lawless Somalia in recent months. Elsewhere, the head of U.S. military operations in Africa has said he does not have any evidence that Somali pirates are connected to al Qaeda. Asked about alleged connections between pirates and al Qaeda, he said: "I think that's a concern that we all would have." But he added that he doesn't have "any evidence that pirates have links to al Qaeda."
