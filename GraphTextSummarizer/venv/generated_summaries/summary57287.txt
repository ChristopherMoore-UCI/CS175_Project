Stein said van der Sloot remains a "person of interest" to investigators, and Aruban prosecutors have asked the FBI -- which currently has the hard drive from van der Sloot's computer -- for any information that may be relevant to Holloway's disappearance. The piece contained a wisdom tooth, and Holloway's had been removed before her 2005 disappearance, Aruba Solicitor General Taco Stein told reporters. The piece of jawbone found on a beach in Aruba this month is human, but is not that of long-missing Alabama teenager Natalee Holloway, Aruban prosecutors said Tuesday. He is now awaiting trial in Lima, Peru, on a murder charge in the death of Peruvian student Stephany Flores, whose body was found in a hotel room registered to van der Sloot in May. Van der Sloot was detained twice in connection with Holloway's disappearance but never charged.
