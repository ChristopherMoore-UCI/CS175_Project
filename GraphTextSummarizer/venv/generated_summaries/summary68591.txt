The sponsor of a proposal to rein in aggressive celebrity photographers is meeting resistance from Los Angeles' top cop, who says the law is not needed when celebrities just behave. iReport.com: Share your celeb stories and photos Critics of the plan include Los Angeles Police Chief William Bratton, who argues that it would be difficult to enforce. "Unless every celebrity has a chaperone of a police officer with a 6-foot tape measure, how are you going to enforce it?" said photographer Nick Stern. The proposal gained exposure last month when officials from around Southern California asked former independent counsel Kenneth Starr -- whose investigation of former President Clinton spawned its own share of tabloid headlines -- to help craft a law that would protect celebrities without infringing on freedom of the press. City Councilman Dennis Zine wants to require photographers to stay a safe distance from celebrities.
