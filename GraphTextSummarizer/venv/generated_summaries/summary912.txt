The defense secretary plans to meet with troops, commanders, and he has already met with Afghan President Hamid Karzai to talk about the way ahead, Secretary Gates assuring Karzai that the U.S. has a continuing commitment to this country. Barbara Starr has more on Mr. Gates' trip there and some of the challenges that U.S. troops face there. During a speech yesterday, President Obama offered some ideas on how to create new jobs and help out the country's economy: offering tax breaks to small businesses, expanding some of the government's stimulus programs, and spending more funds on infrastructure projects -- things like roads, bridges and water systems. He is here, of course, for the first time since President Obama made the announcement that 30,000 additional U.S. troops will be headed to this war zone. The bailout ended up not costing as much as expected, and President Obama thinks the extra could be used to help out in other ways.
