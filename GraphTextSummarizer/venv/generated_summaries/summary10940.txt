Clayson Monyela, a spokesman from the Department of International Relations of South Africa, said the government has no immediate plans to send troops into Lesotho, but the South African government is closely monitoring the situation and will continue to consult with Southern African Development Community countries and the African Union Commission. Officials urge peace Thabane told eNCA the Lesotho government is seeking the assistance of the South African government and other neighboring states. Monyela added that the Lesotho military's actions "bear the hallmarks of a coup d'etat." Kamalesh Sharma, secretary-general of the Commonwealth of Nations, condemned the reported coup attempt and urged the military in Lesotho to respect civilian authority, constitutional order and the rule of law. "But how else do I earn money if I don't go to work?" A stone's throw away was more evidence that locals were carrying on as if nothing had happened and life had already returned to normal: a Lesotho Premier League soccer match. One of the teams was that of the Lesotho military.
