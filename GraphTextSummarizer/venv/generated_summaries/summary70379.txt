The Academy Museum of Motion Pictures -- with the help of "angel donors" including actor Leonardo DiCaprio -- acquired one of four pairs of the iconic red shoes last February. A purple skirt worn in Canada by Monroe, as she was filming "River of No Return," sold for $50,000, while a gold blouse and matching Capri pants fetched $43,750. That set are called the "Witch's Shoes," because they were likely seen on the Wicked Witch of the East when Dorothy's house fell on her in the film, according to the Academy. While the destination may not be known, there's no doubt the blue gingham dress wore by Judy Garland, as Dorothy in "The Wizard of Oz," has a new home. Other signature clothing auctioned off included a Steve McQueen racing jacket for $50,000, a dress Julie Andrews (as Maria) wore in "The Sound of Music" for $38,400, and a black gown worn by Jaclyn Smith of "Charlie's Angels" fame for $15,000.
