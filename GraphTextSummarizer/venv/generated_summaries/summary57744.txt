International court staff freed after detention in Libya Tunisia hands former Gadhafi PM over to Libya Extremist triangle a growing threat to Africa and America CNN's Moni Basu reported from Atlanta and Jomana Karadsheh, from Tripoli, Libya. "One was suspended from a door for hours, had boiling water poured over her head, and was beaten and stabbed while being accused of supporting the former government of Colonel Moammar Gadhafi," the report said. Critics of the militias, Amnesty said, are often labeled as Gadhafi loyalists. It said Libya should build a judicial system that will "hold perpetrators to account in trials that meet international standards and provide redress to the thousands of victims of human rights violations." Many months after the February 17 uprising that rid Libya of Gadhafi and his autocratic rule, Libyans will choose a new government Saturday.
