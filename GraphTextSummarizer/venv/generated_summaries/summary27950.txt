Every year, he offers hazing workshops, and anytime a band member has been suspended for hazing, White sends a note to the school president, the vice president of student affairs, the chief of police and the band staff. But, he added, the facts that have emerged to date "point to the fact that hazing was a cause of Robert Champion's death, and it was under FAMU's watch." Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings told CNN last week that hazing was involved but added that authorities were trying to determine an official cause of death. In addition, FAMU moved to fire longtime band director Julian E. White. "He loved the band -- so much, I always called him Mr. Band," Champion's mother, Pam Champion, told reporters of her son.
