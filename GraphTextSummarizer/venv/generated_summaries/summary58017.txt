-- Australian authorities say they're not certain when a new search area for missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 will be announced, clarifying earlier statements suggesting it would be made public Wednesday. Reports that emerged in the early stages of the investigation had suggested the plane may have made dramatic changes in altitude after it turned sharply off its scheduled path from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing. If the plane did not make sharp changes in altitude, it would have flown farther and moved farther south than the original search area. CNN safety analyst David Soucie says information about altitude changes is important because it directly affects the calculation of the new search area. The ATSB, the agency leading the underwater search for the plane, had said Sunday that the new search area would be announced Wednesday.
