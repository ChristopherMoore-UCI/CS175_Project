The decision to relieve him of his duties was made by Rear Adm. Mary M. Jackson, commander of Navy Region Southeast, the military said in a statement. John R. Nettleton has been temporarily reassigned to a post in Jacksonville, Florida, the Navy said in a statement released Wednesday. The Naval commander at Guantanamo Bay does not oversee the detention facility that President Barack Obama has vowed to close. The commanding officer of the U.S. Naval Station in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, has been relieved of duty "due to loss of confidence" in his "ability to command," the Navy says. Having an affair violates military law -- the Uniform Code of Military Justice -- and could  in itself constitute grounds for Nettleton's reassignment.
