The Berlin mansion is Barbie's first Dreamhouse in Europe and will be dismantled to tour other European cities after August 25. "They present an image of cooking, primping and singing, as if it were in some way life-fulfilling," Socialist Alternative editor Michael Koschitzki, 27, told German newspaper Der Spiegel. The Berlin movement has led to an "Occupy Barbie Dreamhouse" page on Facebook, which displays a cover image of a dark-haired girl saying, "I can't stand pink!" In addition to viewing 350 Barbie dolls and other displays, visitors can strut a long runway, "bake" virtual cupcakes in a pink kitchen or eat real ones in the cafe. Barbie has long been a subject of controversy -- with criticisms ranging from sexism to racism to creating body image issues for girls.
