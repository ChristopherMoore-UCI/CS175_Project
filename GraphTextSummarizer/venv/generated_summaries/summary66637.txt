Deloizy and Himes represent a growing number of same-sex couples with a partner of foreign nationality at risk of separation under DOMA, according to the couple's immigration attorney, Lavi Soloway. It bars federal recognition of same-sex marriages and says states cannot be forced to recognize such marriages from other states. Frederic Deloizy says his life began the day he met Mark Himes by chance at a birthday party in April 1990. Himes had recently started a job with Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education, and Deloizy was studying at a nearby college. The strangers arrived at the party at the same time, and Deloizy held the door open for Himes, catching his eye.
