That same day, Yemeni military forces -- some under the Houthis, others led by officers loyal to Hadi -- battled in Aden, leaving at least 13 people dead in the clashes, Aden Gov. Abdul Aziz Hobtour said. The Security Council again deplored the violence and called for an end to the fighting and for Houthi rebels to return government facilities to the elected government of President Abdo Rabbo Mansour Hadi. The Houthi rebels are Shiites with ties to Iran, who have long felt marginalized in majority Sunni Yemen. Yemen has been a key U.S. ally in the fight against al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, allowing U.S. drones and special operations forces to stalk terrorists in the country. On Monday, a security source in the region familiar with the situation in Yemen told CNN's Nic Robertson that British special forces had also left Yemen in the last few days.
