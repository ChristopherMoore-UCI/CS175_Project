"It may have value in terms of posture depending on how it measures neck angle and distance from the screen." The system can also sense if your neck is inclined at a poor ergonomic angle, and will give you corrective feedback showing you the ideal angle position. "It's an interesting concept and it certainly provides a potential value for timing and alerting people to take a break," David Rempel, Director of the Ergonomics Program at UC Berkeley and Professor of Medicine at UCSF, told Wired. Philips dubs the base "The SmartErgoBase" as it can be lowered to almost desk level, and allows users to tilt, rotate, swivel, and make angle adjustments to the screen. The device is also made out of 65% recycled plastics, and comes with a 0-watt hard switch that lets you cut power completely off from the monitor for zero power consumption.
