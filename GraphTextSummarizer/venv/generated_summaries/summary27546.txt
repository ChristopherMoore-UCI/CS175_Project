The jump shot, which sees a player leap before unleashing the ball at speeds up to 125 kph (around 78 mph), is a spectacular climax to a long, drawn out tactical build-up and Fernandez is one of the game's greatest exponents, says German handball journalist, Bjorn Pazen. "The best memory in my career and for my sport was the Olympics Games in Beijing, because it was a title that changed the view of people in France about handball," Fernandez told CNN's Human to Hero series. " When a 20-year-old Fernandez arrived on the international scene in 1997, France was beginning to emerge as a major force in handball. Fernandez and France are currently on course to be crowned world champions for a fifth time at the World Championships currently taking place in Qatar -- Pazen says they are "big favorites" at the biennial tournament. During spells with sides in France (Montpelier and Toulouse), Spain (Barcelona and CF Ciudad Real) and Germany (THW Kiel), Fernandez has won numerous club titles, including the Champions League (twice), the sport's equivalent of football's premier European club competition.
