"Any team or employee that inquires about impermissible subjects or makes an employment decision based on such factors is subject to league discipline," said NFL spokesman Greg Aiello. NFL.com said that NFL teams "try to catch prospects off-guard when they interview them at the NFL Scouting Combine." Three years ago, however, the combine experienced controversy when Miami Dolphins General Manager Jeff Ireland asked Dez Bryant, now a Dallas Cowboys wide receiver, whether Bryant's mother was a prostitute. League policy states that teams "neither consider nor inquire about sexual orientation in the hiring process," Aiello said. The combine is a skills audition for NFL scouts and coaches before the draft, which this year will be held April 25 to 27.
