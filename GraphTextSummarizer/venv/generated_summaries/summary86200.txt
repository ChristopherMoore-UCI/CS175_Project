" Social power The power and reach of social media has played a major role in developing a civil society in China. And with the rise of social media in China, the country's civil society is more connected and better resourced than ever before -- bringing people in need together, including China's once isolated coal miners suffering from deadly lung diseases. "Social media is definitely a game changer to China," says Isaac Mao, a Chinese social media researcher and Internet freedom activist. Political tension James Miles, who has had more than 20 years of experience covering China, believes civil society may very well play a critical role in changing China's political landscape. So the workers of China have no choice but be their own force for change in the country, striking for better wages and launching civil action for just compensation.
