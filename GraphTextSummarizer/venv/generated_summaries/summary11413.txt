A UK-based tour operator has begun offering whistle-stop sightseeing excursions from London to Australia that depart Friday afternoon and return "just in time for work" on Tuesday morning. There's a night and morning in Melbourne, before a return flight that lands in London at 6:40 a.m. on Tuesday. The itinerary sees passengers depart London on Friday afternoon, arriving in Sydney on Saturday evening. If that's not enough, Austravel says passengers willing to forgo all sleep can buy "bolt-on" trips to see attractions such as the Great Ocean Road (more driving) or Melbourne's Yarra Valley wine region. You'll need the car because as well as the time spent cooped up in a jet, there's a 12-hour drive from Sydney to Melbourne to make the return flight.
