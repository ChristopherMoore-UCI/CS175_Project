Tobacco use is a major factor in four out of the five leading causes of death: heart disease, cancer, lung disease and stroke. Five things kill more people in the United States than anything else: heart disease, cancer, lung disease such as emphysema and chronic bronchitis, stroke and unintentional injuries such as those on roads or caused by medication overdoses. The Million Hearts initiative, launched by the Department of Health and Human Services in 2011, brings together communities, health systems, nonprofit organizations, federal agencies and private-sector partners to prevent heart attacks and strokes. Million Hearts will reduce these human and economic costs by improving care for high blood pressure and high cholesterol, helping patients quit smoking and increasing use of aspirin for those who will benefit from it. Whether it's by investing resources, using proven strategies or coordinating with health care systems, we have within our communities the strengths to help people live long and healthy lives.
