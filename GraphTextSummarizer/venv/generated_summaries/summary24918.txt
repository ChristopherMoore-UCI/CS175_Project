With the opening of her foundation's new center last year, 400 pregnant teens and young mothers now enroll every year. She said Escobar and the program gave her a new outlook on life. Escobar is hoping to change that through her teen mothers program, which aims to teach young women how to support themselves and their children. For the first year, young mothers come to the center every weekday, leaving their babies at the daycare while they attend classes. In the last 10 years, her Juan Felipe Gomez Escobar Foundation -- named for her late son -- has brought health care to tens of thousands of children in Cartagena and provided more than 2,000 teenage mothers with counseling, education and job training.
