Sherman, meanwhile, still struggles to talk about the Triple Crown near miss, and California Chrome himself has yet to record a victory since the disappointment at Belmont Park. " Lost among the excitement of looking ahead to the future for California Chrome, while also reflecting on this year's achievements, it can be easy to forget about the horse's humble beginnings and just how the story all started. But when you're running horses you're always going to have setbacks and you can't have a perfect trip," Sherman says. "Winning the award after all these setbacks would be even sweeter," California Chrome's trainer Art Sherman told CNN. Yet victory in the Hollywood Derby on Saturday could be enough to consign those darker memories to the past and fire the three-year-old chestnut colt to the prestigious Horse of the Year accolade at January's Eclipse Awards -- an annual ceremony recognizing the year's best thoroughbred horses.
