Every year for the past three years the Pacific Islands Forum has yielded further commitments to the management and protection of the natural resources the Pacific provides. After its close, I can see that the 2012 forum has provided the most ambitious international measures for ocean conservation the world has ever seen. The Pacific Oceanscape hosts the world's largest remaining stocks of tuna, providing approximately one third of the world's catch, and is also the region that is first to see the environmental impacts on the ocean. We have been fortunate to work closely with leaders and regional institutions to develop the Pacific Oceanscape initiative and are proud to have the global marine pioneer and innovator President Anote Tong of Kiribati as a Member of Conservation International's Board. At the Pacific Islands Forum in the Cook Islands, 16 countries that when combined make up a tiny fraction of the world's land, came together and made some of the largest ocean commitments in history towards the sustainable management of their oceans, which conversely make up an immense 10% of the world's ocean area.
