But while all the highest and most challenging peaks are in Western states, Slayden has a soft spot for many of the little ones in the Midwest and coastal states of the South. if that's your mindset, then getting a state high point is a worthy goal," said Greg Slayden, who runs Peakbagger.com, a mountaineering site. "There are a lot of states where the actual high point is less than a 10-minute walk from your car," Slayden said. Slayden, whose website keeps records of this stuff, estimates that fewer than 300 people have summited all 50 U.S. high points. But if you want to climb all 50 state high points, as Slayden has done, you need to bag the baby peaks along with the big ones.
