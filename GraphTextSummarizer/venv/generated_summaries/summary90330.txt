Brenda and her husband, Gary, got their two young daughters, Allison and Cecilia, dressed and ready to go. "I had a dentist appointment, and I asked Brenda to take Cecilia," Gary says. Then, in a departure from their regular routine, Brenda loaded 2-year-old Cecilia into her car to take her to the babysitter's house. " With Cecilia sleeping in the backseat, Brenda pulled out of the driveway at about 6 a.m. When she realized it was too early to drop her youngest child off, she decided to run a quick errand. " The day Cecilia died, Brenda was taken to a police station where she was questioned for more than two hours.
