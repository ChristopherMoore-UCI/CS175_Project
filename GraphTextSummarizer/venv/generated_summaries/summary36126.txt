However, moderate Republicans want to avoid another electoral drubbing by Hispanic voters as occurred last year, when Obama won a huge majority of the nation's largest minority demographic in defeating GOP nominee Mitt Romney. Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, a member of the bipartisan "Gang of Eight" that drafted the immigration plan, warned that any attempt by House Republicans to stall or block the issue would bring a strong public backlash. "If you look through history, we don't do big things very well in Washington, so I think it's better to break it apart, do smaller pieces, have a heavy debate about it," GOP Rep. Mike Kelly of Pennsylvania told ABC on Sunday. He won re-election last year by touting a first-term recovery from economic recession, as well as a major domestic achievement in health care reform and a major foreign policy triumph in taking out Osama bin Laden. Referring to the health care reform bill still despised by Republicans three years after becoming law, Kelly said "any time you rush anything through that big -- this was up to 1,100 pages -- I doubt that anybody's really read it and been able to really get through piece of it." House Speaker John Boehner said last week he would refuse to introduce an immigration bill unless it had support from a majority of Republicans.
