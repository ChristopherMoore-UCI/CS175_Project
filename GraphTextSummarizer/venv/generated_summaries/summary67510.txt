"This ruthless violence brought to the Afghan people at what should have been a time for celebration demonstrates the Taliban's sickening and indiscriminate tactics to try to intimidate the citizens of Afghanistan," said Lt. Gen. Nick Parker, Deputy Commander, International Security Assistance Force on Thursday. -- A bombing at a wedding ceremony in Afghanistan's Kandahar province was carried out by a suicide bomber wearing an explosives-laden vest, the interior ministry said Thursday. All the casualties were men or boys, village officials said. The International Security Assistance Force confirmed the bombing but did not provide a casualty count. The village is about 30 kilometers (19 miles) from the city of Kandahar.
