Hoy told police that his wife showed him an e-mail Guzman allegedly sent her on the morning of the killing, which included the words, "You will pay," the affidavit states. After speaking to Yun-Mi Hoy and Guzman, responding officers determined there "were ongoing family issues between them and it appeared to be resolved," court documents state. The teen's stepfather, Ryan Hoy, told authorities that Guzman and her mother had often fought in the past, but Guzman spit in her mother's face and became "more threatening and disrespectful towards her mother" in the days leading up to the killing, according to an arrest affidavit. Hoy also told police that when he went back upstairs, he saw Guzman standing in the bathroom doorway holding a knife. Guzman was arrested Thursday at a parking garage by Aurora police.
