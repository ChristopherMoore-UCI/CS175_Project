Britain's Andy Murray has turned to former great Ivan Lendl as he bids to win an elusive first grand slam title. But his first big target will be the Australian Open where Murray made his last grand slam final appearance, losing in straight sets to World No.1 Novak Djokovic earlier this year. " He is to take up his role immediately as Murray starts his new season with a first-round match against Kazakhstan's Mikhail Kukushkin at the Brisbane International Tuesday. In March, Murray dispensed with Spanish Davis Cup captain Alex Corretja as his coach and has worked without one until the appointment of Lendl. The 51-year-old Lendl is an eight-time grand slam winner and long-time World No.1, but has never worked as a full-time coach on the circuit.
