-- Carolina Panthers star quarterback Cam Newton has two fractures in his back after a two-vehicle wreck Tuesday, the NFL team said in a statement. There was no word on what caused the wreck in uptown Charlotte, a block from Bank of America Stadium, where the Panthers play, but witnesses told CNN affiliate WSOC they saw Newton's vehicle flip four times. This year, with both Newton and his team beset by injuries, he has put up less impressive numbers, and the Panthers are 4-8-1 going into this weekend's games. Newton was taken to a hospital after the truck he was traveling in crashed in Charlotte, North Carolina, said Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department spokesman Rob Tufano. "It's not the kind of injury that affects the spine or the nerves so it's a matter of when the pain settles down enough so he can play," said Mautner, who is not involved in Newton's case.
