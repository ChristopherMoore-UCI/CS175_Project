"There  is no evidence that gay teens are better off in Massachusetts, a state that has gay marriage, than they  are in Wisconsin, a state which has passed a marriage  amendment defining marriage as one man and one woman," she  said in an e-mail response to CNN. The research, Anderson said, indicates that marriage "does  confer the same sense of security, support, and validation" to same-sex couples  as to heterosexual ones. The resolution also points to evidence that ongoing  political debate about marriage creates stress for gay men and lesbians and  perpetuates stigmas and prejudice about their communities. "That's the  analysis that we've come to and why we've decided to support full marriage  equality -- because domestic partnership or civil union will still convey the  message that same-sex couples are not as good." "We knew that marriage benefits heterosexual people in  very significant ways, but we didn't know if that would be true for same-sex  couples," said Anderson, who is also director of the APA's Office on Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Concerns.
