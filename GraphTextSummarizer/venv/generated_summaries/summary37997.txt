" New York Times chief information officer Marc Frons sent the same update internally to employees at 4:20 p.m. and advised them not to send out sensitive emails "until this situation is resolved," according to a statement from the New York Times. The group, loyal to Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad, has been behind multiple attacks on media websites in recent months and, on Twitter, took credit for a sophisticated hack that had hobbled the Times' news site for roughly 20 hours. People on Twitter began reporting the New York Times site was down as early as 3 p.m. ET Tuesday. The New York Times website was still experiencing some issues late Wednesday and early Thursday following a widespread outage. A domain registrar should have extremely tight security because they are holding the security to hundreds if not thousands of Web sites," said Frons in the New York Times.
