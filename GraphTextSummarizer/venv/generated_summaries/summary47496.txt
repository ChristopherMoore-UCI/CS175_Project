Scott says larger hailstones fell around the tiny town of Vivian, South Dakota last week. He told CNN that he saw hailstones that were as large or larger than the one he actually kept. Hailstones punched through many roofs and ended up in attics and even bedrooms. Scott's hailstone actually broke two previous records. With the focus in Vivian firmly on cleaning up and repairing homes, Scott seems bemused by the new-found notoriety that has come along with breaking a U.S. record.
