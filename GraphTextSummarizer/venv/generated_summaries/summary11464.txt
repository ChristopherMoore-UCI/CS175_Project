It features pictures of the artist's young lover, Marie-Therese Walter, depictions of the Minotaur, the half-man-half-beast from classical myth who would become a regular feature in Picasso's works, and also a number of portraits of art collector Ambroise Vollard, for whom the collection is named. Businessman Hamish Parker -- a long-term fan of the London museum -- donated the entire Vollard Suite in memory of his father, Major Horace Parker, who died last year. The collection will be shown alongside examples of the classical sculpture, Rembrandt etchings and Goya prints which inspired Picasso in creating it.. The Vollard Suite -- one of the 20th century's most highly prized collections of etchings -- was created by Picasso between 1930 and 1937. A spokeswoman for the museum said Parker -- a friend of the prints and drawings room -- had learned of the museum's hopes of acquiring the suite of etchings at an event there last year.
