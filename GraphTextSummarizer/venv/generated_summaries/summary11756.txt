In an editorial for Britain's The Observer, Tutu singled out South African President Jacob Zuma and other politicians who took photos with a clearly confused and ill Mandela and called it an "affront to his dignity. Maki Mandela says she and most family members have not been to visit his grave recently but hope to do so soon. He suffered greatly in his final months, but Nelson Mandela's last breaths were peaceful, says his eldest daughter, Maki Mandela. Maki Mandela says she constantly questioned her father's team of state medical doctors about why his life was being prolonged. In keeping with traditions of his Xhosa tribe, Nelson Mandela was laid to rest on a reed mat on the floor of the grave, as if he had gone to sleep like his ancestors did in generations past.
