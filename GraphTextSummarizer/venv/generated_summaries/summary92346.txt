The highlight of Del Potro's career so far came at Flushing Meadows five years ago, when he beat Roger Federer in five sets to win his first grand slam title. -- Juan Martin del Potro is facing a lengthy spell on the sidelines after the world No. 8 announced he will undergo wrist surgery on Monday.
