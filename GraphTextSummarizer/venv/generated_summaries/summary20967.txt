And yet they are extremely happy." Calling themselves Awa, Tupi-Guarani for "man," the tribe is made of forest foragers and dexterous hunters. The Awa-Guaja's way of life is being threatened by relentless loggers who are illegally encroaching on their land, according to Brazil's National Indian Foundation. Rodrigues tries to explain: "Getting out of my comfort zone, my comfortable bed, to walk for hours through virgin forest, crossing rivers and rapids with water up to my neck ... hearing the triumphal songs of the hunters as they walked home a large prey to share with their brethren -- this experience can completely change a human being. Many Awa Indians have had little to no contact with the outside world, but that is beginning to change, the foundation reports, as loggers continue to destroy the forests their existence depends on. The Awa clearly trusted Rodrigues' camera, and in the resulting work we can clearly see how well-versed he became with the ins and outs of the Awa way of life.
