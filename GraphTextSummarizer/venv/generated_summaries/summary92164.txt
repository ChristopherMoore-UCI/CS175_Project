The five aboard identified themselves as Jaime Arturo Alaba Chavez, the 35-year-old captain; VÃ­ctor Hugo Alaba Chavez, the 32-year-old cook; Edison Prado Alaba, a 27-year-old sailor; Carlos Cheme Vazquez, a 37-year-old sailor; and Raul Contreras Vera, a 64-year-old machinist. Mexican authorities initiated the rescue, which occurred Tuesday, after the U.S. Coast Guard alerted them that sailors aboard a fishing boat located 45 nautical miles (83 km) southeast of Port Chiapas had signaled to a passing plane that they needed help. A naval patrol boat towed the boat to Puerto Chiapas, arriving there Wednesday morning. The Mexican navy said Wednesday that it rescued five Ecuadorians who had been adrift without supplies in a fishing boat for more than two weeks off the coast of the southern state of Chiapas. The sailors were taken to the Naval Sanatorium of Puerto Chiapas, where doctors determined they were dehydrated.
