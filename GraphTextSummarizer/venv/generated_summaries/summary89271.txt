But Pagasa, the Philippine national weather agency, still issued a "Yellow Rainfall Advisory" on Wednesday that forecast "moderate to heavy rains" for Metro Manila and nearby provinces. Heavy rain continued to lash the northern Philippines on Wednesday, a day after flooding put more than half of the Manila region under water. The pouring rain and rising water are grimly familiar to Manila residents as August is generally the area's wettest month. Widespread disruption Brought about by days of fierce rain, floods have disrupted air and land transportation, and caused the closure of schools, businesses and nonemergency government offices. The waters later subsided, leaving about 20% of Metro Manila under water, the U.N. office said.
