The third computer generated 3D film to be made in South Africa, "Zambezia" is  "probably the biggest budget animated film ever to come out of anywhere in Africa," says Thornley  -- Triggerfish was unable to disclose how much the film cost, but said its budget was under $20 million. "The film is a wonderful ambassador, in a way, of South Africa and I think as it travels the world it's going to spread the word about an industry that is young and vibrant and extremely talented," says "Zambezia" director and co-writer Wayne Thornley. Set in the majestic Victoria Falls and inspired by southern Africa's startling artwork, "Zambezia" is hoping to put South African animation on the map while enthralling children around the world with its uplifting message of togetherness. But also I want them to come away really surprised that something like that could come out of Africa and South Africa in particular."
