Now, coal baron Nathan Tinkler, 36, is facing a mountain of debt. Sitting on a promising asset, Tinkler sold it not once but twice -- first to Macarthur Coal for A$275 million plus a 10% stake in the company and a year later, in 2008, with world coal prices soaring, he sold his stake in Macarthur to global steel giant ArcelorMittal. Patinack Farm's cash flow problems were reported to be so severe, Tinkler was trying to stem the bleeding by downsizing operations in Victoria and South Australia and selling horses at bargain base prices to settle a state debt. And in August with coal prices flailing, Tinkler abandoned plans for a A$5.3 billion take over Whitehaven Coal, one of Australia's largest coal producers with exploration assets in Queensland. His A$1 million gamble turned into a multimillion dollar pile of cash with which he went on a buying spree -- football and rugby league clubs, horse studs, as well as property.
