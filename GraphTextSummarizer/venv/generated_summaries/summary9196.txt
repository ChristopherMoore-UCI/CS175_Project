Some of these articles also failed to say that this is a very early piece of scientific progress at best -- and may not even be progress. But over the past several decades, these gatherings have more and more become venues for drug companies and medical device manufacturers to tell physicians about their drugs and medical hardware. The veterans have been replaced by mostly young, inexperienced writers who suddenly find themselves under pressure to turn out compelling stories about difficult scientific medical studies that are all too easy to oversimplify and misinterpret. They offer opportunities for physicians to learn about new studies and possible new treatments, and for those interested in medicine, the meetings are fascinating and enjoyable. I was motivated to write this after reading articles in reputable newspapers in the United States and Europe that a cure for breast cancer was on the horizon and a blood test was coming to market that could detect lung cancer early and save lives.
