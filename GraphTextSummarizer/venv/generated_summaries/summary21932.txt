My personal favorite at Magic Carpet is a pita sandwich stuffed with grape leaves. The fountain offers sundaes, splits, ice cream waffle sandwiches, fresh pies, house-made cakes, phosphates and America's oldest soft drink, just to name a few. -- I wore a path between Washington and Philly for interviews and shoots for our recent "Cheating Death" special with Dr. Sanjay Gupta. Magic Carpet Hours: 10:30 a.m.-3 p.m. Cuisine: Mediterranean/vegetarian If you ask Holly Auer, University of Pennsylvania Hospital's senior medical communications officer, she'll immediately say, "Magic Carpet."
