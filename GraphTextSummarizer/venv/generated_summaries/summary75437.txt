The Dutch international, who is currently on loan at fellow La Liga club Hercules, has declared he will go on a post-Christmas, one-man strike until he receives what he claims are unpaid wages. The Spanish Players' Association (AFE) had applied to postpone the next round of Spanish league games, including Barcelona's La Liga match against Levante on Sunday, by 24 hours. I've received 50% of my monthly wages on two occasions and didn't get paid at all in the other four months," he told Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf. "I have a mortgage and several other bills that need to be paid and I can't accept that Hercules are not paying me." But the Spanish High Court decided it had no jurisdiction over the dispute, declaring that it "it is not competent to decide on the precautionary measure of suspending the League for Sunday January 2," AFP reports.
