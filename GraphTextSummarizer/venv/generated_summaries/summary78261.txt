At the very least, they say, we should stop glorifying God, now that he (or she) has been demoted far below the exalted status one finds in the Bible and the rest of world scriptures. But no one ever claimed that God or higher intelligence or the creative principle in the universe was tangible, like a rock or a tree. What, he asked, if believing in God actually makes new evidence appear? God is subtler than gravity but just as evident, and just as dependent on knowing what to look for. The same evidence fuels the arguments of atheists, who claim that if God is just a chemical reaction, it's time we quit believing in a deity.
