This is considered one of the main roads in North Korea, but the damage caused could take months to fix, according to a military official accompanying us. The town of Hyangsan is filled with bunting and posters for the celebration of the 60th anniversary of the Korean War, a day North Korea calls "Victory Day." Women crouch by the side of the road clearing the grass of weeds; others sweep the streets with a tree branch. While driving to Hyangsan, an area the regime wants to see tourists flock to, we're stopped at a number of military checkpoints. Each time, we are told we cannot go on as the roads are flooded, but each time, our minders talk us through until it becomes clear there has been significant damage. A number of official-looking men dressed in brown Mao suits stand silently on street corners.
