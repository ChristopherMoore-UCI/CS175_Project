They were beloved by all who knew them, and they all made us better people, better friends, better brothers and sisters to our siblings, better children to our parents, better citizens and better Muslims. My prayers and those of my family and friends are for their souls' everlasting peace and rest, for patience and strength to their families and loved ones to endure this tragedy, and for the God consciousness we all need to carry on after such devastating loss. These three young Muslim Americans were active in their neighborhoods and communities, worked with local and international charities and relief efforts, supported their brothers and sisters in the Triangle community in their educational and professional pursuits, promoted love, tolerance and togetherness. I cannot imagine the sweltering hatred and utter disregard for human life that must have plagued the killer's heart and soul, but all must know and honor the kinds of people Deah, Yusor and Razan were to understand how terribly they will be missed. Our Islam -- Deah, Yusor and Razan's Islam -- is the Islam of grassroots organizing, giving and promoting charity work, treating everyone with only the best manners and a smile, always a smile.
