"It looks just like Afghanistan," Ujaama wrote to the prominent preacher, asking for trainers in both the physical and spiritual aspects of holy war to be sent from London so fighters could be readied for the Afghanistan front lines. He scoffed at the thought he'd use Ujaama -- a "troublemaker" and known liar who had never set foot in Afghanistan -- for such an errand, when any of the several dozen Afghani veterans in the mosque would have provided more reliable options. He conceded he gave Ujaama money to transport but said it was charity for a secret girls' school and widows of mujahedeen fighters, not the Taliban regime or al Qaeda -- something Ujaama's testimony corroborated. He's accused of aiding kidnappers during a 1998 hostage-taking in Yemen; facilitating violent jihad in Afghanistan; supplying goods and services to the Taliban; and attempting to establish an al Qaeda-style training camp on the West Coast of the United States. Prosecutors also allege that al-Masri sent Ujaama to Afghanistan in 1999 to deliver envelopes of cash and a young recruit for the front lines.
