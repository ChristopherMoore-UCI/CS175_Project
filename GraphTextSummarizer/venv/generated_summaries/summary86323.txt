"The diffusion image is a map of the water diffusion which we then convert into a marker for the fiber pathways," says Van Wedeen, director of Connectomics at the Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). In his new book, "Connectome: How the Brain's Wiring Makes Us Who We Are," Seung argues that our identities are stored in the connections between individual brain cells. " Poorly understood diseases like autism, he says, could be the result of an abnormality of brain connections called "connectopathies. The creation of a map, or "connectome" as it has been dubbed, is raising hopes that brain disorders like autism and schizophrenia will be better understood in the future, perhaps cured. "Over time, it's clear that in addition to scanning normal volunteers we'd be very interested in scanning patients with disease," says Rosen, director of the Martinos Center for Biological Imaging at MGH.
