" England were particularly vociferous in their criticism of FIFA and claimed several committee members promised them votes that didn't materialize. Franz Beckenbauer, a member of FIFA's executive committee, criticized football's governing body after the amount of votes each bidder received was made public. It led to an angry reaction from representatives of the England and Australia bid teams and Beckenbauer acknowledges his faith in FIFA has been shaken as a result. The seven losing countries were treated disgracefully, particularly England and Australia, Beckenbauer told German newspaper Bild. -- The man who led Germany to a World Cup win both as a player and a coach admits he has lost faith in FIFA due to the way the voting process for the 2018 and 2022 tournaments was handled.
