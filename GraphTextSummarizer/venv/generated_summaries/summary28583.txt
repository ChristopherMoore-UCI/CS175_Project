" The theme he emphasized Friday was the problem of Afghan civilian casualties caused by American airstrikes. The president pointed out that Afghan courts had recently convicted 600 people on corruption charges or on counts of major drug dealing. " In response to recent suggestions by U.S. military officials that the civilian deaths in Farah province might have been staged by the Taliban, Karzai said that an Afghan government team was investigating the incident and that "there was no doubt that the casualties were caused by bombings... and the use of air power." Afghan officials say that more than 100 civilians were killed in a U.S. airstrike Wednesday in Farah province, on the western border with Iran. If that death toll is confirmed, it will be the single deadliest incident involving Afghan civilians since the American-led invasion of the country in 2001 to oust the Taliban from power.
