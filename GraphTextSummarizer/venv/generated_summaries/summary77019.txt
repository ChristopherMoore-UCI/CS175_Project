The Web gave us a place to indulge our shared obsession without (audible) derision: We posted online photos from every dog walk, and when Sisko's ear was torn by a pit bull, we created an online monument to "Siskogh," illustrated with photos we manipulated to look like the famous Van Gogh self-portrait. Our obsession with Sisko was the subject of great amusement and mockery among our friends, not least because we trained him with "Star Trek"-themed commands. The high point of the evening is always when I wander over to his elbow and intrude on his conversation -- seeing the way he connects with, listens to and amuses other people gives me fresh eyes on the qualities I love about him and makes me happier and prouder than ever.
