A peer reviewed report, called "Beyond dangerous climate change: emission scenarios for a new world," written by Kevin Anderson and Alice Bows in 2011, pointed out that there is a widespread understanding among scientists that an increase of four degrees Celsius in global temperatures is incompatible with an organized global community. The Middle East has been through a lot of change lately, but the region is often eerily quiet on climate change, not to mention that some countries of the region have been considered "obstructionist" in the process. Agreeing to this peak will also mean that countries which have been big polluters historically, like the U.S., Canada, Europe, Japan and Australia, will have to increase their commitments on carbon emission reductions. Putting forward pledges to the international community is one step that countries of the region can take in the right direction, but also regional civil society should start a strong Arab climate movement. As such, the talks provide the perfect opportunity for the countries in the region to prove that they have started to take climate change seriously.
