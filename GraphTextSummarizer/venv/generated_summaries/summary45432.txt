The university, quoting a U.S. vice consul in Auckland, identified the victims as Daniela Lekhno from Manalapan, New Jersey; Roch Jauberty, who lived in Paris; and Austin Brashears of Huntington Beach, California. "This is a horrible tragedy," Boston University President Robert A. Brown said in a statement. -- Boston University mourned three study-abroad students killed in New Zealand while visiting locations where "The Lord of the Rings" movies were filmed. Five other students were injured in the crash, including one in critical condition after being flown by helicopter to get medical treatment. The U.S. Consulate in Auckland did not immediately respond to a message left early Sunday.
