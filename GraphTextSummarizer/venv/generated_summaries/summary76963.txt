The incident was shown live on television as officers arrested suspect Jamie Donnell Hood in Athens, Georgia. Hood was wanted in connection with Tuesday's slaying of Senior Police Officer Elmer "Buddy" Christian, 34, and the wounding of Senior Police Officer Tony Howard, 43. Hood was being held without bond Saturday in the Hall County Detention Center, Captain Eric Pozen of the Clarke County Sheriff's Office said. When Howard stopped the SUV, the man believed to be Hood got out and began shooting, police said. The shooting spurred a huge manhunt that climaxed when authorities learned that Hood was holed up in an apartment in Athens.
