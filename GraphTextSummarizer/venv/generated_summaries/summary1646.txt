"The knee-jerk reaction to terminate Mr. Stem was not about whether Ms. Golden chose to create and perpetuate a life-threatening situation. Hearne City Attorney Bryan Russ Jr. said Stem told Golden to drop her weapon at least three times. "None of those factors played a role in Stem's decision to use deadly force," Robert McCabe, Stem's attorney, said in a statement Sunday. A man believed to be a relative of Golden's made a 911 call asking for help from police, Robertson County District Attorney Coty Siegert said. Stem fired three times, and Golden was hit at least twice, he said.
