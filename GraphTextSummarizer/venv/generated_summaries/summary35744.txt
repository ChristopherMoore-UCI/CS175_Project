Jeff Ruby's Waterfront Restaurant -- which has sweeping views of downtown Cincinnati -- separated from the shoreline and floated downriver, striking the Clay Wade Bailey Bridge, which carries U.S. Routes 42 and 127, and spinning around in the process. A floating restaurant along the banks of the Ohio River in Covington, Kentucky, broke free from its moorings Thursday and drifted several hundred yards downriver, according to Assistant Fire Chief Chris Black. The restaurant is currently being held in place by two tug boats and a barge, according to Ruby, preventing it from ramming into the aging Brent Spence Bridge. Ruby told CNN that one of his employees was walking the 110-foot ramp that connects the floating restaurant to the dock when "he heard cable popping and snapping." "The part that was facing Kentucky is now facing Cincinnati" said the restaurant's owner, Jeff Ruby.
