Detective Inspector Sharon Marman told the coroner that police had discovered the drugs when they searched Rausing's car after stopping him on suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, the UK's Press Association news agency reported. -- Hans Kristian Rausing, the son of one of the world's wealthiest men, was arrested on suspicion of murder after the body of his American-born wife was found in their home this week, police confirmed Friday. The 49-year-old was initially arrested Monday on drug charges and then was held "in connection with the death" of Eva Rausing, police said Tuesday. He is the son of Hans Rausing, who is worth an estimated $10 billion, thanks to the family's connection to Swedish packaging giant Tetra Laval. Authorities are awaiting the results of further post-mortem tests, which are not expected for several more days, police said.
