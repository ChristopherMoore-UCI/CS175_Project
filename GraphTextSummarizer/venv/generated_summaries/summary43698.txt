When you combine these factors -- money, recruits, nonconference schedule, years of success -- it's tough to call a team like Gonzaga a mid-major, even if they do hail from the West Coast Conference, Litos said. Consider also that Gonzaga's basketball expenses have risen from $1.9 million in 2005 to $6.1 million last year, according to the U.S. Department of Education, which means better facilities and players. Pomeroy's statistics indicate there are three clear favorites in this year's tournament, and the trio doesn't include No. 1 seeds Gonzaga or Kansas. "We're just happy to be from Spokane." Since the 1999 run to the Elite Eight, Gonzaga "has been central to our identity as a city," he said, and it's been common in years past for people to have high hopes, idealistically jotting down Gonzaga as a Final Four team in their brackets. The Zags come in at No. 4 in Pomeroy's rankings, but he is quick to say his "ratings represent a team's average performance, and teams rarely put in an average performance."
