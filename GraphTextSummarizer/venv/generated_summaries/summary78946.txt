McDonald said that while many designers derived inspiration from the heritage of African textile traditions, no prevailing theme united the collections. She said she relished the chance for her "ethical fashion" label, which she describes as a Nigerian-Italian brand, to share a platform with accomplished designers such as South Africa's Kluk CGDT -- jointly named alongside Nigeria's Maki Oh as "designer of the year" at the event. But fashion creates a vehicle to showcase Africa in a different way." "It's raised the bar," said McDonald, international managing director for Arise, a title which describes itself as Africa's global style and culture magazine. We feel it's Africa's capital," said McDonald.
