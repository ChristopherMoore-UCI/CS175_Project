He added that the railroad has been slow to implement what is known as positive train control technology, which combines GPS, wireless radio and computers to monitor trains and stop them from colliding or derailing. The train engineer, William Rockefeller Jr., apparently "was nodding off and caught himself too late" before the accident, a union representative told CNN. National Transportation Safety Board member Earl Weener said Tuesday it's possible that positive train control could have prevented a derailment involving a high-speed train, like the one involved in the Metro-North accident. MTA spokesman Salvatore Arena said the agency began work to install positive train control technology on the Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North Railroad in 2009, budgeting nearly $600 million for its installation, including $428 million last month for a system integrator. His cabin was equipped with a "dead man pedal" that required constant downward pressure with the foot to keep the train moving, MTA spokesman Aaron Donovan told CNN on Thursday.
