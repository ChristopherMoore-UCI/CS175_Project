"If these cruel and tragic events can only awaken that city and state -- if they can only awaken this entire nation to a realization of the folly of racial injustice and hatred and violence -- then it is not too late for all concerned to unite in steps toward peaceful progress before more lives are lost," he said. -- President Barack Obama on Friday awarded posthumous Congressional Gold Medals to four African-American girls killed in a Birmingham, Alabama, church bombing that became a key and tragic moment of the civil rights movement. "To the families who are here today, those who lost daughters and sisters, we just want to express incredible thanks not only for the strength you showed in suffering but also in your persistence," Obama said. President John F. Kennedy hoped in the aftermath of the bombing that it would spur action against racial hatred. Addie Mae Collins, Carole Robertson and Cynthia Wesley, all 14, and Denise McNair, 11, were killed during Sunday services on September 15, 1963, at the 16th Street Baptist Church.
