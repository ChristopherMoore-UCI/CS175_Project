Italy is a major gateway into Europe for migrants who come by sea from North Africa in hope of reaching EU soil. The Italian navy said it rescued more than 1,000 migrants from several overcrowded boats in the Mediterranean between Tuesday and Wednesday morning. According to the European border agency Frontex, more than 12,000 illegal migrants were detected off Sicily and 8,000 off Lampedusa in the third quarter of last year. On Tuesday, three other navy ships disembarked 1,049 more migrants rescued since Monday in the ports of Augusta and Pozzallo, also in Sicily, the navy said. They are now being taken by ship to the port of Augusta, on Italy's Mediterranean island of Sicily.
