At 5:15 Thursday evening, White House advance staffer Mike Ruemmler called to say the Clubbs had been chosen. Jeff says he was told the White House wanted to hold the event in Beaverdale, a sprawling suburb of Des Moines, because of its beautiful big oak trees, which Obama admired during the event. The White House often looks for people who have a good life story and have benefited from the administration's policies. Sandy Clubb said 45 minutes later, about a dozen local and White House officials arrived at their home, including the Secret Service, to brief their family and scout out the backyard. She said a week ago, they had been informed that they were being considered as "one of eight families the White House was looking at to possibly host the president's visit to Des Moines."
