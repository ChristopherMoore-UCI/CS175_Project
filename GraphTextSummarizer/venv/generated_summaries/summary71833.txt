After waiting for hours in rough conditions, one Greek man told Italian state broadcaster RAI TV that passengers were "dying of cold and suffocating from the smoke," and that their feet were burning from the heat of the flames. Conditions for the rescue of passengers off a ferry that caught fire in the Adriatic Sea could hardly have been worse. 'Prisoners on a burning ship' Dramatic cell phone images filmed by a passenger showed flames through shattered portholes, while a wider view released by rescuers showed a huge plume of thick, black smoke streaming from the stricken vessel. Authorities are waiting for authorization from Albanian officials to release the ship, because it is in Albanian waters. Helicopters with night vision equipment worked through the night to pull passengers off the ferry, one by one.
