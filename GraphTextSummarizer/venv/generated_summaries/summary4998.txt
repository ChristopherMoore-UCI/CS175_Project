The majority of food companies are not responsive in providing information about their specific uses, plans and policies toward nanoparticles. There are not nearly enough studies that can adequately demonstrate the safety of nanoparticles in food additives or packaging. More companies and consumers need to be aware of the use of engineered nanomaterials in foods and the potential unknown risks of this technology. Nanoparticles have been heralded as having the potential to revolutionize the food industry -- from enabling the production of creamy liquids that contain no fat, to enhancing flavors, improving supplement delivery, providing brighter colors, keeping food fresh longer, or indicating when it spoils. In contrast, companies in the European Union are required to label foods containing nanoparticles.
