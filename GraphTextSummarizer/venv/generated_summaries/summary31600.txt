Downey recently presented a robotic arm to young Alex Pring, a Central Florida boy who is missing his right arm from just above his elbow. The arm was made by Limbitless Solutions, a volunteer group started by Albert Manero, a University of Central Florida engineering PhD student, to make free bionic arms for kids. Manero met Alex through E-Nable, a volunteer network that matches people who have 3-D printers with children who need limbs. " After giving him the new arm, Downey invited Alex to hang out with him in Atlanta this summer when he's filming the new Captain America movie. Through 3-D printing technology, Alex and others have had the chance to get a robotic arm so they can use their limbs again.
