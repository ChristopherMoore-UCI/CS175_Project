The Academy Award-winning director recently completed "Neil Young Journeys," his third feature-length documentary on the iconic folk-rocker, which mingles footage of Young alone onstage at Toronto's Massey hall with moving scenes of him driving through his childhood home of Omeeme, Ontario. Demme is the acclaimed director of a long list of dramatic films, including 1991's horrific "Silence of the Lambs" and 2008's "Rachel Getting Married" -- but music is never far from his mind. He collaborated with David Byrne on the classic Talking Heads concert film, "Stop Making Sense," in 1984, and music is a crucial part of his dramatic movies, including 1993's "Philadelphia," which features deeply emotional original songs from Young and Bruce Springsteen. Demme, who just finished shooting an adaptation of Henrick Ibsen's "The Master Builder" with Wallace Shawn and Andre Gregory ("My Dinner With Andre"), spoke to Rolling Stone about his love of music, Young's film director alter-ego Bernard Shakey and his long journey through the past with Young.
