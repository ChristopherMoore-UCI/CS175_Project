Before suicide, raped Montana teen loved outdoors, poetry Activists file formal judicial complaint On Tuesday, the Montana and Pennsylvania chapters of the National Organization for Women and an activist group called Ultraviolet filed a complaint with a judicial review board, CNN affiliate KULR reported. "If we can't get him removed from this, there is something wrong with the system, and I know people in the state will work to not get (Baugh) re-elected (next year)," said Marian Bradley, president of Montana NOW. The case drew widespread attention when Baugh imposed a one-month sentence on Rambold and made controversial comments about the victim, saying she "seemed older than her chronological age" and she was "as much in control of the situation." "(Judge G. Todd Baugh) made a mistake and I'm disappointed, (31) days, that's outrageous, but the Montana Supreme Court stepped in.
