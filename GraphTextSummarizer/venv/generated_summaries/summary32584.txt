While President George W. Bush sought congressional approval for wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, presidents have often failed to ask Congress for support for smaller incursions. Presidents moved away from asking Congress' permission in the 1950s, starting with the Korean War, when President Harry Truman declined to seek congressional authorization. Obama looks to Congress to bolster legal case for Syria strike "Going to war under these circumstances (without congressional or Security Council support) would have put him out on a limb politically and legally," Hathaway said. The law says the president must "consult" with Congress before U.S. forces are committed in an overseas conflict or within 60 days of U.S. involvement. Some say the concession to Congress sets a new precedent that bodes well for future Congresses and not so well for future presidents.
