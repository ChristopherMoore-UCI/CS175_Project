-- Plans to build a mosque two blocks away from ground zero have set off an emotional debate among area residents and relatives of victims of the September 11, 2001 terror attacks. Daisy Khan, executive director of the Muslim society, described her vision of a center led by Muslims, but serving the community as a whole. " However, Khan emphasized that the attacks killed Muslims, too. Cordoba House project calls for a 15-story community center including a mosque, performance art center, gym, swimming pool and other public spaces. The need for the center is twofold, Khan said, because it will support the needs of the growing Muslim community.
