"LG Twins players are very handsome," says Choi. Seo Yeon-mi, wearing a LG Twins jersey and hat, has been coming to games for 15 years. And the number of the female fans is going to be increasing more and more," says Nick Choi, a spokesman for the Seoul-based LG Twins. "If you attract women to the stadium, you attract men as well," laughs Choi. She plans on returning to the ballpark soon but this next time with a LG Twins Jersey.
