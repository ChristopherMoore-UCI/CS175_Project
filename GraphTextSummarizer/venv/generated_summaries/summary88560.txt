More recently, Jeff Bezos and company have rolled out the Fulfillment by Amazon program globally, enabling entrepreneurs like Thompson to move goods through fulfillment centers in other parts of the world. As they do domestically, sellers can export their goods in bulk to Amazon warehouses in those hubs. Taylor says sellers from 89 countries use Fulfillment by Amazon to sell goods to U.S. customers. "The small seller suddenly has access to the global marketplace," says Tom Taylor, Amazon's vice president of seller services. But the real power of the system doesn't come into play until merchants also opt to use Amazon to fulfill and ship its orders, as Thompson does.
