"The mere fact that some of the Russian soldiers have moved back from the border and that Russia is now destabilizing Ukraine through surrogates, rather than overtly and explicitly, does not mean that we can afford three months, or four months, or six months, of continued violence and conflict in eastern Ukraine." -- U.S. President Barack Obama had stern words for his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin over Russia's actions in Ukraine, following a meeting Thursday of G7 leaders in Brussels, Belgium, at which Russia was excluded. " "Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea, and actions to de-stabilize eastern Ukraine are unacceptable and must stop," the statement said. Putin was excluded from what was originally planned as a G8 summit in Sochi, Russia, as part of measures to sanction Moscow over its annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region. Putin: No Russian intervention in Ukraine Questioned in the same TF1 interview about Russia's intentions in Ukraine, Putin denied it had sought to annex or destabilize its neighbor.
