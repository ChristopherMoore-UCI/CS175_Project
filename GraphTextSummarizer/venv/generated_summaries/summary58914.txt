Watching Kennedy and his team play one of the highest stakes poker games that the world had witnessed was at once exhilarating and frightening. -- I vividly recall those 13 days in the fall of 1962, watching President John F. Kennedy on our black and white television in Cambridge, Massachusetts. This was a very different Kennedy from the uncertain president who failed miserably in the Bay of Pigs invasion. Much like Thomas Jefferson, Kennedy believed in the value of great ideas and people, surrounding himself with the smartest people in any room. I met John Kennedy in 1959 in Hyannis Port during the early stages of his presidential campaign, and would later serve on a Federal Aviation Administration task force that he created.
