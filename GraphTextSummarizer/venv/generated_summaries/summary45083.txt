Things almost got worse for Murray on the opening day of the U.S. Open, as he suffered from cramps throughout his body before seeing off Dutchman Robin Haase 6-3 7-6 1-6 7-5 on Monday. "Murray was presented to Haase on a silver platter in that fourth set but Robin didn't like it." Murray, known for his endurance, said he began to cramp after an hour and 45 minutes. Bachinger upset Stepanek in straight sets. Despite Murray being in distress, Haase couldn't serve out the fourth set and also squandered a break chance in the final game when he netted a fairly routine forehand volley. "It was hot but it wasn't particularly humid and we didn't play loads of long rallies in the first couple of sets, either."
