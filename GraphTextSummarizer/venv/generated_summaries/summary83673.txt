In a separate concession, Jammeh agreed to halt indefinitely dozens of executions he had originally planned to carry out by mid September, according to Jackson's non-profit Rainbow Push Coalition. -- Two American citizens serving long prison sentences for treason in Gambia will return to the United States Tuesday night after the Rev. Jesse Jackson made a face-to-face appeal for their release to President Yahya Jammeh. One of them, Amadou Scattred Janneh, was serving a life sentence for printing and distributing T-shirts critical of Jammeh, according to Amnesty International. Jammeh took power in a military coup in 1994, and was elected president two years later. Gambia's human rights record has drawn steady criticism since Jammeh's election, but the president has won supporters by building new hospitals, schools and other infrastructure.
