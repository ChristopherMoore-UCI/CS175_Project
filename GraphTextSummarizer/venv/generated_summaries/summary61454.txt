Aboriginal place names were particularly sensitive, however, especially if they marked known massacre sites. "We don't want to stop Australia's tradition of weird and wonderful place names," Geographical Names Board deputy chairman Paul Harcombe told CNN. Towns like Come By Chance, Home Rule and Wattanobi are perfectly normal within the Australian context -- and locals use them without thinking -- but the country's Geographical Names Board has proposed tightening the regulations on naming places. The regulations are not likely to please punctuation pedants, however, with the board saying it would eliminate apostrophes -- they've already been eliminated from places including Howes Valley -- and retain names that have been corrupted by long-established usage. -- From Cape Desolation and Bong Bong to Lake Disappointment and Woolloomooloo, Australia is no stranger to bleak, odd or evocative place names.
