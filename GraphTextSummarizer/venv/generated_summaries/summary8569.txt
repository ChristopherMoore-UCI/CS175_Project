Notre Dame will hold a special Mass Thursday evening in memory of Declan Sullivan, 20, who died Wednesday afternoon when the scaffolding toppled in strong winds. "We need to make sure we understood all the dynamics that played throughout the day," said athletics director Jack Swarbrick, adding he expects the South Bend, Indiana, school to learn some lessons that might prevent a recurrence. -- The investigation into the death of a college student who fell from a camera tower during a University of Notre Dame football practice will look at wind conditions and protocols, officials said. He plans to preside over the Mass, which is scheduled to begin at 10 p.m. The university said it has made pastoral care and grief counseling available to students. A sudden gust of wind sent up equipment and other material just before he heard the crash, Swarbrick said.
