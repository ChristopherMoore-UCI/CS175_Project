However, many supporters believe that the banning of standing up at football grounds has resulted in the atmosphere becoming diluted -- prompting the  180,000-member Football Supporters' Federation (FSF) to launch an online petition calling for the return of standing areas in the top division. The FSF has cited the German Bundesliga, where terraces are widespread, resulting in packed stadia and cheaper tickets, as a good example of how standing can be safer at matches. Speaking to the official English Premier League website, EPL spokesman Dan Johnson said: "Our view is that the benefits of all-seater stadia far outweigh the return of standing areas. Standing is also still very much evident in Argentina and Brazil, where the most fervent supporters adorn their own respective terraces in club colours, making for a noisy, passionate, and at times, intimidating atmosphere. Following the 1989 Hillsborough disaster, when 96 Liverpool fans were crushed to death on terracing, it was made law in England for all top-flight stadiums to be made all-seater -- although terraces are still common place in the lower divisions.
