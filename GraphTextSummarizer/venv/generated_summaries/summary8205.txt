The actual rules of the game, however, concede that certain assaults and certain violations of free speech rights may proceed with impunity. Vilks opened his talk with a provocative short video that included an image of two nearly naked Iranian gay men wearing masks of Muhammad. The same day, U.S. law enforcement announced the indictment of an American woman who had attempted to recruit assassins to kill Vilks. Vilks produced three pencil sketches of street dogs with human faces, the face (Vilks said) of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad. Impunity invites further attack.
