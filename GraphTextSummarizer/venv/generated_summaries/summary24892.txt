Cycling immortality Despite his hardships, Millar can take comfort in the fact his struggles paved the way for Wiggins to earn cycling immortality. Doping problems Doping has cast a long shadow over cycling throughout the history of the sport, with Andy's brother Frank Schleck failing an in-Tour test earlier this week, but the ever forthright Millar denied it was an excuse for British riders past failings. For British road cycling, the breakthrough moment came in 2009 when Team Sky was founded, the country's only professional cycling outfit. Spearheaded by Dave Brailsford, a driving force behind Team GB's eight gold medals in China, Team Sky has produced Britain's first Tour de France winner in only its third attempt at the race. When Millar first turned professional with the French team Peugeot in 1980, it was during an era when aspiring British riders had to brave the European amateur scene to achieve their dream.
