No known threat to the United States Earlier Wednesday, a different law enforcement source emphasized  there was no known threat to the United States, but the notice to U.S. and international air carriers is based on new intelligence information. He noted a "ring of steel right around the Olympics itself" but said "there's a real cause for concern" about getting to Sochi and surrounding areas. "We are getting some information about what's happening outside of Russia, some external threats, that type thing, or potential threats. However, U.S. officials also are worried that al Qaeda-linked groups from elsewhere could take advantage of the attention being focused on Russian militant groups. "There are a number of specific threats of varying degrees of credibility that we're tracking," he said.
