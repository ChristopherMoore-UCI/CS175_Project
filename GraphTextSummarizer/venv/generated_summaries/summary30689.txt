A judge in the murder trial of former NFL star Aaron Hernandez handed his defense pretrial legal victories Friday, throwing out as evidence text messages sent by the homicide victim the night he died and ruling that prosecutors may not tell jurors about two other slayings allegedly committed by the former New England Patriot. Authorities have said that Hernandez and two other men picked Lloyd up from his Boston apartment in a rental car shortly before he was found shot to death in a North Attleborough, Massachusetts, industrial park. In May, Hernandez was charged in the shooting deaths of Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado, who prosecutors say were ambushed and executed as they drove home in Boston's South End on July 16, 2012. Superior Court Judge Susan Garsh ruled that prosecutors may not introduce the texts that murder victim Odin Lloyd sent his sister shortly before his death. In another defense victory, Garsh ruled that prosecutors may not tell jurors about a separate homicide case involving Hernandez: the July 2012 killings of two men in Boston.
