What is being called the nation's toughest anti-abortion measure -- a law that bans most abortions after six weeks, when a fetal heartbeat can be first detected -- was signed into law on Tuesday by North Dakota's governor. North Dakota's fetal heartbeat law was one of three laws targeting abortion that Dalrymple signed on Tuesday. -- A requirement that doctors who perform abortions have privileges at a North Dakota-area hospital. The law sets the stage for an almost guaranteed legal showdown, with proponents saying the law is intended to test the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that made abortion legal. Statutory time limits on when abortions can take place, however, vary from state to state.
