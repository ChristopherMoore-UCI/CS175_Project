-- Italian manager Gianfranco Zola has been sacked by English Premier League club West Ham, while former England boss Steve McLaren has joined German side Wolfsburg. Media reports in Italy claim current coach Leonardo will leave the club in the summer but according to the UK Press Association, Van Basten told Italian television that a serious ankle injury would rule him out of contention. A statement on Wolfsburg's official Web site said: "Steve McClaren is to take over as new trainer at VfL Wolfsburg. Meanwhile, ex-England coach Steve McLaren has been confirmed as Wolfsburg's new coach. McLaren led Dutch side FC Twente to their first ever league title last season and will become the first English coach to take charge of a German side.
