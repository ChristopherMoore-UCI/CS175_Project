The semifinal in Punjab province was Pakistan's first match in India since the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks which further strained relations between the two sub-continent nations. " Pakistan prime minister in India for cricket diplomacy Tendulkar, who scored 98 when India beat Pakistan in the group stages of the 2003 tournament, survived a strong appeal for leg before wicket and was dropped four times before becoming the fifth man to fall with the total at 187. But India took vital wickets at regular intervals, as 1992 champions Pakistan were bowled out for 231 off the penultimate delivery with Misbah-ul-Haq top-scoring on 56. When cricket means more than just a match Veteran batsman Sachin Tendulkar top-scored with a fortuitous 85 as India posted a total of 260-9 in their allotted overs, while Wahab Riaz claimed five wickets for Pakistan to give his team a reasonable total to chase. The 37-year-old, the world's highest run-scorer in both limited-overs and Test formats, hit 11 fours from 115 balls faced until he was finally caught by Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi to be the first of two wickets for Saeed Ajmal.
