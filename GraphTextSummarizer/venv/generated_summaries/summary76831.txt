According to research by Andrew Sum at Northeastern University, wages and salaries accounted for just 1 percent of economic growth in the first 18 months after the recession ended, while corporate profits accounted for an unprecedented 88 percent of economic growth. And while the bastion of low-paid workers is growing, their wages are declining: workers in lower-wage occupations (with median wages under $13.52) have seen a 2.3 percent decline in real wages since the recession began. While wages and salaries are now the lowest share of GDP since 1955, corporate profits are the largest share of GDP since 1950. As the economy has sputtered, wages have stagnated, and even folks with jobs are having trouble meeting their families' basic needs. A new analysis by the National Employment Law Project finds that while the majority of jobs lost during and after the recession were in mid-wage occupations, roughly three-quarters of jobs added since job growth resumed are low-wage.
