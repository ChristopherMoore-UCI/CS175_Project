On Sunday, State Department officials also called out Italy, Poland, Denmark, Albania and Croatia for providing equipment and ammunition in the fight against ISIS. The United States has conducted more than 150 airstrikes in Iraq against ISIS, and Secretary of State John Kerry has said nearly 40 nations have agreed to contribute to the fight against the militants. Egypt: Kerry said Saturday that Egypt has a critical role to play in countering ISIS ideology. On September 17, in a speech to service members at Central Command in Tampa, Florida, Obama said that Saudi Arabia has "agreed to host our efforts to train and equip Syria opposition forces" to fight ISIS. There was a "very detailed conversation with the Egyptians about military-to-military cooperation" in Iraq, State Department officials said Sunday, but there appear to be no public details about the role Egypt may play.
