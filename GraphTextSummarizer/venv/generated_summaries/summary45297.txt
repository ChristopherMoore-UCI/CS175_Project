Ramadan Mohamed, who lives across town, has an elaborate net for catching pigeons that stray into his patch. "In the hobby of breeding pigeons, there are friends and foes," said Mohamed. " Hassan's pigeons cost him $600 a month in food alone, but he says it's a hobby that unites people of all backgrounds, rich and poor, conservative and liberal. "The pigeon is joined with our culture in Egypt," said Hassan. "Every type of people in Egypt can breed the pigeon," he said.
