Within weeks of his release from hospital, Ali had made contact with people smugglers -- "mafia," as he called them. Still, the boats keep sailing to Australia with desperate people believing that after a period of incarceration they'll begin new lives. Ali was questioned, albeit periodically, over a period of 10 months as he languished in detention centers on Christmas Island, Tasmania and in the Northern Territory capital of Darwin. But though Pakistan does its bit to take in asylum seekers, Ali tells me this is not a preferred option for his family. But on June 12 this year, the Australian government granted Ali a health and security clearance along with a bridging visa and the right to work whilst he awaits final clearance.
