"The cold spell is about zero degrees, and we will get subzero overnight," said Mayor Rick Kaysen of Cheyenne, Wyoming. "This is the first snow I've seen this season, and it's a major snowstorm, rather than the usual light dusting you'd expect to start off the winter with," said Katie Robinson of St. Paul. " In Minnesota, though tempered by years of long brutal winters, this snap came a little too soon. The cold air will move toward the South by Wednesday morning, bringing freezing temperatures as far south as Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle. The cold snap will bring lows in the teens and single digits into Iowa, Kansas and Colorado this week but also spread freezing temperatures as far south as Texas.
