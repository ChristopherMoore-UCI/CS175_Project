Such widespread laudatory performance appraisals occurred shortly before CNN started reporting in November how veterans waited excessive periods for VA health care, with some dying in the process. A fatal wait: Veterans languish and die on a VA hospital's secret list That didn't stop the head of the Phoenix VA medical center, Sharon Helman, from getting an $8,500 bonus last year.

Updated figures Earlier this week, an updated audit revealed about 177,000 veterans were still waiting at least two months for an appointment at VA medical centers.
