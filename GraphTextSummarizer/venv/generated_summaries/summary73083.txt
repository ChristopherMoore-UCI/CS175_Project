The center is a unique cultural crossroads in the deep South, said Anisah Bagasra, an instructor at Claflin University in Orangeburg, South Carolina, who has studied the mosque and how its members incorporate Islamic rituals into their daily lives. They practice mainstream Islam, like 2.45 million other American Muslims, not Nation of Islam, a separate religious tradition associated with black Muslims. Gibbs enjoys the duality and expresses her culture through her clothing, head scarf and singing West African-influenced Islamic prayers, a practice uncommon in other mosques. Here, they marry Islamic ritual, racial understanding and traditional southern culture. "When I came and listened to the sheikh and he spoke about God and the Prophet Mohammed, it wasn't about 'black power this,' and 'black man that,'" Gibbs said.
