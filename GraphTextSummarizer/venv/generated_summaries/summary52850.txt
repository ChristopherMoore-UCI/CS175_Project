"Greater investments are needed to combat the LRA across central Africa," said co-author Kasper Agger, an Enough Project field researcher. -- African warlord Joseph Kony and his struggling militia are poaching elephant ivory across central Africa to get funds for weapons, ammunition and food, a report says. His militia, the Lord's Resistance Army, has been butchering elephants for years, according to a report released Tuesday by various groups, including the Enough Project and the Satellite Sentinel Project. A small number of U.S. special forces are advising and assisting regional military efforts to hunt him down. Unlike decades past when poachers across the continent ran down elephants using spears, attackers are now highly organized and armed with sophisticated weapons.
