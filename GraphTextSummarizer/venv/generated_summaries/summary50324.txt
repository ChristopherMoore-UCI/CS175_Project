It's tempting and lazy for me to describe Birand to foreigners as Turkey's own "Walter Cronkite." Mehmet Ali Birand, Turkey's most charismatic broadcaster, writer and political commentator had passed away. Last year I asked him what words of advice he might have for young Turkish journalists. As crowds of Kurdish demonstrators dispersed after the memorial gathering on Thursday, a young Kurdish man approached my camera crew. With Birand's passing, Turkey lost one of its most effective communicators -- not only to millions of Turks who watched his news broadcast on Kanal D every night, but also to foreigners like myself who struggle haplessly to explain this fascinating and sometimes frustrating country to the outside world.
