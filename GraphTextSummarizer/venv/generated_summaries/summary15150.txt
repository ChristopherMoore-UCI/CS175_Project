Standing beside a table displaying rocks, wooden sticks and even a gun that authorities recovered from the scene, Cabinet Chief Anibal Fernandez Fernandez blamed the conflict on Buenos Aires Mayor Mauricio Macri, Telam reported. Authorities say many of the squatters are illegal immigrants, and the physical clashes have also become a tense political standoff between the federal government and city authorities in a nation that frequently attracts low-wage migrants from other South American countries. Four men were still in the hospital Monday -- one in serious condition -- after authorities cracked down on groups of homeless people who tried to illegally take park lands to start building houses, the state-run Telam news agency said. Federal officials have called Macri a "xenophobe" for saying the conflict was because of "uncontrolled immigration" of illegal immigrants from neighboring South American countries, including Bolivia and Paraguay, the agency said. The clashes grew so violent that Argentinian President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner sent in National Guard troops to surround the park, where government estimates indicate more than 1,600 families are camped.
