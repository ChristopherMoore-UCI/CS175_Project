Veterans like Richard Quest, who is attending his 10th WEF, take great pleasure in warning new CNN producers that it'll cost a fortune, it's exhausting, but it's like no other event like it you've ever been to before. Sweating in heavy winter gear under the power of hot air blowers, I soon discovered how my ID badge dictates your right to access, food and hospitality at WEF. Billy Connolly once said: "there's no such thing as bad weather, only the wrong kind of clothing." Beyond the ring of steel, tourists were rapidly banished as journalists from round the world take over ski lodges and budget hotels. This was a stunt for my show, Marketplace Europe, which showed the plethora of reports which come out to coincide with WEF.
