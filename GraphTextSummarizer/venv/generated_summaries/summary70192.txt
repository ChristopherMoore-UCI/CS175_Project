In an interview with CNN en Espanol, Mujica suggested in September that when it comes to drug trafficking, the trafficking part is usually more harmful than the drug itself, especially when it comes to marijuana. The bill rests on the premise that if "the state assumes the control and regulation of the activities of importation and exportation, sowing, growing, harvesting, producing ... storing, commercializing and distributing," then the ills of drug trafficking would be greatly reduced and the quality of the plants improved, benefiting patients and putting drug traffickers out of business. "We would like to identify those who consume (marijuana), take them out of the shadows and offer to them a regulated opportunity to consume (the drug) so that they don't have to depend on drug traffickers. Luis Gallo, a senator with the Broad Front Party, which supports the bill, said current drug policy, which rests solely on law enforcement and prohibition, has produced no results. We want to take away the market from drug traffickers by competing with them," Mujica said.
