CNN's Jonathan Wald in London and Youssif Basil in Baghdad, Iraq, contributed to this report. He said that Iraq does not need the British troops and that Iraqi security forces are ready to handle security on their own. It was a group of Iraqi lawmakers loyal to anti-American Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr that prevented parliament from approving a new agreement on British troops. The United Kingdom's remaining contingent of 100 to 150 troops is leaving Iraq for neighboring Kuwait, a Ministry of Defence spokesman told CNN. "The small handful of British military personnel operating in Iraq will be withdrawn to Kuwait after Iraq's parliament adjourned without passing a deal that would let them stay," the spokesman said.
