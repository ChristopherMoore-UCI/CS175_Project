On Tuesday afternoon, bus driver Charles Poland Jr. was shuttling children from school to their homes when he dropped Miller's two boys off and a man boarded the bus. 'That's a hero' Even as authorities search for answers behind the killing and kidnapping, there is no question to Midland City residents that the bus driver was a hero. He is Jimmy Lee Dykes, 65, a Vietnam veteran and retired truck driver who moved to the area about five years ago. Tim Byrd, chief investigator with the Dale County Sheriff's Office, told the Southern Poverty Law Center's Hatewatch that Dykes was a "survivalist type" with "anti-America" views. He had worked as a full-time bus driver for four years, shuttling children between their homes and schools.
