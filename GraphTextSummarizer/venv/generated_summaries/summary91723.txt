I do not offer evidence of the devil, just a proposition for secularists and atheists: Even if you do not believe as people of faith do, respect their right to believe and hold opinions informed by belief. Discussing faith in public life is many orders of magnitude harder, but Scalia tried. Scalia's awareness of elite bias against belief shows. Today, as a third-year law student, I sit in seminars with students who scoff at the idea of lawmaking informed by religion, even though most Americans are religious. I come from North Carolina, buckle of the Bible Belt, where few would proudly announce contempt for faith.
