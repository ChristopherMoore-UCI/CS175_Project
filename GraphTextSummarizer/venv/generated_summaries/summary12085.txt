Elias Acevedo Sr., 49, pleaded guilty Monday to 297 counts, including aggravated murder, rape and kidnapping, said Timothy McGinty, the Cuyahoga County prosecutor. Acevedo was arrested earlier this year in the same neighborhood where authorities found Amanda Berry, Georgina "Gina" DeJesus and Michelle Knight in May at Castro's two-story home. In October, the FBI's Violent Crime Task Force -- which was looking into other suspected abductions in Cleveland after Castro was arrested -- linked Acevedo to the slaying of Christina Adkins, who disappeared in 1995 at age 18. -- A Cleveland man will spend the rest of his life in prison for the killings of two women in the 1990s, cases that were reinvestigated after the discovery of three women held captive nearby for years by Ariel Castro. Castro, who pleaded guilty to 937 counts, was found hanged with a bedsheet in his jail cell on September 3.
