Make an election night plan: Whether you'll be at viewing parties in opposite cities or side-by-side with earpieces and laptops, agree in advance whether you'll spend the evening, and morning, together. Do a reality check: For every couple engaged in a playful red-versus-blue showdown, there's another that must acknowledge red flags about opposing world views. But ixnay on the bouffant wig and red glasses.... as well as the Joe Biden undies. Maybe it's no political talk at the table or no ranting email forwards from Aunt Phyllis. Drive to distraction: Now is the time to take up cooking together, not to spend all night with Wolf Blitzer.
