The missile -- fired from an unmanned drone -- was targeting a pickup truck carrying suspected militants near the town of Wana in South Waziristan in Pakistan's Federally Administered Tribal Areas, according to Nasim Dawar, an official with the South Waziristan administration. People inspect the damage from a suspected U.S. missile strike in northwest Pakistan last month. -- A suspected U.S. missile struck a village Wednesday in Pakistan's tribal region, killing three Taliban militants and wounding four others, according to local officials and media reports. However, the United States is the only country operating in the region known to have the capability to launch missiles from drones, which are controlled remotely. The U.S. military in Afghanistan routinely offers no comment on reported cross-border strikes.
