According to Hill's mother, Judith Hughes, Hill called early Saturday to say she and Jaidon were on their way to meet Smith's relatives to "take care of some business. According to her mother, Hill works as a nurse assistant at the University of Mississippi Medical Center. After the family's car was found flipped, Hughes said she went to the home where Hill and Smith are believed to live. The vehicle was later found in the western part of Copiah County, Mississippi. "We have not been able to rule out foul play," said Copiah County Sheriff Harold Jones.
