Clough, one of the legends of the British game, had been denied an FA Cup Final with Forest a year earlier, when his side lost to Liverpool at the same stage of the competition and at the same venue. Through it hundreds of Liverpool fans had attempted to make their way without realizing the two caged pens it led to were already overcrowded. The oldest victim at Hillsborough was 67, the youngest 10-year-old Jon-Paul Gilhooley, a cousin of current Liverpool captain and England international Steven Gerrard. In 1985 I had been in Brussels with Liverpool to cover their European Cup final against Juventus, when 39 fans, mainly Italian, were killed at the Heysel stadium as a wall collapsed after trouble on the terraces. The Liverpool end of the pitch resembled a casualty station with frantic efforts being made to treat the injured and save lives while others wandered aimlessly around the pitch in a daze.
