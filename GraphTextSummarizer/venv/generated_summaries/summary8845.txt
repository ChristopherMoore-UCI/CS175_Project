(For those of you younger folk, Johnny Carson is the late night TV guy before the other late night TV guy before Jimmy Fallon.) The agony and ecstasy of the National Spelling Bee What is great about the National Spelling Bee is that it provides a safe space for prepubescent kids to meet peers with a similar obsession for words. This obsessive attention to letters and orthography led me to victory at the 1986 National Spelling Bee. Tonight one competitor will be crowned the 2013 National Spelling Bee victor and embark on a similar journey to the one I did 27 years ago. Winning the Bee can lead to all kinds of aches -- headaches, stomachaches, growing pains.
