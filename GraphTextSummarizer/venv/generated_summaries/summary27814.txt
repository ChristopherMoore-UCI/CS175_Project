"Children's books live a long time because you always have children growing into them," says Pat Scales, president of the Association for Library Service to Children and a retired school librarian. "One of my husband's favorites growing up was 'The Pokey Little Puppy,' " she says of the 1942 Little Golden Book by Janette Sebring Lowrey and Gustaf Tenggren. -- They feature characters such as hat-wearing cats, very hungry caterpillars, nice girls named Madeline and naughty boys named Max. But almost all classics share some characteristics, says Alida Allison, a San Diego State University English professor and member of that California school's National Center for the Study of Children's Literature. The plot isn't just reassuring to children, she points out, but also reinforces the lessons of good parenting.
