Besides Shape-ups, Skechers also made deceptive claims about other products including Resistance Runner, Toners and Tone-up shoes, the FTC alleged. The FTC is warning customers to be careful when shopping for fitness products and workout gear, and Reebok isn't the only shoemaker to come under fire for over-hyping the fitness benefits of their products. The refund is part of a settlement reached between the federal government and the popular shoe maker over allegations of deceptive advertising claims that their shoes were better than regular shoes at strengthening and toning leg and buttock muscles. The deadline for customers to ask for a refund ended in April according to the FTC's Cheryl Hackley. In May, Skechers agreed to pay a hefty $40 million fine to settle charges they allegedly deceived consumers by making "unfounded claims that Shape-ups would help people lose weight, and strengthen and tone their buttocks, legs and abdominal muscles," according to the FTC.
