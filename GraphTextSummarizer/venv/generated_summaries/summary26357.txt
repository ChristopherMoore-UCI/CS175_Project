High school learns to love students' tech habits Students can adjust their privacy settings if they don't want the world to see their tweets or Facebook updates. Frydrych has been providing technology services to school districts the past 10 years. "When the government -- and public schools are part of the government -- engages in any kind of line-crossing and to actually go and gather information about people away from school, that crosses a line," Tien said. Though critics liken the monitoring to government stalking, school officials and their contractor say the purpose is student safety. Frydrych's firm scours the social media postings of Glendale students aged 13 and older -- the age at which parental permission isn't required for the school's contracted monitoring -- and sends a daily report to principals on which students' comments could be causes for concern, Frydrych said.
