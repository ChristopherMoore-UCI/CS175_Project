Officers learned his real name the night of his arrest on February 20, but only discovered his law enforcement role when preparing documents for his lawyer last week, Coon Rapids Police Chief Brad Wise said. Coon Rapids police "followed all protocol and procedure" during the arrest, he added. "Mr. Smith did not ask for special treatment upon his arrest, nor did he receive treatment different from any other person arrested in this operation," Wise said. "It was at that time that a staff member recognized Smith's photo as that of the Robbinsdale police chief," Wise said in a written statement. Wise said nothing Smith carried at the time of his arrest identified him as a law enforcement officer.
