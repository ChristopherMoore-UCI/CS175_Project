The provisional accord paves the way for a new autonomous region to be administered by Muslims in Mindanao, according to President Benigno Aquino III, who met with the rebels at the presidential palace in Manila. -- Filipino government officials and Muslim rebel leaders signed a landmark peace deal Monday aimed at ending a long-running insurgency in the nation's troubled south. Yet even as this violence unfolded, rebels have been negotiating for 15 years with officials from the Manila-based government. Murad's group is estimated to have 12,000 members, but military sources say it may have splintered when government troops conducted offensives in 2000. The new name of Bangsamoro "symbolizes and honors the struggles of our forebears in Mindanao, and celebrates the history and character of that part of our nation," according to Aquino.
