The nation's main airport closed for a time, but had reopened by late Saturday afternoon, according to Rachel Brumbaugh, operations manager in Haiti for the Christian humanitarian organization World Vision. -- After dumping intense rain and bringing strong winds to Haiti and Cuba on Saturday, Tropical Storm Isaac picked up steam -- and promised to pick up strength -- as it spun toward Florida. The Florida Keys, Florida Bay and the state's west coast, from Bonita Beach south to Ocean Reef, are under a hurricane warning. "We are a state that we know we have to get prepared for hurricanes." As preparations continue, authorities in Haiti spent Saturday assessing Isaac's aftermath. And a hurricane watch, first issued early Saturday, continued overnight for Florida's east coast from Golden Beach south to Ocean Reef.
