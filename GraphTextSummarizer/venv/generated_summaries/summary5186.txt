-- San Diego Mayor Bob Filner, accused of sexually harassing women, will resign if the San Diego City Council accepts a proposed mediation agreement, local TV stations reported Thursday. Filner has been under intense pressure to resign in the wake of allegations of serial sexual harassment of women, including inappropriate touching, kissing and comments. That was the same day that, according to Filner and others involved, three days of mediation talks yielded a tentative agreement. Filner, for example, said in a statement Thursday, "Due to the confidential nature of mediation and settlement discussions, we are unable to comment or make statements about any of the terms." Whatever the final deal is, lawyer Gloria Allred -- who represents Filner's former communications chief Irene McCormack Jackson, who has filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against her former boss, and who has spoken alongside several other accusers -- said Thursday that she hopes it includes not only his resignation, but no future payments to him for legal fees or otherwise.
