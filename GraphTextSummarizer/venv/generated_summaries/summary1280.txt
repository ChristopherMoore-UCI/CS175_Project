Prayuth seized control of the country on May 22, 2014 after months of unrest destabilized the elected government, led by former Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra. Critics accused Yingluck of acting as a mouthpiece for her brother, former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who was deposed in the last coup in 2006 and is now living in exile. After taking power, military authorities summoned leading political officials and other prominent figures. Since taking power, the Thai military has enforced the rule of law, seizing guns, arresting suspected criminals and shutting down illegal businesses. Thailand's National Legislative Assembly selected General Prayuth Chan-ocha to lead the government in a vote on Thursday.
