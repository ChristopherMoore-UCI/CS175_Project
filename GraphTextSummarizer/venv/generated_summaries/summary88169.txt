Police said Monday that the 88-year-old World War II vet, who died last week after a brutal beating in a parking lot in Spokane, Washington, tried to fend off his attackers. "What did they think they were going to get from this man?" Belton, a retired aluminum company worker, was wounded during a battle on the Pacific island of Okinawa while fighting in World War II. He didn't have a lot of money," Belton's daughter-in-law, Barbara Belton, told CNN's Alina Machado last week. "He came close to losing his life in service to this country on Okinawa, and then he gets killed needlessly on the parking lot while he was waiting for a friend," Spokane police Chief Frank Straub Jr. said. Random killings spark laments, but reality shows long slide in crime rate Monique Cotton, a spokeswoman with Spokane police, said the teens were charged as adults.
