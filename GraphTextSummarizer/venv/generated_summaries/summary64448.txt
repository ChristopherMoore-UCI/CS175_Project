The Wildcats smoked the Mountaineers 78-39 Thursday night in a Midwest Region contest that was never a contest. The Fighting Irish pulled away from Wichita State while the Badgers shook off pesky North Carolina. The undefeated Wildcats were scary good Thursday night in crushing West Virginia. The good news was Arizona and Xavier played a terrific game in the final contest of the night. Jerian Grant, a national player of the year candidate, had a rough night shooting, so he set up his teammates for buckets instead.
