-- Legendary fitness pioneer Jack LaLanne saved millions of lives by teaching people to eat right and exercise regularly, Arnold Schwarzenegger said in his eulogy for LaLanne on Tuesday. LaLanne's memorial service at Forest Lawn Cemetery in Hollywood Hills on Tuesday afternoon was filled with laughter about LaLanne's evangelical energy in promoting fitness. "'This guy's a monster, he just keeps going and going and going with the exercising.'" LaLanne was laid to rest with a weight he was holding in his left hand when he died, said his son, Dan LaLanne. "It doesn't matter where you go, there is a health club and it all started with Jack LaLanne," Schwarzenegger, the bodybuilder, actor and former California governor, said. Schwarzenegger said he first met LaLanne soon after he moved to Venice Beach, California, as a young bodybuilder.
