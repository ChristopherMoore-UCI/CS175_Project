"I'm delighted that Ryan has accepted the chance to become player-coach," former Everton manager Moyes told United's official website as the new manager steps up his preparations for his first season at Old Trafford. Former United defender Phil Neville also returns to Old Trafford as part of Moyes' staff. Moyes' first Premier League match as United manager is at Swansea City on August 17. Meanwhile United's rivals Chelsea have agreed to sign talented Dutch midfielder Marco van Ginkel from Dutch club Vitesse Arnhem. Moyes was announced as the United manager in May, after fellow Scot Alex Ferguson called time on his trophy-laden 26-year reign.
