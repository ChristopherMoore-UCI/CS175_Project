Veteran striker Alessandro del Piero netted twice in the first half, the opener from the penalty spot, but the Sicilians leveled with goals in the last 10 minutes by Argentine Alejandro Gomez and fellow midfielder Francesco Lodi. Sampdoria moved out of the bottom three on goal difference above Lecce thanks to a 59th-minute winner from striker Nicola Pozzi at Bari. Inter Milan moved up to second place with a 2-1 win over fourth-placed Lazio, bouncing back from last weekend's defeat at Parma which effectively ended the Nerazzurri's five-year title reign. On-loan Brazilian striker Amauri scored in the 13th and final minutes to lift his side three points above the relegation zone. Lecce lost 4-2 at Genoa despite a first-half double from striker David Di Michele, as on-loan striker Antonio Floro Flores and Argentina international Rodrigo Palacio both scored twice for the 10th-placed home side.
