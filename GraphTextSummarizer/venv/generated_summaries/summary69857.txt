It left Leonardo's men eight points adrift of city rivals AC Milan, who romped to a 4-0 home win over Parma 24 hours earlier, but they still  have a game in hand.

Coach Edy Reja asked the fans to be patient after his side have slipped in recent weeks.

But Palermo saw their hopes nosedive with a shock 4-2 defeat at home to Fiorentina.
