Judge Joan Lefkow, who eventually returned to the bench, credited the marshals who protect federal judges at work and at home with major improvements in judicial security in the years since her family tragedy. U.S. Marshals Director John Clark credits Lefkow's advocacy for better security as the catalyst for dramatic changes. Judge Joan Lefkow has advocated improving judicial security since her husband and mother were killed. "We've already had 600 inappropriate communications reported in the first months of this year," said Marshals Service spokesman Dave Turner. Judge Lefkow returned home on February 28, 2005, to find them shot to death.
