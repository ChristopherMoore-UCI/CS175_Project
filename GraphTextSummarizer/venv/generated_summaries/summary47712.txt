The ratcheting socket wrench was the first "uplink tool" printed in space, according to Grant Lowery, marketing and communications manager for Made In Space, which built the printer in partnership with NASA. The goal for the project is to create in-space manufacturing, especially as missions venture farther from Earth. "This means that we could go from having a part designed on the ground to printed in orbit within an hour to two from start to finish," Niki Werkheiser, NASA's 3-D print manager, said in a press release when the printer was sent to the ISS in September. Space, the final frontier for 3-D printing Ultimately, Lowery said the wrench and other objects will be sent back  to assess whether there are any functional differences between those samples printed in space versus those on the ground. This week, thanks to 3-D printing, astronaut and ISS commander Barry "Butch" Wilmore had a wrench he needed manufactured by a printer in just four hours.
