In the poll, women said they agree with some basic principles about health care, including the statement, "We need to start over and create real heath care reform that allows us to choose the plans we want, the doctors we need at the cost we can afford." In other words, when our candidates oppose Obamacare and support real health care solutions, they are likely to find support among women. As women, we also take an interest in finding out what female voters are actually thinking. For years Democrats have fixated on a contrived "war on women" to connect with female voters. They reject the typical Washington one-size-fits-all approach and identify with the statement in the poll that "Obamacare doesn't allow women to make health care decisions for their families."
