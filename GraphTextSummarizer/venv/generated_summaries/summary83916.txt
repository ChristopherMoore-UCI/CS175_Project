Peng Liyuan, wife of China's new president Xi Jinping, made her debut as China's First Lady this week accompanying Xi in his first overseas trip as China's new state president. -- China's new First Lady is poised to impress--and burnish China's image overseas. Peng had performed in the annual TV gala show almost every year until 2007, when Xi was promoted into the top-tier of the Communist Party, making him the presumptive paramount leader of China. In contrast to Jiang Qing, China's First Ladies in the 1980s and 90's kept a low public profile. She is a popular soprano, widely known in China for her soaring, glass-breaking voice and patriotic folk songs.
