Murunga, who has a background in banking, says it is difficult for women to get credit from banks to start businesses. Some banks have even created products that specifically target chama groups, with favorable interest rates and sizeable loan potential. The growth is important to Murunga, who bought the business a year ago, without the help of big banks. "The chama has been very exciting in that it's been much easier for us to quickly invest in big deals which would not have been possible if I tried to do (it) myself," says Murunga. Murunga says when it comes to new members they look for someone who is interested in their long-term strategic vision and thus willing to pump in money for 10 years without getting any out.
