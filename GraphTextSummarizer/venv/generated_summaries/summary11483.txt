And he wouldn't have gotten so big, even with hundreds of injections, if he hadn't pumped iron day after day. He argues that steroids and human growth hormone alone didn't make him a great slugger, saying that he had good and bad years when he was juiced, just as he had good years, such as his record-setting rookie season, when he claims he wasn't chemically enhanced. If McGwire's admissions can serve any good now, it would be to prompt other steroid users to come clean. This from a manager who either closed his eyes to drug use on his teams, didn't know what he should have known, or kept conspiratorially silent about it through all the years with McGwire on the Oakland Athletics (along with Jose Canseco) and on the Cards. Can he be trusted to coach other players who may be using steroids?
