-- A hundred years ago on this day, on August 8th, 1914, the British HMS Asteria and Pegasus protected cruisers bombed Dar-es-Salaam, then the capital of German East Africa, bringing the European so-called "war to end all wars" to the eastern African shores. 45,000 among the dead were from British East Africa (Kenya) alone. Of the 105,000 deaths among British forces during the East Africa campaign, 90% were porters. All told, two million African soldiers, workers and porters were directly involved in World War I. Though never fully acknowledged, Europe's Great war was a war of colonials and a colonial theater of war. That same year, Germans carried out the first genocide of the century against the Herero in German South West Africa (Namibia).
