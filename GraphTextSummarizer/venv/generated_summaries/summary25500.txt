"While time passed by, and Koblenz was rebuild(ing), the bombs got even more dangerous," bomb-disposal squad member Jurgen Wagner said Sunday. -- Bomb squads in Germany successfully defused on Sunday two bombs and disposed of an additional air-dropped military device that had caused an evacuation of historic proportions in a city in the country's west. By mid-Sunday morning, authorities declared the center of Koblenz a "forbidden area." Life had come to a standstill in the western German city of Koblenz, where 45,000 people -- nearly half of the cityÂ´s population -- had been evacuated after the discovery of several dangerous World War II bombs. "It's the largest German evacuation since the end of the war," fire brigade spokesman Ronald Eppelsheim said Sunday.
