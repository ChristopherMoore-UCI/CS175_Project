" The NCAA defended the decision, with spokesman Erik Christianson stating "schools have known since 2006" about the "serious penalties, including postseason restriction" for programs that did not meet set academic requirements. "Also, in UConn's first waiver denial, NCAA staff noted the men's basketball team's overall lack of academic achievement and minimal academic progress over several years," Christianson said by e-mail to CNN. " The NCAA notes that a 930 APR, or academic performance rate, equates to a program being at the fulcrum to meet that criteria -- with higher scores indicating that a program is on track to graduate more than half its players, and lower ones indicating it is not. The move is a result of the NCAA's decision to implement a recommendation, backed by U.S. Education Secretary Arne Duncan and the Knight Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics, to penalize programs that did not or were not on track to graduate at least half of their student athletes. The academic standards will get even more stringent next school year, the spokesman noted.
