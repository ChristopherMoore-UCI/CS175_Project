According to the website for Guinness World Records, the heaviest baby -- weighing in at more than 23 pounds -- was born in Seville, Ohio, on January 19, 1879. "We anticipated that the child would be big," said Holger Stepan, chief of obstetrics. -- One of the heaviest babies ever born in Germany was born last week at the University Hospital Leipzig. The girl's mother suffered from gestational diabetes, which, when untreated or uncontrolled, can cause babies to be born larger than normal. "We prepared in advance by assembling a special team (of doctors and midwives) to be ready for any possible complications."
