Amid heightened tensions with North Korea, the United States and South Korea on Sunday began joint military exercises. Democratic Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, answered "no" when asked if there was a real threat of a North Korean military attack over the U.S.-South Korean exercises. North Korea "will legitimately counter with [its] powerful nuclear deterrence the largest-ever nuclear war exercises to be staged by the U.S. and the South Korean puppet forces," KCNA reported. An international inquiry found North Korea culpable for the March attack that killed 46 South Korean sailors. The Security Council did not mention North Korea by name but condemned the attack strongly, called for "full adherence" to the armistice agreement that halted fighting in the Korean War in 1953 and encouraged "the settlement of outstanding issues on the Korean peninsula by peaceful means."
