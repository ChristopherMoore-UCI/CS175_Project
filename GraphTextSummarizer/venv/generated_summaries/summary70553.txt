Two Australians are on death row in a Bali prison while six others are serving life sentences. He will leave Indonesia and will be blacklisted from re-entering the nation for six months, prosecutor Gusti Gede Putu Atmaja said. After the arrest, the boy's attorney, Mohammad Rifan, said he had hoped to avoid a prison sentence and have him released to undergo drug rehabilitation. The sentence included time already served, local prosecutors said. But they have a provision, article 128, under which those arrested with small amounts of drugs can be released to rehabilitation if they can prove they are an addict.
