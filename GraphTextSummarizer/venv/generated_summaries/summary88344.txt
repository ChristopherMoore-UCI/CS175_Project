A Continental flight bound for Chicago from Houston made an unscheduled stop in St. Louis because of an "unruly passenger," a St. Louis airport spokesman said Sunday. The plane landed at St. Louis and the man was taken off the plane for questioning by airport police and federal authories, he said. -- Security concerns forced two U.S. passenger flights to be diverted Sunday, but both planes landed safely and eventually flew to their final destinations. A spokesman for Albuquerque International Sunport Airport said passengers deplaned and were "being checked out. Flight 1706 landed in Albuquerque shortly before 10 a.m. (12 p.m. ET) and agents were on the scene to investigate, the FBI office in Albuquerque said.
