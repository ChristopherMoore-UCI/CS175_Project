Real's strategies in those matches bore more resemblance to the Portuguese coach's winning formula against Barca while in charge of Inter Milan in last season's Champions League semis than the all-out attacking blitz that saw Madrid crush Valencia 6-3 on Saturday. -- Coach Jose Mourinho has told his Real Madrid players to heed the wisdom of Albert Einstein ahead of Wednesday's Champions League semifinal first leg against Spanish arch-rivals Barcelona. Puyol missed Saturday's 2-0 win over Osasuna and the Copa del Rey final defeat by Real, having gone off with a thigh injury during the previous weekend's El Clasico clash in Madrid. Having been crushed 5-0 by Barca in this season's first "Clasico" clash in the Catalan capital in November, Mourinho has successfully resorted to more defensive tactics to earn a draw at the Santiago Bernabeu and then victory in the Spanish Cup final last Wednesday. Mourinho has welcomed back loan striker Emmanuel Adebayor and winger Angel Di Maria, who missed Saturday's 6-3 win at Valencia due to injuries.
