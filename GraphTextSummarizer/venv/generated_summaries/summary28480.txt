To minimize identity theft, the Obama administration is urging Internet companies to agree upon and adopt a standard, reliable identity-verification system that people can use for any website. What Obama's proposal describes is a series of security problems on the Internet, such as insecure passwords and people handing over sensitive data to dozens of companies, as well as some vague suggestions for how to solve them. After failed government experiments, the United States has observed that an online ID has to be driven by companies, not countries, and has to keep Internet anonymity intact, Grant said. The government's prospective standard for online identity is not expected to result in a law, as long as companies can come to an agreement among themselves. Passwords are often shared among family, friends and spouses, and people typically use the same passwords for everything.
