"It has gone beyond Latinos, so that a lot of Latino girls will have not only family members in court but they will reach out to non-Latino friends," says Salcedo. One reason for their popularity is a greater acceptance of Latin culture in America, according to Michele Salcedo, author of "Quinceañera!" The church plays a role in helping to prepare teenage girls for this transition to womanhood. Beyond the elaborate apparel, food and festivities, modern quinceañeras often feature a court of 15 people, typically consisting of family and friends. It doesn't have to be celebrated with a party at all, but it is generally marked by something quite special," Salcedo says.
