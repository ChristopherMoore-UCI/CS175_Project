The Patriots racked up victories on the shoulders of a topflight quarterback in Brady, an ingenious coach in Bill Belichick -- but they won the respect of others around the league in large part thanks to Bob's forthright leadership and Myra's heart of gold.

Although married to a man who Forbes lists with a net worth of $1.7 billion, Myra always made time to serve food in soup kitchens, to pack bags full of donated clothes, to bond with anyone around her.
