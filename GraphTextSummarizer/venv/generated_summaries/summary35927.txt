American flies Boeing 767-300s on international routes as well as long-haul domestic routes. American Airlines found the cracks in large pylons that hold engines onto the wings of two of its 767-300 aircraft, which Boeing currently recommends inspecting every 1,500 takeoff and landing cycles. "Boeing will recommend decreasing the number of flight cycles between inspections of the pylon mid spar fitting from every 1,500 flight cycles to possibly as low as every 400 flight cycles," the company said late Wednesday. -- Boeing says it has notified all 767 aircraft operators about cracks found on two American Airlines 767-300 planes, and by mid-July will recommend more frequent maintenance checks. American Airlines spokesman Tim Wagner said the problem was first discovered on one of its 767-300s about two weeks ago during a maintenance check targeting other parts of the aircraft.
