You see the results everywhere you look: -- A survey of U.S. history textbooks found that only 10% of the individuals identified in the texts were women. A vital part of recognizing equal rights for women is acknowledging and commemorating the deep and lasting contributions women have made throughout history. The stories of courageous and pioneering Americans such as abolitionist Harriet Tubman, astronaut Sally Ride, Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor and the founder of the Girl Scouts, Juliette Gordon Low, will inform and inspire future generations. For some reason or other, when the story of our country is told, women -- really great women -- have tended to be left out of the telling. Their stories aren't told widely or often -- perhaps because they were all women.
