That's why when a woman fears she might become pregnant after her contraceptive has failed or she has had unprotected sex, she needs fast access to emergency contraception, not delays at the pharmacy counter. And because emergency contraception is safe, making it over-the-counter was a big step in creating better access to birth control. Another concern among some is that access to emergency contraception will increase the rates of unprotected sex, especially among teens. It's a fact that rates of unprotected sex do not increase when there is more access to emergency contraception. It's a fact that emergency contraception is birth control.
