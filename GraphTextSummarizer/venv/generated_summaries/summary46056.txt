"Senna was very important for Formula One, as a driver and a person and his death led to a rapid acceleration in the process of increasing the level of safety in our sport," Ferrari driver Kimi Raikkonen told the sport's official website. Senna's passing was the last time a driver has died as a result of a crash at a grand prix, in a sport which in its formative decades had become infamous for driver fatalities. In Brazil, Senna's grave in the city of Sao Paulo was adorned with wreaths and bright bouquets. Brazilian football team Corinthians paid tribute to one of the country's most famous sporting icons by walking out onto the pitch in replicas of Senna's brightly-colored helmet ahead of Wednesday's match against National AM. Vivianne is the head of the Ayrton Senna Institute, which partners with major corporations to give educational opportunities to millions of children across Brazil.
