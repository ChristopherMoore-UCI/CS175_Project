-- Former President Clinton published a list of donors to his foundation Thursday to help clear the way for his wife to become secretary of state. The donations to the William J. Clinton Foundation include amounts of $10 million to $25 million from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and real estate mogul Stephen Bing, a personal friend of Clinton's. Bill Clinton agreed to the release the list after President-elect Barack Obama nominated Hillary Clinton to become secretary of state. The Clintons came under intense pressure during Hillary Clinton's campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination to release the names of donors to both the foundation and to the Clinton presidential library in Arkansas. Clinton donated between $500,000 and $1 million personally or through his family foundation, which is separate from the William J. Clinton Foundation.
