The PhotoMath app is available for iPhones and Windows phones and is coming to Android phones in 2015. PhotoMath by microblink uses a phone's camera to solve equations and then teaches you the step-by-step method for solving it yourself. The app can do arithmetic: addition, subtraction, division and multiplication. Math teachers will have to be extra vigilant during tests to prevent students from cheating. It can even do simple linear equations, provided the x you're solving for is italicized so the app doesn't confuse it with the x multiplication symbol.
