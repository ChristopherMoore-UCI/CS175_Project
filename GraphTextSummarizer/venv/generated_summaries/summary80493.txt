The newly-crowned Masters champion watched on television as his hero and fellow Australian Greg Norman threw away a six-shot lead at Augusta in 1996, while Scott himself blew a four-shot advantage over the final four holes of last year's British Open. Now, Scott is Australia's first Masters champion, succeeding where two-time major winner Norman and the great Peter Thompson failed. Els' victory over Scott was achieved using the club, while Webb Simpson and Keegan Bradley both belly putted their way to major championships. " Scott has flirted with major success on a number of occasions. "The whole nation stopped that day and felt for Greg," Scott told CNN when asked about Norman's implosion on April 14, 1996.
