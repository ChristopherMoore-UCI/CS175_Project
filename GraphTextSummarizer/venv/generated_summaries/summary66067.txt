The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for the assault, saying it was in retaliation for a drone strike in nearby North Waziristan last month that killed two of its commanders. "This attack was to avenge the deaths of two of our commanders who had been killed in a drone attack last month," Pakistani Taliban spokesman Ehsanullah Ehsan told CNN. Two of the militants who were killed were wearing suicide jackets, intelligence officials said. The Pakistani military confirmed the attack, saying the army responded in full force. At least 13 security personnel, 10 civilians and 12 militants were killed in the early morning attack on the base that included housing for Pakistani military personnel and their families near the town of Serai Naurang in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, the officials said.
