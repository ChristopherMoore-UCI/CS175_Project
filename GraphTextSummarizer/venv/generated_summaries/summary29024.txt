More than 15 years after director James Cameron made his Oscar-winning film, it was his turn to scour the deep sea in a high-tech pod. But unlike his "Titanic" fictional character Lockett, Cameron wasn't in search of a sunken diamond -- instead he was gathering scientific data which could revolutionize our understanding of both deep sea creatures and earthquakes. As the three-time Academy Award winner said: "I'd much rather deal with the physical threats of deep sea ocean diving or the potential failures of engineering, than I would the fickleness of an audience." Dig deep Cameron admitted we're still some way off predicting earthquakes, but until now we didn't have the technology to fully explore such depths as the Mariana Trench -- the deepest point in the ocean. Cameron is just the third person to reach the Mariana Trench, since oceanographers Don Walsh and Jacques Piccard in 1960, and the only person to do so solo.
