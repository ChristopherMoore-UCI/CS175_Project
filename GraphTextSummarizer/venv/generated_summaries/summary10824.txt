Bullish Trump presses ahead with Scottish course Trump's golf course portfolio currently boasts 10 courses, 11 if his Aberdeen project comes to fruition. -- American billionaire tycoon Donald Trump could never be accused of underselling himself and his myriad of business projects so it came as no surprise when he said wanted to build the "world's best golf course" in Scotland. Does he believe the women's golf circuit will continue to flourish after the retirement of Annika Sorenstam and more recently Lorena Ochoa ? But across the world, other similar developments have run into trouble due to the worldwide recession and the move away from traditional golf course membership.
