Global signal "We wanted to give a signal to the world that now we have the possibility to do away with a whole category of weapons of mass destruction," said Thorbjorn Jagland, chairman of the Nobel Committee. Few had heard of the OPCW before it was tasked with dismantling Syria's chemical stockpile, but Jagland denied that the development had anything to do with his committee's decision. There had been vigorous speculation in the world's press about who might take home the medal: Possibly Pakistan's girls' education activist Malala Yousufzai, the teen who was shot for trumpeting her cause, or Congolese physician Denis Mukwege, who treats victims of gang rape. "Eighty percent of chemical weapons have been eliminated and more than 90 percent of production capacity," Jagland said. Many were surprised when the Norwegian Nobel Committee announced in October that the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons had won the award for work just begun in Syria to eliminate its poison gas stockpiles.
