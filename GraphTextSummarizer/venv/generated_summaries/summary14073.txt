-- Fresh off an electoral bruising for his Democratic Party, President Obama heads to India on Friday to launch a 10-day Asian trip intended to expand export markets and strengthen security cooperation in what he considers a region vital to U.S. interests. "If you look at the trend lines in the 21st century, the rise of Asia, the rise of individual countries within Asia, is one of the defining stories of our time," Rhodes said last week, adding, "We see core U.S. national interests that will be advanced by us playing a key role in helping to shape the future of the region and making clear that we're an Asian and a Pacific power." We both have an increasing stake in global stability and prosperity, especially across Asia and the Pacific." Michael Froman, the deputy national security adviser for international economic affairs, said India was "one of the most important emerging economic relationships for the United States." "With 1.2 billion people and an economy expected to grow at 8 percent a year for the next several years, we really see India as a potentially very important market for U.S. exports," Froman said. According to Rhodes, Obama departs Washington on Friday and arrives Saturday in Mumbai, where he will attend a business conference and visit the Gandhi Museum, then head to New Delhi for bilateral talks with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, the Parliament speech and the state dinner. "While a Muslim majority, it's a host to a broad religious diversity, so this speech will give the president an opportunity to discuss some of the themes that many of you have heard him talk about and to do so, again, in a country where he can speak to the importance of Indonesia to him, personally, having lived there for several years in Jakarta as a boy," Rhodes added.
