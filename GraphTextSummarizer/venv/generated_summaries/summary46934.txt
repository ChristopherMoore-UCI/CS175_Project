Bjorn's Danish teammate Thorbjorn Olesen and Streelman's partner Matt Kuchar (who won the team event with Gary Woodland in 2011) both shot level par rounds of 71. He and Bjorn are one shot ahead of South Korea's K.J. Choi, Welshman Stuart Manley and Scot Martin Laird. Masters champion Adam Scott, who won the Australian Masters at the same course last week, carded a four-over par 75 which included a quintuple-bogey nine at the par four 12th hole. Portugal are currently lying second on two-under par thanks to rounds of 69 from Ricardo Santos and 71 from Jose-Filipe Lima. -- Denmark's Thomas Bjorn and American Kevin Streelman are tied for the lead after Thursday's opening round of the World Cup of Golf in Melbourne.
