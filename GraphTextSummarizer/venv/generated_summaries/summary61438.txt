Marion Christopher Barry, the 34-year-old son of Marion Barry, the iconic former D.C. mayor and council member who died last year, is running for his father's seat on the district's council. Barry was infamously busted in 1990 on law enforcement surveillance tape smoking crack cocaine in a drug sting involving the FBI and Washington police. During his years of power in D.C., the older Marion Barry became a national symbol of African-American political leadership. Barry, however, made a comeback and was elected to a fourth term as mayor in 1995. In December, Barry told The Washington Post that he was "just listening to what the people want," adding that "God will send me the message" about whether to run or not.
