The NTSB investigators have found nothing to corroborate online flight tracking records showing that Asiana Flight 214 descended from cruising altitude much more steeply and rapidly than previous Asiana flights on the same route. -- Here's what we know about Saturday's crash landing of Asiana Airlines Flight 214 and some of the key questions raised by those facts: 1. Flights were landing using visual flight rules. Asiana said the pilot at the controls was making his first landing of a Boeing 777 at San Francisco International Airport. The runway's precision approach path indicator lights, showing correct flight approach altitudes, were working.
