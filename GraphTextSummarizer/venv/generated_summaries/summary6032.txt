For their part, Palestinian officials have refused to enter into new talks with Israel on the decades-old conflict until Israel stops building settlements on occupied West Bank land the Palestinians see as part of their future state. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a joint meeting of the U.S. Congress Tuesday that he is prepared to make "painful compromises" for a peace deal with Palestinians, but reiterated his insistence that Israel will never return to the boundaries that existed before the 1967 Middle East war. The prime minister flatly ruled out any so-called "right of return" for Palestinian families who left Israel after the state's founding in 1948. The group criticized what it called "the theft of Palestinian land" and the Israeli blockade of Gaza. Netanyahu flatly ruled out negotiations with Hamas, which is recognized as a terrorist organization by both the United States and Israel.
