For Gamergate -- now a catchall term for a kind of culture war sprung from the gaming world, taking in issues of sexism, free speech, journalistic ethics, identity and more -- the most timely and thoughtful coverage is coming from people who are affected by it. In the most visible episode so far, a few days ago Anita Sarkeesian, who in August had released a video about the use and abuse of women in games, canceled a scheduled talk at Utah State University after the school received emails threatening to murder people at the event. "They can't understand," she says, "why game designers, industry leaders, writers, public figures are lining up to disown their ideas and pledge to do better by women and girls in the future." Even if few would applaud such horrific acts of violence, the meaning of "support" is one of the questions raised by Gamergate: These women are being attacked for criticizing mainstream games' diminishment of women, and some of the sites where these discussions have erupted have subcultures of misogyny. As other women entered the conversation that was spreading across the Web, male gamer bullies organized to stamp them down as well, some of them adopting Gamergate as the rubric for their "movement."
