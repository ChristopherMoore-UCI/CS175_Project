The RGA's top slot has been held by other potential 2016 contenders including Texas governor Rick Perry, and is currently maintained by New Jersey governor Chris Christie. At the time, funds were used to rally constituent support for Jindal's program, an effort that falls squarely within the legal ramifications of campaign spending. Jindal's campaign spending totaled $1.8 million in 2013, according to analysis from New Orleans paper The Times-Picayune published Tuesday, and said that was more than any other politician in the state for that year. He spent more than $152,600 in 2012 and 2013 for flights to New Hampshire, Iowa and South Carolina -- lynchpin states that nearly all potential presidential candidates visit to swing votes in their favor. Jindal has been one of a growing list of GOP governors who could run for president in 2016.
