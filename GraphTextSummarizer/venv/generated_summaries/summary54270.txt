Most customers were tourists like me, business people or embassy staff -- the price for a pizza is too high for most North Koreans. Like other North Koreans I'd met or photographed, I felt from the staff a distinctive curiosity, tinged with a shyness of not knowing how to react to the increasing numbers of visiting foreigners. A group of North Korean border officials in neat uniforms boarded the train, collecting passports from passengers. As well as fear and reservation, and the intimidating scrutiny of the guides, most North Koreans cannot understand English. This was the closest I could get to ordinary North Korean people and it was in sharp contrast to the poorer, harsher views of rural life I got during the trip east.
