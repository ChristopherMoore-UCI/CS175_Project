Muhammed Ali: Fast Facts Since emerging on the international stage by winning a gold medal in boxing in the 1960 Olympic Games, Muhammad Ali has spent six decades in public life. Serving as a United Nations Messenger of Peace, Ali has visited more than 100 countries, meeting world leaders and human rights agencies to provide humanitarian assistance.
