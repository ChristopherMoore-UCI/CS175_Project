The re-education through labor system, or laojiao as it's known in China, began in the 1950s as a way for the fledgling Communist Party government to maintain order and stability in the chaotic post-revolution years. " Zhang and more than a hundred other prominent academics, journalists and economists wrote and posted an open letter online earlier this year that called for incoming President Xi Jinping to ratify U.N. rights treaties and respect basic principles of human rights. Human rights activists and liberal Chinese intellectuals see the 10 years of Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao's leadership, while overwhelmingly positive for the nation's economy, as a lost opportunity to reform China's legal system and protect the individual rights of ordinary Chinese. When police caught Liu with documents for petitioning at a sports event in southern China, they finally lost their patience. While laojiao was designed for petty thieves and prostitutes -- minor criminals that officials didn't want clogging up the courts -- rights groups believe that it is a convenient place to put government agitators.
