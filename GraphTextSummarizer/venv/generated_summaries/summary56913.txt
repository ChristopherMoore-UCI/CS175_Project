In a third trial, three men have been convicted in a 2006 plot to blow up commercial airliners over the Atlantic Ocean, the head of Britain's counterterrorism prosecution told CNN on Thursday. The men "were actively working alongside other men on a plot to cause death and injury on a massive scale," said Sue Hemming, head of the Counter Terrorism Division at the Crown Prosecution Service, in a statement released to CNN. "They were cleared in the previous trial of being aware of the ultimate targets of the plot," Hemming's statement said, "but we say that they were committed to the principle and practice of violent jihad to the point of targeting innocent people in an attempt to further their cause. Ibrahim Savant, Arafat Waheed Khan and Waheed Zaman were convicted of conspiracy to murder as suicide bombers. New restrictions were instituted worldwide and a ban on liquids remains in effect in most airports around the world.
