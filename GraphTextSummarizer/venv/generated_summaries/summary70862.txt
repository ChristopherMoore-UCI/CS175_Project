I was reminded of the slight in the show's most recent episode as Davis' character removed her wig, fake eyelashes, and makeup on camera. I can't tell you how many former NFL players I have come across who look nothing like the men I saw on the fieldâ€”significant weight loss, clean-shaven, hell, just being clean for a change. Those who dare to not join in may be called "less classically beautiful" in the eyes of The New York Times, who tried to pin such a slight on Viola Davis, the star of "How To Get Away With Murder." Considering how mean-spirited some of the response has been since Zellweger showed up at the Elle Women in Hollywood Awards much slimmer than we remembered, who could question the effect time away from the vitriol can have on a person? Maybe she had plastic surgery.
