Recently, I talked with Woody Rogers from The Tire Rack to learn about the differences between all-season tires and winter tires along with the basics to consider when purchasing a set of tires designed for the harsh winter conditions. "The industry really intended that symbol to be a merit badge for true winter tires, not for a multi purpose or multi use tires like on-/off-road all terrain or highway all-season," he said. He explained that winter tires (they're just not for the snow) focus their attention on the exact conditions you'll most likely be facing during the winter season. It's best to determine what conditions you'll be driving in and then determine the type of winter tire you will need. So why the need for winter tires when our cars can do so much work for us?
