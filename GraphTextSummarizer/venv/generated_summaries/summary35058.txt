"Big data is the new oil," says Andy Cutler, director of strategy at SAS, a consulting firm specializing in big data analytics. Meanwhile major supermarkets in the UK are turning to big data analytics to help them provide same-day grocery delivery services -- a huge logistical challenge involving predicting what customers are likely to want before they order it, and ensuring coordinated delivery times that protect supermarkets' already-thin profit margins. Technological advances are giving rise to huge amounts of data -- about consumers, supply chains and world events -- that businesses can use to make better decisions and gain a competitive edge. " Firms like Amazon and Netflix are at the forefront of this revolution, gathering the huge amounts of data generated by their customers and analyzing it to predict what customers will want to buy or watch in the future. It's called 'big data analytics', and those who ignore it are being warned they risk being left behind.
