-- Spanish authorities have arrested 25 people suspected in a 10 million euro ($13 million) fraud scheme targeting German owners of timeshare vacation property in the Canary Islands, police said Friday. The suspects contacted the timeshare owners, offered lucrative terms to buy their shares and lured the owners into paying what turned out to be non-existent taxes or transfer fees, Spanish national police said in a statement. With help from the German Embassy in Madrid, investigators identified a web of suspects spread among numerous businesses and locations, mainly on Tenerife Island -- one of the largest of the Canary archipelago of seven islands in the Atlantic Ocean. They, along with other property owners -- foreigners and Spaniards alike -- have felt the deep economic downturn after Spain's real estate bubble and construction boom collapsed. The timeshare property never actually changed hands, and the suspects vanished, only to surface elsewhere and repeat the alleged scam, police said.
