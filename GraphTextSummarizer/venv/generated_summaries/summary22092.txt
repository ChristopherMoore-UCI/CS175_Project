"That kind of pushy behavior helped her be the persistent don't-give-up-style of working dog that I needed later," says Corliss. For 15 years, Corliss has spent two weekends a month at the center working with dogs. Flying drones and other robotic technology provide new options for search and rescue teams, but Corliss says dogs will always be a part of the toolbox, along with cameras and listening devices. Back in 2001, Corliss and Bretagne (pronounced, "Britney") were fresh graduates of Disaster City when they were deployed to New York shortly after the World Trade Center attacks. Bretagne had become a kind of therapy dog.
