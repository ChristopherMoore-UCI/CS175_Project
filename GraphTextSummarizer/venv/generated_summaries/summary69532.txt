EW has learned exclusively that the "Today" co-host is quietly meeting with studios and pitching herself for new hosting gigs, such as a daytime talk show. A source close to Kotb downplayed the odds of a fourth-hour shakeup and denied the co-host wants a new series: "Hoda loves her job at the Today show and adores everyone she works with on the show. The show recently shot two weeks in L.A., but the co-hosts have dismissed the idea of a permanent relocation on the air. David Letterman addresses Jay Leno exit Kotb and her fourth-hour co-host Kathie Lee Gifford have been the target of media speculation as well. Her contract is coming up and she's just expanding relationships and having coffee with a few people." Conan O'Brien congratulates Jimmy Fallon Given all the "Today" rumors, one certainly can't blame Kotb for wanting to keep her options open.
