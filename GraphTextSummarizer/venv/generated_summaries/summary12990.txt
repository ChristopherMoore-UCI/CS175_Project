Shock upset in Pacquiao bout "People were in shock and disbelief," said Lito Tacujan, sports editor of the Manila-based Philippine Star daily. -- Philippines boxing icon Manny Pacquiao's fellow countrymen were left reeling Monday after their hero's controversial defeat to American boxer Timothy Bradley in Las Vegas at the weekend. Tacujan believes the rematch with Bradley will influence whether a much-anticipated showdown between the Filipino boxer, whose retirement is said to be on the horizon, and America's Floyd Mayweather Jr., who is serving a three-month jail sentence for a domestic violence conviction in Las Vegas, will happen. "Pacman," as he is affectionately known by fans, appeared to dominate Bradley during the 12-round match at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas but the judges decided otherwise. They thought the match result was set up or scripted." After the scores were announced, most of the crowd in the packed arena booed -- a sentiment that was echoed in Pacquiao's homeland where streets in towns and cities across the Philippines were deserted as people tuned in to watch the fight at home, in shopping malls, cinemas, parks and even army bases (Pacquiao is a lieutenant colonel in the Philippine Army Reserve Command.)
