"The increasingly sharp public criticism of Craigslist's Adult Services section reflects a growing recognition that ads for prostitution -- including ads trafficking children -- are rampant on it," the attorneys general said in a Tuesday letter to Craigslist CEO Jim Buckmaster and founder Craig Newmark. In a later blog, Buckmaster said Craigslist implemented manual screening of adult services ads in May 2009. In 2008, under pressure from state prosecutors, the website raised the fees for posting adult services ads. She told Lyon a Craigslist ad was "the fastest, quickest way you're for sure going to see somebody that day." In 2009, it started donating portions of the money generated by adult ads to charity.
