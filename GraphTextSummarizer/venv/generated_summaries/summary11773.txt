"I think it is an oversexualization of young girls/young women." Robin Belkin, a mom of three in Northern California, believes Cyrus' performance only adds to the already "damaging image of women-as-sex-objects. "The fact that she doesn't play the victim and shows that girls can be as aggressive and bad in many ways might in some twisted way pave the way for (women) to play in a more level field with men," said Leigh Bordbar, a mom of two from Toronto who said she was personally disappointed with what Cyrus did at the VMAs. Opinion: Miley Cyrus is sexual, get over it "Her behavior sets 50 to 60 years of women's forward progress back a long way when you consider that her huge fan base really only consists of young and impressionable girls and horny young boys, who, unfortunately on many levels, are our future leaders," said John Rodrigues of Boston, in response to a request for comment on CNN's Facebook page. Miley Cyrus twerks, stuns VMAs crowd "Hannah Montana" seems about as relevant to the current day Cyrus as a typewriter is to millenials. Cyrus "took a page straight out of Madonna's playbook," said Ivan Baker, a father in New York City, on Facebook.
