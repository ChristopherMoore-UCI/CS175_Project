"The film developed as a detective story," says Israeli director Arnon Goldfinger, grandson of Gerda Tuchler, the woman who owned the flat. What I found out was this journey, the Nazi (von Mildenstein) and his wife were accompanied by my grandparents," Goldfinger told CNN. This became all the harder for Goldfinger to digest when he learned more about von Mildenstein: He was no mere travel writer, but the head of the Nazi's Jewish Affairs Department in the early 1930s. In that capacity von Mildenstein is said to have recruited an up-and-coming member of the party -- Adolf Eichmann. Additional documents, photos and letters pointed to only one conclusion -- Gerda and her husband Kurt were not simply acquainted with von Mildenstein and his wife -- they had become the warmest of friends.
