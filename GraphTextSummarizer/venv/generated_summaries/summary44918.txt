In the Southeast, people with HIV tend to get tested late, after they have become sick, partly because of stigma, said Kathie Hiers, executive director of AIDS Alabama in Birmingham. The Southeast is among the areas of the United States with the highest concentration of cases of HIV and AIDS, according to a new online tool called the National HIV/AIDS Atlas. The remaining 61 percent of people living with HIV or AIDS are in the metro Atlanta area. The atlas, the first of its kind to map out HIV and AIDS at the level of counties, launched in time for Saturday's HIV/AIDS Testing Day. The National HIV/AIDS Atlas allows users to explore the prevalence of HIV and AIDS in any region of the United States.
