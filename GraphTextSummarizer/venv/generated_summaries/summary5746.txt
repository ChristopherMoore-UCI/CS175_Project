Labor unions influencing the talks, including the AFL-CIO, argued for higher pay and fewer workers per year, since they are concerned about the effect guest workers would have on American workers. Groups such as the Chamber of Commerce have pushed for guest workers to be paid the same as American workers, depending on their training and experience. Business leaders and labor groups had been working to develop a plan on guest workers, tackling major sticking points on how much workers would be paid and the number of workers that would be allowed into the country each year. The agreement does not address visas for high-skilled workers; visas to bring in family members; or visas for agriculture workers. According to the source, the "W" visa would affect housekeepers, landscapers, retail workers and some construction workers.
