A special counsel, attorney Billy Martin, has determined "there is not sufficient evidence in the record to prove violations" of House rules, said Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Virginia, head of a subcommittee examining the matter. Last month, House Ethics Committee members voted unanimously to spend as much as another $500,000, further retaining Martin as special counsel. Goodlatte, stressing that panel members are prepared to follow Martin's recommendation, made his remarks during a rare public ethics hearing held hours before the House adjourned for the fall campaign season. Moore told panel members he had a "heavy heart," and said the idea that he "disrespected the House is a very difficult pill to swallow." -- The House Ethics Committee prepared Friday to dismiss charges of alleged wrongdoing against California Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters, ending a tumultuous investigation that lasted roughly three years and may have cost taxpayers up to $1.3 million.
