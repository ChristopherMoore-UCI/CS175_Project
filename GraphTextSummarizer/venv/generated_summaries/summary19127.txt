The U.S. Embassy had a rehearsal for a terrorism incident in mid-July, spokeswoman Siv Alsen of Norway's Police Security Service said. The officer checked and found something suspicious in the car, Brussels police spokeswoman Ilse Van de Keere said. Police later said they saw wires coming from the car, but there was "nothing abnormal to report." Technicians are continuing to investigate the vehicle, and police are trying to determine who owns it and how it came to be parked near the embassy, they said. They "used fake bombs, and one of those bombs was not removed" from the vehicle it was attached to, sparking the July 31 alert, Alsen said. The building was "evacuated this afternoon as a precaution while Belgian authorities investigated a suspicious vehicle in the vicinity," the embassy said on Twitter.
