"We're also celebrating the generosity and commitment of our incredible Clinton Foundation family -- and that means you." Clinton highlighted a number of her foundation's initiatives, including Too Small To Fail, a project dedicated to childhood education; No Ceilings, aimed at women and girls achieving full participation around the world; and Job One, an initiative aimed at connecting the unemployed with prospective employers. The collective freak out you heard at 6:58 a.m. ET Tuesday morning was the cadre of Clinton followers reacting to an email from "Hillary Rodham Clinton" with the subject line "Announcement." With the addition of Clinton -- as well as her daughter Chelsea -- the foundation changed its named from the William J. Clinton Foundation to the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation. Since joining the effort, Hillary Clinton has also used the foundation as a vehicle to travel the country and deliver high profile speeches. The jump was seen as the foundation moving to up its endowment and put itself on better footing in case Hillary Clinton runs for president in 2016.
