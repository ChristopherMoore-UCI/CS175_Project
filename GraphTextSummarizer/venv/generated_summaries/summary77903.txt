"It's definitely a reminder of the danger of the sport that we all love," Skydive Superior instructor Mike Robinson told CNN affiliate KQDS. It happened as the two planes were flying close by as the skydivers prepared to jump in formation, Superior Fire Department Battalion Chief Vern Johnson told CNN. Fortunately, both planes were carrying skydivers -- meaning that for the 11 people aboard the two aircraft, the collision resulted in nothing more than minor injuries to two of them, firefighters reported. Another Superior Fire Department official, Battalion Chief Steve Edwards, said one other person also suffered minor injuries. Johnson said the pilot of the lead plane told firefighters that before the jump, he heard a loud bang and his windshield shattered.
