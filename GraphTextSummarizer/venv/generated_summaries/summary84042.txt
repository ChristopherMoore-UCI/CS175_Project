-- Insurgents launched attacks Thursday on a Provincial Reconstruction Team base and a military outpost in Afghanistan, Afghan and NATO officials said. Three insurgents took positions in a home near a PRT base in Kandahar, said the region's police chief, Salim Ahsas. There were no casualties among PRT or military personnel, Ahsas said. Lt. Col. Jimmie Cummings, spokesman for NATO's International Security Assistance Force, said the fighting in Kandahar was one of two incidents Thursday. The statement noted that U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has said civilians serving in Afghanistan will not be intimidated by such attacks.
