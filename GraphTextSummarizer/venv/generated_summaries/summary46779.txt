They have also been collected in a new book, "Brian Stonehouse, MBE, 1918-1998", by Frederic A Sharf and Michelle Tolini Finamore (Sharf, $24.95). "He told the story to his sister, but she isn't sure how the mistake occurred," says Philip Athill, managing director of the Abbot and Holder Ltd art dealer in London, who has collected Stonehouse's work. Eventually they were auctioned, and I recognized their rarity and purchased them." Since then, Athill has become increasingly fascinated with Stonehouse, becoming acquainted with his surviving family and several of his friends (including 83-year-old Afdera Franchetti). It was the golden age of fashion illustration." Tinker, tailor, artist, spy Stonehouse died of a heart attack in 1998, and his pictures have been brought together for the first time at Abbot and Holder Ltd, where they can be purchased. Haller persuaded Stonehouse to move to New York to join the large number of Second World War émigré illustrators who were shaping America's fashion trends.
