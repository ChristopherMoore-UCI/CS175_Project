Kate Winslet, who welcomed son Bear Blaze with husband Ned Rocknroll last December, has assured "Ellen's" Ellen DeGeneres that yes, there's a purpose for the kid's unique signature. Bear Blaze is the 38-year-old star's third child -- she had daughter Mia, 13, and son Joe, 10, with prior husbands Jim Threapleton and Sam Mendes, respectively -- and this time around she had baby names on the brain. When DeGeneres asked why Winslet's youngest son isn't taking his father's last name, she paused before responding with a laugh, "Why do you think, Ellen?" Instead, he'll be known as Bear Blaze Winslet. "Bear's second name is Blaze because my husband and I met in a house fire basically," the actress continued, referring to the fire that consumed billionaire Richard Branson's Caribbean home while she was staying there in 2011. " Bear Blaze may be uncommon, but Winslet didn't want to be creative with the infant's last name.
