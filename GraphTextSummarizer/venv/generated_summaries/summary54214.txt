But cigarette packs with fewer cigarettes could bolster willpower and help smokers quit. Now that most smokers are trying to quit or cut back, we should allow or require smaller packs. The average number of cigarettes smoked per day declined among daily smokers from almost 19.6 in 1993 to not quite 16.8 in 2004, according to the National Center for Health Statistics. Most smokers actually want fewer cigarettes. Moreover, cigarette prices are higher than ever because of increased federal, state and even city excise taxes -- perhaps making friends and family less likely to share and teens even less likely to buy.
