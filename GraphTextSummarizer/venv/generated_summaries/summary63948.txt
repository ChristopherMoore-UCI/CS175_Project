Built on the Drupal content management system by the campaign's own tech team, MyMitt lets supporters make donations, create their own fundraising pages to rally their friends around, purchase official campaign gear or volunteer by making calls from home on behalf of the campaign. Two million people eventually joined, and 35,000 generated more than $70 million in campaign contributions from their own personal networks. When I suggest that this kind of user-centric toolkit isn't standard operating procedure -- the Rick Perry campaign offers only a personal fundraising page, for example, and Michelle Bachmann makes volunteers fill out an online form and wait to be contacted -- Moffatt demurs. Moffatt, whose firm Targeted Victory rose to prominence running online operations for Republican candidates like Marco Rubio in 2010, is reticent to provide many details about the Romney campaign's plans for MyMitt. While Obama's re-election campaign brags about getting its millionth individual donor, basks in its 23 million-strong Facebook following and spends millions on building a sophisticated online campaign operation, it might be tempting to write off the Republican presidential candidates as hopelessly behind in the chase for support on the Web.
