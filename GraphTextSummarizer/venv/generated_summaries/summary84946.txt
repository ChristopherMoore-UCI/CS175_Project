The Wallow fire, raging in eastern Arizona and western New Mexico, has grown into the largest fire ever battled in Arizona, according to fire officials. Other homes were damaged or destroyed in Nutrioso, but Hollender did not know the number. KNXV reported Tuesday night that fire investigators suspect that the blaze was started by a campfire. Besides Wallow, the largest of the fires is the Horseshoe Two fire in southern Arizona, which started May 8. -- After 13 days of staying in campers, in trailers or with out-of-town relatives to escape a raging wildfire, the 200-plus residents of Nutrioso, Arizona, were allowed to go home Wednesday.
