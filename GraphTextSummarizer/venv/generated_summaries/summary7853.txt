Given the death toll, it is tempting to seek easy answers or adopt quick options, including perhaps withdrawing Kenyan troops from Somalia or scaling back Kenya's role in regional security matters. These are Kenya's thinking on security, its state of preparedness, state responsiveness and the regional security dimensions. Kenya has borrowed extensively from the United States and relied on Uganda to mount a counter-terror programme in which security is thought of in military and defense terms. Kenya needs to bring its citizens together to recognize security threats, to mobilize them into a common security consciousness and surveillance system that they trust and have confidence in. Kenya needs to think beyond defense or purely military approaches, to ensure coherent and better use of security apparatus, and to mobilize society around a unifying security consciousness.
