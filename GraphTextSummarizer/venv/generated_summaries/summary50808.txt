The MEK moved to Camp Hurriya last year from its longtime home at Camp Ashraf in Diyala province, a temporary measure before members are resettled in third countries. Saturday's incident is the camp's third rocket attack since February 9, when eight residents were killed and 100 wounded, according to Shahin Gobadi, a spokesman for the National Council of Resistance of Iran. "We've also called on the government of Iraq to investigate this attack and bring the terrorists responsible to justice," Secretary of State John Kerry said in a statement released Saturday. -- A camp housing a group of Iranian dissidents in Iraq was attacked Saturday, leaving at least two people dead and 27 wounded, a spokesman for the group said. The rocket attack occurred on the outskirts of Baghdad at Camp Hurriya, a former U.S. base known as Camp Liberty, now the home of the Iranian exile group Mujahedin-e-Khalq.
