News Corp. executives need to focus not on taking over BSkyB, "but on clearing up the mess and getting their house in order," Cameron said. Murdoch's News Corp. also encompasses Fox News, The Wall Street Journal, the New York Post and Harper Collins publishers. Miliband hammered Cameron for having hired a former top News International journalist to be his communications director after the editor left his newspaper, News of the World, in the wake of one of its journalists going to prison over phone hacking. But, he said, staff at News International, a subsidiary of News Corp., took freedom of the press as a license for abuse and then "cynically manipulated our support of that vital freedom as their justification and then callously used the defense of a free press as the banner under which they marched in step, I say, with members of the criminal underworld. Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown, whose family's private records are alleged to have been obtained by News International newspapers, said it was vital to maintain the right to a free press and the public's right to information.
