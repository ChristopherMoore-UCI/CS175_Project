After presidential candidate Mitt Romney threatened to cut funding for public broadcasting during a debate with President Obama in 2012 -- even though Romney said he loves Big Bird -- jokesters set up parody accounts such as  @BigBirdRomney. Don't tell the kids but actor Caroll Spinney, age 81, has played Big Bird and Oscar the Grouch in more than 4,000 episodes of "Sesame Street" since the show's inception in 1969. Big Bird's third tweet reached out to his buddy Cookie Monster, who was tweeting about the blue creature's visit to New York's Museum of Modern Art. "Tweet?" With just one word, the yellow-feathered star of "Sesame Street" on Friday joined the ranks of famous Twitterers. It's not first time Big Bird has been in the Twitter spotlight.
