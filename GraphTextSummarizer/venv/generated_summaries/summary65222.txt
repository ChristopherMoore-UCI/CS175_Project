Amid growing unrest in Panama, then-U.S. President Bush ordered the invasion of Panama in December 1989, saying Noriega's rule posed a threat to U.S. lives and property. Earlier, Noriega arrived at the Tocumen International Airport in Panama City, where security was tight. Noriega fled his offices and tried to seek sanctuary in the Vatican Embassy in Panama City. Last month, a French court authorized his extradition to Panama, where officials want Noriega to face justice in the killings of Hugo Spadafora, his political opponent, and at least one other person. Noriega inspires very big emotions, and Noriega's life could very well be at risk in Panama," Henriquez said.
