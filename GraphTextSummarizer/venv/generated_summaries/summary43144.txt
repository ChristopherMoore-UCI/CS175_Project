But shifting Afghanistan from a military engagement to a political one would, by design, extend U.S. operations there. The burning of the Qurans -- which the U.S. claims was accidental -- was a fresh outrage to many Afghans. The game has already changed, and many Afghans are not surprised when the U.S. kills a bunch of civilians. The shocking murder last weekend of 16 Afghan civilians -- 9 of them children -- by a U.S. soldier is raising many questions about the war. While the Taliban often claims the U.S. disrespects Islam and wants to destroy it, few Afghans had any real reason to believe that in their daily lives.
