Petty Officer Jon Moore spotted the bottle Thursday during a beach clean up project near the Navy's Pacific Missile Range Facility on the island of Kauai. There was also a picture of Arikawa's class from Kagoshima, a city in Japan's southern island of Kyushu. Even though he was born in Guyana, South America, he said Japan feels like home because his wife and son live there. Inside the bottle were four origami flowers and a letter signed by student Saki Arikawa. Moore said he immediately thought of home.
