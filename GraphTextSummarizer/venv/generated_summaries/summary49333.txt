-- Four people were killed Thursday afternoon and two others were injured in a gun and knife attack at a Native American tribal office in Alturas, California, police chief Ken Barnes said. A person at the meeting ran out of the building covered in blood and went to the Alturas police station to alert officers, Barnes said. Sherrie Rhoades, 44, was attending a tribal eviction meeting at the Cedarville Rancheria tribal office Thursday around 3:30 p.m. when she opened fire, Barnes said. When Rhoades ran out of ammunition she grabbed a butcher knife from the kitchen and attacked another person, stabbing them, Barnes said. Rhoades, a former tribal leader, was at the hearing because she was facing eviction, police said.
