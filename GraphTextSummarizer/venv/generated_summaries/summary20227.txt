Truck drivers had defied a government order Wednesday to halt what they had said would be a five-day strike. -- A strike by Italian truck drivers that has caused shortages of food, fuel and medicine across the country has ended -- at least for now. British driver Brian Briggs, stuck since Tuesday, needed to deliver art to northern Italy and then head back to London. "We can report that in the coming hours the country can return to complete normalcy," Enrico Letta, undersecretary for Prime Minister Romano Prodi, said in announcing the end of the strike. Trucks carrying fuel and medicines for hospitals and pharmacies have been let through, but pharmacists warned there could be shortages of medicine in the long run.
