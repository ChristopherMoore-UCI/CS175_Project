So it was only natural for many to wonder whether Smith's previous box-office dominance would waver at all when "Men in Black 3" hit theaters last weekend. "Men in Black" ($51.1 million) and 2002â€²s "Men in Black II" ($52.1 million), "Men in Black 3" actually sold far fewer tickets. Even if Smith had continued acting these past three years, it would probably be unreasonable to expect "Men in Black 3" to perform significantly better than it did. In that light, "Men in Black 3's" $54.6 million debut isn't so disheartening. If you adjust for ticket-price inflation, then "Men in Black" and "Men in Black II" opened to $88.2 million and $71.2 million, respectively.
