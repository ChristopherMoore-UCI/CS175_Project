-- Children are bearing the brunt of the conflict in Gaza as the Israeli offensive to flush out Hamas fighters leaves youngsters battling indelible trauma while threatening the lives of newborns and their mothers, a senior aid official says. Children are particularly vulnerable in Gaza because families are trapped in the conflict areas. Ann Veneman, executive director of the United Nations' children body UNICEF, says too little is being done to protect Gaza's children, who account for half the territory's population, from the horrors of the latest conflict. Because they cannot escape the constant violence, Veneman says, most Gaza kids are severely traumatized. Newborns and pregnant women in Gaza also are a concern, UNICEF says.
