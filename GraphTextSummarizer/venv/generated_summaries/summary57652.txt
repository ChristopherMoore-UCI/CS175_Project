But it would mean a change in priorities at Justice and the FCC in which the agencies use their legal leverage to minimize concentration in regional wireless markets without undermining the potential for more efficient use of spectrum. But the politics of spectrum allocation remain gridlocked, as competing interests push and shove for preferred access, or just a claim on some of the cash from future spectrum auctions. If this were 1951 instead of 2011, when self-satisfied American megacompanies like GM set the pace for global industrial innovation, we'd have more sympathy for the government's tilt against market concentration. The third option, and probably the best under the circumstances, is to look on the Verizon and AT&T gambits with sympathy, on the premise that the vitality of innovation means more to consumers than the potential downside of greater market concentration. But the deals do have one big thing in common: In both, the primary objective is to cope with the looming scarcity of spectrum.
