New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito announced Wednesday that the city will move to name two streets in honor of the fallen officers, Detectives Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos. The blocks where the officers lived will bear their names -- a stretch of Ridgewood Avenue for Ramos and of West 6th Street for Liu, the statement said. Liu and Ramos were shot in their patrol car in Brooklyn on December 20. The NYPD posthumously promoted Liu and Ramos to the rank of detective. -- The two New York police officers shot to death earlier this month in Brooklyn are set to be immortalized in the streets of the city that they swore to protect.
