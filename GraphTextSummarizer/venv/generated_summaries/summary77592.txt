In short, European Muslims are at risk of being driven away from mainstream European societies. The horrific twin attacks in Paris last week have sent shockwaves throughout Europe. Fortress Europe will become even more of a reality. This combination of a considerable portion of Europeans that are skeptical of, if not outright hostile to, Muslims and migrants, and the ever more aggressive rhetoric of the populist far-right puts a massive pressure on Europe's politics and societies alike. Although in their overwhelming majority, they are integrated and identify with Europe, blanket suspicion against Islam, resentments in day-to-day life, and assaults on their community are bound to increase and deepen fear and alienation among Muslims.
