Soon afterward, the head of the public security bureau in Luoyang apologized for the police failure to uncover the dungeon sooner and said they were taking new steps to clamp down on vice, according to a Xinhua report at the time. A court in Luoyang city convicted Li Hao on charges of murder, rape, organized prostitution, illegal detention and selling pornography, state-run Xinhua said. The 35-year-old dug the dungeon in the basement of a residential compound he bought in 2009, the court heard, according to Xinhua. Three of the women were also found guilty of murder over the killings of two of their fellow captives, Xinhua reported. Li repeatedly raped the women, forced them to appear in pornographic web shows from March to April 2011 and made them have sex with customers for a brief period last year, the court heard.
