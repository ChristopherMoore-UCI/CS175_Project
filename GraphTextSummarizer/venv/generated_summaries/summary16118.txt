-- Two U.S. citizens from Seattle and Los Angeles -- described as "would-be terrorists" by the FBI -- have been arrested and charged with plotting to kill Americans enlisting in the armed forces in Seattle, federal officials announced Thursday. The two suspects appeared in federal court in Seattle late Thursday, where they heard the changes against them. The men were identified as Abu Khalid Abdul-Latif, (also known as Joseph Anthony Davis), 33, of Seattle; and Walli Mujahidh, (also known as Frederick Domingue Jr.) 32, of Los Angeles. According to a source working with federal agents, Abdul-Latif said the original plan to attack Fort Lewis "would be in retaliation for alleged crimes committed by United States soldiers in Afghanistan," a court document said. Agents began monitoring Abdul-Latif and Mujahidh in the past month and collected audio and videotapes of the pair discussing a violent assault on the Military Entrance Processing Station in Seattle.
