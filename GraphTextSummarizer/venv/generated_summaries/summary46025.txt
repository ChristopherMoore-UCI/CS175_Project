Sony's PlayStation and Microsoft's Xbox Live gaming networks experienced widespread problems on Christmas Day as a hacker group claimed responsibility for what it said was an attack. The problem persisted for hours, but Thursday night Xbox Live briefly posted a message on its support website saying: "Were you having a hard time signing in to Xbox Live? The hacker group Lizard Squad said earlier it was "smacking" the two systems, apparently one of several attacks in December. Sony was the victim of a massive cyberattack in late November that was widely believed to be motivated, at least in part, by North Korea's anger over "The Interview," which depicts the assassination of Kim Jong Un. Gamers were able to play games offline, but couldn't communicate with other players or make use of network functions.
