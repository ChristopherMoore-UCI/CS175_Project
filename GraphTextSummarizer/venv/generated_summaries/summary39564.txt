"We know from Dr. Black that he took a picture of something he shouldn't have and that it was stupid," said Rein, who did not know what Black photographed, where or when. Rein said that U.S. Embassy officials are working to get Black a phone card, and that his family is trying to hire a local attorney and raise money for his defense. A former architect, Black often takes photos of buildings, according to Rein. Robert Alan Black is being held in Abu Dhuabi's Al Wathba prison, said Rosemary Rein, the family spokeswoman, one of Black's longtime friends and a fellow speaker at the "Creative Thinkers" conference in the UAE capital. He has given presentations at more more than 150 creativity conferences on six continents since 1978, not to mention authoring more than 600 articles and the book, "Broken Crayons: Break Your Crayons and Draw Outside the Lines." Rein said that Black's next stop, after the Abu Dhabi conference, was supposed to be Malaysia.
