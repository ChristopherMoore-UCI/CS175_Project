Other parts of the missile defense would fire short-range missiles at incoming warheads that are close to hitting their targets. Another part of the missile defense protection -- ground-based midcourse defense -- is designed to strike at long-range missiles. Much of the missile defense program is still under development, including lasers fired from a plane that the military hopes would destroy an enemy missile during launch. A target missile was fired from Hawaii about 5:40 p.m. (11:40 p.m. ET) and was tracked by Navy ships hundreds of miles away. The United States successfully tested a sea-based component of its missile defense shield Thursday evening, intercepting a ballistic missile with a dummy warhead over the Pacific Ocean, the U.S. Missile Defense Agency said.
