A series of affidavits used by state investigators to obtain search warrants in their 2Â½-year investigation was unsealed last month, revealing many details, including an account of one witness who told investigators she saw Stern inject Smith with drugs. A hotel employee who saw Smith and Stern arrive told investigators she "wasn't her normal vivacious self," Santiago said. Other affidavits included a medical expert's conclusion that Smith, whose real name was Vickie Lynn Marshall, was given drugs in "excessive amounts" and a pharmacist who said he had refused to fill a prescription for a long list of strong narcotics. Howard K. Stern, Smith's lawyer and companion, and co-defendants Dr. Khristine Eroshevich and Dr. Sandeep Kapoor each entered not guilty pleas in Los Angeles County Superior Court in September. The lawyer for Stern, who faces 11 felony counts, said to prove a conspiracy, the prosecutor would have to show Stern knew it was illegal to use fake names to obtain narcotics for Smith, which he said was to protect her privacy.
