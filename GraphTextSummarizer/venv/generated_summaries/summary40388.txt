CNN affiliate WDIV is reporting that the judge was shot in front of his home and that Detroit police say they think it "happened during a robbery attempt, which likely had nothing to do with his profession." U.S. District Judge Terrence Berg is recovering from a gunshot wound after an apparent robbery attempt in Detroit. "Detroit police said two men approached Berg, a struggle ensued and a shot was fired, striking him in the leg. The two men, likely in their teens to early 20s, escaped the scene in a dark-colored Dodge Charger," according to WDIV reports. Berg also was an assistant U.S. attorney for over 20 years, specializing in fraud and technology crimes, according to his District Court biography.
