A number of South American nations have moved to allow same-sex civil unions in recent years. The country joined several of its South American neighbors in allowing the unions when President Michelle Bachelet enacted a new law on Monday. It also gives the couples greater rights in the realms of property, health care, pensions and inheritance. Civil unions between people of the same sex will soon be recognized in Chile. But marriage between people of the same sex is legal only in Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay.
