Federal prosecutors in a U.S. District Court in Detroit, Michigan, say Xiang Dong Yu -- a 49 year-old former product engineer at Ford -- used his company access to steal trade secrets. Yu admitted to copying 4,000 internal company documents -- including sensitive Ford design plans -- prior to his departure from Ford, according to a statement from the U.S. Attorney's office for Michigan's Eastern District. -- A former Ford Motor Co. employee pled guilty on Wednesday to two counts of theft of trade secrets, handing them over to a Chinese competitor. "We will vigilantly protect the intellectual property of our U.S. automakers, who invest millions of dollars and decades of time in research and development to compete in a global economy," U.S. Attorney Barbara L. McQuade said in the statement. Yu returned to the United States in October 2009, it said, where he was arrested by FBI agents who searched his computer and discovered 41 Ford design specification documents.
