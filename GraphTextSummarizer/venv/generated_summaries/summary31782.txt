"It will be profitable if there are enough people like me that don't like lugging business presentation materials, shopping bags, diaper bags, etc. around the city." While many people in the world would be overjoyed just to have public bathrooms, here we're socially conditioned to be a little worrisome of any place where another human being and his lunch burrito may have had their final intimate encounter. The point, here is that bathrooms gross me out, and people gross me out, and, though it's all completely irrational, this mild phobia is getting to the point where, for safety, I may have to consider wearing pants in public. The floors could be cleaner, and it had a slight odor of asparagus, but the loo at Grand Central is certainly passable considering thousands of people pass through each day, and some of them may have had shepherd's pie for lunch. On the main level of the terminal, I didn't immediately see any signs for public bathrooms.
