Variant CJD is different than what the CDC calls classic CJD, which is not related to mad cow disease. Variant CJD is a fatal brain disorder linked to eating beef from cattle with mad cow disease, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a press release. -- Mad cow disease has caused a fourth death in the United States, health officials say. CDC officials said this is only the fourth case to be reported in the United States, and that each U.S. infection is believed to have happened while the patient was traveling abroad. The first case of mad cow disease was confirmed in a cow in the United States in December 2003.
