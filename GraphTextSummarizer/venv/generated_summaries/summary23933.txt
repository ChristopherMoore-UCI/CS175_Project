"We try to empower these kids to live healthier lives through exercise, through good nutrition and understanding how picking up healthy habits from an early life is going to save them from a lot of health issues down the road." Beyond his duties with UNICEF, Gasol and his younger brother and fellow NBA player, Marc Gasol, created the Gasol Foundation. Gasol says everyone must decide what his mission in life will be. "I was also carrying that responsibility, and it made me focus even more and made me want to do better and score more points and have more people donating and helping all the people in the Philippines," Gasol says. The Gasol Foundation aims to empower children to lead healthier lives.
