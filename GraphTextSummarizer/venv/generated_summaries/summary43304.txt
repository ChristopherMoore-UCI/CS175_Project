-- England international defender Ashley Cole turned goal scorer as his late winner at Stamford Bridge Saturday gave Chelsea a 1-0 win over Stoke City to stay top of the English Premier League. Southampton earned their first points of the season with a 4-1 thrashing of Aston Villa at St Mary's. The striker was also subjected to a strong challenge late in the game from Chelsea defender David Luiz, which left the Brazilian lucky to escape a straight red card. Victor Anichebe and Kevin Mirallas put Everton 2-0 up by halftime and home hopes disappeared when substitute Nathan Dyer was sent off after the break. Sunday will see Liverpool face arch-rivals Manchester United, while champions Manchester City entertain Arsenal.
