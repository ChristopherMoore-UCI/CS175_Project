Part of what makes the conservative language of freedom so politically potent is that it resonates with a problem many Americans face. If you asked Sarah Palin, a Tea Partier, or a Republican member of Congress what freedom means, each would likely have a ready answer: Freedom is individual autonomy and it is closely identified with the market. But with Obama, most Americans simply would not know his answer. What they might note, though, is that even if this conservative response is incomplete, it at least articulates the lack of control many people experience and presents freedom as a product of individual self-rule. Some liberals find it difficult to understand why this vision resonates with so many of their fellow Americans, given that it ignores the pathologies of corporate power.
