Lunar New Year, also known as Spring Festival in China, is the country's biggest holiday and families have traditionally gathered around the TV set on New Year's Eve to watch CCTV 's "Spring Festival Eve Gala." -- Chinese rock star, Cui Jian, has declined to appear on the state broadcaster's annual Lunar New Year television extravaganza, his manager told CNN Wednesday. However, Mr. Cui Jian ultimately won't perform," his agent, You You, said in an email, without giving further details. For years, it was China's most watched variety show, raking in huge advertising revenues and catapulting artists to stardom. In the 1990s, authorities refused him permission to perform in big venues due to the political content of his lyrics, state newspaper Global Times reported on its website, although in recent years he has performed at some music festivals.
