According to Avakov, tanks crossed the border at a checkpoint controlled by pro-Russian separatists in the Luhansk region of eastern Ukraine. -- Three Russian tanks and other military vehicles crossed the border into Ukraine on Thursday, prompting a skirmish between Ukrainian and Russian forces, acting Ukrainian Interior Minister Arsen Avakov said. Also on Thursday, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko and Russian President Vladimir Putin "held a substantial and long phone conversation," the Ukrainian President's media office said, but it was unclear if that conversation occurred before or after the reported tank incursion. They say Ukrainian leaders have carried out a campaign of violence against people living in the largely pro-Russian east. Russian leaders say Ukraine has failed to move to implement a framework for peace worked out in Geneva, Switzerland, in April.
