The state agency will help cities move snow to snow farms or, in some cases, into rivers, spokesman Peter Judge told CNN. The superintendent cited the "frequency and intensity of recent storms, another potentially major storm brewing for Thursday and Friday, and the already high levels of snow on the roofs of schools" as factors. The National Weather Service is keeping close watch on a new storm that could bring between 3 and 6 additional inches of snow to the Boston area Thursday and Friday. "I'd welcome a 6-inch storm at this point," Boston Mayor Marty Walsh quipped. The murder trial of former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez has been pushed back to Wednesday, and the same goes for jury selection in the trial of Boston bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev.
