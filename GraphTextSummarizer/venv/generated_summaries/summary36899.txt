The defense wants records from the defendant's parents, George and Cindy Anthony; her former fianc√©, Jesse Grund; her brother, Lee Anthony; a friend, Amy Huizenga; and Roy Kronk, the meter reader who found Caylee's remains in December of last year. Casey Anthony is charged with first-degree murder in the slaying of her daughter Caylee, 2,  Trial is set for October. Meanwhile, Anthony's defense filed a motion on Friday with Orange County Circuit Court, seeking more phone records from a dozen people involved in the case. The motion says the release of these records could lead to admissible evidence in Anthony's trial, which is set to begin in October. In a dramatic reversal, the Florida state attorney's office announced Monday it will seek the death penalty against Casey Anthony, the 23-year-old woman charged in the death of her 2-year-old daughter Caylee.
