It was decorated with flower-shaped ornaments carved from carrots and sweet potatoes and topped off with a large number "1." Bao Bao, whose name means "precious" and is one of 42 surviving cubs born last year in human care, approached the ice cake with suspicion, but in no time licked it with apparent delight. After she turns 4, Bao Bao will go to China to enter the breeding program there for giant pandas. According to the zoo, Bao Bao was born after a precisely-timed artificial insemination performed by the panda team in Washington and scientists from the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda in Wolong, Sichuan Province. And when you're a giant panda cub -- such as Bao Bao, at the Smithsonian's National Zoo in Washington -- they are even bigger. The cake, made by the zoo's nutrition department, contained Bao Bao's favorite fruits, including apples and pears, packed in ice.
