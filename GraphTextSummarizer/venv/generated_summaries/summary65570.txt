He secured his third major -- following the U.S. Open in 2011 and U.S. PGA Championship in 2012 -- with a two-shot victory ahead of Sergio Garcia and Rickie Fowler. Rory also secured some cash off the back of a bet placed over the weekend, earning Â£20 ($34) off Darren Clarke after beating his compatriot during a practice round on Wednesday. He has been at his side for all three of Rory McIlroy's major wins, but Sunday's British Open triumph may well have been the sweetest yet for the Northern Irishman's father Gerry. Gerry, a regular at his son's tournaments, is a director of Rory McIlroy Inc -- a company created to run Rory's affairs following his split from the Horizon group. He embraced his son on the 18th green after he landed the 2011 U.S. Open on Father's Day, the first major triumph of his career.
