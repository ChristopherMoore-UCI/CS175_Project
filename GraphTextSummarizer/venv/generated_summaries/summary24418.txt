The top U.N. envoy to Iraq, Sergio Vieira de Mello, and 21 others were killed in an August 2003 bombing at U.N. headquarters in Baghdad. The draft resolution calls for the U.N. Assistance Mission for Iraq to help the government with the "safe, orderly and voluntary return of refugees and displaced persons, including coordinating and delivering humanitarian assistance in Iraq and coordinating with agencies providing assistance in states hosting Iraqi refugees. Damage is evident at U.N. headquarters in Baghdad in September 2003, a month after a deadly bombing. The resolution would expand the U.N. mandate in Iraq to include fostering "regional dialogue" on matters such as border security, energy and refugees. After a second bombing that year and attacks against humanitarian workers, then-U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan removed all U.N. international staff from Iraq.
