" Hills said she heard on a South Africa radio station that Carl Pistorius' Twitter account stated that Oscar Pistorius was going to speak to the media. "What happened has changed our lives irrevocably," said Arnold Pistorius, the athlete's uncle, referring to the events surrounding Steenkamp's death. On Friday, Oscar Pistorius was freed from jail on $112,000 bail eight days after the shooting death of his model girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp, 29. "We are acutely aware of the fact that this is only the beginning of a long road to prove that, as we know, Oscar never intended to harm Reeva, let alone cause her death," Arnold Pistorius said in a statement. "It is most unfortunate that during this sensitive time, someone would choose to hack into Oscar Pistorius older brother, Carl Pistorius' Twitter handle," Hills said in a statement.
