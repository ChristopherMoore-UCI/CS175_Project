In January 2007, after almost a year and a half in mental institutions, Richard Sonnen started a new life at Lewis-Clark State College in Lewiston, Idaho. Richard Sonnen spent 16 months in mental health institutions after plotting to kill his high school classmates. -- It was just 2Â½ years ago when Elaine Sonnen found out that her 16-year-old son, Richard, had been planning a Columbine-style attack at his high school. Both Richard and Elaine Sonnen spoke to CNN at the 45-acre family farm. Elaine Sonnen says that at age 6, Richard told her he wanted to kill her.
