-- Cynde Strand, CNN's Beijing camerawoman during the crisis, had spent night after night in Tiananmen Square, amidst a heap of trash, leaning on her ladder, her head over her camera, just waiting for something to happen. The Chinese had been deeply embarrassed by the demonstrators during the visit of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, they reasoned, and the students were still occupying Tiananmen Square, although their numbers had dwindled. Cynde Strand is now Director of Coverage at CNN International, based in Atlanta Daniela Deane was a chief sub-editor at the Reuters news agency in Hong Kong during the Tiananmen crisis And Strand had a feeling that whatever was going to happen was going to happen at night, when energy levels were low.
