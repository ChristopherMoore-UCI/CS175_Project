The endlessly written about stripper film, which is partially inspired by Channing Tatum's real-life stripper past, grossed a tremendous $39.2 million in its opening weekend from audiences which were 73% female. Down in tenth place, Disney's family drama "People Like Us" flopped almost as badly as last weekend's "Seeking a Friend for the End of the World." The film was independently financed for $7 million by Steven Soderbergh, Channing Tatum and Matthew McConaughey; Warner Brothers then paid $7 million to acquire "Magic Mike" from Soderbergh, with whom they often collaborate, and agreed to distribute. Still, "Magic Mike" shouldn't be viewed as anything but a huge winner -- especially for its star, Channing Tatum, whose banner year continues. For Warner Brothers, "Magic Mike" was already a winner on its opening day, when it grossed a jaw-dropping $19.4 million.
