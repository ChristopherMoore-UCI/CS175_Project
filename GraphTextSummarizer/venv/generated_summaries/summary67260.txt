The U.S. Attorney's Office in Arizona declined to file charges against the Maricopa County Sheriff's office after an investigation into claims of abuse of county credit cards, misuse of funds and other financial matters. The federal financial probe stems from a 2010 request from Maricopa County officials for help in investigating the claims of misuse of county funds. The feds found that the office was not properly documenting credit card transactions, but found no evidence of stealing county funds. -- Federal investigators have cleared controversial Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio's office of criminal wrongdoing regarding allegations of financial improprieties. Federal authorities acted as "special deputy county attorneys" tasked with finding possible state charges.
