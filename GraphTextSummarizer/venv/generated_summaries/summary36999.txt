Five-times winner Roger Federer will face Novak Djokovic of Serbia in the other semifinals after the Swiss second seed battled high winds to beat fifth seed Robin Soderling in a repeat of their 2009 quarterfinal 6-4, 6-4, 7-5. -- Top seed Rafael Nadal made short work of fellow Spaniard Fernando Verdasco on Thursday to advance to the semifinals of the U.S. Open with a 7-5, 6-3, 6-4 win. Monfils, meanwhile, was playing in his third grand slam quarterfinal after becoming the first Frenchman into the last eight at this event since Arnaud Clement in 2000. " Federer's victory reaffirmed his dominance in the tournament; the five-time champion has not dropped a set in New York, and remains on course for a record-breaking sixth U.S. Open crown. Nadal started slowly on a cold and windy evening in New York and dropped his serve for the first time in the tournament early in the first set.
