A woman accused of cutting in line at a Wal-Mart, shoving merchandise and assaulting police officers will plead guilty to disturbing the peace and resisting arrest, both misdemeanors. The prosecution has also alleged the Ellis went "ballistic in a profane tirade" that continued when police officers arrived. Witnesses and police say Ellis cut in front of customers at a Wal-Mart in January 2007, pushed aside merchandise belonging to another customer to make room for hers on the conveyor belt and, after police were called to the scene, kicked one officer in the shin and split another's lip. She was initially charged with assaulting police officers, resisting arrest and disturbing the peace. It appeared to show Ellis kicking backward at police, as authorities allege.
