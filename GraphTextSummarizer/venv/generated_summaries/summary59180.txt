If you are one of the few who haven't seen South Korean rapper Psy's performance of "Gangnam Style" on YouTube (which, until I wrote these words, included me), you're missing not only a piece of power pop, but -- some hope -- a harbinger of things to come for Asian music artists. But the force of YouTube and digital downloads is dismantling the old business model for music companies, and Asian artists like Psy are benefiting, analysts say. But Psy's success was softened by the growing global popularity of Korean pop music, or K-pop. As CNN's Madison Park writes, Psy's song -- about the wannabe style of the affluent neighborhood of Gangnam in Seoul -- has been sliced and diced with theories about what it means about wealth and class in Korea, and questions about whether Psy embodies the stereotypes about Asian masculinity. "The positive sentiment from 'Gangnam Style' has attracted investors just because of the fact that the company is owned by Psy's father and uncle," Lee Sun-tae, a researcher at NH Investment and Securities, recently told Reuters.
