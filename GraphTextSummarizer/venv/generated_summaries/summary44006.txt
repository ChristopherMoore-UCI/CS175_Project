-- Winter-weary residents in the Great Plains are bracing for yet another blow this week, compliments of a system that spent Sunday pounding those in and around Denver with high winds and heavy snow. " Record-setting February Kansas City International Airport set a February 21 record of 9 inches of snow, 4 more inches than the amount that fell the same date in 2010. The snow socked the city's main airport, where more than 200 of 1,500 flights had been canceled and other travelers faced average delays of more than 4 hours on Sunday night, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. By Sunday night, the worst was over for much of Colorado, though not for points east, which are expected to be hammered to start the workweek. Last Thursday, for instance, a storm dumped up to 22 inches of snow on parts of Kansas.
