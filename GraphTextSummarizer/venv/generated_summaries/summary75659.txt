Under the lifetime ban, Sterling is prohibited from NBA games or practices, stepping foot inside any Clippers facility, taking part in business or personnel decisions or having a role in league activities such as attending NBA Board of Governors meetings. After dodging the media for days, the woman who recorded Clippers' owner Donald Sterling making racist remarks urged him to apologize. In the audio, Sterling tells Stiviano not to "promote" her relationship with black people or bring them to games after she posted a picture on social media with NBA legend Magic Johnson. "The best way to ensure the stability of the team during this difficult situation is to move quickly and install a CEO to oversee the Clippers organization," NBA Executive Vice President Mike Bass said in a statement. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver gave him a lifetime ban, ordered he pay a $2.5 million fine and said he'd push to "force a sale" of the Clippers.
