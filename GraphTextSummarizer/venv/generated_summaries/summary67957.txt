-- Lawyers representing Muslim Brotherhood members in a jailbreak case that includes former Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy called Saturday for the judges to be changed. Most of the leaders of the January 25, 2011, revolution that toppled longtime strongman Hosni Mubarak and led to Morsy's election the following year, especially Islamists, "have been thrown into prison with fictitious evidence," El-Damaty said. Morsy and other Brotherhood leaders were rounded up after the coup. " Morsy has been charged with inciting the killings of political opponents and organizing a 2011 jailbreak by members of his then-banned Muslim Brotherhood. That was a reference to Morsy's removal last year from the presidency and by Gen. Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.
