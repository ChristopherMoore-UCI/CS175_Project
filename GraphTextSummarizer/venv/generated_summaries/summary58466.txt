In regard to the charge of attempted murder of a police officer, Lakha said both defendants intended to make police feel threatened because they wanted to be shot. -- A London court heard closing arguments Wednesday in the trial of two men accused of the brutal daylight killing of British soldier Lee Rigby. The gun Adebowale aimed at police was not loaded; he knew that he would not be able to harm police, the lawyer said. He then played to the jury the CCTV footage of the moment the defendants were shot by police. The killing of Rigby outside the Woolwich Barracks in southeast London on May 22 shocked the nation.
