The U.S. State Department weighed in Friday, with spokeswoman Victoria Nuland noting Cuban citizens still need a valid U.S. visa or entry authorization to legally get into the United States, whatever Cuba's policy is. A story Friday in the state-run Granma newspaper criticized what it called the U.S. "hostile policy toward Cuba" that contributed to "brain drain," claiming many Cuban doctors and other professionals had emigrated at their home nation's expense. Illeana Sorolla, head of the University of Havana's Center for the Study of International Immigration, called out Washington's preference for "more skilled people," while Granma also said U.S. immigration policies favor activists or others who advocate change in Cuba. After weeks in which passport applications surged and just days before the new policy takes affect, Cuba this week "began to increase the information about the update announced last October," according to a story from the state-run Prensa Latina News Agency. This gives people a chance to obtain and keep longer better-paying jobs outside Cuba, where the average monthly income works out to about $20 U.S. Instead, they'd only need a valid passport and an entry visa for the country where they were headed.
