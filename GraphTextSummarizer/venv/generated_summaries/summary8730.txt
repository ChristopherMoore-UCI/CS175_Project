But then detectives questioned Nancy Garrido about other California children who went missing the same time that Phillip Garrido was living in northern California, Tapson said. Authorities have wanted to question Nancy Garrido because her husband has been a lead suspect in the case of 9-year-old Michaela Garecht, who disappeared in 1988 in Hayward, California. -- Phillip and Nancy Garrido pleaded not guilty Thursday to all 18 charges relating to the kidnapping and rape of a young California girl who was held captive from age 11 through 29, according to the El Dorado County Superior Court and an attorney. Nancy Garrido had pleaded "not guilty" last year, but she had to re-enter the same pleas Thursday because the indictment against her was amended, Tapson told CNN. Tapson said Nancy Garrido confessed that she was involved in the kidnapping but denies she had anything to do with the sex crimes.
