House Republicans have offered their alternative to avoiding the sequester, known as "Plan C." The plan would spare the Pentagon any pain, but it would slash investments that benefit the middle class, seniors, children and the poor -- from child lunches to cancer research to meals on wheels programs. That means a balanced approach of new revenues and sensible spending cuts that will keep our economy growing and protect American families. We should let Medicare negotiate drug prices, which would save as much as $200 billion over 10 years and lower drug costs for seniors. Our top priority should be strengthening the economy, and that includes preserving critical investments in things such as education, transportation and medical research that create jobs. There are many common sense ways to reduce our deficit and avert the sequester, which would hit defense and domestic programs with $1.2 trillion in indiscriminate cuts over 10 years.
