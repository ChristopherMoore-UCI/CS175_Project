-- On this week's Tech Check podcast, writers Doug Gross, Stephanie Golberg and Mark Millian discuss Google's recent announcement of a new privacy policy -- and the concerns some folks have voiced about it. Google says it's to enhance user experience (and better target ads) but some critics fear having all of that activity rounded up in one place. The policy spells out the fact that Google is assembling users' activity on all of its products -- from search to Gmail to phones running its Android system on smartphones. Our Reader Comments of the Week come from a story about Facebook Timeline. And our Tech Fail of the Week goes to a politician who flung around some statistics about Apple and Steve Jobs this week.
