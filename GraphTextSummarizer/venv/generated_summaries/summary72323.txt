With worries that preparations for the World Cup were running behind schedule, Marin said in the statement that it "made no sense" to stage the 2015 Copa America when Brazil has also to deliver the 2013 Confederations Cup and the 2016 Summer Olympics. Marin took over from Ricardo Teixeira at the helm of Brazilian football last week and has also taken his place on the FIFA 2014 World Cup organizing committee. -- Brazil wants to give up the rights to stage the 2015 Copa America to neighboring Chile, its football federation confirmed Monday. Brazil president Dilma Rousseff has recently given her government's pledge to assist in making sure that preparations for the 2014 World Cup run to time. A statement on the CBF (Brazil Football Confederation) website said a meeting between its new president Jose Maria Marin and his Chilean counterpart Sergio Jadue had agreed the change.
