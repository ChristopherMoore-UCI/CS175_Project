Soledad O'Brien and I had a long conversation about sentencing disparities among black and white criminals -- specifically, the disparity between sentencing for crack cocaine and powder cocaine. Despite efforts by the Supreme Court and the U.S. Sentencing Commission to increase flexibility in sentencing, the punishment for possession by a first-time offender of more than 5 grams of crack cocaine is a minimum 5-year prison sentence -- while possession of any amount of powder cocaine is a misdemeanor punishable by no more than a year in prison. (Left unanswered, of course, is why they who have also been targets of racism and economic hardship are not engaged in criminal behavior.) Whether it concerns sexual behavior, decisions concerning our education or how we conceive of civil behavior, when it comes to creating lives of purpose and fulfillment nothing will replace the individual accessing the wisdom that has been passed down from antiquity. Our representatives in Congress, particularly the Congressional Black Caucus, decided to take a tough stance and supported harsh sentencing guidelines for selling crack cocaine.
