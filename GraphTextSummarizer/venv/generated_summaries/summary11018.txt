The royal baby bump has arrived, and the world can finally see evidence of the progeny of Prince William and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, who we still like to think of as Kate Middleton. People magazine was so impressed with one of her recent outfits that it ran a story headlined "Kate's baby blue maternity dress - how to get the look." Cheers Kate! The world has been on watch since the couple announced their impending arrival last December. Well known for her fashion sense, the young duchess is now applying that to her pregnancy and stepping out in outfits that both flatter and show off the wee one.
