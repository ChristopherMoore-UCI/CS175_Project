And he proves that yet again in "Captain Phillips," his suspensefully spiky thriller based on a shattering incident from April 2009, when the crew of a U.S. cargo ship, the MV Maersk Alabama, was held hostage for several days by a band of Somali pirates armed with machine guns. As soon as they climb aboard, evading the spray of water hoses that are the crew's only ''weapons,'' we know we're seeing a clash of two cultures: the privileged Western world, with its power and bounty (all symbolized by the vastness of that ship), and the desperate quarters of the Third World, locked outside the loop of technological progress and hope. When the giant cargo liner rounds the Horn of Africa, Captain Phillips realizes he's in dangerous waters.
