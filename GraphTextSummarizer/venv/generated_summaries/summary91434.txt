Vettel's nearest rival Fernando Alonso, who drives for Ferrari, hasn't given up hope of clinching his third world championship going into this weekend's Korean Grand Prix. -- Sebastian Vettel has at times made his domination of Formula One look effortless, but the triple world champion insists his supremacy is the result of tireless work from his all-conquering Red Bull team. " Vettel's occupation of the podium has led to a backlash from some fans, with the former Toro Rosso driver consistently booed by fans during the season. And the Spaniard is urging his team to take heart from Oracle Team USA's incredible comeback recently against Emirates Team New Zealand in sailing's America's Cup. I think those who booed were Ferrari fans who obviously were disappointed that we again finished ahead of them.
