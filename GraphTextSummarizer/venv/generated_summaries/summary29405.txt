-- South Korea is breaking new ground Thursday on a resettlement facility for North Korean defectors, reflecting the increasing number of people escaping food shortages and harsh living conditions of the hermit state. With little outside influence since the Korean War in the 1950s, North Korean language is rigid and difficult for their Southern neighbors to understand. The new facility, the third such center, will cost the South Korean government $35 million and will be able to take up to 500 defectors for the mandatory three month training before being released to find their place in South Korean society. With a camera in every phone these days, officials worry photos of defectors could find their way back to North Korea and they say family members would be severely punished by the North Korean military. Counselors help defectors cope with the trauma of fleeing North Korea and in many cases the sense of guilt they feel at having left loved ones behind.
