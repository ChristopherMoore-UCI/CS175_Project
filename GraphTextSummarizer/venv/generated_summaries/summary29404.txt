CNN: Are some people more likely than others to get motion sickness? Gupta: People who have some sort of inner ear problem, we know that that can be an issue. [When I rode] with the Blue Angels, I was talking to some of the pilots ahead of time, because I know that I'm pretty prone to motion sickness. CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta says motion sickness is "paralyzing" and sometimes leaves him "incapacitated." So what part of that disconnect is most likely to make you feel motion sickness? Gupta: The inner ear is probably the biggest culprit, mainly because you literally have these bones in the inner ear and these fluid-filled canals that detect your motion, and they are constantly giving you feedback right to your brain stem about what your position in space is. Gupta: You know it's funny, I think that probably anybody could get motion sickness.
