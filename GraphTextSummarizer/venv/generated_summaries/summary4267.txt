Officers with the Metro Transit Police Department's anti-terror team fanned out in the subway system Wednesday with bomb-sniffing dogs and extra officers, according to Deputy Chief Mark Olson. Olson said anti-terror officers did not discover anything suspicious during patrols on Wednesday. -- Terrorism concerns surrounding the first anniversary of the death of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden prompted authorities to elevate visible security Wednesday on Washington's Metrorail system. "Law enforcement agencies from Boston to Washington are engaging in transit-related activities such as high visibility deployment to increase awareness," said Olson. We are mindful that, in the past, al Qaeda has shown an interest in anniversaries and significant dates," said Philip Stewart, a Washington Metropolitan Transit Authority spokesperson.
