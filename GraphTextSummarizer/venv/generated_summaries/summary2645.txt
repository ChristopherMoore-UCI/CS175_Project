Ominously, New Zealand bookmakers appear to have lost faith in their crew. At one stage Oracle Team USA were flat on the canvas facing the referee's count as they went 8-1 down in this year's competition against a dominant Emirates Team New Zealand. "Hard to know what to say: Team New Zealand 8, Oracle 8 at America's Cup in San Francisco. This could be worse than the public blood-letting post Rugby World Cup defeats," New Zealand sports broadcaster, Tony Veitch, posted on Facebook. "Looks like New Zealand is about to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory after losing another race this morning in the #AmericasCup," posted Australian television presenter Lisa Wilkinson.
