The University of Kansas sent an e-mail to students Monday warning those staying on campus for spring break. It was the second e-mail that campus officials have sent out in recent years regarding the rapes. Those similarities include "the age of the victims, the location of the rapes in off-campus housing" and "the fact they occurred during breaks in the school session." "It's scary to walk around campus or be on a college campus not knowing at night what goes on and who can be around," one student told CNN affiliate KTKA. "If staying in Lawrence, students should take reasonable precautions, as some reported sexual assaults and other crimes have occurred during breaks," read the warning, which did not refer specifically to the past rapes.
