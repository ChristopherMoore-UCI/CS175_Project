"In these economic times, we can't be so into church business that we forget what our business is, and that is to help people," Slough told CNN television affiliate KDAF in Dallas-Forth Worth, Texas. Church members are pleasantly surprised. Slough said he is not concerned if people try to take advantage of the church's generosity. -- The pastor of a non-denominational church in Argyle, Texas, passed around the collection plate to his congregants earlier this year -- and asked them to take money from it. It was a eureka moment for Slough: Give away money to those who need it, knowing his church members will help fill the need.
