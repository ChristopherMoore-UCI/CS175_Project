A privacy group, the Electronic Privacy Information Center, had sued the TSA claiming the machines violated Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches. Privacy advocates had worried the use of scanners could become mandatory, as they become more ubiquitous at airports. Rotenberg, meanwhile, called the court's decision important and said it "pins" down TSA to a policy in which body scans are optional. TSA plans to have more than 1,000 machines in use at airports nationwide by the end of this year. TSA officers operate more than 500 of the body imaging machines, which can see through clothes and reveal concealed objects, including bombs and bomb components.
