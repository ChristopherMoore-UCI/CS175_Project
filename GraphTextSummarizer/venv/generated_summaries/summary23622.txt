Kyron Horman, 7, vanished on June 4, and since then there has been intense scrutiny on Kyron's stepmother, Terri Horman. Kyron went missing after Terri Horman dropped him off at school on June 4. But they did say that they continue to feel that Terri Horman is not completely cooperating with police running the search for Kyron. KGW reported that sources believe Terri Horman approached the landscaper, who had been working on the family's property in northwest Portland, and offered the man "a large sum of money" to kill her husband, Kaine Horman. In the e-mail response, Kyron's family members said they hope people will focus more on the missing boy.
