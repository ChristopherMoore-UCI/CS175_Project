Unlike other social platforms, we've all pretty much agreed that Twitter is where you go to talk about TV shows while they're happening. Just log on during the Super Bowl, the Oscars, a presidential debate or any other big TV event and you'll see why CEO Dick Costolo said the site is saving live television. One social-media click, and you can spoil some of television's biggest moments for other people who may be enjoying the same shows at a more leisurely pace. On Facebook, throwing something like "SPOILER ALERT" or "GAME OF THRONES SPOILER" at the beginning of your post gives your friends at least a fighting chance to avert their eyes. (Spoilers in comments).
