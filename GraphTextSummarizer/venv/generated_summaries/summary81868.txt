The presidential and parliamentary polls are critical in the central African nation struggling to rebuild years after a conflict left millions dead and displaced entire regions. Analysts fear post-election violence could further destabilize the nation, which is battling unrest years after the 1998-2003 conflict that left 5 million dead as a result of  fighting, diseases and starvation. Last year, U.S. lawmakers passed legislation that requires American electronics companies to  submit annual reports outlining what they are doing to ensure  minerals bought from Congo are "conflict-free." Congo is not ready to conduct elections yet,  Moleka said. Despite Congo's vast resources including cobalt, gold, copper and tantalum, the fledgling democracy  is mired in poverty and conflict especially in its eastern region, prompting complex economic and political relations with its neighbors and the world.
