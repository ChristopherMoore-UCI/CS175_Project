-- Airports in Ireland prepared to close overnight Saturday as a drifting ash cloud from an erupting volcano in Iceland prompted the United Kingdom's air traffic authority to close airspace over parts of Northern Ireland. British ministers agreed Saturday that five-day ash-prediction charts -- the first of which will come out later Saturday -- would now be made available to airlines, other transport providers and the public on the Met Office website. Volcanic ash had forced the closing of Iceland's main airport Friday but it reopened at midnight and was operating normally on Saturday. The ash may force more airports to close again next week, the country's Department of Transport said Saturday. The problems began in mid-April, when the volcano beneath the Eyjafjallajokull glacier in southern Iceland erupted and sent a cloud of ash into the atmosphere, disrupting international travel for several days.
