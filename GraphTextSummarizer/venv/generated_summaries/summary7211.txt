-- Rapper DMX had another run-in with police in South Carolina this week, ending with a citation for marijuana possession. DMX has faced various criminal charges in the past, including probation violation, illegal drug possession and animal cruelty. " Anitra Rhodes, 39, was charged with improper lane change and simple possession of marijuana after three bags of suspected marijuana were found under the driver's seat, the police report said. DMX -- whose real name is Earl Simmons -- was a passenger in a Ford F-350 truck stopped by police for allegedly making an improper lane change Tuesday night, according to the police report. "At this point, Mr. Simmons became very aggressive with his words and was making multiple idle threats," the police report said.
