The home of William Petit, his wife, Hawke-Petit, and two daughters was invaded in the middle of the night by Hayes and co-defendant Joshua Komisarjevsky, prosecutors say. "What is known is that Steven Hayes kills and assaults Mrs. Petit. ... Hayes also reportedly wondered out loud whether Petit might have been in cahoots with his co-defendant, Komisarjevsky, because Petit had escaped. " Connecticut State Police Detective Anthony Buglione, who interviewed Hayes after the crime, has testified the duo beat Petit bloody and left him in the basement. Hayes is accused of taking Hawke-Petit to the bank while Komisarjevsky allegedly stayed behind.
