-- Racial profiling "should be a hate crime investigated by the FBI," filmmaker Tyler Perry wrote in a Facebook posting Sunday in which he described his own tense encounter with police. Perry posed a question to his readers: "Do you see how quickly this could have turned for the worse?" "Now I know that there are many great officers, patrolmen and security guys out there," wrote Perry, who employs a small army of his own security officers to guard his movie studio. "As I grabbed it they both tensed up and I dropped it as I heard my mother's voice from when I was a little boy." "If you get stopped by the police, especially if they are white policemen, you say 'yes sir' and 'no sir', and if they want to take you in, you go with them," Perry said his mother often told him. Perry wrote that he has been "screaming at the top of my lungs" about the disappearances of Terrance Williams and Felipe Santos. I didn't feel safe at all." Perry, one of America's most successful film and television producers, said "although we have made significant strides with racial profiling in this country, the world needs to know that we are still being racially profiled.
