U.S. officials have said in recent weeks that it is not essential to keep Kobani from falling into ISIS hands. U.S. fighter jets also flew at least 14 missions against ISIS targets near Kobani on Wednesday and Thursday, striking buildings, command posts, sniper positions and a staging location, according to Centcom. Austin said Friday that the increased number of airstrikes near Kobani aren't due to a change in attitudes, but rather the presence of so many ISIS targets as the group fights Syrian Kurdish fighters for control of the city. The intelligence sharing between U.S. and Syrian Kurds in Kobani signifies an unprecedented level of U.S. military cooperation with operatives on the ground inside Syria. CNN has learned that the U.S. military for the first time is getting intelligence from Syrian Kurds about ISIS positions in and around Kobani, according to an administration official who confirmed the details, but declined to be identified due to the sensitive nature of the information.
