Most Muslims in Europe, the United States and even in parts of the Islamic world view the presence of Islam in the West  as a chance to overcome such polarization. Prohibiting mosques doesn't advance these society-saving debates, and can't reshape our imaginations so that we can one day imagine Islam and Muslims as fellow citizens. Those people who were already suspicious of  Islam can justify their hostility because, instead of a religion, Islam is considered an ideology emanating from Iraq, Afghanistan, Somalia, Turkey and the rest of the Muslim world to threaten the West. This suggests that opposition to mosques is not driven only by sensitivity to the memory of terrorism victims, but also by a growing unease toward Islam, fueled by security fears. Politicians, pundits and ordinary Americans see Islam -- not political groups using Islamic rhetoric --  as an existential threat to Western secular norms.
