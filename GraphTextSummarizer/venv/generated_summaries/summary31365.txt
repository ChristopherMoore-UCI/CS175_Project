-- Manchester United's new manager David Moyes started the new English Premier League campaign with a resounding 4-1 win away to Swansea City on Saturday. Tottenham Hotspur are also in action, traveling to south-east London to take on Premier League new boys Crystal Palace. The Uruguayan's future at the club remains in doubt with Suarez agitating for a move away from the club he joined in January 2011 so he can play Champions League football. Danny Welbeck doubled the lead two minutes later, tapping the ball home from an Antonio Valencia cross. Unsettled striker Wayne Rooney received a mixed reception when he came on as a second-half substitute and had to play second fiddle to van Persie yet again. Liverpool kicked off the new season with a 1-0 win against Stoke City at Anfield.
