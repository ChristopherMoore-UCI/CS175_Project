If celebrities didn't take and store nude photos of themselves on their phones or on computers, they wouldn't be stolen and published online. Last week, hackers allegedly stole nude photos from actress Scarlett Johansson and then plastered them all over the Internet. Who is behind the recent string of stolen celebrity photos -- and how exactly they got them -- remains unclear. The real issue here, the researchers said, is the prevalence, and accessibility of, nude photos. When nude photos of the New York congressman surfaced on Twitter, "he initially blamed a hacker," Cluley said.
