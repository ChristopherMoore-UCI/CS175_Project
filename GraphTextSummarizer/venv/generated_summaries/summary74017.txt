Things haven't gone much better under new coach Laurent Blanc, with the French losing their opening 2012 European Championship qualifier to Belarus in Paris before steadying the ship with a 2-0 win over Bosnia Herzegovina. Anelka's team-mates then went on strike in protest at his expulsion, resulting in bans for the Chelsea striker, captain Patrice Evra, star winger Franck Ribery and midfielder Jeremy Toulalan. Les Bleus, world champions in 1998 and finalists in 2006, were knocked out in the group stage in South Africa without winning a game after a campaign overshadowed by infighting, which led to Nicolas Anelka being sent home following a spat with coach Raymond Domenech. England have gone up to sixth after impressive wins over Bulgaria and Switzerland in their first two Euro 2012 qualifiers. Germany are third after moving ahead of five-time World Cup winners Brazil and Argentina are fifth.
