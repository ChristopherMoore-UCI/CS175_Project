He and several other members of his family, including his father and fellow former CEO August Busch III, took home tens of millions of dollars from the move, said MacIntosh. August Busch IV is the only representative of the family -- and its former namesake company -- on the Anheuser-Busch InBev board of directors. "It was a very difficult time, when August Busch IV took over," said Julie MacIntosh, author of the book "Dethroning the King," which focuses on the last decade of Anheuser-Busch. In the About Me section of her page, she writes that she had been in beauty pageants for years and "would really like to do beer advertising." Busch, 46, became chief executive officer of Anheuser-Busch in December 2006, after years of working in the company's brewing, operations and marketing divisions. That also largely ended the Busch family's long legacy in brewing, namely heading the legendary eastern Missouri institution known for its Budweiser and other brands.
