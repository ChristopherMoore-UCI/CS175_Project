But after listening to Barton apologize this morning to BP officials for having to set aside $20 billion in an escrow fund to assist the victims of the biggest oil disaster in American history, I am ashamed that this poor excuse of an elected official has disgraced his Texas congressional district. These are launched against those of us who hold Texas A&M University (aka the "Aggies") near and dear, usually by fans of our arch-rival, the University of Texas. Anyone who has read or listened to me knows that I am proud of my native Texas, and especially my alma mater, Texas A&M University. Either you are on the side of BP or the American people, especially those in the Gulf. All of his because of the explosion on BP's oil platform 60 days ago that killed 11 people and continues to cause irreparable harm to the environment.
