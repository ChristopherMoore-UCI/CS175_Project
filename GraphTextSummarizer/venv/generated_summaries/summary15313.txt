The unrivaled camera capabilities of Nokia's 808 PureView, which runs the company's Symbian operating system, caused ripples of surprise among Congress delegates who predicted few surprises thanks to pre-event leaks and rumors. Other hot gadget announcements include phones by Taiwanese manufacturer HTC. -- Mobile phone giant Nokia on Monday unveiled a phone with a powerful 41 Megapixel camera as it attempts to reposition itself back at the forefront of the mobile market. Reportedly priced at â‚¬450 ($600), the device is due to be released in May, with the camera technology likely to be carried over to other Nokia phones. The 41 Megapixels put the phone in the same league -- in terms of photo resolution -- as professional cameras costing thousands of dollars.
