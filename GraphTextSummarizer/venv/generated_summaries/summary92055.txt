He was due to travel to Europe this week to speak to German, Dutch and British parliamentarians about his personal experience with drone strikes, according to Reprieve, a UK-based charity that provides legal support to prisoners unable to pay for it themselves. Khan was one of the first people to raise awareness about drone strikes, said Noor Behram, a journalist based in North Waziristan. Kareem Khan was seized from his home in Rawalpindi on the night of February 5th, according to attorney Shazad Akbar. He was picked up by 20 men, some of them dressed in police uniforms, Akbar said. Khan was also involved in legal proceedings against the Pakistani government concerning its failure to investigate the deaths of his son and brother in a drone strike, the charity said on its website.
