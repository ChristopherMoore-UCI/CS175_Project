While Hong Kong has strong sentences for drug trafficking, there is no capital punishment for offenders unlike in mainland China, making the city a favored transit post for drug traffickers, experts say. On the stand for drug trafficking, Talina Prieto Vazquez tearfully insisted she didn't know that when her husband brought her to Hong Kong she would be taking part in one of the city's largest ever cocaine trafficking cases. The drug case highlighted the role Hong Kong plays as a staging post in a booming trade between Latin American drug producers and a growing illegal drug market in mainland China. She was among a group of five Mexicans and one American - including her husband JosuÃ© Mario Bravo Galindo - that police arrested in Tuen Mun, northern Hong Kong, in September, 2011. Authorities arrested her walking out of a warehouse in northern Hong Kong where hundreds of kilos of cocaine were found and six kilos of the drug were in her purse.
