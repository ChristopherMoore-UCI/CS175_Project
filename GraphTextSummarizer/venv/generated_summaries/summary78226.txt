Two other suspects arrested last Tuesday, siblings Daniel Mathis and Mersadies Shelton, are held each on charges of felony grand theft for allegedly stealing Quick's vehicle, a 1999 Toyota 4Runner. Virginia prosecutors said Monday they will not pursue murder charges against three people in connection with the death of Kevin Quick, an auxiliary police officer. Auxiliary officers aren't paid but hold ranks, have badges and carry firearms like full-time officers. Leslie Hope Casterlow, 49; Anthony Darnell Stokes Jr., 31; and Halisi Uhuru still face felony gang participation charges, Goochland County Commonwealth's Attorney Claiborne Stokes' office said. Quick, 45, was an auxiliary police captain and resident of Waynesboro, a small town west of Charlottesville.
