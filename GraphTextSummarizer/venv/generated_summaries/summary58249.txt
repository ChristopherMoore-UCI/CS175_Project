When I can, I prefer to fly during the day so that I can take photos from the window seat of the aircraft wing, winglets or engines during sunsets complete with the Moon or with cities down below. The first time, I allow myself to throw everything in I'd ideally like to take in case of any change in weather or impromptu dinners or downtime (my tennis racket unfortunately never makes the cut). If I'm staying at a one or two-star hotel I'll pack little bottles of shampoo and conditioner that I've collected from a nicer hotel from previous trips! - My yellow headphones -- always more comfortable wearing your own than airline headsets and music is a great escape for little windows of downtime. I'm currently reading What Makes Business Rocks by Bill Roedy.
