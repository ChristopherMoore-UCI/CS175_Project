-- Federal prosecutors are seeking the forfeiture of Bernard Madoff's four homes and other assets after Madoff's guilty plea to masterminding a massive investment fraud. The targeted assets include:  • A Manhattan condominium valued at $7 million on East 64th Street, where Madoff was under house arrest for three months before his guilty plea. Convicted investment swindler Bernard Madoff is shown in his federal mug shot. • $17 million deposited at Wachovia Bank, $45 million in securities held at COHMAD Securities and Madoff's interest in COHMAD Securities. That should not prevent the government from seizing them, said former federal prosecutor Bradley Simon of Simon & Partners.
