-- Singapore's ruling party was returned to power in general elections Saturday, despite the strongest challenge to date from the opposition. Many voters said they were worried about the relatively high cost of living and the rise of low-wage immigrant workers. Singapore is a prosperous nation but it remains an authoritarian nation with curbs on freedom of expression, assembly and association. Political activities are tightly controlled by the government, according to human rights monitoring groups. Saturday's voting in general elections were to determine 82 seats of the incoming parliament; five seats were already decided as that slate ran unopposed in one district.
