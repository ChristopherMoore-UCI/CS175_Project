An attempted military coup took place in the remote and mountainous nation of Lesotho on Saturday, Prime Minister Thomas Thabane said in an interview aired by South African broadcaster eNCA. " Kamalesh Sharma, secretary-general of the Commonwealth of Nations, condemned the reported coup attempt and urged the military in Lesotho to respect civilian authority, constitutional order and the rule of law. Lesotho is known for its "herd boys," children as young as 5 who tend flocks of cattle in remote locations and often miss out on education. The Lesotho government is seeking the assistance of the South African government and other neighboring states, Thabane said. "Democracy and the rule of law are central tenets of our association ... and any action to subvert constitutional civilian rule is unacceptable."
