-- I have for some time been collecting the phrases that patients use to complain about us doctors, and it is amazing how often you hear, "(S)he never touched me!" TED.com: Aubrey de Grey on how we can avoid aging Though we can debate the merits of the two methods (and I think it is not much of a debate), it is clear that patients prefer the former method. Moreover, it is what most patients want. Indeed almost all of dermatologic diagnosis is made by this step, but so also many other diagnoses can be made by this method. And the bizarre way health care is funded and the way incentives are lined up in this country ( we are paid to do to people, rather than for people â€” sticking a needle in or performing a test pays more than listening), we are pushed to spend more time with the "iPatient" (much of it spent documenting the time we supposedly have spent with the live patient).
