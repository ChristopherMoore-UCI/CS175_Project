-- Under mounting pressure from activists and advertisers, Facebook is ramping up efforts to stamp out hate speech, particularly depictions of violence against women. Increase accountability for Facebook users whose pages don't legally qualify as hate speech but who post content that is "cruel or insensitive" -- Implement a policy that requires users who create pages with questionable content to publicly attach their personal account to them -- In Levine's post, Facebook promised to: -- Update guidelines that its Community Standards team uses to identify hate speech, with help from legal experts and women's groups -- Update training for team members who police hate speech -- Facebook's community standards page says, "Facebook does not permit hate speech, but distinguishes between serious and humorous speech. "These pages and images are approved by your moderators, while you regularly remove content such as pictures of women breastfeeding, women post-mastectomy and artistic representations of women's bodies," read the letter, signed by dozens of women's groups from around the world.
