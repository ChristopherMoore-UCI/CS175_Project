On a tape made in May 2009, one of the suspects, Daniel Patrick Boyd, talks about getting the money needed to wage jihad and hitting Wells Fargo trucks and banks. Federal agents discovered in the Boyd house, among other items: several weapons, thousands of rounds of ammunition, $13,000 cash, gas masks, and a document described as a fatwa (Muslim religious edict) of jihad (holy war), the FBI said. It says he traveled to Pakistan in October 2008 to "engage in violent jihad." They also found a trench under the deck of the house, which a witness told the FBI was a bunker to store and conceal weapons, and a plywood plank placed in a tree so that someone sitting there could see anyone approaching the house, FBI special agent Michael Sutton said. "The Raleigh Joint Terrorism Task Force is seeking any information the public may have regarding the whereabouts of Jude Kenan Mohammad," the FBI said in a statement.
