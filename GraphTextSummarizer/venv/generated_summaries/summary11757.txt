Besides operating clinics where abortions are performed, Planned Parenthood provides a range of health services including cancer screenings, birth control, vaccinations, sexual health education and health counseling. Before Brewer signed the bill into law, the political arm of Planned Parenthood Arizona slammed the measure, which it says will put the health of thousands at risk. "Many in the legislature will never know what it's like to feel a lump in their breast and have to worry about the cost of a doctor's visit," said Bryan Howard, president and chief executive of Planned Parenthood Arizona. -- Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer has signed off on a bill that will prevent abortion providers like Planned Parenthood from receiving public funds in most cases, her office said. "By signing this measure into law, I stand with the majority of Americans who oppose the use of taxpayer funds for abortion," Brewer said.
