-- R. Sargent Shriver, a brother-in-law to former President John F. Kennedy who was the first head of the Peace Corps, has been hospitalized in Maryland, a hospital spokeswoman said Monday. Shriver is the father of Maria Shriver, the wife of former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. Shriver had roles in many top government initiatives of the 1960s, including Head Start and the Peace Corps. In addition, Shriver was Democrat George McGovern's running mate in the 1972 presidential election won by Richard Nixon. Mrs. Shriver died in 2009.
