By giving a small amount of time, like the advocate who helped me so many years ago, we can all help victims of domestic violence. This Valentine's Day, I'd like to call on all lawyers in Washington and elsewhere to consider helping stop domestic violence for good. By giving victims a little pro bono assistance, lawyers can help make our nation's dinner tables, homes and families the safe and peaceful oases they should be. Any woman who is going to turn herself from domestic violence victim to a domestic violence survivor needs this service. This week, as the Senate decides whether to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act and Valentine's Day approaches, it's worth noting that most domestic violence victims don't ask for roses, chocolate or federal funding.
