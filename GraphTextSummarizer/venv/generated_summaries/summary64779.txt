"I just received the terribly sad news that Jay Adams passed away last night due to a massive heart attack, send your love," the post read, alongside a picture of a young Adams. -- Former Z-Boys skater Jay Adams died Thursday after a heart attack while vacationing in Mexico with his wife. Despite previous legal hardships related to substance abuse, Ferris emphasized that Adams was completely sober and had been for a while. Adams was enjoying an "endless summer surf vacation," and was set to return to the United States in a couple of days, said Susan Ferris, manager and friend to the Skateboarding Hall of Fame legend. Adams had never experienced any heart issues.
