The circus business has been a part of the Feld family since 1967, when Irvin Feld purchased Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey. "This was a decision that our family had discussed for quite some time," said Feld, chairman and CEO of Feld Entertainment, the company that owns Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey. "We have the largest and only sustainable herd of Asian elephants in the Western Hemisphere," Feld said. "It was a place for elephants to retire," Feld said. "You can't operate any business, much less with animals, if you don't have consistency from city to city," Feld said.
