Ralph West -- a man who publicly accused Dodd of repeated sexual abuse in the 1980s when he was a teenager and Dodd was a Memphis-based YMCA coach -- has told investigators he does not plan to file a criminal offense report against Dodd, said police Sgt. No criminal charges are being filed after an investigation into sexual abuse allegations made against former Amateur Athletic Union executive Robert "Bobby" Dodd, police in Memphis, Tennessee, said Tuesday. The YMCA said Dodd left in 1992 "to pursue AAU sports full-time," including founding an organization called the YOMCA, which stands for Youth of Memphis Competitive Association and is unrelated to the YMCA. AAU officials said that in November, before the ESPN report aired, they had received anonymous phone calls and e-mail messages accusing Dodd of inappropriate behavior. Dodd, 63, the AAU's longtime president and CEO, was dismissed on November 14, a week after allegations first began arriving.
