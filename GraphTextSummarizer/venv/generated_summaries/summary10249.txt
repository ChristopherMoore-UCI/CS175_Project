Besides Simon, Oscar winner Paul Haggis ("Crash," "Million Dollar Baby") has signed on to direct, and Catherine Keener ("Capote," "Captain Phillips") and Oscar Isaac ("Inside Llewyn Davis") are set to star. It's based on a 1999 nonfiction work by Lisa Belkin about a battle over housing in Yonkers, New York, just north of New York City. (HBO, like CNN, is a unit of Time Warner.) Simon's most recent series, "Treme," wrapped up its run on HBO last December. An effort to add low-income housing to the city's east side led to a ferocious court case, angry demonstrations, tribal politics and, eventually, a suicide.
