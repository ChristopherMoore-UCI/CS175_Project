For me, "it all" includes working full-time, going to law school four nights a week, raising a toddler and preparing for the imminent arrival of Baby No. 2. It's hard to ask for help, but it is impossible to balance work, school and family life without it. I've carved out my schedule so I have time to focus on my priorities. Find time to unwind There's nothing I can do about looming school assignments or piles of laundry during that time, so there's no point in worrying about them.
