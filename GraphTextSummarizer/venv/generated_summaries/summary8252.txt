In Ferguson, the video we have in the death of Michael Brown is of press conferences with police Chief Tom Jackson, who refused to release the police officer's name, but did release a video that appeared to show Michael Brown stealing cigars. Both North Charleston and Ferguson have police forces that are not representative of the population they serve, yet because of a video North Charleston's police force got in front of the story. North Charleston police Chief Eddie Driggers told reporters, "I have watched the video, and I was sickened by what I saw." I have heard many commentators say the North Charleston shooting doesn't have anything to do with race. Walter Scott was stopped by Officer Michael Slager for a broken taillight, and within minutes Scott was dead.
