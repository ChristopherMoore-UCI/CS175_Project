But we don't find as much radiation emanating from Sagittarius A*, or other black holes in the centers of galaxies in the present universe. Instead, this black hole -- and likely other black holes in the centers of galaxies -- must spit out a lot in order to swallow a little. It's been a mystery why black holes at the centers of galaxies in the present universe appear so much dimmer than quasars, extremely bright objects from the early universe that have black holes at their centers, too. There was more cold and dense gas in the early universe, so black holes at that time were better at accumulating material this way. -- You might think of black holes as indiscriminate eaters, hungrily gobbling up everything in their vicinity.
