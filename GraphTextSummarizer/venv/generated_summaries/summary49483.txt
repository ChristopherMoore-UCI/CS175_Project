Early on, when we were just starting ELWA's treatment program for HIV, many of these clients were quite ill, and needed nutritional support, medication and health care, and help with transportation to appointments and support group meetings. In partnership with several international organizations, the association advocates for survivors' mental and physical needs, and educates the public about Ebola survivors to help reduce stigma. He let them know about a free survivors' clinic at ELWA Hospital to address complications of Ebola, such as nerve damage or vision problems. The gathering was initiated by the Christian Health Association of Liberia, a local nongovernmental organization that has received funding to help Ebola survivors. While the initial response to Ebola required massive direct aid and assistance, let's hope that we can also move on to real partnership in helping develop a locally led and driven health system that can do better at protecting its people from the next outbreak.
