The carrier has begun upgrading its network to a protocol with the awkward name of HSPA+ and that is faster than today's 3G. That process will ramp up this year, said AT&T executives at a developers conference here during the Consumer Electronics Show. AT&T plans to release 20 devices with 4G, starting with HSPA+ phones in the next few months. Christopher said the carrier's "blockbuster lineup of 4G tablets" will be led by a touchscreen computer with HSPA+ from Samsung Electronics, which will come out in the spring or summer. Yet, in an identity crisis that seems to plague the wireless industry, AT&T Marketing Chief David Christopher blurred the lines during his speech. AT&T Mobility CEO Ralph de la Vega boasted that as "something our competitors will not be able to match."
