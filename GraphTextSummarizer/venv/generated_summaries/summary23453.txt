-- Pop star Britney Spears and former manager Jason Trawick have ended their yearlong engagement, a representative for the singer said Friday. "I love and cherish her and her boys and we will be close forever," he said, referring to Spears' two sons with former husband Kevin Federline. In 2004, she had a quickie Las Vegas wedding with childhood friend Jason Alexander (the "marriage" lasted 55 hours). Spears and Trawick, who had been dating since 2009, became engaged in December 2011. "I'll always adore him and we will remain great friends," Spears, 31, said in a statement.
