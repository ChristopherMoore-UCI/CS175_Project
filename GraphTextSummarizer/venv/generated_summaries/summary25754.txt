The 27-year-old Swiss player was found to have tested positive for a metabolite of cocaine while competing at Wimbledon last year, the ITF said in a statement published on its Web site. The federation said Hingis would have to repay $130,000 prize money and ranking points won since last year's Wimbledon. Hingis must forfeit $130,000 prize money and ranking points earned at Wimbledon and subsequent events. Hingis, a five-time Grand Slam champion and former Wimbledon winner, announced her retirement from the sport at the time the allegations emerged. At the time the allegations first surfaced last November, Hingis dismissed the test results, calling the claims "horrendous" and "monstrous."
