" Henry has been strongly linked with a move to American Major League Soccer team New York Red Bulls in the past. Toure has also been told he can leave the club, with English side Manchester City reportedly favorites to reunite the 27-year-old with his brother and Ivory Coast international teammate Kolo. CNN -- Spanish champions Barcelona have announced that striker Thierry Henry and midfielder Yaya Toure will leave the club before the new season. While contributing to Barcelona's unprecedented treble in 2008-09, capped by a Champions League title, he struggled with injury at times and was even usurped by younger players at the Nou Camp such as winger Pedro. France international Henry scored four goals in 15 starts last season for the Champions League semifinalists, as he fell down the pecking order following the arrival of Zlatan Ibrahimovic and, last month, Spain star David Villa.
