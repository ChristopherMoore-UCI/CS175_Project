-- Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the former International Monetary Fund chief who was at one time accused of sexually assaulting a hotel maid in New York, is threatening to sue a Belgian sex club using the initials "D.S.K." The Dodo Sex Klub is due to open Wednesday in Blaton, a town on the Belgian-French border. The former head of the IMF "will take all legal measures necessary to cease the smearing of his name," according to a statement released by five French and Belgian lawyers. Later this year, Alderweireld will be on trial, along with Strauss-Kahn, on charges of "aggravated pimping" for their alleged participation in a prostitution ring at the Hotel Carlton in Lille, in northern France. The club's owner, Dominique Alderweireld, owns a string of prostitution houses in Belgium. Strauss-Kahn is often referred to as "DSK," especially by the French media.
