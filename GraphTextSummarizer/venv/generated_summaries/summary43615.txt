Doctors said she suffered from acute respiratory illnesses like asthma and bronchitis, but Dabalsa said she'd never been sick with asthma before. -- Attorneys representing families whose homes were built with toxic drywall say they will not advise their clients to accept a proposed $55 million settlement without first having several "fundamental questions" answered. The homeowners also claim the drywall corroded metals in home appliances and fixtures throughout their homes. In 2009, the product safety commission determined the drywall emits extraordinarily high levels of hydrogen sulfide and recommended that homes be completely gutted and electric components replaced. The plaintiffs' attorneys claim more than 32% of settlement money could go towards paying attorney fees -- possibly leaving their clients as little as $4,000 each to rebuild their homes.
