Denzel Washington plays a transit official, once demoted, in "The Taking of Pelham 123." Moreover, Washington's character is not like the hostage negotiator he played three years ago in "Inside Man," although the movie is about his negotiation with a deranged ex-con hostage-holder, played by John Travolta, Washington said. It's essentially a two-character play, with much of the dialogue delivered over a two-way radio between Washington, in the train control center, and Travolta, on a hijacked train, director Tony Scott said. -- Denzel Washington's new movie, "The Taking of Pelham 123," is not a remake, even though Walter Matthau starred in a film by the same name in 1974, the actor told CNN. New York City is also a major character, Scott said. Travolta's character is "a contradiction of what you normally expect in a bad guy," Scott said.
