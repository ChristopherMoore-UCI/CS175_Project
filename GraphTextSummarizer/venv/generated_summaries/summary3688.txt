Harrell was arrested in Meridian, Mississippi, by federal agents earlier this month, and Florida Gov. Charlie Crist asked Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour to extradite him. -- A man authorities want to question in the slaying of a 7-year-old girl, whose body was dumped in a landfill, appeared in a Florida court Wednesday on child pornography charges after being extradited from Mississippi. Jarred Harrell, 24, faces 29 counts of possession of child pornography in Clay County, Florida. The arrest followed a search of Harrell's residence, Clay County authorities said. Somer Thompson was last seen in the Clay County town of Orange Park on October 19.
