In the wake of criticism over a two-game suspension for Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice, the NFL has established a six-game unpaid ban for personnel who violate the league's policy on domestic violence, Commissioner Roger Goodell said Thursday. "Violations of the Personal Conduct Policy regarding assault, battery, domestic violence or sexual assault that involve physical force will be subject to a suspension without pay of six games for a first offense, with consideration given to mitigating factors, as well as a longer suspension when circumstances warrant. The punishments, both from the NFL and from the criminal justice system, were widely decried as too light, and the issue quickly spiraled into debates over domestic violence and victim-blaming. "We were informed today of the NFL's decision to increase penalties on domestic violence offenders under the Personal Conduct Policy for all NFL employees. Opinion: NFL, apologize to women for Ray Rice Goodell's letter tells teams to distribute a memo about the new policy to each player and all members of the organizations.
