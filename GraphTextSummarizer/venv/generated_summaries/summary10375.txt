The former England captain, who recently joined Paris Saint-Germain on a five-month contract, attracts more cash than four-time FIFA World Player of the Year Lionel Messi and Real Madrid's Portuguese superstar Cristiano Ronaldo. France Football, first published in 1946, organized the Ballon d'Or award for European footballer of the year until it was merged with FIFA's world player of the year award in 2010. Second on the magazine's rich list was Barcelona's Messi, who will reportedly make $45.2 million this season, with $17 million coming from salary and bonuses. Real's Ronaldo has so often trailed narrowly behind Messi on the pitch, and so it is the financial stakes. -- David Beckham is the highest-paid soccer player in the world, according to prestigious magazine France Football.
