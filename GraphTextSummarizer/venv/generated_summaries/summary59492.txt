Video: Syria government says it will fight back The officials killed in the blast were the defense minister; the deputy defense minister, who is the president's brother-in-law; and al-Assad's security adviser and assistant vice president, state TV reported. At least 217 people were killed Thursday, including 40 in Damascus suburbs, 70 in Deir Ezzor and 33 in Idlib, the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria (LCC) said. The development came as rebels fought government forces in Damascus and its suburbs and made significant attacks on strategic border points, officials said. Amid fierce fighting, Syrian TV on Thursday showed video of President Bashar al-Assad, the first images broadcast of him since a deadly attack on top officials a day earlier. Russia, China veto sanctions on Syria Western countries were pushing for a resolution that threatened new sanctions if government forces don't stop attacks against civilians.
