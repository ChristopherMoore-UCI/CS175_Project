Officials say Routh, a military veteran, killed the men on a gun range in a remote section of Rough Creek Lodge and Resort, which sprawls across 11,000 acres in Glen Rose, Texas, 90 minutes southwest of Dallas-Fort Worth. The Saturday afternoon call from Routh's sister, Laura Blevins, came from her home in Midlothian, some 30 miles southeast of Fort Worth, after Routh, she said, had come to visit her and her husband. Like, he's all crazy ..." Those recorded words from the sister of Eddie Ray Routh gave Texas authorities one of their first indications Saturday of death at an isolated shooting range. Routh, Kyle and his friend, Chad Littlefield, entered the resort and headed toward a gun range at 3:15 p.m. (4:15 p.m. ET) Saturday, according to authorities. Though the 25-year-old Routh had not threatened the couple, "he was talking kinda babble." Asked whether Routh had been known to drink or take drugs, Gaines Blevins said, "Yeah, he's been known to drink in the past -- and smoke pot."
