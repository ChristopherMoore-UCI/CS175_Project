The decision to name a naval frigate the KRI Usman Harun, after Sergeants Usman Haji Mohamed Ali and Harun Said, has angered the city-state, which says that it reflects a lack of sensitivity and respect for mutual ties. Despite differences, including protests against an annual forest burn conducted by the larger country, which affects air quality in Singapore, the two countries enjoy a full diplomatic relationship and have strong commercial ties. Lieutenant-General (Retired) Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin, Indonesia's deputy defense minister, alongside the chiefs of the country's three main military branches, will not be attending the Singapore Airshow, which begins Tuesday, in a form of diplomatic protest. "The visit by senior TNI [Indonesian National Armed Forces] officers, military chiefs of staff and TNI commander to Singapore has been canceled," the ministry said a statement. -- Singapore's escalating dispute with its neighbor Indonesia over the naming of a warship has led to a series of tit-for-tat snubs involving the city's airshow, which is being held this week.
