Watch the actress talk about her character and the wedding Â» The ceremony, portions of which were posted on a Web site dedicated to ABC daytime television and SOAPnet.com, featured both women wearing designer dresses and holding red roses. Rhode Island recognizes same-sex marriages from other states, and Vermont, New Jersey and New Hampshire allow civil unions. "I think it is really important to understand that there are a lot of things that people don't really want to see and don't want coming into their homes, and lesbian weddings are certainly one of them," said Glenn Stanton of the group Focus on the Family. Monday's ceremony on ABC's "All My Children" was much the same, except for the couple: Bianca Montgomery and Reese Williams, both wearing designer dresses, united in daytime television's first lesbian wedding. "When my character did first come out of the closet, there was a lot of negative reaction," said Eden Riegel, the actress who plays Bianca.
