State budget cuts mean many zoos, aquariums and botanical gardens will lose crucial state funding for their exhibits. The state of New York funds just 2.7 percent of the Bronx Zoo and the New York Aquarium's budget, but zoo officials say it will be difficult to make up. There is no easy way to say this: Even though you bring record numbers of people to New York and help the economy, we are going to have to let you go. New York's 76 zoos, aquariums and botanical gardens will lose $9.1 million in state funds next year. They will lose $3 million to budget cuts.
