The team attended a bizarre news conference given -- under duress -- by captured military observers from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe and the self-appointed mayor of Slovyansk, Vyacheslav Ponomarev. The separatists now running Slovyansk seem to have firmed up plans to hold a referendum, which could pave the way for the eastern regions to break away from Ukraine. The team traveled south of Slovyansk to the town of Kostyantinivka after reports that separatists had launched their latest move there. On Saturday, April 26, the team went to the funeral of Alexander Lubenets, a young man who was killed at a separatist checkpoint at Kombikormovyi on the outskirts of Slovyansk. He has filed daily reports from the area as the crisis in eastern Ukraine unfolds.
