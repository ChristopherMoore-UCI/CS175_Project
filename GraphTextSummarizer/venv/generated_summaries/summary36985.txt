Sunday's silent march started at 110th Street and headed down Fifth Avenue, ending at 78th Street after passing Bloomberg's townhouse on 79th Street. "I've been pulled over and pushed against fences, frisked, but have never been arrested." Russell's story sounded familiar to many of Sunday's marchers, who want to see action from Mayor Michael Bloomberg, and Police Commissioner Ray Kelly -- either by abolishing or reforming stop-and-frisk. "It's racial profiling of people who are almost all innocent of any wrongdoing," said New York City Comptroller John Liu, who was advocating abolition at the protest march. On Sunday morning, speaking at a Christian Cultural Center, Mayor Bloomberg attempted to preempt the demonstration's inevitable message: "I understand why some people want us to stop making stops," he said. He said he would prefer "strategies of focused deterrents that we have seen in Atlanta, Chicago and Boston that actually reduce crime." Jumaane Williams, a New York city councilman from Brooklyn, said Bloomberg and Kelly "have shown no leadership" on the stop-and-frisk issue.
