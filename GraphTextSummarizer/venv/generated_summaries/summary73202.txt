Mauresmo is currently juggling roles as tournament director in Paris and captain of France's Fed Cup team, alongside coaching and commentating stints. "To be lucky enough to have lived one passion -- tennis -- is great but to learn many things and meet new people in a completely different area, atmosphere and world, why not?" "I read a lot of things about wine from around the world and different regions in France. " A world away from the tranquil vines associated with France's verdant valleys is the slog of the professional tennis circuit -- Mauresmo's home for well over a decade. Alize Cornet, one of those involved in France's Group II win over Switzerland last month, says Mauresmo is the best captain she has ever played for.
