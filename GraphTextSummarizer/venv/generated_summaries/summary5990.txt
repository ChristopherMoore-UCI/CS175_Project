The fight boxing fans have long been clamoring for has moved a step closer, with undefeated Floyd Mayweather challenging Manny Pacquiao to a showdown on May 5 -- but will it happen? "Manny Pacquiao wants to make it clear the fight can happen at the end of May -- Manny wants Floyd to release his grip on May 5th, so the fight can happen for the fans," Wednesday's statement read. The 33-year-old is rated by Ring Magazine as the best pound-for-pound fighter in the world, with Mayweather second on the 10-man list following September's knockout win over compatriot Victor Ortiz in Las Vegas. "Manny Pacquiao I'm calling you out let's fight May 5th and give the world what they want to see," he wrote on Tuesday. Hopes of the much-anticipated bout dimmed in December when Mayweather, the WBC welterweight champion, was sentenced to a 90-day prison term after being found guilty of domestic violence.
