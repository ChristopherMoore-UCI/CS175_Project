-- The City of Brotherly Love isn't exactly embracing the news that one-time quarterback phenom and convicted dogfighter Michael Vick is joining their Philadelphia Eagles. A gifted athlete known more for his dazzling runs than his pinpoint throws, Vick's last season in 2006 was a bit of a disappointment to Atlanta fans. Mike Giunta of Tabernacle, New Jersey, told CNN affiliate WPVI-TV in Philadelphia that signing Vick would spawn "dissension" among the Eagles, who made it to their conference championship last season, losing to the Arizona Cardinals. The latter alluded to Vick being a "psychopath" earlier this year and released a statement Friday saying, "Millions of decent football fans around the world are disappointed" in the Eagles. Former Atlanta Falcon Michael Vick, right, was known more for his elusiveness than his throwing prowess.
