A few weeks ago, Bennett posted on Facebook using his account "State Representative John Bennett" that Christians should be "wary" of Muslim Americans: "The Quran clearly states that non-Muslims should be killed. But I have to give it up for Oklahoma state Rep. John Bennett, a Republican, who has set a record for the vilest anti-Muslim comments yet. What makes Bennett's comments so alarming is that they weren't directed against Islamic terrorists such as ISIS, but rather against Muslim Americans, people like my family, friends and me. " In reality, Muslim American organizations across the nation, including one in Bennett's own state, have publicly denounced ISIS and condemned their actions as not only being horrific but as also being un-Islamic. Despite calls for Bennett to apologize for inciting hate against Muslim Americans, he instead escalated his campaign of bigotry.
