Although the contribution of Nepal, one of the poorest countries in the world, to carbon emissions is negligible, the poor and the marginalized bear the brunt of climate change, Prime Minister Nepal said at a press conference after the cabinet meeting. "The Himalayas are important not only for the people of Nepal but for 1.3 billion people who depend on waters from the mountains for their livelihoods," said Nepal's Prime Minister Madhav Kumar Nepal at the cabinet meeting broadcast live by state-owned Nepal Television. The 10-point Everest Declaration the cabinet adopted includes increasing the protected area of Nepal's land from 20 percent to 25 percent, developing communities' capacity to cope with climate change and working together with other countries to mitigate the impact of global warming. "This is a very important and historic meeting," Prime Minister Nepal said. "The earth is our common abode," said Prime Minister Nepal.
