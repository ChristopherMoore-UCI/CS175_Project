"The Archdiocese will allow for co-ed participation in CYO football, effective in the 2013 season," the statement said, adding that the rule was provisional and will be reviewed in future seasons. Two games into Caroline's second season, head coach Chip Ross received an unexpected call from Jason Budd, deputy secretary for Catholic education for the archdiocese, who oversees the football program. Football season is still a while off, but when the time comes, said Caroline, "I'll be ready." Her playing time with the Catholic Youth Organization ended after last season when the Archdiocese of Philadelphia enforced its "boys only" policy for football, sidelining the All-Star guard and defensive end. Despite the panel's recommendation, on Thursday Archbishop Charles Chaput ordered the archdiocese to allow girls to play CYO football, according to a statement.
