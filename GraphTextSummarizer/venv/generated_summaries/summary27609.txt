The victory was a nice tune-up ahead of their final Champions League match at Galatasaray next Tuesday. The result in Bologna left the home side hovering near the foot of Serie A with only Sampdoria and Catania below them. The Catalan giants, who are without the talents of their mercurial striker Lionel Messi, had fallen to consecutive defeats to Ajax, in the Champions League, and to Athletic Bilbao in La Liga. In France, Marseille were leap-frogged by Nantes as the home side nicked a 1-0 victory thanks to a solo strike from American midfielder Alejandro Bedoya. Chilean midfielder Arturo Vidal followed up his Champions League hat-trick against FC Copenhagen with an opening goal for Juventus, volleying Federico Peluso's pass into the roof of the net.
