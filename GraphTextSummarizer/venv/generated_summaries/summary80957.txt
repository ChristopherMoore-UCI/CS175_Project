In countries like Egypt, people with cleft lips and/or palates are looked upon as "cursed" and virtually shunned from society. The global rate for cleft lip and/or palate is about 1 in 750 births. The doctors and nurses who volunteer their time and skill come from all over the world, pay their own way, are housed in places like military barracks (as we were), and work long days through the screening, surgery and recovery process. For example, they say in Third World countries, the lack of folic acid and the practice of intermarriage increase the likelihood of cleft lip and/or palate. Seven-month-old Adnan Saleh had just come out of surgery to fix a cleft lip.
