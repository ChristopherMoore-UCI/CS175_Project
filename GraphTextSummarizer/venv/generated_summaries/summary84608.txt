It's trust in English, confiance in French, and a word used a lot Tuesday by President Barack Obama and visiting French President Francois Hollande to describe what has changed once thorny relations between the NATO allies. Even for issues on which they may not see completely eye-to-eye, Obama and Hollande emphasized a cooperative spirit in seeking an end to the Syrian war and a deal with Iran to prevent it from developing nuclear weapons. Hollande, meanwhile, said it was critical that Iran renounces nuclear weapons in a "comprehensive manner" in talks going forward, but noted that he lacked authority to tell French businesses who they can talk with as long as no sanctions violations occur. When a reporter asked about a French business delegation visiting Iran, Obama warned any companies violating sanctions would "do so at their own peril now, because we will come down on them like a ton of bricks." The next round of Iran talks begin on February 18 in Vienna.
