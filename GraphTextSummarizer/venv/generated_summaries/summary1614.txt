Goodall became friends with Jackson about 20 years ago when he invited her to his Neverland Ranch, where "he talked about his dreams for the place to have animals running, looking free like they would in the wild. He told me he liked the way I told stories." Goodall, who travels the world to promote protection of endangered chimps, said she had hoped Jackson would help get her message out. " Goodall, whose life has been spent understanding chimpanzees, said she found Jackson to be "a sad person." Goodall, famous for her 50 years of groundbreaking research on chimpanzees in Africa, said Jackson invited her because "he loved what I did." "He loved chimpanzees," she said. -- A famed primatologist says the plight of chimpanzees helped inspire Michael Jackson to write the song "Heal the World."
