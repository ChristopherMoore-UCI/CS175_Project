Some users with Graph Search can now browse Facebook for topics of interest â€” for example, "posts about Breaking Bad" or simply "Breaking Bad." -- Facebook announced an update to Graph Search on Monday that will enable users to search for conversation topics within status updates, comments and posts. When users' eyes aren't glued to the TV screen, Facebook and Twitter want them to be having conversations or voicing their opinions on their respective networks. Facebook reported on its Q2 earnings call that 88 to 100 million people are actively using the social network during primetime television hours â€” a number that Facebook advertisers will pay close attention to.
