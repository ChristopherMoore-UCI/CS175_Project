The flare on a North Sea platform that has been leaking gas for nearly a week has extinguished itself, energy giant Total said Saturday. " Scottish Environment Secretary Richard Lochhead said Friday he had stressed the need for "absolute transparency" from Total and the British government with regards to the situation. "The first is to pump heavy mud directly into the well and the second is to drill relief wells to intervene at the source of the gas flow," Total said. Total said it had received the first indication that the flare might be out at lunchtime on Friday. Total said Friday that it was ready to push ahead with two operations intended to stop the leak, following five days during which the site had remained stable.
