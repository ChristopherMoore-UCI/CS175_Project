Peter Cervelli, a research geophysicist with the observatory, told CNN that "every indication is that we're heading toward an eruption." Cervelli said scientists don't know exactly when it will happen, but if it does happen, it could be days or weeks -- or even hours. It plans to do continuous visual surveillance, measure gas output and analyze satellite and weather-radar data. Predicting eruptions That eruption spread ash in Kenai and Anchorage, where it disrupted air traffic operations. The observatory has set up a Web camera near the summit of the volcano and another within Cook Inlet. Scientists raised the alert status Sunday to a "watch" level, the second-highest, based on seismic activity detected January 23.
