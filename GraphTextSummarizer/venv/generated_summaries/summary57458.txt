State medical boards need to examine over-prescribing and strip some physicians of their license to practice medicine, as well as offer training about addiction and appropriate prescribing of pain medications. Historically, pain has been inadequately treated by physicians, so there is good reason for the increased medical use of opioid pain medications. Pain is the most common problem bringing people to the doctor, and opioid pain medications are frequently prescribed for even minor pain. Prescribed opioids -- pain medication -- have become the fastest-growing addiction problem in the United States. None of them went on to college and they were all caught in the vicious cycle of opioid addiction; using high doses every few hours, engaging in crime to support their addiction.
