The Huangs were blocked from leaving Qatar on Sunday at Hamad International Airport by immigration officials, who confiscated their passports, according to the Doha News agency, which cited a family spokesman Eric Volz. " State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Secretary of State John Kerry called Qatar's foreign minister to encourage the Qataris to let the Huangs leave. An appeals judge in Qatar on Sunday cleared them of starving their adopted daughter to death in 2013 in a case that drew global attention to the Middle Eastern nation's justice system. A new warrant had been issued for their arrest on unknown charges, the agency cited Volz as saying. But Matthew Huang told CNN's Brooke Baldwin Monday that each day that passes without their exit from Qatar is the continuation of an injustice.
