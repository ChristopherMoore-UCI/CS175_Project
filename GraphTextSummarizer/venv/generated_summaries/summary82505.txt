Woods, who has won 72 times on the PGA Tour, has previously built his preparation for majors around a restricted schedule of select tournaments, but earlier this season he sprang another surprise by playing in the Honda Classic for the first time since his teenage years. The 36-year-old American is stalled on 14 major titles -- four short of the all-time record held by Jack Nicklaus -- since his U.S. Open triumph in 2008. Woods announced on his official website that he will play in the Greenbrier Classic for the first time before heading for the British Open at Royal Lytham in July. His career has been interrupted by injury and well publicized problems in his personal life, but this year Woods returned to top form with victory in the Arnold Palmer Invitational at Bay Hill. "I'm excited about my schedule and looking forward to competing," said Woods, who will next head for the Memorial Tournament, hosted by Jack Nicklaus, which starts on May 31.
