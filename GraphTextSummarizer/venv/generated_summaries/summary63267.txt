As more reports of bloodshed and chaos emerged from Syria on Monday, the government announced it will hold presidential elections on June 3. The explosives, which usually involve barrels stuffed with nails and other objects to maximize damage, fell in Daraa and Idlib provinces Monday, the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said. As the government announced the election date, opposition activists reported more barrel bombs raining down on neighborhoods across Syria. On Monday, the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency said demonstrators in Khan Arnabeh took to the streets to express support for the army "in confronting terrorism." Parliament Speaker Mohammad Jihad al-Laham said the constitutional court will start accepting presidential nominations Tuesday.
