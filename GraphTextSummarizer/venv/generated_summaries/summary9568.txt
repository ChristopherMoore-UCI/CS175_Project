French police in the region have pleaded with locals and visitors to stay away from the site, urging them "not to clutter the roads," leaving them clear for emergency vehicles. French President Francois Hollande warned "it will take some hours for the emergency services to reach the crash site." Photographs posted on Twitter hours after the plane disappeared from radar showed helicopters preparing to take off, and emergency vehicles lining up ready to receive the victims' remains. "There is no access by road; emergency crews are coming in by air, using helicopters," he said. But the remoteness -- which appeals to small numbers of holidaymakers looking to ski in winter or take restorative walks through the green hills in the warmer months -- may make reaching the wreckage of the Germanwings plane difficult. With its snow-capped mountains and picturesque deserted hamlets, the Bleone Valley, where a Germanwings jet crashed Tuesday, is a stunningly beautiful but sparsely populated spot.
