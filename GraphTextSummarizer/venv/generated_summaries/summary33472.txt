By early January, Bedley had found several teachers in other states. Bedley was delighted; it was his class' first foray into international Mystery Skype, and the video might train and inspire other teachers. "The tools available for teachers now are what I wish I would have had my first year teaching." Now, he's got BYOD (bring your own device) classrooms where students can use cell phones, iPods, tablets or laptops from home, as long as they've passed a course on how to use them appropriately. His California fifth-graders are hoping to video chat with students from all 50 states and other parts of the world. Another couple of students, "great kids who always forget their glasses," created a program that would automatically adjust computer screens so they could read, no matter what.
