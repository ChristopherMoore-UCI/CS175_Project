"Neither of the two women had any outward signs of trauma on them," said Fort Lewis spokesman Joseph Piek. Barracks where soldiers live are usually split into rooms for one to three soldiers, Piek said. The circumstances of how the girls came unto the base are under investigation, Piek said, but there was no evidence that security had been compromised. -- A 16-year-old girl was found dead and another girl was found unconscious in an Army barracks at Fort Lewis near Tacoma, Washington, during the weekend, a base spokesman said Monday. A doctor declared one of the girls dead on the scene, and the second girl was transported to Madigan Army Hospital, where she was in stable condition Monday.
