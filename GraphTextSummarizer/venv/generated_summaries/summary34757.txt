The dramatic rescue in the Marshall Islands brought heartbreaking news for Rios: Jose Salvador Alvarenga had survived, but her son, who was with him, had perished at sea. Four weeks into their drift, according to Alvarenga, Cordova died of starvation because he refused to eat raw birds and turtles. " Her son, 23-year-old Ezequiel Cordova, set sail from Mexico with Alvarenga in late 2012. Now, as Alvarenga begins his journey home to El Salvador, Rios is grieving her son's death, more than a year after he went missing. A short ride took Cordova to where he worked, the nearby town of Costa Azul.
