In northern Utah, "ecliptomaniacs" are planning to travel south to view the event, said Patrick Wiggins, a NASA ambassador in Salt Lake City. In western United States, more than 1,000 people may flood the small town of Kanarraville, Utah -- population 300 -- to get one of the best views of Sunday's event, said Bonnie Char, spokeswoman for the Cedar City-Brian Head Tourism Bureau. -- Thousands of people are planning viewing parties for the upcoming annular solar eclipse, a rare event in which the sun will appear as a thin ring behind the moon. In the United States, the eclipse will be visible on a path from northwestern Texas through New Mexico, northeastern Arizona, southern Utah, Nevada, northern California and southwestern Oregon late Sunday. Newmark said people should not peer up at the sky to view the solar event without special viewing equipment.
