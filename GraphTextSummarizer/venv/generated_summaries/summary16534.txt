On Wednesday, a U.S. official said that commanders referred to Bergdahl as a "good soldier" in that initial fact-finding report, and that fellow soldiers said he'd left the post on other occasions.

There was no definitive finding Bergdahl deserted because that would require knowing his intent -- something Army officials couldn't do without talking to the soldier. Since announcing Bergdahl's release over the weekend, Obama administration officials have repeatedly said they fast-tracked the operation over concerns about his health and safety, which appeared to be in jeopardy.
