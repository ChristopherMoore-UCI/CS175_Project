But Barnard's coup in securing the president, whose aides contacted Barnard last week, according to university President Debora L. Spar, raises an important question:  How do colleges choose their commencement speakers? A famous commencement speaker is an expense that colleges believe will pay dividends down the line. The most important commencement address in modern American history occurred June 5, 1947, at Harvard, when Secretary of State and former Army Chief of Staff  George Marshall delivered the talk that became the basis for the Marshall Plan. Perhaps colleges are right? But I think it is equally possible that colleges are kidding themselves.
