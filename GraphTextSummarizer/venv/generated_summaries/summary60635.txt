It is no coincidence that, very early on in her role as secretary of state, Hillary Clinton elevated climate change and gender issues over freedom in her dealings with foreign officials. Some of the White House's most thoughtful defenders point out that it is counterproductive to support pro-democracy groups, whether in Tehran or Hong Kong. Our consulate there expressed support for general rights such as freedom of expression, religion and association, but was signally quiet on democracy. And so when tens of thousands of demonstrators took to the streets of Hong Kong last weekend, the administration ran true to form. When we don't, it creates not just disappointment in places like Hong Kong, but dissonance here at home.
