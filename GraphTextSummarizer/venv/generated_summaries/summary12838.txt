Lakhan is not alone There are many children like Lakhan in Mumbai, says Meena Mutha, a social worker. According to Jadhav, there is only one shelter for children with special needs in Mumbai and he can't get Lakhan a spot there because that too is severely overcrowded. Mutha's been involved with his case since the end of May. Lakhan was taken into care after a photographer published his photo in the local newspaper. Unable to find a shelter that looks after children with special needs, Mutha took him to a government-run juvenile center in Mumbai. Her office is a short walk away from bus stop 59 where Lakhan was found.
