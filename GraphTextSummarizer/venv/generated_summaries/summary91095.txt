Carlos Larmond was charged with participation in the activity of a terrorist group and with attempting to leave Canada to participate in terrorist activity abroad, a relatively new Canadian terrorism law. After making the arrest, Canada's national security team said in a statement that Mohamed's arrest was directly linked to the arrests of Ashton and Carlos Larmond, two Ottawa brothers accused of conspiring to commit terrorism offenses. "These recent arrests underscore the reality that there are individuals in Ontario and in Canada who have become radicalized to a violent ideology, and who are willing to act upon it," wrote Chief Superintendent Jennifer Strachan, criminal operations officer for the Ontario Division of the RCMP. Ashton Larmond was arrested in Ottawa, but his brother Carlos was arrested at Montreal's Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport, where police said he was intending to travel overseas for terrorist purposes. Neighbors in an east Ottawa neighborhood where Mohamed has lived said they did not immediately recognize him but indicated there had been police activity on the street all weekend long.
