Fazul Abdullah Mohammed, indicted in the United States for alleged involvement in the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, managed to evade police in a raid Saturday morning in Malindi, along Kenya's coast, said police spokesman Eric Kiraithe. The FBI description says Mohammed was born in the Comoros Islands, and has used birth dates indicating he was born in either 1972 or 1974. The United States calls Mohammed a senior al Qaeda operative in East Africa. They also believe Mohammed was involved in attacks on an Israeli-owned hotel and airliner in Kenya in 2002. He said police know Mohammed had, in fact, been at the location they raided, because they found two passports under names Mohammed has used.
