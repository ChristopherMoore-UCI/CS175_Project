A poll released by Siena College on Wednesday found that 26 percent of New York voters wanted another Democrat with a famous last name to be appointed to the seat: state Attorney General Andrew Cuomo, son of former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo. -- Caroline Kennedy is on a public campaign for Sen. Hillary Clinton's Senate seat, which may make it difficult for New York Gov. David Paterson not to send President John F. Kennedy's only living child to Washington. During a stop in Syracuse, New York, Kennedy said, "I've told Gov. Paterson that I'd be honored to be considered for the position of United States senator. While she has to win over only one voter -- Paterson -- Kennedy essentially began a political campaign for the seat, which was once held by her uncle, Robert F. Kennedy, with a visit to upstate New York on Wednesday. Kennedy was the choice of 23 percent of New York voters, the polls found.
