The exit polls in November showed that the GOP is out of step with the electorate on a number of big issues, including immigration and gay marriage. Throughout the year, polls showed, for example, that the public was becoming more tolerant of gay marriage and civil unions. In Syria, the government brutally cracked down on opponents, reaching the point in December where Obama's administration has started to talk about the possibility of the al-Assad regime using chemical weapons, though the severity of the threat is unclear. While there are some conservative voices who lament these changes and warn of a nation that is veering toward Sodom, a majority are more than comfortable that some of the taboos and social restrictions of earlier eras are fading and that we live in a nation which is more tolerant than ever before. Not only are their numbers growing as a voting bloc, but they are more organized and active than ever before, both on election day as well as in policy making.
