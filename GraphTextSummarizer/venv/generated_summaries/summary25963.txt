" The late president was a cautious, slow-moving tactician, and while his son's style may appear modern, he was still schooled in the old Assad family way. But opposition activists say it is a systematic, sustained slaughter on civilians by the al-Assad regime. In 1982, the Syrian military -- acting under orders from Assad's father -- brutally crushed an uprising in the western city of Hama. Hafez al-Assad ruled with an iron fist for three decades, ruthlessly putting down dissent by jailing dissidents and crushing the opposition. When his father died in June 2000, it only took hours for the Syrian parliament to vote to amend the country's constitution to allow al-Assad to become president.
