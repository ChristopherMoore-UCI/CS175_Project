The National Security Agency leaker will urge listeners to rally against mass government surveillance when he gives Channel 4's annual Alternative Christmas Message, which follows Queen Elizabeth II's traditional Christmas broadcast. Channel 4's alternative address tradition, begun in 1993, has included addresses from Ahmadinejad, then the Iranian president; Ali G, a character played by comedian Sacha Baron Cohen; an injured Afghan war veteran; and a survivor of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. -- Edward Snowden will join the ranks of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Ali G and Marge Simpson when he delivers an "alternative" Christmas greeting to British television viewers Wednesday. "Together we can find a better balance, end mass surveillance and remind the government that if it really wants to know how we feel, asking is always cheaper than spying," Snowden will say in the Wednesday address, according to a transcript that Channel 4 released a day in advance. Snowden, a former NSA contractor, is living in asylum in Russia after leaking U.S. surveillance secrets to the news media earlier this year.
