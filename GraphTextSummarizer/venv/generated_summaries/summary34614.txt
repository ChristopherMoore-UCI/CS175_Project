French movie icon Gerard Depardieu is now a Russian. Depardieu may never become a documented immigrant in the U.S., but the star announced Friday he accepted  Russian citizenship after Vladimir Putin granted it to him personally by presidential decree, Russian news agency RIA Novosti reported. The Russian president pounced on the wisecrack the very next day, saying that if Depardieu wants in, then he's in, Russian news agency RIA Novosti reported. Putin had Thursday's decree posted to his website: "In accordance with clause 'a' of article 89 of the Russian Constitution, the application for Russian citizenship by Gerard Xavier Depardieu born in France in 1948 has been granted."

"He knows that I love your President Vladimir Putin," Depardieu wrote, according to RIA Novosti, "and that feeling is mutual."
