The FBI said Friday it believes AWOL policeman Henry Solis is armed and dangerous and drove 800 miles across the desert from Southern California to El Paso with his father in a pickup a week ago. The FBI, Pomona Police and Los Angeles County District Attorney declined to comment on whether Victor Solis might face charges for allegedly helping his son flee to El Paso. Garriola said Solis then reportedly called his father in Lancaster, California, and later that morning they began the trek to El Paso. "The pattern suggests he crossed into Mexico, but he has family and friends living in El Paso and Ciudad Juarez," said Scott Garriola, special FBI agent who runs the fugitive task force from the Los Angeles Bureau. Victor Solis said he dropped off his son at a bus stop in El Paso and his son made some incriminating statements "not only about his actions that day but also that he would never be seen again," Garriola said.
