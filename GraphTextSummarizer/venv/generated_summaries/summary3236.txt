And I suspect that Superman aficionados will be disappointed by just how joyless most of Snyder's reboot is. Hans Zimmer's 'Man of Steel' soundtrack has new surround sound tech Things pick up a bit down on Earth, where little Kal-El has crash-landed in Kansas and been raised by the Kents (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane). The 21st-century Lois isn't the gullible gal Friday she was in the old comics or the Christopher Reeve Superman films, where she was played by Margot Kidder. During a prologue that goes on way too long setting the bloated tone for the film, Superman's father Jor-El (Russell Crowe) squares off against General Zod (Michael Shannon) on Krypton. Snyder, whose best films are 2004's -adrenalized Dawn of the Dead remake and 2007's hyper-stylized Spartan saga 300, has teamed up with producer Christopher Nolan to give us a cooler, more conflicted Superman.
