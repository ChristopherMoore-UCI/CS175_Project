Near the epicenter, quakes on the lower to middle parts of that range could leave negligible to slight damage in buildings of good design, and considerable to great damage -- such as broken or fallen walls -- in poorly designed structures, according to the USGS. The state-run IRNA news agency cited a plant executive as saying the facility's distance from the epicenter was the reason for the lack of damage. The Iranian Red Crescent Society sent five assessment teams to coordinate rescue operations, IRNA reported, saying ambulances were sent from Tehran to assist in the rescue effort. At least 850 people were injured, Iran's Press TV said. At least three strong aftershocks struck the same area in the hour after the quake Tuesday, according to the USGS, and Press TV said authorities expect the number of casualties to rise.
