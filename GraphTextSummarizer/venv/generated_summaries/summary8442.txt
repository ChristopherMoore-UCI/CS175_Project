Former Interior Minister Habib El Adly has been sentenced to 12 years for corruption charges but still awaits the verdict for the charge of killing protesters. -- Armed men and vendors attacked protesters in Tahrir Square on Sunday as clashes continued for hours, leaving many injured. The army deployed hundreds of troops with armored vehicles onto the streets Wednesday to protect the Ministry of the Interior after the police were forced to withdraw from Tahrir Square when anti-government protests raged. Many Egyptians are angry at the slow pace of change since President Hosni Mubarak resigned on February 11 after protests. "The vendors always existed in Tahrir, but today around 6 p.m. they joined dozens of armed men in plainclothes who attacked us with swords, sticks and threw cooking gas canisters at our tents in the center of the square," said Kareem El Agami, a protester living in the tents since the sit-in started on June 28.
