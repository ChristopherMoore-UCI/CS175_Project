A recent Treasury Department report of misconduct by a banking regulator is giving watchdogs some ammunition to argue that financial regulators are too cozy with the banks they are tasked with overseeing. In another, an employee was found to have emailed internal information about Treasury contracting to her husband, who worked for a contractor. Treasury officials referred five of the six cases to criminal prosecutors, although charges were not ultimately filed. "These are isolated incidences, and do not diminish the highly ethical behavior of thousands of other OCC employees," the agency said in a written statement. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency responded that it attaches great importance to ethical conduct, and any alleged misconduct is investigated.
