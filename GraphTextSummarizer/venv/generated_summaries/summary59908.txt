-- Over the past month, video has emerged from the Syrian city of Homs showing killings and other atrocities apparently committed by security forces in neighborhoods that have opposed the government. The Syrian government has in the past blamed armed gangs for such attacks. In an adjacent room, they find more bodies next to each other in a corner, as though they had been trying to hide. The camera pans to show more bodies in the bathroom. Beside the pile of bodies, about a foot above the slumped third body, the white wall is splattered red.
