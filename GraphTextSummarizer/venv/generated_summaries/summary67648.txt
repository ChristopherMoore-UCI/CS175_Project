"I hope they (Republicans) will show the American people that they are more interested in creating jobs than defeating President Obama," Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada said in a statement. According to Obama, the purpose of the proposed jobs legislation is "to put more people back to work and more money in the pockets of those who are working." White House spokesman Jay Carney told CNN that Obama will send Congress jobs plan legislation next week. "It will create more jobs for construction workers, more jobs for teachers, more jobs for veterans, and more jobs for the long-term unemployed," Obama said. Republicans call for corporate tax cuts and deregulation as steps to spur job growth, opposing what they label new stimulus spending.
