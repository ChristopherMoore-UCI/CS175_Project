Let me live" Other probation violation charge Brown punched Rihanna inside a rented Lamborghini on a Hollywood street, leaving her face bruised and bloody on the eve of the Grammy Awards in February 2009. The hit and run charge threatens Brown's freedom since it led a judge to revoke his probation last week in connection with his conviction in the beating of his girlfriend, Rihanna. A Brown representative said last week that the singer expected all of the charges to be dropped and probation reinstated this week. In a court filing in February 2013, prosecutors accused Brown of not completing the community labor. Geragos, Brown's attorney, said the prosecutor's filing was so fraudulent that he would ask the judge to punish the deputy district attorneys involved and call for a contempt of court hearing for filing false documents with the court.
