-- Security forces rescued a U.S. citizen from the Taliban on Sunday during an operation in eastern Afghanistan, officials said. He was believed to be in imminent danger of injury or death, which is why Gen. John Allen, commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, ordered the mission. Dr. Dilip Joseph was kidnapped Wednesday by insurgents in Kabul province, the NATO-led International Assistance Security Force said in statement. "Today's mission exemplifies our unwavering commitment to defeating the Taliban," Allen said in a statement. Thanks to them, Dr. Joseph will soon be rejoining his family and loved ones.
