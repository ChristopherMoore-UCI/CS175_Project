Government surveillance of telephone records and conversations in the name of national security has long been controversial. U.S. officials have acknowledged collecting domestic telephone records containing the time and date of calls and telephone numbers involved. The court operates in secrecy, reviewing requests by intelligence agencies to conduct electronic surveillance and other activities as part of espionage, terrorism and national security investigations. The Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with NSA activities, reported Friday that the agency has also collected credit card records. The debate, which dates back decades, is back in the news with recent revelations that the U.S. government is collecting telephone records in the United States and some Internet traffic overseas.
