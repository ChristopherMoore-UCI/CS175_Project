The Atchafalaya crested at more than six feet above flood stage at Morgan City, about 80 miles west of New Orleans, and forecasters are projecting a long, steady decline, said Shawn O'Neil, a meteorologist at the Weather Service office in Slidell. -- Louisiana's swollen Atchafalaya River was slowly receding along its entire length Tuesday after federal authorities flooded it to save the Mississippi River cities of New Orleans and Baton Rouge The Army Corps of Engineers began diverting water from the Mississippi into the Atchafalaya basin on May 14 by opening the Morganza Spillway above Baton Rouge. Some businesses along the waterfront outside the sea wall flooded, but the sea wall -- and a massive barge sunk into nearby Bayou Chene -- prevented high water from reaching neighborhoods in and around the area, Breaux said. The river's peak at Morgan City was 10.35 feet -- barely two inches below its historic high-water mark in 1973 -- "and now it's slowly, slowly falling," O'Neil said.
