A federal judge on Wednesday denied Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's bid to move the location of his upcoming trial, even while moving back its scheduled start date. Explaining his decision to have a jury weigh Tsarnaev's fate near where the bombings and subsequent violent incidents with police occurred, U.S. District Judge George O'Toole said, "Although the media coverage in this case has been extensive, at this stage the defendant has failed to show that it has so inflamed and pervasively prejudiced the pool that a fair and impartial jury cannot be impaneled in the (eastern division of the District of Massachusetts). With his older brother Tamerlan, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is accused of planting two explosives hidden inside backpacks on April 15, 2013, along downtown Boston's busy Boylston Street near the marathon's finish line. " O'Toole's ruling means that the trial in one of the most scarring episodes in Boston history will stay in Boston. The attention spurred Dzhokhar Tsarnaev to ask for his trial to be moved out of Massachusetts, his lawyers arguing "that pretrial publicity and public sentiment" jeopardized his opportunity for a fair trial.
