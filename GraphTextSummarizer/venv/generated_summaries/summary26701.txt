"The North Dakota strict ban on abortions at the time when a 'heartbeat' has been detected -- essentially banning all abortions as early as six weeks of pregnancy -- cannot withstand a constitutional challenge," U.S. District Judge Daniel L. Hovland wrote in his decision. But women should not be forced to go to court, year after year in state after state, to protect their constitutional rights. Statutory time limits on when abortions can take place, however, vary from state to state. The ruling was also praised by the director of the Red River Women's Clinic, the only clinic providing abortions in North Dakota. "We hope today's decision, along with the long line of decisions striking down these attempts to choke off access to safe and legal abortion services in the U.S., sends a strong message to politicians across the country that our rights cannot be legislated away," said Nancy Northup, that group's president and CEO.
