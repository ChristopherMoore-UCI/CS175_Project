There are some areas that BACTEC operations manager Johan Hann can mark as "cleared" on a map in his office. -- Diab Diab lost an eye and part of a leg trying to clear unexploded bombs from the fields of southern Lebanon. Countries such as the United States, Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom and the United Arab Emirates all pledged to help Lebanon clear the landmines, cluster bombs and other unexploded ordnance left by Israeli forces as they withdrew from their conflict with Hezbollah in the summer of 2006. They leave behind thousands of acres of land around the villages that they haven't been able to check and an untold number of bombs, perhaps still waiting for a victim. Land has to be cleared field by field, section by section and yard by yard.
