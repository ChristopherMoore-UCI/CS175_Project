Tuesday, Customs and Border Protection Deputy Commissioner David Aguilar noted that Ivie "died in the line of duty, protecting our nation against those who threaten our way of life. He was released from the hospital Wednesday, said Jeremy Copeland, an agent with the Tucson Sector of U.S. Border Patrol. The agents came under fire near Naco, Arizona, Tuesday after responding to a sensor that had gone off near the border, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency said. Customs and Border Protection "appreciates the support it has received from its law enforcement partners and community members from around the nation," Copeland added. James Turgal, special agent in charge of the FBI for the Phoenix division, declined to say whether the agents involved in the incident returned fire.
