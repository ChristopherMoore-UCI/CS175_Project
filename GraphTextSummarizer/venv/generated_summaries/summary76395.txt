BMW Oracle won the America's Cup as victory in Sunday's second race off Valencia against Swiss holders Alinghi gave them an unassailable 2-0 lead in the best-of-three series. Alinghi, who won the trophy with a 5-2 win over Team New Zealand in Valencia in 2007, dropped a possible protest after the second race as the result was confirmed. Ellison was on board as they clinched victory by a margin of five minutes and 26 seconds, underlining their superiority against Alinghi, who made a series of uncharacteristic errors in both races off the Spanish coast. The syndicate, founded by software magnate Larry Ellison, is the first American team to win yachting's most prestigious trophy since 1992. Light winds meant the start of Sunday's race was delayed for six hours, but when racing got underway Alinghi were again at a disadvantage having been penalized before the start, as in Friday's defeat.
