By mid-morning Friday, feeds on Facebook, Twitter and Google+ were filling with Rorschach answers, or jokes (Rorschach, the spotted-faced character in the Watchmen graphic novel and movie, was a popular one). Google's page allowed users to click through a series of inkblot images and share their interpretations of them on social media. Some mental-health experts believe the answers can reveal personality characteristics and disorders. Traditionally the test requires a person to look at a series of abstract inkblots and describe what they see. The doodle celebrates the 129th birthday of Hermann Rorschach, the Swiss psychoanalyst who developed the famous test.
