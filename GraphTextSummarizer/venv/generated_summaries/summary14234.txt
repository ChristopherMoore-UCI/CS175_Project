"I've always liked puzzle games -- 'Tetris' and games like that." Players also can share their "Candy Crush" progress with friends via Facebook -- something that Byler was reluctant to do at first because he was weary of friends posting "FarmVille" updates. The game's cruelly seductive nature has even inspired a spoof trailer for a fake film, "Candy Crush: The Movie," about people grappling with their addictions to "Candy Crush," "Temple Run" and other mobile games. Casual mobile games appeal to people like Enright because unlike traditional console games, they can be played in bite-sized chunks while waiting for a bus. "I didn't want to be that guy," said Byler, who limits his "Candy Crush" public postings to other players within the game itself. Like predecessor "Bejeweled," to which it's often compared, "Candy Crush" requires players to form chains of brightly colored tiles -- shaped like jelly beans, lemon drops and other candy pieces -- to earn points and advance.
