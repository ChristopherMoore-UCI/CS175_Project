The work will take about a week and will cost less than $10,000, said Knights spokesman Patrick Korten. -- The message from President John F. Kennedy's January 20, 1961, inaugural address has withstood the test of time, but not the elements at his grave site at Arlington National Cemetery. Words from other Kennedy speeches also are on the wall, which was erected in 1965. The original engraving was done by master stone mason John Everett Benson, who was on hand Thursday to advise workers. The organization also is sponsoring a high school essay contest to mark the 50th anniversary of Kennedy's inaugural address.
