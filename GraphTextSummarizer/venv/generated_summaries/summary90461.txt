-- After turning a traditional Senegalese drink into a hit American product, Magatte Wade is now trying re-brand Africa itself. Wade says that when it comes to marketing an African product it's not just about selling units, it's about selling a different image of Africa to consumers. Senegalese entrepreneur Magatte Wade is the creator of multi-million dollar U.S. company Adina World Beat Beverages, which makes drinks based on traditional recipes from around the world. It's a high-end skin care line based on traditional Senegalese recipes, using natural ingredients indigenous to Africa. "But self-esteem will also come if enough of us today that are in the age of working, if enough of us can really get together and try and build a different brand for Africa, a brand that all of a sudden means 'contributors to the world,' rather than a subset of a population that's always sucking energy out of others.
