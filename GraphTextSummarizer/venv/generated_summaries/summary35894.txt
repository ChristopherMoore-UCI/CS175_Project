You're bound for Bainbridge Island -- an antidote to Seattle's big-city bustle and an introduction to Puget Sound island life. Now that you've had a glimpse of island life, Puget style, we know you'll be back. Two of the most exquisite: Waterfall Gardens, a 5-acre retreat with spring-fed ponds, waterfalls and gardens, and Skiff Point Guest House, with a 180-degree view of Puget Sound. 9 a.m. Wake up with traditional morning fare at Richie's 305 Diner or Streamliner Diner. Doc's Marina Grill, along the waterfront, serves some of the best fish-and-chips on Puget Sound.
