Dialogue will help the countries understand each other's nuclear doctrine, Pakistan's state-run agency cited foreign office spokesman Abdul Basit as saying. Earlier this year, New Delhi and Islamabad agreed to resume peace talks frozen by the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks. -- Representatives of India and Pakistan on Tuesday will hold the second day of two-day talks on conventional and nuclear weapons, Indian officials said. In 2004, the nations agreed to negotiations that cover eight issues, including Kashmir, terrorism and Pakistan's concerns over river dams on the Indian side of the border. No major developments were expected from the high-level talks, which are being held in Pakistan's capital, Islamabad.
