Earlier Saturday at least 28 people were wounded in a U.S. attack on a building near a hospital in Baghdad's sprawling Sadr City area, an Iraqi Interior Ministry official said. U.S. military officials confirmed firing two Hellfire missiles at a rooftop in the vicinity about the same time that the boy said the attack took place. On Friday, U.S. forces killed eight suspected militants during 10 hours of fighting in the Shiite neighborhood, a military statement said. The southern portion of Sadr City has been walled off so that U.S. military and Iraqi security forces can control movements there. The number of U.S. military deaths in the Iraq war stands at 4,066, including eight Defense Department contractors.
