-- Another person has been added to the list of suspects in the January killing of a Hamas leader in a Dubai hotel, bringing the number of identified suspects to 27, two sources told CNN on Monday. Also Monday, the sources said the UAE central bank is working with other nations to track funding and 14 credit cards -- issued mostly by a United States bank -- used by the suspects in different places, including the United States. Twelve of the suspects used British passports, police said. The 27 suspects are believed to have acquired false passports to travel to Dubai for the killing, then scattered to several far-flung locations afterward. Earlier Monday, sources in Dubai said two of the suspects ultimately entered the United States after al-Mabhouh's death, confirming a story originally reported by the Wall Street Journal.
