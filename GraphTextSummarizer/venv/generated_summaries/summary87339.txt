According to the police union, Pantaleo comes from a family of public servants: his father is a retired New York City firefighter, and his uncle was an officer with the NYPD. On Wednesday, a grand jury decided not to indict Pantaleo for his role in Garner's death -- a controversial decision that's sparked protests in New York and across the country.
