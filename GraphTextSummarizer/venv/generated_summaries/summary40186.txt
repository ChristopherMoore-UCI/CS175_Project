The vote, which required two-thirds approval by UNESCO members, passed with 107 in favor, 14 against, and 52 abstentions. Susan Rice, the U.N. ambassador to the United Nations, posted on her Twitter account: "Today's vote to grant Palestinian membership in UNESCO is no substitute for direct negotiations, but it is deeply damaging to UNESCO. "Any recognition of Palestine as a Member State would not only jeopardize the hope for a resumption of direct Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, but (it) would endanger the United States' contribution to UNESCO," said an October 13 letter signed by members of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on State and Foreign Operations, which appropriates UNESCO's U.S. funding. Killion did not say what could happen to U.S. funding for UNESCO. Sadly, during the time we are trying to form a Palestinian state with a peace agreement they are trying to form a state without an agreement." David Killion, the U.S. permanent representative to UNESCO, said the United States "cannot accept the premature Palestinian admission for membership in a United Nations specialized agency such as UNESCO."
