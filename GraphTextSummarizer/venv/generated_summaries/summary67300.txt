Jarrett's study was carried out on "senior" golfers, with an average age of 68, but he said the findings on mood change tied in with other studies carried out on younger recreational golfers. One of the researchers, Haydn Jarrett, senior lecturer in sport and exercise science at the University of Worcester, told CNN that the study also showed that golfers reported feeling more fatigued and less vigorous after playing golf, as most players walked an average 10.2 km during a game. He has carried out unpublished work showing that a round of golf can give a significant reduction in blood pressure. The secret of dealing with golf stress is to get on top of your thoughts, says Thompson. "If we wanted golfers to enjoy it more fully it might be nice to engage with golfers and bring potential negative moods to their attention."
