"If it is now possible -- and Mr. Bulger seriously questions whether it will be possible -- for Mr. Bulger to receive a fair trial, law enforcement leaks of non-public information must end, with disclosures of information limited to the judicial process," his interim attorney, Peter Krupp, wrote. Prosecutors asked Wolf to require both William Bulger and a third Bulger brother, John Bulger, to submit affidavits before a decision is made. Ahead of Tuesday's hearing, prosecutors asked a judge to dismiss Bulger from the earlier racketeering indictment. Bulger appeared in court in orange jail coveralls Tuesday. "He has every incentive to lie and stick the taxpayers with the bill for his defense," prosecutors wrote in court papers filed Tuesday.
