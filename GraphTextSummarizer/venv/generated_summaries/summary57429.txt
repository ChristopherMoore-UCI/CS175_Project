-- Six years removed from the death of their son -- former NFL star Pat Tillman -- in Afghanistan, Patrick and Mary Tillman say they haven't gotten the full truth from the U.S. Army and don't expect to. "The Army truly regrets the pain and suffering endured by the Tillman family as a result of this tragic, friendly fire accident and the shortfalls in reporting accurate information to them in the days and weeks after Pat's death." Mary Tillman also is the author of the book "Boots on the Ground by Dusk: My Tribute to Pat Tillman." "No, we don't know the whole truth," Mary Tillman said on CNN's "Larry King Live" Monday night. Mary Tillman took issue with the Army's characterization of events.
