The headmistress was deeply committed to the education of women and understood that STEM subjects must be taught in a way connects their inherent creativity and relationships with the real world, rather than dry data to be memorized and regurgitated on standardized tests. The teachers who taught sciences in the school I went to as a young girl in Baghdad were all professors from the university, so the standards of science courses were really incredible. Our design for the new Mathematics Gallery at London's Science Museum will convey these seemingly abstract concepts into an inspiring interactive experience for all visitors. Her work includes the London Aquatics Centre, the Sheikh Zayed Bridge and Beijing's Galaxy Soho shopping center. Huge advances in design technology are enabling us to rethink form and space, and the wonderfully fluid surfaces and structures of each project are defined by scientific innovations.
