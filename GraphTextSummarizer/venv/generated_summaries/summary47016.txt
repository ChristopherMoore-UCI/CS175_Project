The bigger cities, which have other water sources, are no longer allowed to pull from Lake Spence, but even with only Robert Lee pumping water, if it doesn't rain the town can expect to run dry "around the first of the year or March, maybe," he said. Tropical Storm Don teased Texas last weekend, making landfall between Beaumont and Corpus Christi, but it petered out into a tropical depression far, far away from West Texas and shriveling water sources like Lake Spence, some 250 miles west of Dallas. San Angelo also is home to the nearest operating car wash -- a luxury by Robert Lee standards these days, the mayor said. In normal times, Lake E.V. Spence is a teeming 14,600-acre reservoir with a maximum depth of 108 feet, just west of the town of Robert Lee, Texas. "I don't know where you go to find someone who has excess water," Jacobs told KWES.
