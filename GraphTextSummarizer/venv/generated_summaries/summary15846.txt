-- Actress Daryl Hannah was arrested Tuesday during a sit-in in front of the White House protesting a pipeline expansion project that would significantly increase the amount of oil the United States imports from Canada's controversial Alberta oil sands. The State Department is set to issue what could be a final ruling to allow a massive new pipeline expansion from central Alberta to the Gulf of Mexico. A decision is expected by the end of the year, State Department spokeswoman Heide Fulton said at a briefing last month. Canada's oil sands have drawn numerous critics who say the way the oil is extracted harms the environment. A representative for the actress was unaware of the arrest when contacted by CNN Tuesday afternoon.
