A steady stream of typhoon survivors arrived at Tacloban airport, looking for food, water and escape. Crews search for victims, survivors Romualdez, Tacloban's mayor, told CNN that reports 10,000 people may have died in Leyte province were "entirely possible. We are looking for as many as we can," Tacloban Mayor Alfred Romualdez told CNN. "In the western islands of Philippines, for instance, no one can evaluate the casualties," said ICRC spokesman David Pierre Marquet. This is really the basic income of many people."
