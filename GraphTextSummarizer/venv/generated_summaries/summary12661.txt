Had Burdell, a 36-year-old attorney, not died on April 2, 1985, shot to death by Ronnie Lee Gardner during Gardner's escape attempt at a Salt Lake City courthouse, they would have been married. "Michael Burdell would not have wanted Ronnie Lee Gardner put to death," Nu said in court documents. But Nu, along with Burdell's friend, Ron Temu, and his 86-year-old father, Joseph Burdell, are now arguing on Gardner's behalf. Nu said in her statement she met Burdell while the two were living in Arizona and she was making frequent trips to the Summum center in Utah. According to court documents filed by Gardner's defense, he had planned to use a gun that would be left hanging from a water fountain in the basement of the courthouse.
