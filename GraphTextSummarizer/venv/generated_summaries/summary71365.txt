Putting a dark matter experiment deep underground quiets the noise by screening out lots of particles other than dark matter. So, a distant galaxy that just happens to line up behind a nearby, massive cluster of galaxies looks strangely elongated. As detectors improved even more and telescopes got bigger, more arcs were seen, typically behind clusters of galaxies. Whatever these young scientists end up doing in the future -- and with the skills they learn, they could do just about anything -- they made an important step toward direct detection of dark matter particles. You can't see it, touch it, smell it, throw a net over it, or tag it in the ways particle physicists deal with ordinary particles.
