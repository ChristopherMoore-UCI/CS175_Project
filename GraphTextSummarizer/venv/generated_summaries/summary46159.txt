Trains and cars must share an uneasy co-existence here in the nation that railroads built, and for many drivers -- especially those who live near active tracks -- the act of crossing them also comes with a brief pause, perhaps mindful of the 3,000 tons of angry steel that could theoretically be barreling toward them. Short of running it underground or up on viaducts, there is no way to run a railroad across open land in the United States without crossing multiple surface streets and country lanes, putting the unwary at risk of being flattened by oncoming trains. An average of about five people each week are killed in train collisions, far more than those who lose their lives in commercial airline crashes. Better driver education and the painfully slow attempts by railroads and states to upgrade faulty crossing equipment have shown results over the last four decades. State and local governments are responsible for keeping crossings safe and equipment up to date, but railroads can be complicit in allowing conditions to deteriorate to dangerous levels.
