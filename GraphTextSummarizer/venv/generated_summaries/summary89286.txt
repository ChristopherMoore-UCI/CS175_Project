" 'Angel's Gate' by P.G. Sturges Dick Henry, aka the Shortcut Man, is back in P.G. Sturges' latest noir novel, "Angel's Gate," a romp through the seamy underside of Los Angeles. There are a slew of new titles hitting shelves in May and a few recent releases you may have missed; from spies to private eyes, World War II history to werewolves and a new riff on Sherlock Holmes. That said, any Holmes fan would enjoy Michael Robertson's fresh new take on the Holmes stories in "The Baker Street Translation," the latest in his series of books about the brothers of Baker Street. The real struggle here is the nearly five months the crash survivors spent stranded on the ice, battling blizzards and sub-zero temperatures. The concept is clever, Reggie and Nigel Heath are siblings who lease law offices at London's 221B Baker Street, where they get mail addressed to the building's best known, albeit fictional resident.
