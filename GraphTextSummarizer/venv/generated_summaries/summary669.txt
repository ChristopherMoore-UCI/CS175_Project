-- Dragon boats, a floating belfry and the royal barge are among more than 1,000 vessels preparing to transform London's River Thames into a spectacular floating tribute to the 60-year reign of Queen Elizabeth II. Fashions and treats fit for a queen Next will come passenger boats, pleasure boats, historic wooden vessels -- the oldest built in 1740 -- and boats carrying members of the armed forces, police and fire services. Sailing boats that are too tall to pass under the 14 bridges along the river pageant route will line the river from London Bridge to Wapping, in the east, creating an avenue of sails set against the Tower of London and the city's financial center. What's on during Diamond Jubilee weekend After gathering upriver in west London, the seven-mile long flotilla will wend its majestic way from Battersea Bridge to Tower Bridge, passing through the heart of Britain's capital city over the course of several hours. London's Metropolitan Police said as many as 6,000 extra officers would be on patrol during jubilee events.
