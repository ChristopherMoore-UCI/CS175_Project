China is entering a period of tough economic transition. With its proposed Asian Free Trade Zone, along with building diverse energy supply links through Russia and central Asia, China is engaged in staking out discrete spaces where it can move without being hedged in. Of course, all this might change one day, when China really feels it has to demand more international strategic space and sees the United States as an impediment to that. And while separating the sound and fury from the truth is tough, on the fight against terrorism, the need to find sustainable economic growth, preserving a benign, stable international environment, and increasing predictability in the global financial governance system, China and the United States often pretend they are much further apart than they actually are. Having as many friends as possible is Xi's diplomatic priority, after years of brittle tensions with so many countries around China's land and maritime borders.
