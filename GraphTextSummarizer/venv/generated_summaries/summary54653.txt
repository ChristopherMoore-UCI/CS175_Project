The Supreme Court appeared cautiously willing to uphold its decades-old precedent giving labor unions the power to collect dues for collective bargaining from public sector workers, even those who choose not to join the union. Two years ago, in a related case, the court hinted it may be willing to rethink its views on union fees in the larger context of free speech. And they say unions negotiating with the state naturally involve matters of public concern, which deserve greater protection from compelled free speech and association. State says union representation helps all The state argues state-compelled union representation has increased wages and benefits, reduced turnover and improved training and supervision for home-care workers who typically do not operate in a centralized workplace. But such fees cannot be used by unions to support purely political activities, such as backing electoral candidates.
