King George VI (Colin Firth) -- father of the present Queen Elizabeth -- found his own Dr. Strangelove in Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush), a wildly eccentric Australian speech therapist who made it possible for the stammering monarch to go on radio in 1939 and rally his subjects to support the declaration of war on Hitler's Germany. Lionel treats speech lessons like therapy sessions, pushing for details about life in the royal family. Rolling Stone: Peter Travers' holiday movie preview: Ten movies for escapism this season Firth's nuanced brilliance is a thing of bruised beauty. The scene in which Lionel's wife, Myrtle (Jennifer Ehle), meets the king has a special poignancy, if you remember Ehle and Firth as lovers in TV's "Pride and Prejudice." "The King's Speech" doesn't have the budget to show coronations and pomp, but it misses nothing in resonant intimacy. What he gets is a portrait of a blowhard father, George V (Michael Gambon), and a taunting brother, Edward VIII (Guy Pearce is absolutely stellar), who reduces the proud, vulnerable Albert to rubble by committing the one unforgivable sin: Edward abdicates the throne to marry American divorcee Wallis Simpson (Eve Best), leaving Bertie to succeed him.
