Parents Joe and Katherine Jackson attended court Tuesday, along with their daughter, LaToya Jackson and youngest son, Randy Jackson. White ruled out the possibility that Murray would have injected the fatal dose unless "he wanted to potentially harm Mr. Jackson." -- Lawyers in the Conrad Murray manslaughter trial will take Wednesday off from court to prepare their closing arguments, a day after the doctor declined to testify in his defense in the death of singer Michael Jackson. The prosecution contends that Murray's use of the surgical anesthetic propofol to treat Jackson's insomnia in his home deviated from the standards of care expected of a doctor so egregiously that it made him criminally responsible for Jackson's death. The prosecution contends greed led Murray to leave his medical practice and put his ethics aside to serve as Jackson's private doctor for $150,000 a month.
