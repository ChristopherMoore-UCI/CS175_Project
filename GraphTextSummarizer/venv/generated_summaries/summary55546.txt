The International Campaign for Tibet, which promotes human rights for Tibetan people, reported Monday that thousands of Tibetans had marched on government offices before the police opened fire into the crowd, killing at least three protesters and wounding nine. -- China on Tuesday criticized human rights groups' accounts of a violent clash between Tibetan protesters and the Chinese police, accusing them of trying to "distort the truth. Tibetans in the mountainous region of Ganzi, have called for more freedom and the return of the Dalai Lama, their spiritual leader who fled to India during an uprising against Chinese rule in 1959. Free Tibet, a London-based group that campaigns for Tibetan independence, said that one person was killed and as many as 30 others wounded by gunfire from the Chinese security forces. "The attempts of overseas secessionist groups involving Tibet to distort the truth and discredit the Chinese government will not succeed," Xinhua said Tuesday, citing Hong Lei, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry.
