"I do think he is in a vulnerable position on Iraq because of his last name," she said, conceding that the public perception of the Bush legacy on foreign policy was a wider problem for his party, not just Jeb Bush. Democrats are vowing to tether him to the controversial decisions of his brother, President George W. Bush, who they blame for starting a war in Iraq on false pretenses and for presiding over a disastrous occupation that cost trillions of dollars, thousands of U.S. and Iraqi lives and destabilized the region. " Bush seems to be happy to engage in war talk if it centers on Obama's missteps, which may offer him a chance to turn the conversation on Iraq away from simply yet another fight over his brother's legacy. "There is no question that Gov. Bush has to talk about Iraq at some point," said Peter Feaver, who was a leading official responsible for Iraq on George W. Bush's National Security Council and is now at Duke University. Bush is wading into foreign policy at a crucial time, when it appears that public opinion on issues of war could be shifting.
