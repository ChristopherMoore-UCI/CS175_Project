Alexis Sanchez netted a hat-trick for the home team, which was still without multiple world player of the year Lionel Messi -- although he has looked sharp in his return to training -- and didn't start Brazilian ace Neymar. Roma was out of sorts and Daniele de Rossi received a straight red in the 75th minute for his two-footed tackle on Italian international teammate Giorgio Chiellini. AC Milan plays Monday but manager Max Allegri confirmed Sunday that he would be leaving when his contract expires at the end of the season. Milan currently sits 13th in Serie A, much closer to relegation than Juventus, and was paired with Spanish high-flyer Atletico Madrid in the next round of the Champions League. It was the same knee that has troubled the Italian international in recent years and forced him to miss Euro 2012.
