As an agency of the U.S. government, the FTC can enforce federal laws but does not have the power to prosecute criminal cases on its own, instead referring cases to the FBI or a U.S. attorney's office. We are by now familiar with the concept of what's broadly known as "revenge porn," that is, posting explicit images online of people -- women, mostly -- without their knowledge or permission. That's because revenge porn isn't a federal crime -- Brittain was found in violation of the Federal Trade Commission Act, not in violation of criminal law. The Federal Trade Commission released a statement saying it had barred Craig Brittain, a Colorado man, from posting nude images of women to his website without their written consent. Currently, 16 states have laws addressing revenge porn, though some are broader than others.
