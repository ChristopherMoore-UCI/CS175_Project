-- President Barack Obama unveiled initiatives Saturday in education and health for war veterans and highlighted how his administration has reduced by 20% the government's woeful backlog of veterans' disability claims. One attendee, Kathie DiCesare, who maintains a blog about PTSD and military suicides, said Americans aren't fully aware of the suicide rates among veterans, and she criticized Obama for not holding his joint chiefs accountable for the epidemic. Obama made his remarks in Orlando, Florida, before more than 3,000 people attending the annual convention of Disabled American Veterans, an advocacy group deploring the one- or even two-year delays of processing disability claims and urging more mental health care for returning servicemen. We're not going to let up until we eliminate the backlog once and for all," Obama told a gathering of disabled veterans in Florida. Obama also rolled out another initiative with 250 higher-education institutions to help war veterans complete their degrees.
