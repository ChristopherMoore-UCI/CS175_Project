This scheme ended up claiming the life of a 3-week old baby, who was shot in a stroller by gang members targeting a street vendor who refused to pay $50 to members of Columbia Lil' Cycos, a "clique" of the 18th Street gang, said the U.S. Attorney's Office for Central California in a press release. "The members of the 18th Street Gang, including those convicted today, thought that they controlled neighborhoods and territory within this city," U.S. Attorney AndrÃ© Birotte Jr. said. "Today's verdicts prove otherwise, and law enforcement at every level will work together to continue to make our streets safe." Prosecutors argued that Columbia Lil' Cycos pressured "narcotics suppliers and street dealers" to give them money -- typically, a cut of their sales -- in order to hawk drugs in an area adjoining MacArthur Park in the Westlake district of Los Angeles. According to evidence presented in court, Hernandez as well as Vladimir and Leonidas Iraheta made "thousands of dollars a week extorting the street vendors," the U.S. Attorney's Office said. -- Four gang members potentially face life in prison without parole after being convicted Friday of using violence and intimidation to extort "rents" from drug dealers and suppliers on their Los Angeles turf,
