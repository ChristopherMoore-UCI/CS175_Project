And mom is now more adept at navigating Apple TV than I am -- when she's babysitting Kylie and a request (read: demand) comes down for the YouTube rendition of "Twinkle Twinkle" featuring the little owl, mom will bring it up on the TV screen quicker than you can say, "Holy diaper rash." From their homes in Victoria, British Columbia, and the remote Pender Island, they watched Kylie slap her teeny hand into her cake's white frosting as everyone sang happy birthday. Becoming grandparents isn't the sole reason my parents have become technically savvy -- mom had a Kindle before Kylie came along -- but it has likely sped things up. Unable to attend Kylie's first birthday party, they watched us from laptops we set up on top of bookshelves. Dad will pick up colorful objects -- a Buzz Lightyear figurine, a sombrero, a bird feeder -- and move them toward his laptop's tiny camera lens, making Kylie squeal or say, "What's that funny thing, Granddad?"
