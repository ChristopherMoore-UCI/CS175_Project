Cee's resignation followed the posting on YouTube of a video in which a cross-dressing personality using the name Bimbo Winehouse plays an audio recording of a seven-minute encounter purportedly with Mister Cee. Hot 97 General Manager Alexandra Cameron, in a statement to CNN on Wednesday, said the station and Cee parted company after 20 years because of "some personal circumstances that have become public. " Cee said in the interview Thursday that he was addicted to prostitutes and strippers. Station spokeswoman Lindsay Salandra confirmed to CNN that Cee was working his air shift Thursday afternoon, but she said she had not heard from the general manager if he was back permanently. -- A day after Mister Cee told listeners he was quitting his job at New York's Hot 97, the veteran hip-hop DJ was back on the air.
