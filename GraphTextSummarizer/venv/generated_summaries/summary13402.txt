Jordan feels that would put them in a dangerous situation with possible missile strikes from Syria and terror strikes precipitated by the Syrian regime. And a senior diplomat told journalists that if there is a strike against Syria it would be as a sanction for the regime's defiance of the international agreement to never use chemical weapons and not an attempt to change the course of the Syrian civil war. CNN correspondents and experts explain the different positions of some key nations involved in preparing for -- or warning against -- international military attacks on Syria. The rhetoric is ratcheting up with talk of punishing Syria, even though Syria denies using chemical weapons. France has taken a very forward leaning position on punishing Syria for its apparent use of chemical weapons against its own citizens -- maybe that's because of its colonial era ties to the Middle East or because it sees its itself as a global force for good.
