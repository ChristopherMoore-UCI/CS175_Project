World No. 1 Serena Williams -- trying for a seventh title in Miami -- plays Australian Open champion Li Na. Miami time Friday with pain in his stomach. Nishikori had upset 17-time grand slam champion Roger Federer in the quarterfinals Wednesday and 2013 Miami finalist David Ferrer in a three-hour battle a day earlier. His third-round opponent, Florian Mayer, was a walkover because of a groin injury and the Serb progressed Friday after Kei Nishikori withdrew -- with a groin injury. Former Wimbledon finalist Tomas Berdych was then unable to take on Nadal in the second semifinal due to a stomach illness, leaving spectators with no singles action to watch.
