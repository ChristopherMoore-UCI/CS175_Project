-- As a lifelong resident of South Central Los Angeles, I refuse to be part of the social system that breeds problems rather than solutions. My vision is that gardening can do that -- and my organization has been planting gardens in South Central, including ones on city-owned land. South Central is a "food desert" where the lack of healthy food alternatives leads to obesity and preventable disease. Our society -- not just South Central -- suffers from social corrosion. Change begins with youth and healthy role models.
