The families of two boys allegedly shot to death by a U.S. consular employee as they tried to rob him have filed a complaint with Lahore police against the American, accusing him of two murders, a police spokesman said. Rana said the man surrendered to police and was in custody. In addition, Rana said, a car from the U.S. consulate was involved in an accident that killed a motorcyclist while it was en route to the police station in response to the shooting incident. Rodriguez, however, could not say whether the man was in police custody or whether he had been turned over to the consulate. Nayab Haider said the complaint, called a "first information report," triggers an official investigation by police, who will submit their findings to a court.
