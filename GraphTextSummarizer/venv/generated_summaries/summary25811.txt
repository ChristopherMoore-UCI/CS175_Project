-- President Barack Obama stood by new controversial screening measures Saturday, calling methods such as pat-downs and body scans necessary to assure airline safety. In a public statement released Saturday, TSA Administrator John Pistole spelled out the new security measures and offered tips to those flying this Thanksgiving week. The president said such methods are needed after what happened December 25, 2009, when Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab of Nigeria allegedly boarded a flight from Amsterdam to Detroit with a bomb hidden in his underwear. In Portugal, the president vowed he'd try to find a way to make passengers feel more both comfortable and safe, whether it is through the current policies or with new ones. Abdulmutallab reportedly failed to set off the bomb, which metal detectors didn't detect, though his attempt led to airport screening procedures that have caused a holiday travel uproar.
