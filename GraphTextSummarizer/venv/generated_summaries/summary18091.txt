It is 2013, yet we are fighting for civil rights for disabled individuals, fighting so young adolescents can have access to equal opportunities Sports are something that every adolescent should have access to -- regardless of gender, regardless of race and regardless of disability. With the U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights placing this mandate it is my hope it will raise awareness of sport for individuals with disabilities and open the eyes of disabled adolescents to the opportunities which are out there for them. This new change will allow disable student athletes access to sports, something that in my opinion is a no-brainer, something that should have been in place years ago. This directive requires schools to make reasonable modifications to allow disable students equal access to sport. I traveled with the team, competed in duel meets and even our conference meet.
