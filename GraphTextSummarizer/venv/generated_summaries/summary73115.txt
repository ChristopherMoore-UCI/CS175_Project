" Redknapp guided Tottenham to fourth place in the Premier League last season but the club missed out on European Champions League qualification after Chelsea won the continent's premier club competition. -- English Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur have confirmed the appointment of former Chelsea manager Andre Villas-Boas as their new head coach. That triumph, overseen by Villas-Boas' successor at Stamford Bridge, former player Roberto Di Matteo, meant Chelsea took Tottenham's place by virtue of being crowned champions. Prior to his spell at Stamford Bridge Villas-Boas enjoyed a record-breaking first season at Portuguese club Porto, winning a domestic double as well as the Europa League. The 34-year-old lasted just nine months at Tottenham's London rivals, and was sacked in March after a run of disappointing results left them languishing in sixth place in the league.
