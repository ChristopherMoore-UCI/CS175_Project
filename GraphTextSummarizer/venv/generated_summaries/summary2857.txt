"Bones" star Emily Deschanel and her husband, "It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia"'s David Hornsby, welcomed their first child Wednesday, a baby boy named Henry Hornsby, Deschanel's rep confirms to PEOPLE exclusively. "Yay yay yay!!! In April, shortly after her sister Emily announced her pregnancy, Zooey Deschanel could hardly contain her excitement, Tweeting: "I am super excited to be an aunt!" Deschanel, 34, and Hornsby were married in 2010. :o)" But he's surely not the only one celebrating Henry's arrival.
