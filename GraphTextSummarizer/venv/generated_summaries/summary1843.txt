It ruled that Briatore and his chief engineer Pat Symonds, who was given a five-year ban, ordered Renault driver Nelson Piquet Jr. to deliberately crash his car to help his teammate Fernando Alonso to win F1's first-ever night race in Singapore. Former Renault team boss Briatore was handed the ban last September by the World Motor Sport Council following an enquiry ordered by governing body, the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA). The court decision came soon after Renault, handed a two-year suspended ban at the FIA hearing over the Singapore incident, announced that Frenchman Eric Bouillier had been appointed as Briatore's replacement as team principal. The team is attempting to restore its reputation in the aftermath of the Singapore incident, which came to light after Piquet Jr. was sacked and then went public with his admission of involvement. "The decision of the World Council was presided over by the FIA president, who was well-known to be in conflict with Briatore, with Mr Mosley having played a leading role in launching the inquiry and its investigation in violation of the principle of separation of the power of the bodies," its judgment said.
