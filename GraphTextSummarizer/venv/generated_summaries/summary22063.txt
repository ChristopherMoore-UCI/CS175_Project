Gacuca said Saturday that protesters aren't "interested in seizing property -- we are interested in justice and expressing our frustrations. "In a country where all people can vote and Trinity's door to dialogue is open, it is not necessary to forcibly break into property," Archbishop Desmond Tutu said in a statement Friday. Earlier, Occupy Wall Street protesters gathered in Duarte Park for speeches and music. Protesters called Saturday "part of a call to re-occupy in the wake of the coordinated attacks and subsequent evictions of occupations across the nation and around the world," according to their website. The fence protected an area of Duarte Park that is owned by Trinity Church.
