The ride with House on July 9 became a 40-mile drive to the mobile home he shared with girlfriend Kendra Tooley in the small town of Stewartsville and the victim decided she wanted to leave, according to a police affidavit. " Throughout July and August, police said, House and Tooley kept their victim bound to the bed with zip ties or with "an intricate restraint system." Tooley told police that House, whom she described as "a sadist," was "attempting to impregnate (the victim) because (Tooley) was old and unable to have children of her own." "I said if you're going to effing kill me you better do it now or I'm going to take this away from you and beat you to death with it." Higgs said he was able to head butt House, who retreated into another room. Her captors treated her like a dog, forcing her to wear "a red dog collar with a rope or leash attached to it," and forced her to stay inside a "locked wooden cage" that House built, according to court documents.
