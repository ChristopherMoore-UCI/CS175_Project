-- A historic drought in southern China has caused billions of dollars in losses to agriculture and left millions of people and animals short of drinking water, government officials said Tuesday. Agriculture experts will be sent to the rain-starved areas to help farmers combat the shortfall of precipitation and see to the allocation of relief materials like seeds and fertilizers. The Ministry of Finance will distribute relief funds. The impact of the drought, which began in June, is being felt across four provinces, affecting more than 44 million people, Ministry of Civil Affairs said. More than 7 million people and 3 million cattle are short of drinking water.
