In late April, the Stones began rehearsing in New York and continued working across the Hudson River in Weehawken, New Jersey, inviting a film crew led by director Brett Morgen to shoot footage for a documentary celebrating the group's anniversary, set for a fall release. It was like playing in the garage â€” a maintenance check, you know?" The vibe was joyful, with Keith Richards and Mick Jagger joking around between takes. The news comes after the band gathered in late April in the New York area for a full week of rehearsals -- their first time playing together at such length since the final night of the marathon A Bigger Bang tour at London's O2 arena in August 2007. Adds Richards, "I thought I'd be quite rusty. " Does Richards see himself writing one-on-one with Mick Jagger again?
