Islamic extremists carved out a large portion in northern Mali last year, taking advantage of a chaotic situation after a military coup. In the latest blow to militants, the French military said Wednesday it has seized the airport in Kidal, the last major town under rebel control in northern Mali. Up to 40 of those troops will be deployed to a European Union military training mission in Mali and the rest in English-speaking West African countries. More than 380,000 people fled northern Mali in the past year, the United Nations says. If the forces secure the town, it will be the last major city in their sweep north to flush out Islamist militants in Mali, France's former colony.
