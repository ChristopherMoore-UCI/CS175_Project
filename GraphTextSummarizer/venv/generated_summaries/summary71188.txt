Love Land had not opened its doors yet, but authorities in the city of Chongqing -- a sprawling metropolis on the banks of the Yangtze River -- got all hot and bothered over the park's plans to display naked human sculptures, giant replica genitals and a photo gallery on the history of sex, the state-run China Daily reported. Some thought sex was best left behind closed doors, while others argued that a real need for sex education existed in China. "Sex is a taboo subject in China, but people really need to have more access to information about it," he told the newspaper. Visitors catch a glimpse of Love Land, billed as China's first-ever sex theme park, in southwest China. Lu Xiaoqing, park manager, told the newspaper he got the idea for building Love Land after a visit to a sex park in Jeju, a popular destination in South Korea.
