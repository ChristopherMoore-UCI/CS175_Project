Messi tied proceedings in the 42nd minute to break Alfredo di Stefano's El Clasico record, with Barcelona midfielder Cesc Fabregas and Real Madrid defender Pepe shown yellow cards in the aftermath when they touched heads -- and then theatrically fell to the ground. -- Barcelona manager Gerardo Martino said prior to Sunday's El Clasico that it was his team's last chance in the Spanish title race. Lionel Messi netted a hat-trick to become the leading scorer in El Clasico history as part of a 4-3 Barcelona victory that featured just about everything in Madrid. But a part of Madrid won't be disappointed with the result, since Atletico Madrid assumed top spot in La Liga ahead of its city rival thanks to a better head-to-head record. With Barcelona reeling, Benzema's close-range finish in the 24th minute handed Madrid the advantage and the French international was only denied a hat-trick when Gerard Pique cleared off the line.
