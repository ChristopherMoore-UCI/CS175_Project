He also was behind reconciliation, a painful and lengthy process that attempted to hold those responsible for the brutality accountable for their acts without alienating other white South Africans. In his last public words before he was jailed, Mandela said, "I have fought against white domination, and I have fought against black domination. "President Mandela united this country behind the goal of a nonsexist, nonracial democratic and prosperous South Africa," President Jacob Zuma told lawmakers. Following his release, he worked with South Africa's white president, F.W. de Klerk, to end those policies. He also was instrumental in bringing soccer's World Cup to South Africa.
