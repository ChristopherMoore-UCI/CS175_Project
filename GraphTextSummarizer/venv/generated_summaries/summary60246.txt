After Carrie Underwood won her sixth Grammy, the latest for best country solo performance, she made it clear backstage that she's sticking to country music and would never cross over into pop music. Spalding, 28, won for best instrumental arrangement accompanying vocalists and for best jazz vocal album for "Radio Music Society." The Beach Boys' Brian Wilson also took the pre-telecast stage to accept the Grammy for best historical album. Bonnie Raitt was there to get her 10th Grammy, the latest for best Americana album given for "Slipstream." Paul McCartney was a no-show to pick up his Grammy for best traditional pop vocal album.
