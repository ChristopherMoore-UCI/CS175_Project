" With Jackson gone, Morgan's Keya Gallery is buying the image copyrights and helping Reginald Garcia sell the original slides, prints and contact sheets that have been forgotten on his shelf for decades. Reginald Garcia will use cash from the sale of 130 unpublished Jackson photos to fund testing of the motor, which he claims generates more electricity than it uses. The sale of the Jackson photographs will allow them "to certify that the prototype does everything that we say it's going to do," Marohnic said. "He was the greatest guy you could ever talk to," Garcia said of his day with Jackson. Garcia pulled the box of photos out of his closet last month when he was looking for ways to finance testing of his "self-generating" motor, Garcia said in a CNN interview this week.
