"If you're going to put yourself in the spotlight for accolade, then you've got to accept the reverse consequences." James has sympathy for Rooney, who became a Premier League player with Everton at the age of just 16 and has had to deal with intense media pressure -- this year he was accused by newspapers of sleeping with a prostitute while his wife Coleen was pregnant. The 25-year-old's apparent rift with manager Alex Ferguson split United fans, some of whom accused him of engineering the situation to get a better pay deal, and James said Rooney needs to accept that he will remain firmly in the media spotlight. Wayne Rooney must be prepared for criticism from fans when he returns from injury for Manchester United, his former England teammate David James told CNN. While James has set up a foundation to carry out charity work in the African country of Malawi, he does not believe that footballers have to be role models. "It is difficult, the likes of Wayne Rooney - he was a kid when he was in the first team and not much older than a kid when he was playing for England, so I think the reality is very subjective," James said.
