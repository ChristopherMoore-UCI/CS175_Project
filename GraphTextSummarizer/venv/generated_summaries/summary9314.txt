It's a digital renaissance and it's being pioneered by a new generation of talented young Internet entrepreneurs who are trying to reinvent not only the Greek economy and society, but also Greece's role in today's global economy. Plakopita, a 28-year-old woman who has degrees in economics and real-estate development from London and Columbia universities, came back from the US to Greece to start-up and run Netrobe, an iPhone app designed as a virtual closet for young fashionistas which already has 40,000 users. In pre-crisis Greece, most Greeks grew up wanting to be public servants. Yet in spite of the danger of a complete economic meltdown, the future remains full of opportunity for Greece's young digital entrepreneurs. Given the crisis, Doxaras -- a young man who is already on his third start-up -- believe that young Greeks have "nothing to lose" and are "willing to take a risk." There's a "big opportunity" in Greece, Doxaras told me because -- given the relative insignificance of the local market - start-ups have to be global, both in their organization and their market.
