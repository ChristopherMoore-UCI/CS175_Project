" Victoria's grandmother, Kelly Mullins, took to Facebook last month to tell a story about how Victoria, who wears an eye patch and eats through a tube, was told to leave a KFC in Mississippi because her appearance was disturbing to other patrons. Victoria, who lost sight in her right eye and was left with severe facial scars after a pit bull attack, will meet with Raymond Peters, an ocularist who hopes to outfit her with a prosthetic eye this week at his office in Naples, Florida. -- Victoria Wilcher -- the 3-year-old Mississippi girl whose family claimed was asked to leave KFC because of her appearance -- will be fitted for a prosthetic eye. "We don't want this child to walk in the shadows." Despite saying it hadn't found proof that one of its restaurants mistreated the girl or her grandmother, KFC said it will still honor its commitment to donate $30,000 to assist with Victoria's medical bills. Peters said he doesn't care about the controversy surrounding what her family said happened to her at KFC.
