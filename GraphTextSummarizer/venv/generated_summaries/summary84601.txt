The UK's Energy Saving Trust says online surveys and energy monitors can also help homeowners track their energy usage. IRT have surveyed around 200,000 UK homes since they were founded in 2002, and also offer customers quantified thermal images showing the financial and carbon costs of energy leaks. Thermal imaging surveys are nothing new, but widespread access to them is says Stewart Little, CEO of British thermal imaging company, IRT. -- It's an illuminating idea which its creators hope will help drive up energy efficiency and bring down buildings' carbon emissions. Essess have also developed computer programs that generate energy reports highlighting specific areas of concern and calculating their cost -- financially and environmentally.
