Obama, who's stayed away from most Senate races this year with the rare exception of a Saturday visit to Michigan on behalf of Democratic candidate Gary Peters, is in Connecticut Sunday to campaign for Gov. Dannel Malloy. Two days from the midterm election, Washington's political class was buzzing around news that Iowa GOP Senate hopeful Joni Ernst was  7 percentage points up in a Des Moines Register poll, and Republican candidates and surrogates popped up on the Sunday news shows, gleeful about their prospects. A new set of NBC News/Marist polls unveiled Sunday morning gave Republicans boosts in three key Senate races -- including McConnell's in Kentucky, as well as Georgia, where Democrats had hoped to pickup a seat, and Louisiana, where Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu is in a tough race for her political career. Top Democrats, trying to narrow the gap, hit the trail Sunday, including Bill Clinton, who planned four stops in Arkansas -- where Democratic Sen. Mark Pryor is endangered and long-time Clinton foil Asa Hutchinson is expected to win the governor's race. Senate Republican leader McConnell is ahead of Democratic challenger Alison Lundergan Grimes, 50% to 41%, according to an NBC News/Marist survey released Sunday.
