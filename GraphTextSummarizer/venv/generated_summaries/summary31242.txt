Los Angeles County prosecutors allege in court papers that Sharper also is suspected of rape in Tempe, Arizona; Las Vegas, Nevada; and New Orleans, Louisiana. Sharper, 38, who played defensive back for the Green Bay Packers, Minnesota Vikings and New Orleans Saints during his 14-year career, appeared Friday in a Los Angeles County court, but his arraignment was postponed until Thursday, said spokesman Ricardo Santiago of the district attorney's office. "I believe that the defendant is involved in seven acts of rape and eleven acts of furnishing a controlled substance" in those three communities and the Los Angeles area between last September and January, Los Angeles police investigator John Macchiarella stated in papers requesting an increase in Sharper's bail to $10 million. New Orleans police are also investigating Sharper after a 25-year-old woman accused him of sexual assault in September, New Orleans police spokeswoman Cherie Guggenheim confirmed to CNN. "And we are very hopeful that at the end of day that Mr. Sharper will be fully exonerated," added attorney Blair Berk.
