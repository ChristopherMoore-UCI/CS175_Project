"The extension of the contract has been signed." Monza is one of the most famous tracks on the F1 circuit and hosted its first Grand Prix in 1922. This year's event is scheduled for September 12. There had been speculation that Rome would replace Monza as the venue of the Italian Grand Prix after Ecclestone confirmed plans to stage a race in the capital. "The Italian Grand Prix will be at Monza until 2016," Claudio Vigano, the head of SIAS, the company that controls the circuit, told reporters. The Italian Grand Prix will be held at the historic Monza track until 2016 after a new four-year deal was clinched.
