Le Monde reported that it didn't know the message's content, but said it helps to show the Charlie Hebdo attacks by Cherif and Said Kouachi and supermarket attack by Amedy Coulibaly were coordinated -- something that Coulibaly himself purportedly admitted to a TV reporter before police killed him. The investigative sources told Le Monde that the Charlie Hebdo attack almost was called off on January 6, because Said Kouachi had come down with the stomach flu. One of the brothers who committed January's massacre at the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo texted the man who would later kill hostages at a Paris kosher supermarket a little more than an hour before the first attack, French newspaper Le Monde reported Tuesday. Cherif Kouachi sent a text message to Coulibaly at 10:19 a.m. on January 7, Le Monde reported. Evidence from the phone shows that Coulibaly and Cherif Kouachi probably met in person sometime before 1 a.m. on January 7, Le Monde reported.
