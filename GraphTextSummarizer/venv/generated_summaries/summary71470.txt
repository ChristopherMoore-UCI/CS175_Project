At Camp Ayandeh, games of "vasati," or Iranian dodgeball, and Iranian dancing sessions are scheduled next to public speaking and college prep workshops. It's so common that Ayandeh counselors said the camp was created three years ago to address both Iranian and American parts of a new generation of Iranian-American youth -- a community they define as being "hyphenated." Born in Baltimore, Maryland, six years after the revolution, Ramin grew up with two distinct and, at times conflicting, influences: the American side that met him at school and the Iranian one that greeted him at home. She has experienced little in the way of Iranian culture and tradition outside her home in Rockville, Maryland. The largest wave of Iranian immigrants came to the U.S. immediately following the ouster of the Shah of Iran and the Islamic-led revolution in 1979.
