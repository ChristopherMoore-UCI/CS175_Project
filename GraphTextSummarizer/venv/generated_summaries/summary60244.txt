Tens of thousands of people in the southern tip of Malawi have been cut off by deadly floods, leaving them without food, clean water or access to health care, aid organizations have warned, while many others have been displaced. Even though these areas are prone to floods, old people I talked to could not remember events of this magnitude." MSF has been distributing mosquito nets and water treatment kits, and building latrines to try to limit the spread of disease. "The floods are behaving like a slow tsunami with the river swelling progressively downstream towards the south and Mozambique," says Amaury Gregoire, MSF's head of mission in Malawi "Most of Nsanje and East Bank are submerged under two to three meters of water, which has transformed these vast plains into a giant lake engulfing houses and bridges. Gift of the Givers warned of the danger of a cholera outbreak, as well as other waterborne diseases, thanks to the lack of clean drinking water and contamination with sewerage.
