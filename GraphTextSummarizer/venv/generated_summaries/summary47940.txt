Pilot who survived midair collision decades ago learns wreckage found The wreckage of Besal's plane was found last month by a team of divers from TISIRI (Think It Sink It Reef It), a Jacksonsville-based marine conservation company that specializes, among other things, in building artificial reefs. Twenty miles from shore and 80 feet under the Atlantic, parts of Besal's past were brought to the surface. " Much of the debris, now a mix of tires, turbine blades and unrecognizable airplane features, is encrusted with marine life such as coral and sponges. Joe Kistel, executive director of TISIRI, asked Besal if he would like to return to the wreckage site, an invitation Besal eagerly accepted. " As the day ended and temperatures started cooling off, the blue skies now streaked with purple highlights, Besal, his wife Jennie, Kistel and a dozen other divers, friends and observers returned to shore.
