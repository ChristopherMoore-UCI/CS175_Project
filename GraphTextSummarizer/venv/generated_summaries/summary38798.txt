Violence between Afghan forces and NATO troops is a matter of extreme concern for NATO officials, and it is growing in frequency. Out of 16 incidents of Afghan forces shooting NATO personnel that NATO has investigated, eight have been determined to be motivated by combat stress on the part of the Afghan attacker. There have been 36 NATO deaths in the past two years attributed to attacks by people perceived to be Afghan soldiers or police. The Taliban has claimed responsibility for previous conflicts between NATO service members and members of the Afghan military. The NATO-led International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan said an Afghan military pilot opened fire on international troops, sparking a "gunfight."
