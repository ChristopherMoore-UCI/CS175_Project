However, we know that the company plans to reveal Samsung Galaxy S III, which was rumored to be launched at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, but Samsung decided to move the launch to a later date. Samsung has started sending out invites for the launch of the next Galaxy smartphone, which is slated for May 3 in London. What features/specs would you like to see in Samsung Galaxy S III? In any case, Samsung will have to show something truly spectacular if it wants to top the Tegra 3 powerhouses from HTC. The invite doesn't give any details about the upcoming device(s) -- it merely says "come and meet the next Galaxy."
