But "all of us have the intention to stop the violence in Syria ... and to solve this situation peacefully," Putin said Monday after a meeting with U.S. President Barack Obama at the Group of Eight Summit in Northern Ireland. On Monday, Obama stressed the importance of making sure chemical weapons "are neither used nor subject to proliferation" in Syria -- a topic that Putin didn't mention in his public remarks after meeting with the U.S. president. Other G8 nations have expressed similar viewpoints, calling on Russia to back United Nations intervention in Syria. global leaders at the conference are poised to pressure Putin over his support for Syria's government. But the Russian president didn't specify who could be involved in Syria talks, when they would take place or what their end goal would be.
