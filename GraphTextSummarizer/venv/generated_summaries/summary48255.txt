Lamo is the California ex-hacker who claimed in the summer of 2010 that U.S. soldier Bradley Manning confessed to him in online chats that Manning had leaked classified wartime documents to WikiLeaks. He doesn't think Wednesday's news about Assange will deflate support for WikiLeaks, Assange, Manning or the effort to leak documents online in any forum. "I hope WikiLeaks is more than just one man, and that despite the extradition and the enormous pressure, WikiLeaks will continue," said Jeff Paterson, who is involved with the Bradley Manning Support Network, which raises money for Manning's defense. Assange has refused to comment about whether Manning was WikiLeaks' source for its Iraq or Afghanistan war logs or other diplomatic cables it has published in the past year. -- A court ruled Wednesday that WikiLeaks editor Julian Assange will be extradited to Sweden to face questioning over accusations of sex crimes made by two women, despite his legal battle to stay in Britain.
