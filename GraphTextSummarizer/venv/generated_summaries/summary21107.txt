-- Fabian Cancellara retained his gold jersey at the Vuelta Espana despite being caught up in a huge pile-up involving the leading riders near the end of Tuesday's fourth stage from Venlo to Liege. British rider Charles Wegelius became the first entrant to quit the event, meaning that New Zealander Julian Dean of the Garmin team is now the only man with a chance of completing all three of the sport's major three-week races this season. Andre Greipel of Team Columbia edged out Belgian Wouter Weylandt and fellow German cyclists Bert Grabsch and Marcel Sieberg in a sprint finish to the rain-hit 225km leg which saw the race move from the Netherlands into Belgium. Lars Boom of Rabobank led a breakaway from the 21km mark with Dominik Roels (Milram), Javier Ramirez (Andalucia Cajasur) and Sergei Lagutin (Vacansoleil), and they built a 14-minute lead by 55km. Switzerland's Cancellara now has a nine-second lead over Belgian sprint specialist Tom Boonen, who moved up to second  as the top 57 riders involved in the crash were given the same time as the leaders.
