One of Sidonie's friends from boarding school, Ximena de la Camara, said Sidonie's death put things in perspective. Back home in Manhattan, Fery and Van Gastel's apartment on 57th Street is filled with small reminders of Sidonie's short but larger-than-life existence. The relationships that began because of that bottle, the remembrances shared since since its discovery, culminated in Saturday's excursion, at which Mimi Fery would dedicate a plaque in the beachside community and an arts fund established in Sidonie's name. On the bus ride to the beach, Fery shared stories of Sidonie's childhood, lighting up when she spoke of trips to Iran during which Sidonie taught her friends English -- even assigning homework -- and ventured out with her traditionally austere grandfather to jewelry shops, where they would turn sketches into small trinkets. Out of a small black clutch, Fery pulled dozens of tiny, trimmed pictures of Sidonie at various ages: Sidonie in Iran, Sidonie as a toddler, Sidonie's last high school portrait before her death.
