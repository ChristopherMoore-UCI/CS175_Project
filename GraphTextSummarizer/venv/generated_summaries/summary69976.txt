We should also hear more from police officers themselves, whose associations usually talk more about protecting pensions than keeping their members safe from gun violence. Or that pulling police officers off the streets would likely lead to more gun violence, not less. We should hear more from elected officials and the media about how dangerous police officers' jobs have become thanks to loophole-ridden gun laws, a pop culture that glorifies gun violence and a powerful gun lobby that terrifies gutless politicians in both parties. But in the case of Michael Bloomberg's off-the-cuff statement that police officers across the country should threaten to go on strike until citizens pressure lawmakers to pass more gun control laws, the search was arduous. People who object to generalizations and snap judgments about guns will accept them when they're about pop culture, and vice versa.
