These images reveal a whole new perspective on America's Civil War re-enactors. After "dying" on battlefields 148 times, longtime re-enactor Ed "Doc" Keith told Dudik he has decided to quit dying. Another re-enactor told Dudik at historic Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, that "he doesn't die very often because he's one of the few that are actually in shape and can make it all the way across the battlefield. " A third re-enactor said he dies "almost every time because he finds it more realistic," Dudik said. Dudik photographed each re-enactor as they laid on a suspended platform, giving the impression they were hovering above the ground.
