Recent flooding in the nation has displaced tens of thousands of people and an "untold numbers of rats," leading to fears the disease could spread, said Margaret Chan, director-general of the World Health Organization. "If diagnosed early, bubonic plague can be successfully treated with antibiotics," the World Health Organization said. At least 119 cases were confirmed by late last year,  including 40 deaths, the World Health Organization said in a statement. Past plague epidemics have have occurred in Europe, the United States, Africa, Asia and South America. The pneumonic type is rare but more dangerous than bubonic plague because it can be transmitted between humans through inhalation and coughing.
