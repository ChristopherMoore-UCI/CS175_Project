Chechen warlord Doku Umarov, one of Russia's most wanted men, has died, a Chechen jihadist website said Tuesday. The Kavkaz Center website said Umarov would be replaced as leader of the Islamist group Caucasus Emirate by Ali Abu Mohammed. The Caucasus Emirate, or Imarat Kavkaz, has its roots in the 1990s Chechen insurgency. The U.S. State Department said Umarov organized a suicide bombing outside the Chechen Interior Ministry in May 2009.
