Facebook told Mashable the site will also be "showing the editing history for a comment so that subsequent commenters or likers have the full context of the conversation." But starting Thursday the site is also now offering the ability to edit your comment â€” and change that pappy back to the puppy you intended in the first place. The editing ability went live on Thursday evening, and will be gradually rolling out to all users over the next few days. Your friend uploads a picture of their new puppy to Facebook, and you somehow manage to leave a comment congratulating them instead on their "new pappy." That way if someone responds to a comment that gets edited commenters in the future can see the history of the conversation and not get lost.
