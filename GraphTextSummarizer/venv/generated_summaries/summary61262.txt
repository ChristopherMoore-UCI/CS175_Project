Here is the latest on the status of each reactor and what was being done to prevent further emissions of radioactive material: Reactor No. 1 The "vapor" rising near the No. 1 reactor at the plant is "only natural" and not a cause for alarm, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano said Thursday, especially since water is now in that unit's nuclear spent fuel pool. Seawater continues to be pumped in an effort to cool down nuclear fuel rods and prevent the further emission of radioactive material into the atmosphere. As with units Nos. 4 and 6, this reactor was off on a scheduled outage when the quake hit and there are no major issues with the reactor and core itself. In addition, firefighters from Tokyo and Yokohoma cities are preparing to spray another 500 tons of water toward that reactor's nuclear spent fuel pool, which Nishiyama said could happen Thursday or Friday. These pools contain fuel rods that, if not cooled down, can overheat and, in the process, release radioactive vapors into the air.
