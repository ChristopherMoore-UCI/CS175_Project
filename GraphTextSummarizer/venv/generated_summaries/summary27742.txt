Check back next week for full box office coverage of "Chasing Mavericks," "Fun Size," "Cloud Atlas," and "Silent Hill 2," and follow me on Twitter for more box office analysis and up-to-the-minute updates! Furthermore, horror movies — and especially horror sequels — are typically some of the most front-loaded films of any genre due to young audiences (60 percent of PA4's audience was below the age of 25), who rush to the theater on opening weekend. Also making matters difficult was direct competition from Sinister, the similarly themed horror title that opened to $18 million last weekend. The Oscar front-runner, which earned an amazing "A+" CinemaScore grade last weekend, has a decent shot at breaking $100 million at the domestic box office if it can keep scoring remarkable holds like this one. "PA2" and "PA3" each finished with about twice as much as they earned on opening weekend, grossing $84.8 and $104 million respectively, but "PA4" will be lucky to score $60 million total.
