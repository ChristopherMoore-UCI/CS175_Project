Much to the frustration of white Washington, Barry launched a stunning comeback after serving time in a federal prison, and won a fourth term as Mayor in 1994. "What a lot of people don't realize was how many thousands of people in this city loved Marion Barry," said outgoing Washington mayor Vincent Gray. To many in white Washington, Barry was a scoundrel, a womanizer and a crook who enriched his friends and cronies with contracts and jobs, corrupted the police department, and allowed the drug-ridden city to earn an ugly reputation in the 80s and early 90s as "the murder capital." Marion Barry was dead, but Ward 8 came to party. Barry's loss last month was felt deeply by black Washingtonians, who celebrated his life with three days of events culminating in a massive memorial service downtown last weekend.
