Mason is part of Don Bosco's first graduating class of 70 students, all of whom have already been accepted to various colleges and universities, said Rev. Steve Shafran, president of Don Bosco Cristo Rey. A child advocate first alerted Mason's mother about Don Bosco, one of 24 schools in the country that use the Cristo Rey model: a combination of employment and academics. -- There was a time not too long ago when 19-year-old Derontae Mason slept in homeless shelters and school playgrounds. But the teachers, the staff, friends, family they all pulled together with Don Bosco and helped me overcome those obstacles," said Mason. For Mason, Don Bosco went even further, helping to arrange housing so he wouldn't have to sleep on the streets.
