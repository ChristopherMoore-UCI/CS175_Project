Vargas Llosa, who lost to Alberto Fujimori in a runoff in his previous presidential campaign, received the Nobel Prize for Literature last week at a ceremony in Norway. Keiko Fujimori, a congresswoman and daughter of ex-president Alberto Fujimori, is one of the leading candidates in next year's presidential election, according to polls. -- Peruvian novelist Mario Vargas Llosa is injecting his cachet as a newly minted Nobel Prize winner into the political sphere, in a strong criticism of the political aspirations of the daughter of a disgraced former president. "If the daughter of the dictator who is condemned to prison for being a criminal and a thief has the possibility of becoming the president of Peru, I will be one of the Peruvians who will go out to try to impede it through all the legal channels available," Vargas Llosa said Monday. Alberto Fujimori fled Peru in the midst of a scandal involving his spy chief, and was extradited years later back to his country to face trial.
