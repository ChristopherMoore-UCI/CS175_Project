He also played down the possibility that alcohol may have played a role in the disaster, saying he did not believe Schettino drank, and that all crew were subject to random drug and alcohol tests by Costa Cruises. There was also no risk of him committing the same offense again, Montesarchio said, saying Schettino had expressed "intent to change his life" and no longer work on ships. But as the official questions his decision, Schettino appears to reverse course and says he did not abandon ship but was "catapulted into the water" after the ship ran into a rock, began taking on water and started listing. As the night unfolds, the coast guard commander repeatedly questions why Schettino, as captain, is not on the ship when passengers are still aboard. Francesco Schettino is the man at the center of the questions and recriminations over the Costa Concordia cruise ship disaster.
