Like King, Obama recognizes that government isn't the principal solution to unemployment and poverty, but rather a buffer from hardship and a catalyst for opportunity. But if only the ghost of King could glide into the Oval Office and urge Obama to take decisive, bold action, and to dodge the status quo behavior favored by power brokers in Washington and on Wall Street. Unchecked free market capitalism, King maintained, cannot guarantee the basic conditions necessary for ordinary people to earn a living, to acquire health care or to build wealth. If only the ghost of King could coax Obama to join the ranks of historically transformative leaders, including Franklin D. Roosevelt, who galvanized movements, who put pressure on themselves, Congress and the public to improve our politics and economy profoundly for decades to come. Today, we face the country's worst economic crisis since the Depression, poverty continues to grow at home and abroad, and wars across the globe are leaving a wake of death and destruction for generations to come.
