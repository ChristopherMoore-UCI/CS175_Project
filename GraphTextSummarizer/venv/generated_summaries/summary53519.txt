The decrease in smoking rates "is all coming out of heavy smokers," says John P. Pierce, Ph.D., the lead author of the study and the director of cancer prevention and control at the University of California San Diego's Moores Cancer Center. The decline in heavy smoking appears to be linked to a subsequent decline in lung cancer. In 1993, when the deaths caused by lung cancer peaked in the U.S.-- about 15 years after the rates of heavy smoking peaked --1 in every 855 deaths was attributable to the cancer. The research was funded with grants from the University of California that, by law, are supported by state cigarette taxes.
