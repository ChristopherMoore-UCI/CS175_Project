About the time Collins kicked off her hunt for Thurmond, Medina was growing frustrated that he hadn't paid his rent. A 30-foot tract of red clay and splotchy crab grass separates her mobile home from the home of Raymond Daniel Thurmond, a residence so rank and squalid that it forced a seasoned police investigator to vomit upon entering. Authorities never had a problem with Thurmond until August 4, when Collins received a call from a women's shelter. Collins interviewed the women and children, who all gave the same story: Thurmond had forced the wife, three sons (9, 13 and 14 years old) and his 12-year-old daughter to remain inside. Collins said police are not sure if padlocks were the only way Thurmond imprisoned his family.
