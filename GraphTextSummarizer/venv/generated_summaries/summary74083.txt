Gibbs admitted in court that he told his troops in Afghanistan about the Iraq shooting as an example that soldiers would not face consequences for acting aggressively, even if civilians were hurt. Instead, prosecutors said Gibbs and a small group of rogue soldiers allegedly plotted to murder civilians and then planted weapons on them so they appeared to be Taliban attackers. Phillip Stackhouse, Gibbs' defense attorney, had argued other soldiers were framing his client. The investigation into the family's killing had been closed but was reopened after Gibbs was charged with the murders of civilians in Afghanistan. Gibbs is the highest ranking of five soldiers charged with being part of a rogue "kill squad" that targeted civilians.
