-- Noah and Connor Barthe, the two boys apparently killed by a 100-pound African rock python in Canada, died from asphyxiation, according to preliminary autopsy results. The apartment was the home of Jean-Claude Savoie, a family friend whose Campbellton, New Brunswick pet store was downstairs. Deaths caused by large constrictor snakes like pythons are fairly rare. Alain Tremblay of the New Brunswick Royal Canadian Mounted Police said Wednesday. CNN's Matt Smith, Jethro Mullen, Dana Ford and Kevin Conlon contributed to this report.
