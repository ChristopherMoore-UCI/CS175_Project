How to help in Japan relief efforts Edano said Monday that the decision to dump tainted water from other reactors and the wastewater treatment facility was unavoidable in order to ensure the safety of the No. 2 reactor core. Both the utility and Japan's nuclear safety agency said they didn't know how much water is leaking into the sea from reactor No. 2. Reactors No. 1 and No. 3, which have lower levels of water, need to be drained as well. The news was a bright spot amid a series of setbacks Japanese authorities faced Tuesday, including the detection of radiation in a fish and news that the water gushing into the Pacific had radiation levels millions of times above the regulatory limit. Meanwhile, the deliberate dumping of radioactive water into the sea continues, Tokyo Electric said Wednesday.
