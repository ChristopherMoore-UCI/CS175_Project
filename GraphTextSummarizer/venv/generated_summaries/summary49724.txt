Premier Wen is scheduled to meet JosÃ© Manuel Barroso, European Commission president, and other European leaders at a bilateral business summit next week in Beijing. Although the aviation industry only accounts for about 3 per cent of global carbon emissions, its share is growing quickly and the EU believes its carbon trading scheme is an important part of the fight against climate change. Chinese airlines had previously said they would not pay the EU carbon tax, but the formal prohibition by the State Council, or cabinet, puts Beijing in direct opposition to Brussels. When German Chancellor Angela Merkel visited Beijing last week, Premier Wen said China might contribute more to rescue funds that are aimed at resolving the European debt crisis. But all airlines using EU airports have been brought into the scheme.
