He clocked one minute 30.844 seconds near the end of the session to head off compatriot Jorge Lorenzo, who clinched his second world title for Yamaha at the penultimate race in Australia last month. The Honda rider smashed Valentino Rossi's lap record at the Ricardo Tormo circuit in Valencia on Saturday to claim pole position for the final race. Hopefully the weather is dry tomorrow and we can take that extra step in warm-up." Lorenzo, who will be rejoined by Rossi at Yamaha next year, has won six out of 17 races and finished runner-up 10 times -- with just one retirement. Seven-time world champion Rossi has not won at Valencia since 2004, and his hopes of a repeat seem slim after a poor final qualifying run for Ducati. The Italian, who has stood on the podium just twice in two years away from Yamaha, finished Saturday's session back in 11th -- more than two seconds slower than Pedrosa.
