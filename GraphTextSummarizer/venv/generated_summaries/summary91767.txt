Then he continued, "If I do not surrender all forces to the Japanese today, Bataan will be known around the world as the greatest slaughter in history." If you survived the Bataan Death March, you were then sent to Japan on old Japanese freighters whose military officers refused to place Red Cross or POW markings on the ships -- thereby making them targets for American submarines and air forces fighter planes. But, according to an Army history, the Navy was still in shambles after the December 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, and no ships were capable of bringing reinforcements. Lacking supplies, the men on Bataan fought bravely for four months against the well-fed, well-armed Japanese military. But he nevertheless ordered all of his troops on Bataan to lay down their arms and surrender to the Imperial Japanese.
