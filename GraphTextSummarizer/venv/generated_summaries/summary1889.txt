Although qualification for next season's competition looks unlikely, Milan still has a Champions League last 16 tie with Spanish high-fliers Atletico Madrid to look forward to. Sunday's 4-3 defeat to lowly Sassuolo, a match which saw Allegri's charges go 2-0 up early in the first half, proved to be the final straw for Milan, which is owned by former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi. "AC Milan would like to thank Mr. Allegri and his staff for their time with the club and wish them the best for the future. " An official club statement read: "AC Milan wishes to communicate that Massimiliano Allegri and his staff have been relieved of their duties with immediate effect. Milan has finished first, second and third under Allegri in the last three seasons, but the seven-time European champions sit in 11th place after 19 games of the 2013-14 season.
