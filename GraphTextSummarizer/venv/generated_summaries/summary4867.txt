The museum held a historic gathering of Holocaust survivors and World War II veterans in Washington for a national marking of its 20th anniversary. Now we're in Chicago, where Sunday, June 9, the museum will hold a daylong public event with many opportunities to engage with museum resources, people, and programs, and pay tribute to local Holocaust survivors and World War II veterans. You can also see highlights from the previous tour stops and the National Tribute to Holocaust Survivors and World War II veterans. The Museum has developed 20 actions that anyone, anywhere can take to help preserve Holocaust memory and apply its lessons today. Each tour stop featured programming that explores the history of the Holocaust and looks at why it remains so relevant for us today.
