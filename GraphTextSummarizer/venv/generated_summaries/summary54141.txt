The U.S.-based chain is making what Schultz calls "a comprehensive strategic commitment to doing business in China, in a way that's locally relevant." Yunnan coffee is already known as some of the best in Asia, owing to the southern province's fertile soil, weather and water. "Starbucks, for the first time in our 40-year history, is going to start growing coffee," CEO Howard Schultz said while on a trip to Beijing. -- Starbucks has not only helped popularize coffee in China, it's also aiming to bring Chinese coffee to the world. Starbucks is working with Yunnan's provincial government "to share our coffee knowledge, to help Yunnan continue to develop into a top-quality coffee-growing region and bring the distinctive Yunnan coffee taste to our customers around the world," Schultz said. "And in three to four years, we will bring coffee from Yunnan to the world."
