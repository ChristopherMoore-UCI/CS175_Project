When Bill Doherty, a family therapist and professor at University of Minnesota, was researching overscheduled kids about 10 years ago, parents complained that "birthday parties are becoming out of hand. Besides soccer, dance and violin lessons, children also have invitations to birthday parties several weekends out of the year. "Birthday parties are embedded in local culture. According to Doherty, the average child celebrates his birthday with three or four events each year, including parties with nuclear family, extended family, friends and neighbors, and school. According to Doherty, parents don't want to send the message that their kid isn't as important as other children, so they feel pressure to go all-out to provide the experience of a lifetime -- every year.
