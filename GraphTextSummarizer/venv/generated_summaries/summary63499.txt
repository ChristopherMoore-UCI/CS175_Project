Goerges had beaten former World No.1 Wozniacki in their two previous matches, both on clay, with the Dane having the better in their other clashes on hard courts. Defending champion Caroline Wozniacki suffered a straight sets defeat to unseeded German Julia Goerges in the semifinal of the $2 million WTA tournament in Dubai Friday. Denmark's Wozniacki had no answer to an inspired Goerges, who won 7-6 7-5 to set up a final clash against Poland's Agnieszka Radwanska. Sixth seed Radwanska had earlier continued her fine recent form to beat Serbia's Jelena Jankovic 6-2 2-6 6-0 in the first semifinal. The 22-year-old Radwanska will be a tough opponent for Goerges in Saturday's final after she saw off Jankovic in a topsy-turvy match.
