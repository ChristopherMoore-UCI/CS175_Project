On Saturday morning, police stopped Smith, 56, as he drove a white van southbound on I-95 in Jacksonville and detained him without incident, Hartley said. According to records from the Duval County Clerk of Courts, Smith's most recent convictions occurred last year on charges from 2009 for unlawful impersonation of a public employee and aggravated child abuse by willful torture, for which he was sentenced to a year in county jail. Williams said the girl's mother first met Smith on Friday night at a local Dollar General store, where he offered to take the family to Walmart to buy them some clothes. "We are very confident that he was the one that took her from the Walmart." Soon after, Hartley said in a subsequent news conference, police followed a lead that took them four miles from the Walmart to a church, near which the child's body was discovered. "This is a transition from an abduction investigation to a murder investigation," Jacksonville Sheriff's Office spokesman Shannon Hartley told reporters.
