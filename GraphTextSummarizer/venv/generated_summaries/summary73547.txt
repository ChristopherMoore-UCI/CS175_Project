When Obama lashes out against Congress he is taking shots at his fellow Democrat, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, not just at House Speaker John Boehner. The heart of Carter's campaign in 1976 had been to clean up government and regain the trust of voters who were disillusioned with Washington as a result of Watergate. President Obama must be true to the kind of Democrat he has been -- not trying to reinvent himself in a media culture that constantly reminds voters of who he really is -- and he must define and champion the record that he has accomplished. Like Obama, Carter was no longer a fresh voice and he was deeply tied to events in Washington. At some level, Obama needs to explain to voters what he has done and how he has strengthened the nation -- even in difficult economic times.
