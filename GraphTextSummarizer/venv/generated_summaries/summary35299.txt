Ramdev was released shortly after police took him into custody, New Delhi police spokesman Rajan Bhagat said Monday. For the past year, India has seen a series of anti-corruption protests in the wake of high-profile scandals that have shaken investor confidence in Asia's third largest economy and rocked the government led by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. -- Police briefly detained famed Indian yoga guru Baba Ramdev on Monday after he tried to lead an anti-corruption march toward the national parliament building, a police spokesman said. In June 2011, riot police broke up Ramdev's hunger strike in an overnight night raid in New Delhi. There were no reports of disorder during Monday's demonstration, Bhagat said.
