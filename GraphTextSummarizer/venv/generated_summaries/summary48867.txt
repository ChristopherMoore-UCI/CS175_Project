The personal remarks, while focused on turning out voters for Democrats Mark Udall, John Hickenlooper and Andrew Romanoff, sounds a great deal like a presidential candidate and resembled a message Clinton could use should she run for president. -- Hillary Clinton used her Tuesday appearance in Colorado, where experts see the female vote deciding a number of statewide races, to court women with a personal message about her life and her hopes for the future. "This election is important to everybody, but it is especially important to the women of Colorado," Clinton said, touching upon a woman's right to choose, personhood laws and availability of birth control - all topics the race between Udall and Gardner have focused on. Clinton usually targets women voters in her appearances. Democrats in the state and nationally see Clinton as someone who can turn out women in Colorado, a key demographic that some experts see the election turning on.
