" French prosecutors will reportedly brief journalists on their investigation into Schumacher's accident on Wednesday in the Alpine town of Albertville. Schumacher suffered severe head trauma in a skiing accident at the French Alps resort of Meribel on 29 December. The German hit a rock hidden under deep snow and was catapulted head first onto another rock. "The privacy of the patient demands that we are not going into details of his treatment, and this is why we do not plan any press conferences, nor give out written press releases, anymore for the time being," they said in a statement on Monday "Please support us in our common fight with Michael," Corinna Schumacher, wife of the F1 racer, said in a statement.
