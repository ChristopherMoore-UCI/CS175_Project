The ice cream company said the ASA's ruling amounted to censorship of artistic freedoms ahead of Pope Benedict XVI's visit to Britain this week. The ASA said the publishers of Lady magazine, which carried the ad, had received several complaints from readers. " "We considered the use of a nun pregnant through immaculate conception was likely to be seen as a distortion and mockery of the beliefs of Roman Catholics," the ASA ruling said. The ad featuring the strapline "immaculately conceived" over an image of the expectant sister spooning from a tub of Antonio Federici ice cream was "likely to cause widespread offense," the Advertising Standards Authority ruled. A statement from Antonio Federici said the company was seeking to relaliate by securing a series of billboard advertisements along the route the pope's motorcade is expected to take during his visit to London.
