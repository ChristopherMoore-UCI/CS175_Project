Evidence indicates Betty Parente and the two daughters died from blunt-force trauma and asphyxiation, said Baltimore County Police Chief Jim Johnson. "Baltimore County Police has learned of allegations that William Parente may be involved in questionable financial dealings," Johnson said. Evidence indicates Betty Parente and Catherine Parente were killed sometime on Sunday, with Stephanie Parente's death occurring later the same day. Stephanie Parente, 19, was found dead along with her sister and parents in a Baltimore hotel Monday. The family was from Garden City, New York, but Stephanie Parente was a student at Loyola College in Baltimore, and police said the family visited her there occasionally.
