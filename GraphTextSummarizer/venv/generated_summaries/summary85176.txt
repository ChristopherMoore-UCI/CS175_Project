Embattled mosque moves forward with construction Kevin Fisher, who is opposed the mosque, told CNN affiliate WZTV on Wednesday that the issue was never about someone's right to worship but rather about whether the planning commission gave proper public notice. "They do have a lot of work to be done cosmetically," said David Jones, Rutherford County Building Codes director, told CNN affiliate WSMV. The mosque -- subject of a two-year battle marked by legal wrangling, vandalism and anti-Muslim sentiment -- still needs to pass inspection and get its occupancy permit, mosque officials said. The issue is widely discussed among local residents and some people near her have even put their houses up for sale, she said, because they don't want to be near a Muslim congregation. "What did we do?" Angela Hytry, 31, said she thinks local opinions on the issue are a reflection of town demographics.
