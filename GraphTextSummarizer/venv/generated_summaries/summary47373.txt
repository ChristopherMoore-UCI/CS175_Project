Davies said it took several hours for fire department tanker trucks and a fire boat on an adjacent creek to bring the fire under control, he said. The Anne Arundel County Fire Department said fire crews had difficulty knocking down the blaze because the house is secluded, apparently with no fire hydrants on the scene. Photos the fire department posted on Twitter showed hoses stretched for long distances. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives is assisting the local fire department, and an ATF national response team is being assembled because the fire was deemed suspicious, a law enforcement official said. Fire officials said they were alerted about 3:30 a.m. Monday to the fire in the 16,000-square-foot house.
