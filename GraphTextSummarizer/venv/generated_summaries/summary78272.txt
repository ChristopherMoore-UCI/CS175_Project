They were allowed to join combat units in 2011, and female troops "have proven themselves worthy of the best traditions of the Australian army," Morrison said. In a follow-up statement posted on the service's YouTube page, Morrison told soldiers that female troops "are vital to us maintaining our capability now and into the future. " Australian women began serving in auxiliary units and as nurses in the early 20th century and were integrated into the armed services in noncombat units in the 1970s and '80s. " Australian news outlets reported last week that at least 17 soldiers circulated video of themselves having sex with women. "No one has ever explained to me how the exploitation or degradation of others enhances capability or honors the traditions of the Australian army," he said in his message to the troops.
