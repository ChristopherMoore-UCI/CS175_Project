We have an ideology that more publicity, more transparency, more openness must improve Congress. Today, almost any one of the 535 members of Congress could help -- and so of course the interests must employ many more lobbyists to woo them all. Bills written in committee typically could not be amended on the floor of Congress. Instead, it has forced every individual member of Congress to spend the bulk of his or her time begging for funds -- the very opposite of clean politics. Congress in the first period was controlled by a handful of committee chairmen, who owed their positions to seniority.
