Temperatures in Lake Michigan are much lower than normal for this time of year, the Coast Guard said, after a long and cold winter. The boaters entered the water late Saturday night during a voyage from New Buffalo, Michigan, to Chicago. -- Several boaters are missing after separate incidents on Lake Michigan over the weekend, the Coast Guard said. In southern Lake Michigan, the water temperature is 45 degrees, officials said. Near Chicago, searchers were looking for four people Sunday about seven miles offshore, where rescuers had pulled two boaters from the water.
