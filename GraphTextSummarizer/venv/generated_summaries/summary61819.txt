Last week, Mozilla promoted Eich, a longtime employee who was previously the company's chief technology officer, to the position of CEO. "Mozilla supports equality for all, including marriage equality for LGBT couples. "As a married gay couple who are co-founders of this venture, we have chosen to boycott all Mozilla projects," said founder Hampton Catlin in an open letter to the company. Various Mozilla employees have also spoken up about the promotion, taking to Twitter to openly share their disappointment with Eich's politics. The company is protesting Mozilla's new CEO, Brendan Eich, who supported an anti-same-sex marriage campaign.
