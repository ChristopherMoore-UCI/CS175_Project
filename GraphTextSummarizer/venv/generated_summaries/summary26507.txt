During the past four years, I've been reaching out to Maine high school students. I won my first national title, scored eight top-10 finishes in the World Cup -- including my first-ever silver medal in front of a home crowd in Lake Placid, New York. I have been blessed with the opportunity to share my experiences with young girls and give them the strength and confidence to go after their dreams. The camp is designed for young girls ages 8 to 11 as a place to develop self-confidence and a healthy lifestyle. I also achieved a personal best, placing sixth in the overall World Cup rankings.
