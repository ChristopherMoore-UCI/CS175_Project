Van Flein also said Palin would remain involved in public service, with no other decisions made at this point. "My guess is the governor wants to be president, and that's what she should have said at her press conference." Palin thought she would stop being a "lightning rod" once she returned to Alaska, but "it never really did simmer down," Van Flein said. Van Flein said the state's ethics process, which Palin signed into law, has been "abused" to harass her and may lead Alaskans to ignore more serious allegations. " Despite leaving office about two-thirds of the way through her term, Palin "is not a quitter," Van Flein said. "And then there's another group, where Gov. Palin has been successful in being able to imply -- and certainly these people have inferred -- that she was a victim."
