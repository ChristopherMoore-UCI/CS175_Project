The CDC let the WHO know about the find and invited the WHO to witness the destruction of the vials, which is the standard protocol any time anyone finds smallpox samples unexpectedly. When the scientists found the vials, they immediately put them in a containment lab and on July 1 notified the branch of the government that deals with toxic substances, called the Division of Select Agents and Toxins. The CDC is one of only two official World Health Organization designated repositories for smallpox. You may know variola by its less formal name -- smallpox. Testing confirmed that there was variola virus DNA in the vials.
