Archbishop of Dublin Diarmuid Martin has issued a statement urging anyone with information about mass graves to go to the authorities. And earlier this year, Philomena Lee -- whose decades-long search for the son she was forced to give up for adoption in the 1950s was the subject of an Oscar-nominated film -- launched the Philomena Project in hopes of compelling the governments of Ireland and the United States to open access to adoption records. Hundreds of documents had been collated but none so far contained information concerning mass graves, it said. "The Gospel message is that authentic faith is measured by how we treat children who represent Jesus Christ," Martin said in the June 5 statement. 'Full bodied inquiry' The Dublin Archdiocese said Martin had asked the Diocesan archivist to compile information on mother and baby homes in Dublin several months ago.
