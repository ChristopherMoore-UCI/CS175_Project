Dr. Maria Siemionow: The patient has a severe deformity of the face after trauma and was missing a nose and missing cheekbones and a large part of the skin and the front of the face, upper lip, lower eyelids. It included skin components, bone components, the entire nose, cheekbones, a palette and upper lip and also included the eyelids -- the lower eyelids. However, it is very difficult to reconstruct certain parts of the face, including, for example, lips or including eyelids. This takes time and patients suffering and the results not always are presentable. There are plastic surgeons who are doing wonderful reconstructive procedures, but they are also done in several attempts.
