Created by Rob Thomas, "Veronica Mars" was introduced in 2004, starring Kristen Bell ("Frozen") as Veronica, a high school student living in fictional Neptune, California, who went from popular to outcast after the murder of her very wealthy best friend (played by Amanda Seyfried). When "Veronica Mars" debuted, it arrived in a TV landscape populated by soapy teen dramas like "The O.C." and "One Tree Hill," and reality series like "America's Next Top Model. Those who supported reuniting the "Veronica Mars" team on film -- and it does reunite everyone, from main characters to actors who had guest arcs -- are getting that love returned on March 14, when "Veronica Mars" the movie will debut in theaters and as Video On Demand. After "Mars" fans kicked in the funds needed to launch a "Veronica Mars" movie, their collective breath was held until stars like Enrico Colantoni were a sure deal. When everything else came crashing down around her, Veronica always had her dad -- the sort of comforting story that you don't see in a lot of teen TV, where the parents are often worse off than their kids.
