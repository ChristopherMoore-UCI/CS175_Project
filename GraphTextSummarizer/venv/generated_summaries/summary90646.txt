(Note: Republicans will continue to have a built-in advantage in House races until at least the next census in 2020 when new district lines will be drawn.) In other words, this election has been extremely important for Republicans in the short term -- and for governing over the next two years -- but in significant ways, it is also an anomaly: a year when red and purple state Democrats who rode into office in 2008 on the coattails of a fresh, popular Obama became highly vulnerable for re-election when his coattails frayed. None of this is written in stone, of course; parties can redefine their futures if they come up with good ideas and good candidates. It's not just the number of blue states but how huge an advantage they provide for the Democratic presidential nominee. In Massachusetts, the bluest of the blue, the Republicans this year are likely to seize the governor's office from Democrats because they have nominated a smart, winsome candidate, Charlie Baker, seen as better in creating jobs and economic growth.
