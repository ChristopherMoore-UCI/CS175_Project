-- Former Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf will face charges of treason for his role in imposing emergency military rule six years ago, the country's interior minister said Sunday. "I'm calling on the chief justice of Pakistan to appoint three high court judges to investigate former President Gen. Pervez Musharraf under Article 6 of the law," Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan told reporters, referring to a section of the constitution covering high treason. Musharraf took power, and a court subsequently convicted Sharif on hijacking and treason charges. That month, Musharraf declared a state of emergency, suspended Pakistan's constitution, replaced the chief judge and blacked out independent TV outlets. Musharraf could face life in prison or receive the death penalty if he is found guilty of treason.
