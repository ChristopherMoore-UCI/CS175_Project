"Since his first show in 1978, Billy has performed 46 shows at Madison Square Garden, including an unprecedented 12 consecutive sold-out shows that have earned Billy a spot among the Garden greats with a banner raised in his honor," James L. Dolan, executive chairman of The Madison Square Garden Company said via a press release. "Today, we take that relationship even further and are extremely honored to have Billy as The Garden's first music franchise." "Performing at Madison Square Garden is a thrilling experience," Joel said in a statement in the press release. I'm honored to be joining the Madison Square Garden family and look forward to taking the stage of the newly transformed Garden to create many more memorable nights." The legendary singer has signed a deal to perform at Madison Square Garden in New York City once a month, the venue announced on Tuesday.
