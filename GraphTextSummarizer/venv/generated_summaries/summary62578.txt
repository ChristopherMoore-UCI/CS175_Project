Countries in the 17-nation currency bloc are grappling with soaring budget deficits and high government borrowing costs. Pinera said the U.S. policy of monetary stimulus is a "concern" for Chile and other countries in South America such as Brazil. Chile is considered one of the most stable and secure countries in South America, according to reports by the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development and the World Bank. -- The Federal Reserve "printing money" will never solve the economic problems in the U.S., Chilean President Sebastian Pinera has told CNN. But other countries like Germany will have to help them in that process.
