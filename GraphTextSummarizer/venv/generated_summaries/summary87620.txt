No cheat days: While many diets prescribe a weekly day off for good behavior, I knew that didn't work for me. In retrospect, I was itching for an overwhelming reason -- short of a heart attack or Type II diabetes diagnosis -- to have to lose weight. My boss told me I needed to lose weight or kiss my job goodbye. In fact, she never used the words "fat" or "lose weight." So lose weight or lose your job is what I heard.
