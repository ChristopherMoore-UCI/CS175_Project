Israel's former ambassador to Egypt, Eli Shaked, told CNN there is nothing political about the decision to build it. Construction started in 2002 in an attempt to stem the tide of Palestinian suicide bombing attacks during the course of the second intifada, which began in September 2000. The Israeli military estimates around 5,000 infiltrators entered Israel over the past year as well as 1.3 tonnes of hash and 130 kilograms of heroin. -- Israel started building a barrier along its border with Egypt Monday. The project was announced in January by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
