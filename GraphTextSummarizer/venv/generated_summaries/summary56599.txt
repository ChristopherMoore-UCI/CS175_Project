NATO-led forces began bombing regime targets in Libya last month after the U.N. Security Council approved a resolution authorizing any means necessary to protect civilians. Opposition forces continue to have control of the border crossing despite fighting that has spilled into Tunisian territory, the agency spokesperson said, adding that UNHCR will give tents to Tunisian authorities, which they can distribute to residents of Dehiba should they need to relocate farther from any further border skirmishes. The refugees arriving in Dehiba, in southern Tunisia, are predominantly from ethnic Berber tribes that have long been persecuted by Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, a spokesperson for the U.N. aid agency said. The situation in Libya has become increasingly precarious for civilians and migrant workers, who have been caught in the crossfire of the conflict that has killed tens of thousands and left thousands more wounded since it began two months ago. Nearly 40,000 Libyans have fled the country's western mountainous region in the past month as pro-Gadhafi and opposition forces have fought for control of the border crossing point, according to the U.N. UNHCR staff in Dehiba said the situation of the refugees was being made worse by a violent sandstorm that has battered the area.
