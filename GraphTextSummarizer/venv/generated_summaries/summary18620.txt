Before I leave, one woman says there are a lot of kids in the neighborhood unable to go to school because of poor eyesight. As I step out onto the dirt road to leave, one of my hosts wants to ask a question: do I know anyone who can donate some wheelchairs, so adults don't' have to carry disabled children on their backs to school anymore? The name means "Light from the Stars" in Amharic, and is meant to reflect the resiliency of children. " The program's philosophy is that the way to help children is to help their families. More often than not, assistance is needed in multiple areas -- and that means these volunteers have had to become master networkers -- calling on friends, family, neighbors, local businessmen and faith leaders to get the kids what they need.
