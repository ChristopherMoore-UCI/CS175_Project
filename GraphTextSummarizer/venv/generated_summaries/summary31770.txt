Thai police say they received a phone call from a DHL shipping office in Pathum Thani province, on the outskirts of Bangkok, on Saturday. Police say in 2010, the smell of decay led investigators to the Phai-nguern Chotinaram temple in central Bangkok, where they discovered more than 2,000 illegally aborted fetuses. Police in Thailand say an American tried to ship infant body parts to the United States, but the delivery was stopped after a call from the shipping company. Some Thais practice black magic and believe that supernatural power comes from infant body parts, if the rites are performed by monks or sorcerers. Police say workers there discovered the body parts inside parcel boxes as they were scanning shipments for delivery.
