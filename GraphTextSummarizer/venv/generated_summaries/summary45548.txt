In one instance, however, a sergeant who'd agreed to smuggle paintings out of prison got very confused while looking at them and thought they included a map of a prison, Htein Lin said. In the 6-1/2 years Htein Lin spent in Myanmar prisons between 1998 and 2004, he produced an estimated 250 paintings. Just weeks ago, Htein Lin painted "Twenty Years On," which unites the history of the 1988 pro-democracy movement and the pro-democracy protests in August and September of last year. In 2005, a year after Htein Lin's release from Myaungmya, one guard came to Htein Lin's solo exhibition in Yangon featuring the cotton paintings he did during his prison years. Many uniforms were used for portraits of other political prisoners, of Aung San Suu Kyi, and of Htein Lin's father, who died while the son was still in prison.
