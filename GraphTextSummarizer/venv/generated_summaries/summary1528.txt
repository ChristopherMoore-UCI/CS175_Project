Political women who embrace electoral leadership while parenting young children are becoming much more common. Even for voters who weren't fans of Palin's political views, she became the new face of women in the arena -- someone knee deep in the details of child-rearing, as well as policymaking and vote counting -- a vision that resonated because most mothers in America are working mothers juggling their own careers and families. That was the model for women interested in national political office: Wait to run until the kids were grown. I don't have a crystal ball, but I have my fingers crossed that many political mothers who are in the queue, so to speak, have their eyes on more than just keeping the jobs they have now. Given the demographics and family status of many of the women in politics today, there's a pretty good chance that the first female who gets to sit behind the historic Resolute Desk in the Oval Office will be a mother of young children.
