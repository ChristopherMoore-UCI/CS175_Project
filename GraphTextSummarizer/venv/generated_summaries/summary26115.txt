-- Defense lawyers for two sisters accused of embezzling money from celebrity chef Nigella Lawson and her ex-husband Charles Saatchi argued Wednesday that they were caught in the middle of a personal battle. The case has gripped UK media, thanks to revelations of drug use by Lawson and intimate insights into her troubled marriage to Saatchi, a millionaire art collector. Saatchi had said in an e-mail that Lawson had used drugs regularly, but in his testimony before the court last month, he backed off that claim. Like the Grillo sisters, Saatchi told the court he had never seen Lawson taking drugs, Carpenter said. "This is not a day for you to say 'ooh, I like Miss Lawson, I like her cooking programs,' " she told the jury.
