"So with gratitude and respect for everyone's concern, I ask for my privacy and for my family's privacy to be respected as I return to Texas and try to get back to a normal life and reunite with my dog, Bentley." Bentley, a Cavalier King Charles spaniel, remains in quarantine until the end of the month in Texas, but Pham "will be able to visit, hold and play with him tomorrow," Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins said Friday. Pham said Friday that her thoughts are with Vinson, who is getting treatment for Ebola at Atlanta's Emory University Hospital. Three days later, Pham tested positive for the Ebola virus, becoming the first person in the United States to contract Ebola on American soil. Pham was among the doctors and nurses in Dallas who treated Thomas Eric Duncan, the first person to be diagnosed with Ebola in the United States. Nina Pham was the first person to catch Ebola on U.S. soil, and now, 13 days after testing positive, she has been declared free of the deadly disease.
