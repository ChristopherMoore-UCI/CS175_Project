Yet, the government choose to charge their own people $1 per liter for petrol, without consideration of how people are going to survive. One of the reasons given for subsidy removal is that ordinary Nigerians don't really benefit, but it is a secret cabal behind importing fuel that is benefiting from subsidy and removing it will kill off their influence in the market, but the people disagree with this. Nigeria's Central Bank governor, Sanusi Lamido Sanusi, stated in a town hall meeting on fuel subsidy that 90% of Nigerians live on less that 2$ a day. In fact, life has become worse for them with life expectancy now at an average of 45 years, according to a 2010 United Nation Report. We have inadequate electricity in Nigeria so everything runs on generators; even the power plants are powered by generators.
