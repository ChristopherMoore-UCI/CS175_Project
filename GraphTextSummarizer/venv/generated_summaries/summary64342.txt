Currently the distribution favors Labour, which tends to spread its vote more evenly across the country and to win a large number of seats by small majorities, particularly amid the shrinking populations of inner cities. But the officials charged with the task, and the lengthy appeals process over their decisions, ensure that parliamentary seat sizes don't keep pace with population changes. Without a majority in parliament, a government becomes dependent on MPs -- or lawmakers -- from other parties to get its program voted through the House of Commons, the chamber which passes laws and legislation. The boundaries of parliamentary seats are periodically revised to keep them close to a notional average size. The British election has ended in a hung parliament, as official returns show it is impossible for any one party to get a majority of seats.
