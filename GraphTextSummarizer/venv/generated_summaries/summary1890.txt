-- A hearing continues Thursday to determine the future of John Hinckley Jr., who shot President Ronald Reagan and three others in March 1981. Chasson also quoted from a 1987 diary entry by Hinckley in which he said "psychiatry is a guessing game" and doctors "will never know the true John Hinckley. " "The hospital doesn't know what Mr. Hinckley is thinking, and he wants it that way," the prosecutor said. Although concerned Hinckley was not truthful about his activities, Jones said, "We didn't feel this constituted an increased risk." It's not clear how quickly the judge might issue a ruling on the hospital's plan to gradually allow Hinckley greater freedom.
