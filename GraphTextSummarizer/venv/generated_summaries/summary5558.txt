International law clearly makes waterboarding, secret detention and targeted killing away from battlefields unlawful. -- Four years ago, John Brennan withdrew from consideration for C.I.A. director because of his leadership role there while serious human rights violations were occurring, including waterboarding and secret detention. Lawyers in the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel in both administrations have written secret memos apparently analyzing the legality of these troubling practices. To create an illusion of legality, both administrations coined new labels for unlawful practices. We can safely assume that the memos conclude the United States may lawfully carry out such practices.
