As Matt Zoller Seitz writes in New York magazine, " 'The Sopranos' was never about ending mysteries, it was about recognizing and exploring the mysteries of everyday life: the mysteries of personality, motivation, conditioning and free will, as expressed through behavior and conversation and action, and as translated into metaphor through fantasies and dreams. And Tony, despite having ended therapy with Dr. Melfi and beaten the New York mob, was still gripped by angst. "As David Chase has said numerous times on the record, 'Whether Tony Soprano is alive or dead is not the point.' Earlier Wednesday, Vox ran a long profile of Chase that quoted him as saying that Tony Soprano, whose fate was left hanging in the show's famous, sudden cut to black, had lived. For years, Chase has refused to say what happened to Tony.
