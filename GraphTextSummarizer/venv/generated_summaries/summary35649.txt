Holmavik is located about 220 kilometers (135 miles) southeast of Isafjordur in the Strandir (or "the coast") region of the Westfjords. "A common joke ... is that since there's mountains on all sides, you only need a lid over it," says Haukur Magnusson, an Isafjordur native who edits Reykjavik Grapevine, an English-language magazine. A short drive from the town center leads up Bolafjall, a mountain that locals claim offers clear day views across the strait to Greenland. In Westfjords, a lonely peninsula that juts out like a thumb into the Denmark Strait toward Greenland, it seems even more so. " Tjoruhusid One of the best seafood restaurants in the Westfjords, and really all of Iceland, Tjoruhusid (Nedstakaupstad 400; +354 456 4419), occupies a beautiful old building at the Isafjordur harbor's edge.
