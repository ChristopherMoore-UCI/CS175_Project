King: Speaking of optimism, in March, President Obama lifted the ban on federal financing for embryonic stem cell research. He also talked about his family, a new approach to acting and President Obama's lifting of a ban on stem cell research, among other things. And so I started to think about it more kind of empirically, writing a book about optimism as a subject, and interviewing researchers about it and talking to people who are optimistic and traveling to places where people are optimistic and all of this stuff. ... I see a lot of broader shoulders these days, people are really working on the delts, you know? And it took me -- you know, it's funny, because I sit and talk about "Always Looking Up" and being optimistic, and accept the losses and move on or find new gains, but it took me about seven years, I think, to really get to the point where I could tell people about it.
