-- A rural Pennsylvania community will say goodbye Tuesday to seven children who were killed when their parent's farmhouse went up in flames last week. "It's just hard to explain how somebody could lose their whole family in a wink of an eye like that," Steve Orris, who works at an insurance company in Loysville, said last week. "While mom's milking cows, her 3-year-old daughter comes running into the barn and the 3-year-old tells the mother that there's smoke inside the house," Tom Pinkerton of the state police said last week. The children -- ages 7 months to 11 years -- died March 8 when the fire fully engulfed the Mennonite family's two-story house in Loysville, about 25 miles northwest of Harrisburg. Mother Janelle Clouse was milking cows in the barn and father Ted Clouse was making deliveries on his milk route.
