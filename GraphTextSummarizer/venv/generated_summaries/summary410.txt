The British company has been running Titanic tours since 1998 but expedition leader Rob McCallum says the forthcoming trips will likely be their last. Unless another company comes along with a viable plan to continue the commercial voyages, however, McCallum believes it likely that future generations will be unable to indulge their varying Titanic curiosities first hand. "We actually finished the Titanic dives in 2005 but it's the centenary year and we had so many requests to make the trip that we decided to do it one more time," says McCallum. Although heavily involved in organizing and planning the trip for DOE, McCallum has only ever been able to take the plunge to the Titanic once.
