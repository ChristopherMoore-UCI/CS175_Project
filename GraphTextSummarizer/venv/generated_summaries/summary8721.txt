London police said Thursday they are planning one of the largest and most complex operations in their history as the city gears up to host the G-20 summit next week. An "Alternative G-20 Summit" will also taking place near the summit venue, the ExCeL convention center in east London. April 1, the day before the summit, will see various smaller demonstrations in central London.
