While some speculated whether Donovan's age (32) or perceived lack of heart -- he said in 2012 he wasn't sure if he wanted to go to Brazil and last year went on sabbatical during an arduous World Cup qualifying campaign -- others simply denounced the decision. It's 19 more than the total goals racked up by the No. 2 all-time scorer, World Cup captain Clint Dempsey. The most glorious dos a cero for American fans came when Donovan buried the second goal in the 2002 World Cup round of 16. Bruce Arena, who coaches Donovan for Major League Soccer's Los Angeles Galaxy and also skippered the 2002 and 2006 World Cup squads, told the San Jose Mercury-News, "If there are 23 better players than Landon, then we have a chance to win the World Cup." He has yet to score in seven games for his club this year, and his performances for the national team have been such that Klinsmann pulled him out of a World Cup qualifier against Jamaica last year and benched him during an April friendly against Mexico.
