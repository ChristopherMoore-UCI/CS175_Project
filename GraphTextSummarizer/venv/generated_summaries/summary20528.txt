"If you were at either of these locations during the times listed above and are not immune to measles, the most likely time you would become sick is between September 13th and September 27th," the health department said in a statement. The United States is seeing a record number of measles cases this year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In rare cases, measles can lead to pneumonia and brain infections, which can be fatal. The King County Department of Public Health in Washington state is investigating "a confirmed case of measles infection" in a traveler who was at the airport while he or she was contagious. The traveler was likely exposed to measles abroad, the health department said.
