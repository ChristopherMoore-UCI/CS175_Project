From Sochi, where he is trying to salvage the spirit of Ukraine's athletes at the Winter Olympics, Bubka has watched on in horror as anti-government protestors clash with police. "As members of Ukraine's national Olympic team, we are extremely indignant at latest actions by President of Ukraine Viktor Yanukovych, who has drenched Ukrainians' last hopes in blood instead of resolving the conflict with Maidan (anti-government protesters) through negotiations, which we had hoped he would when we left for Sochi," they said. "I couldn't believe that has happened in my country," the 50-year-old, who is head of Ukraine's Olympic Committee, told CNN in Sochi Thursday. "We want to show to everyone that Ukraine exists and is united through sport and Olympics." Earlier this month Olympic champion Renaud Lavillenie broke Bubka's 21-year-old pole vault world record with a 6.16-meter leap in the Ukrainian's home city of Donetsk. Also a member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), Bubka held a meeting with his country's 43 athletes in Sochi.
