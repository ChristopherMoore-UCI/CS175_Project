"Maybe my dad will take me to some other store that supports girls to actually PLAY basketball and follow their dreams and not sit on the sidelines and watch the game to get my next pair of shoes and equipment," McKenna wrote. The Petersons say they may take their business elsewhere unless Dick's resolves to include more women in its advertising; McKenna even named several of her favorite professional women's basketball players who would fit the bill in the letter. "They said that they liked her letter and that in future publications they will consider putting more women in the catalog," Peterson told CNN. It was a very nice conversation that McKenna re-stated her opinion that there needs to be more girls represented." UPDATE: McKenna's father, Chris Peterson, tweeted out a response note the family received from Dick's and expressed his disappointment with the "form letter."
