Speaking to HLN's Vinnie Politan, Emily Altman -- a counselor at the Tallapoosa Primary School -- said that she'd taught Brittney and other students as young as four years old some self-defense basics as part of a program called "Good Touch, Bad Touch." Bremen Police Chief Keith Pesnell told HLN that he favored changing the rules, so that there were greater restrictions on people who are convicted of violent crimes -- to prevent incidents like the one that allegedly happened to Brittney. However she learned what to do, young Brittney responded "perfectly" to the alleged kidnapper, her counselor said. Georgeann Baxter told HLN's Jane Velez-Mitchell that she was in the Bremen store with her daughter, Brittney, on Wednesday. "He came up to me and started a conversation," Brittney recalled Thursday to HLN.
