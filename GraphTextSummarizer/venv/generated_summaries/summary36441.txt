He spent six years in prison after being convicted of corruption charges in 1999 and of sodomy charges involving his wife's former driver in 2000. Malaysia's top court on Tuesday upheld the conviction of opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim on the charge of sodomizing a former political aide, prompting criticism from human rights activists. Anwar was the heir apparent to former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad until 1998, when he was sacked and charged with corruption and sodomy. The governing coalition, which has been in power for more than half a century, fell short of that mark again in elections in 2013 but retained its grip on power. The decision appeared likely to be the final chapter in a lengthy and politically contentious legal battle, taking Anwar out of contention for elections for the foreseeable future.
