Detectives spent a bitter-cold Wednesday at Sigg's home in Westminster as crime scene technicians gathered more evidence in the gruesome case. The father had been arrested many times, local television stations said -- accused of domestic violence, assault, bank fraud. Now her daughter, like many in the neighborhood, find themselves once again facing that stare -- from Sigg's mugshot as it blares from television newscasts. So, when Austin Reed Sigg was arrested Tuesday night, accused of strangling 10-year-old Jessica Ridgeway, dismembering her and placing her body parts under the two-story home where he lived, many of the girls in that Denver suburb weren't shocked. The local district attorney said Sigg, a student at Arapahoe Community College, will be tried as an adult.
