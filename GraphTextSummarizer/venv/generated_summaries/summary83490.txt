-- A 35-year-old woman on a first date plummeted to her death early Thursday morning when she fell from the balcony of her 17th floor New York City apartment. Jennifer Rosoff went outside on her balcony around 12:50 a.m. Thursday to talk and smoke a cigarette with her date when the balcony's railing broke, according to police. According to her Linkedin profile, Rosoff worked as director of sales at TripleLift for the past five months and had previously held positions at The New Yorker, Conde Nast and Cosmopolitan magazine. "Her tremendous energy and humor brought so much joy to the office." Richard Dansereau, managing director of Stonehenge Management LLC, the company that manages the building, also released a statement. "This is a tragedy, and our sincere condolences go out to the family and friends of Ms. Rosoff," he said.
