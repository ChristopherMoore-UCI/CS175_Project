-- Children playing in a Texas suburb made a gruesome discovery Monday -- the decomposing body of a child on a residential street. We don't have a model or a make," Saginaw police spokesman Damon Ing told CNN. He said the truck has green paint splattered on its right rear quarter panel. CNN affiliate KTVT said no children from the area have been reported missing. Authorities aren't sure who left the body under a tarp in Saginaw, a northern suburb of Fort Worth.
