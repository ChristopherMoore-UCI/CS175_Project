That sums up the congressional and Senate races, but many states have other contests, including 37 governors' races (19 Democrats, 17 Republicans and one independent up for election). If early in the evening, Democratic incumbents start losing in the early returns from states such as New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Florida, then it is likely the trend predicted for Republicans to gain a majority in the House will come true. Here is what's happening in the House: All 435 seats are up, and 43 seats are open (20 Democrats and 23 Republicans are not running for re-election). But in other cases, it will be late Tuesday and maybe even sometime Wednesday before we know the final results -- particularly in the Senate, where key Western races may alter the final outcome. In order to win a Senate majority, Republicans have to hold Alaska and all their  open seats: New Hampshire, Kentucky, Ohio, Florida, Missouri, Utah and Kansas.
