With the internet blurring the boundary between local news and national or even international news, analysts say the work of reporters like Xuan reflects greater social trends and show the difficulties ordinary people face in their daily life. "I feel it's my responsibility to let the truth help promote social progress or solve social problems," the Shanghai native said. -- For more than a decade, television journalist Xuan Kejiong has covered almost every major disaster in China's largest metropolis, from fires and typhoons to robberies and murders. Like all news outlets in China, Shanghai TV is state-run and falls under the same extensive system of control and censorship, both on air and online. " Despite a 24/7 work schedule that has at times strained his marriage, Xuan says he will keep probing, looking for the truth and giving a voice to the voiceless in order to promote social progress.
