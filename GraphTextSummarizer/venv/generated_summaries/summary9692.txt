TB bacteria usually attack the lungs, but they can also attack other parts of the body such as the kidneys, spine and brain, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. -- The Fairfax County, Virginia, health department is investigating a tuberculosis outbreak at an area school after three people tested positive for the potentially fatal bacteria, officials said Thursday. The first case of tuberculosis at Robert E. Lee High School was diagnosed in December 2012, and the health department opened and completed an investigation, the agency said. Health officials declined to say whether the three were students or teachers. But because two more people from the same school were diagnosed with it in June, the department re-opened the December case and is investigating whether they are related.
