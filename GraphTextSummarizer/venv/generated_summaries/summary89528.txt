A week later, on June 1, Egyptian prosecutors released a statement that said Mubarak had repeated irregular heartbeats that, combined with low blood pressure and an "instant drop in blood circulation in the brain ... leads to instant unconsciousness." El Deeb revealed Monday that Mubarak underwent major surgery in June 2010 at a German hospital. El Deeb has said Mubarak is "very sad and sorry" about the allegations, but has no regrets and denies giving any kind of authorization to fire on demonstrators. And the family lawyer, also named El Deeb but no relation to the doctor, said he submitted an official request Thursday asking for permission for the German surgeon to check on Mubarak. Mubarak's sons, Gama and Alaa, are accused of acquiring property at below-market prices, El Deeb said.
