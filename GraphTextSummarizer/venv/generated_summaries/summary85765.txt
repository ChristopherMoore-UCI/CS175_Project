-- France defender William Gallas has attacked former national coach Raymond Domenech, blaming him for the team's disastrous performance at the World Cup in South Africa. Domenech, as was decided before the competition began, has now been replaced by former World Cup winner Laurent Blanc. The 34-year-old made his first appearance for Les Bleus 13 years ago and has more than 100 caps, but was controversially left out of France's World Cup squad by Domenech. In an interview with French weekly culture magazine Les Inrockuptibles on Wednesday, Gallas became the first French player to speak about the disastrous World Cup campaign, saying that "the real problem is the coach. Domenech never told me," said Gallas, who was vice-captain under former skipper Thierry Henry.
