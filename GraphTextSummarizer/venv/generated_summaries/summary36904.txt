As Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy and the rest of their fuzzy friends prepared to return to the big screen for the first time in six years in their new film, "The Muppets" (also starring Jason Segal, Amy Adams and the newest addition to the Muppet brood, Walter), they took time out from their busy schedule of "SNL" visits,  Password games with Jimmy Fallon and their star-studded movie premiere to talk to CNN, and answer some questions submitted via iReport, about their beloved, late creator Jim Henson, their Hollywood crushes, and Piggy's glamorous new magazine job. Brad Pitt, Brad Paisley, Bradley Cooper, Enrique Iglesias, George Clooney, Javier Bardem, David Beckham, Patrick Dempsey, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Johnny Depp, Rodrigo Santoro -- I'll send you the complete list later; this is gonna take too long. And your favorite albums are the soundtrack to "The Muppets" (featuring moi) and "The Green Album" featuring songs made famous by moi -- and the other Muppets. did you give any acting tips to Jason Segal, Amy Adams or the rest of the cast of "The Muppets"? As for the other Muppets, you can't really give them acting tips, since I don't think any of them are acting; that's just them being themselves.
