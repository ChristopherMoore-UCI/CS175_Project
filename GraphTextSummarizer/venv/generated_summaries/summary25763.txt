Going too far Writing this past week on CNN.com, conservative commentator David Frum said age was openly discussed when Reagan, Dole and McCain ran for president. Another GOP strategist with presidential campaign experience chimed in with a one-word "nope" when asked if it is wise to raise Clinton's age. Scott Reed, who was Dole's 1996 campaign manager, said just about anything, including age, can be relevant as a presidential campaign issue. Bill Clinton allies weren't shy, in public and even more so in private, in suggesting the Kansas senator was too old. Ted Cruz is 43, and Marco Rubio and Bobby Jindal are 42 Dole was 73 when he became the Republican presidential nominee in 1996 -- the oldest first-time presidential nominee.
