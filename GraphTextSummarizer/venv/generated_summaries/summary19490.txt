Pressure on China, South Korea and India to further reduce their imports of Iranian oil intensified this week when Hillary Clinton, US secretary of state, announced that Japan and ten European countries had qualified for exemptions from US penalties on institutions that deal with Iran's central bank. -- China, South Korea and Japan dramatically cut their oil imports from Iran in February following intense US efforts to persuade Asian buyers to comply with Washington sanctions on Iran's central bank. "The market perception is that the drop in crude imports from Iran is not a signal that China is following US/EU sanctions, but more related to pricing issues that were being worked out at the time," said Soozhana Choi, head of Asia commodities research at Deutsche Bank. Iran oil production has fallen to a 10-year low and could drop further as sanctions over its nuclear programme disrupt an industry already suffering from years of under-investment. Despite China's obvious drop in Iranian oil purchases, Beijing is officially firmly opposed to the US and European Union sanctions.
