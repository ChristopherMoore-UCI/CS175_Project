"Mr. Chaney is responsible for causing dozens of illegally obtained, private photographs to be posted on the Internet, where they were available for all to see," said U.S. Attorney Andre Birotte Jr. Chaney admitted when he entered his guilty plea that he hacked e-mail accounts by clicking on the "forgot your password?" "Most of the victims did not check their account settings, so even after they regained control of their e-mail accounts, Chaney's e-mail address remained in their account settings." I wasn't attempting to break into e-mails and get stuff to sell or purposely put it on the Internet. A Florida man who said he became addicted to spying on celebrities must spend the next 10 years in a federal prison for hacking their e-mail.
