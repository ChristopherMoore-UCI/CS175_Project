The 17-time grand slam champion will seek his fifth title at the Indian Wells Masters event on Sunday, having breezed past 28th seed Alexandr Dolgopolov 6-3 6-1 in a semifinal lasting just over an hour. Dolgopolov had been trying to become the first player ranked outside the top 30 to beat both Federer and defending champion Rafael Nadal in the same tournament. " Djokovic, who won the tournament in 2008 and 2011, had to work a bit harder than Federer to beat 2012 finalist John Isner on Saturday. The Swiss veteran, who won his fourth title in the California desert tournament in 2012, will return to the top five in the rankings next week -- up three places. Novak Djokovic, who he beat last month on the way to winning the Dubai title, also on an outdoor hardcourt surface.
