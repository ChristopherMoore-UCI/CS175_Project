-- The mother of "Good Morning America" host Robin Roberts has died, ABC News reported early Friday. Her mother, Lucimarian Tolliver Roberts, appeared on the morning show several times, CNN affiliate WXYZ reported. Roberts found a match, but others likely won't be as lucky CNN's Breeanna Hare and Jordana Ossad contributed to this report. The morning show host was preparing to leave the show Friday to take an extended medical leave, but left a day early to help her ailing mother. Roberts made it home to Mississippi to see her 88-year-old mother, who died Thursday evening, according to the news network.
