-- Emergency teams on Sunday were assessing damage from deadly storms that devastated parts of Missouri, Kentucky and West Virginia this weekend -- even as the threat of more severe weather continued. West Virginia Gov. Joe Manchin tours Mingo County to assess damage caused by extensive rain and flooding. On Sunday, parts of the Meramec and Big rivers were rising feet above flood levels, causing residents already hit by the storms to seek higher ground. A weekend of storming in West Virginia destroyed as many as 400 buildings and severely damaged an additional 1,000, said Rob Jelacic of the West Virginia Office of Emergency Services. Forecasters expected the Meramec to crest Monday 4 to 8 feet above flood state in St. Louis County.
