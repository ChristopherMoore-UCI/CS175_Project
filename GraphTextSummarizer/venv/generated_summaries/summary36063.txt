Saudi Arabia's 87-year-old ruler, King Abdullah, arrived Sunday at a Riyadh hospital to undergo his third back surgery within a year, the Saudi Press Agency reported. Abdullah last had back surgery in December at New York's Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center for a herniated disc and a blood clot that were causing him back pain. Abdullah has ruled the oil-rich kingdom since the August 2005 death of his half-brother, King Fahd. He spent several weeks in Morocco undergoing physical therapy. The king first underwent successful surgery on November 24.
