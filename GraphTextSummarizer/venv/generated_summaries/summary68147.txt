Though the geopolitical makeup of each Arab Spring country is different, Shea and other religious freedom scholars say that a pious holiday like Easter presents an opportunity for anti-Christian groups to seek out worshippers. Thankfully, thousands of Easter services -- from the annual sunrise service at Arlington National Cemetery outside Washington, D.C., to throngs of worshipers attending Mass in the Philippines -- were far more peaceful, a time for both reflection and celebration. Religious holidays have long been a venue for terrorist attacks against all religious groups in the Middle East and North Africa. Last Easter, Benedict called for peace amid ongoing conflicts in Africa and the Middle East and mentioned the plight of those in Japan recovering from the devastating earthquake and tsunami. For Christians in countries thrown into tumult by the Arab Spring revolutions, some say Easter celebrations could prove dangerous.
