I had to develop a lot of these very different aspects, but more importantly I have also met a lot of people who have joined Lytro, invested in Lytro or become partners with Lytro that have helped us to grow this vision of bringing computational photography to consumer cameras. All have, at one stage or another, sought out Ren Ng -- the Malaysian-born inventor of Lytro, a hand-held digital camera that aims to revolutionize photography and simplify the art of taking pictures. Ren Ng: It lets you focus pictures after you take the shot and this really enriches your creativity as it makes a totally new kind of interactive picture. Lytro works by employing a micro-lens array to capture the entire light field -- every ray of light traveling in all directions through a scene, which regular cameras cannot do -- before focusing the information captured onto a sensor. -- What do Steve Jobs, Hollywood film studios and Silicon Valley venture capitalists have in common?
