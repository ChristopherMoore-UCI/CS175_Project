It was a light moment near the end of a routine progress hearing for Brown, the singer who is three years into his five years of probation for the 2009 assault on his then-girlfriend, singer Rihanna. Brown, who recently revealed he is seeing Rihanna again, has completed his community labor requirements and other probation requirements, according to the latest probation report given the judge. Brown must return to court on January 17, 2013, for another probation progress report. Judge Schnegg lifted her "stay away" order, that preventing Brown from near Rihanna, in February 2011. Brown's probation supervision has been transferred from his hometown of Richmond, Virginia, to Los Angeles in September, the judge revealed.
