There's a quiet appeal to a way of life that doesn't involve computers, cell phones, traffic, radios or GPS systems. I feel fortunate to be able to spend my days writing inspirational fiction, and even talking about it to people at a dinner party. My husband squeezed my hand, told how I write inspirational romances and said he was proud of me. Several articles have appeared lately in the media about the popularity of inspirational romances. It would be impossible to park my faith on the sidelines, pulling it out only on Sundays when it's time for church.
