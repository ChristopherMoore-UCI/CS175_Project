"The fortunate thing is that Moon Rabbit was especially designed for the short-term exhibition for Taoyuan Land Arts Festival, and the festival was over yesterday," said Hsin-yi Hu, exbihition manager for Blue Dragon Art Company, the Taiwan-based group responsible for bringing the rabbit to the festival. The man whose giant rubber duck was stabbed 42 times in Belgium, attacked by a suspected eagle in Keelung City, Taiwan, and sunk in Hong Kong has a new disaster to contend with: grilled rabbit. "The workers have disassembled and set aside the rabbit's ears and head before removing the limbs of the rabbit," according to Department of Cultural Affairs, Taoyuan County Government. Cause of fire unknown The cause of the fire is still under investigation, but is believed to have been "caused by sparks from chainsaws" used by workers disassembling the rabbit, according to Focus Taiwan. About five percent of the remaining rabbit is scorched, resulting a charred torso and paws.
