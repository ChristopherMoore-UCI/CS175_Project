Vienna Come wintertime, Christmas markets in Vienna become as ubiquitous as the city's elaborate Baroque architecture. Stroll from Place Broglie to Place Kléber under the glow of thousands of brilliant lights until you arrive at the festival's focal point: the breathtakingly giant Sapin de Noël, or Christmas tree. When: 26 November to 31 December What to buy: For Christmas decorations (Strasbourg's been peddling them since 1600) head to the Place de la Cathédrale. By ditching the mall and making the journey to one of Europe's fabled Christmas markets, you can exchange chain stores for cozy wooden chalets, Muzak for angelic choirs and consumer frenzy for down-to-earth local holiday cheer. Or why not buy a live carp -- sold in tubs lining the streets -- to cook up a traditional Czech Christmas dinner?
