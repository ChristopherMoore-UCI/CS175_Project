The latest Lundberg Survey found the average price of regular gasoline rose to $3.51 per gallon, publisher Trilby Lundberg said Sunday. There's a glut of the fuel on U.S. markets, so its price went up only 21 cents a barrel between surveys, Lundberg said. Lundberg blamed the jump on reduced production from North Sea platforms, tensions among Iran, its Persian Gulf neighbors and Western powers and a dispute between Sudan and newly independent South Sudan that has cut off southern oil from global markets. -- A sharp increase in the price of North Sea oil helped drive U.S. gasoline prices up about 12 cents a gallon since late January, according to a new nationwide survey. Meanwhile, U.S. retailers have little margin to absorb the increased fuel prices, meaning pump prices may edge up "a few more pennies" in the coming weeks, Lundberg said.
