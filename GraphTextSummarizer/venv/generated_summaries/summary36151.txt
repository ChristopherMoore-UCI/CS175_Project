The entertainer known as "Mr. Las Vegas" was facing debt collection of more than $455,000 from a breached contract with a man identified in court documents as Monty Ward. CNN's Brittany Kaplan, Karan Olson and Tom Laabs contributed to this report. Thursday's action by the deputies was Ward's attempt to use the legal options available to him to collect on the judgment, an attorney connected to the case told CNN. -- Nevada sheriff's deputies descended Thursday on Wayne Newton's 38-acre ranch with movers in tow to carry out a debt-collection action, but were rebuffed, officials told CNN. Because Ward had not been paid, he was taking other steps to collect, the attorney said.
