Overall, violence has dropped significantly in Iraq since the peak of sectarian violence, between 2005 and 2007. But tensions and violence, stirred in part by enmity between Shiites and Sunnis, have persisted since the U.S-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. In Baghdad, a car bomb explosion in Sadr City -- a volatile, Shiite neighborhood in the eastern part of the Iraqi capital -- left three people and and 17 more wounded, police told CNN. -- Eleven people -- six in Baghdad and five in Kirkuk -- died in attacks in the two major Iraqi cities, police said Thursday. Another car bomb blew up Thursday near an outdoor market in Baghdad's Chukook neighborhood -- also a predominantly Shiite district.
