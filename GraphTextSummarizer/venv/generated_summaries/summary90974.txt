As Xi pursues these aspirations, he should join Obama in exploring similar issues that are hindering both countries -- a growing divide between the rich and poor, persistent post-graduate unemployment, housing bubbles, food safety concerns, immigration (or internal migration for China) reform, health care reform and tax reform. In contrast to the 2002 farewell summit between President George W. Bush and outgoing Chinese President Jiang Zemin at Bush's ranch in Crawford, Texas, this week's talks between Barack Obama and Xi Jinping in California mark the first time in history that a U.S. president will host a series of informal meetings with a new Chinese leader. As a former professor of constitutional law, Obama is uniquely situated to address the importance of Chinese political reform and constitutionalism. If Xi is to be successful in confronting these issues, it will be difficult to do so without political reform. Both Xi and Obama are finding themselves at political crossroads that will define their subsequent days in office.
