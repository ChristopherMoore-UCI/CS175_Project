Bush has declined to attend a social conservative gathering in Iowa later this month that will feature a hoard of other potential candidates, like Chris Christie, Mike Huckabee, Scott Walker, Ted Cruz, Rick Perry, Ben Carson and Rick Santorum. Republican strategist and Bush supporter Ana Navarro, who's also a CNN contributor, said Bush is focused on fundraising and organizing but added voters can expect Bush do some public events in the coming weeks. While Bush campaigned for 2014 candidates last year, he didn't hit the early primary states like Iowa and New Hampshire, which hold the first two nominating contests and where other potential presidential contenders have already made frequent visits. The chairman of the Iowa Republican Party says he hasn't heard yet from former Gov. Jeb Bush about his interest in the 2016 presidential race. Campbell told the Wall Street Journal that Bush "will travel to states around the country in the coming months to support conservative candidates and causes."
