To call this ugly and unrelenting wave of police violence against unarmed African-Americans a national crisis is not an exaggeration -- we are losing the confidence of a generation of young people who no longer believe in the legitimacy or credibility of our law enforcement and the justice system that underpins it. There must be zero tolerance for racism, brutality and corruption in police departments. Yet until police officers come to expect swift and certain punishment for violating their oath to protect and serve, we are unlikely to see a real decrease in incidents of racially motivated police brutality. But the failure of local law enforcement leadership to vigorously and aggressively discipline, punish and, where appropriate, remove those officers from police forces around the country has allowed the bad apples to spoil the whole bunch. That's partly because police brutality is neither new nor reflective of a "moment."
