-- Gas prices might have breached the $4 per gallon mark in the U.S., but there won't be much sympathy for the American plight in Europe. In fact, that U.S. price of £2.52 a gallon looks highly affordable compared to the UK's current average cost of £6.22 ($9.85). And prices throughout the rest of Europe are similarly high. Its second tax, VAT (Value Added Tax, similar to U.S. sales taxes), is levied on the final cost, giving us an inescapable double whammy. Owning a car that does a mere 35mpg seems so last century.
