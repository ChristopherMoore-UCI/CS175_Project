The assault began when one of the suicide attackers detonated an explosives-filled truck at the front gate of the spy agency, said Shafiq Nang, a spokesman for the governor of Ghazni province. Taliban suicide bombers attacked Afghanistan's regional spy headquarters in Ghazni city early Thursday, leaving 21 people dead and more than 150 civilians wounded, a government official said. A Taliban spokesman claimed responsibility for the attack. Most of the injuries were the result of broken glass and collapsed roofs from the explosion. The remaining two were members of the National Directorate of Security personnel.
