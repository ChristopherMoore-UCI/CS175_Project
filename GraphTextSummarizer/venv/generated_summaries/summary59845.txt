-- Auburn University officials got their first glimmer of hope Friday since they received word that that school's beloved live oak trees had been poisoned with a massive dose of the virulent herbicide Spike 80DF. Fans typically gather around the trees after victories, draping them with toilet paper, said Mike Clardy, Auburn University spokesman. A task force made up of horticulturists, agronomists and engineers had determined that the area directly adjacent to the trees does not show high concentrations of the dangerous toxin, Auburn spokeswoman Deedie Dowdle said. "We've had hundreds of calls of encouragement and suggestions from other schools in the SEC, including from the University of Alabama," he said, referring to the Southeastern Conference, which includes Auburn and the University of Alabama. Attorney Jerry M. Blevins said Tuesday that he was retained on the matter last week but withdrew from the case, based on "some conflicts between me and Mr. Updyke." Updyke's two previous court-appointed attorneys were allowed to withdraw because of their affiliations with Auburn University.
