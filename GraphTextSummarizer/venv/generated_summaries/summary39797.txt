With Iran's president in New York for the UN General Assembly, an Iranian-American family in Michigan is appealing to Mahmoud Ahmadinejad publicly to have their son - imprisoned in Iran on espionage charges - released before his father dies of brain cancer. In a hospital interview with CNN, the father of former US marine Amir Mirzaei Hekmati, says if his son is not released soon, he will pass away without ever seeing him again. Mother of accused U.S. spy says Iranian charges are false A court convicted Hekmati of espionage, sentencing him to death, but he has since been granted a retrial. Amir Hekmati, a former marine and decorated Iraq war veteran, was born in Arizona and raised in Nebraska and Michigan. "Please, please, please release an innocent man," pleaded the father, Ali Hekmati, who had a cancerous tumor removed from his brain.
