With the Atrix and the Bionic, Motorola is trying to hard to differentiate from the existing glut of Android smartphones on the market. We've been waiting to see a finished version of this phone since Motorola first showed off the Bionic in January. The phone came back as a connectivity beast with lots of optional peripheral attachments, turning the Bionic into a successor of sorts to the Atrix, Motorola's most recent dual-core, peripheral-enhanced handheld. After plugging the phone into the station on the back hinge, the Bionic launches Motorola's "webtop" interface, which is essentially a desktop-lite environment powered by the phone's hardware. Our average download speeds clocked in around 10 Mbps in the San Francisco Bay Area on average, with upload speeds ranging from 4 to 6 Mbps.
