The two-day ritual slaughter of tens of thousands of animals -- among the world's largest sacrifice of animals -- began Tuesday in southern Nepal, officials said. About 200,000 animals, including male water buffalo, goats and roosters will be slaughtered, despite protests from animal rights activists, according to the chief priest of the festival. People from Nepal and India sacrifice animals to the goddess Gadhimai in the Bara district, about 150 kilometers (about one mile) south of Kathmandu, in thanks for wishes granted. "This is a matter of people's religion and belief," said chief district officer Tara Nath Gautam, the highest-ranking government official in Bara. A sustained effort is needed so that, sometime, the practice will end," said Nepali animal rights activist Pramada Shah.
