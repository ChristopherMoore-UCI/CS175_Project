Japan's Osaka International Airport claimed the top spot for medium sized airports with 93.2%, followed by Moscow Sheremetyevo (89.8%) and Copenhagen Airport (89.8%). The rest of the top 10 includes: Iberia (89.7%), KLM (89.4%), Saudi Arabian Airlines (89.4%), SAS (89.1%), Japan Airlines (88.8%), Finnair (88.6) and Alaska Airlines (88.5%). The most punctual large air hub was named as Munich Airport (89%) -- a fact that'll do little to dispel stereotypes of German efficiency, but one that also highlights the five-year delay to Berlin's still unopened Brandenburg Airport. European destinations dominated the timekeeping list when it comes to small airports, with Bristol followed closely by Brussels South Charleroi Airport at 93.1% and Berlin Schoenefeld at 92.3%. Second and third were Hawaiian Airlines at 92.3% and Austrian Airlines at 90%.
