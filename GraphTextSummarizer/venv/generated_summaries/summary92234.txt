The rosiest scenario, says Landis, sees moderate Sunni groups eventually carving out a state in northern Syria, expelling ISIS in the process, while the regime holds onto Damascus and a swathe of the coast around Latakia. Landis says ISIS has made al Nusra "look just like any other militia," driving it out of Deir Ezzour in eastern Syria and Aleppo. Joshua Landis, a veteran Syria-watcher and Associate Professor at the University of Oklahoma, says the situation inside Syria is more fluid and unpredictable than ever, with rebel groups confused about U.S. intentions and knocked sideways by ISIS' ruthless advance. One man who might benefit from Washington's new plan is Jamal Maarouf, commander of the Syrian Revolutionary Front, which was formed to oppose ISIS in northern Syria. That may have prompted the ISIS onslaught; now those Kurds left in northern Syria are fighting for their survival.
