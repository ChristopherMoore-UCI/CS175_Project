We might look to Ferguson to see what else must come next: learning about the issues, better supporting local businesses and nonprofits, expanding voter registration and voter education, monitoring local courtrooms and bureaucrats and holding accountable those officials who have used their power for harm rather than for good. We made Ferguson because too many of us would rather tweet than get involved in the messiness of local politics and community building. In the best cases, these divisions create the possibility for good local government and communities where friendship and civic involvement can flourish. It includes not only working-class blacks and white professionals, but also black professionals and working-class whites. And that's true not only of the initial police response to Ferguson, but also of the restrictions placed on many of the Occupy demonstrations, on some labor protests and in many other instances of political and religious dissent in recent years.
