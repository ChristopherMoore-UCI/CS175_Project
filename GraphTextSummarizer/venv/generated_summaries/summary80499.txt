For instance, scientists need to use pi when calculating how  "loops" -- particles that transform themselves into other particles, and then come back together to make the original particle again -- contribute to a particle's mass. The electron would have no mass if it were not for this "substance," the field made of Higgs particles. These two detectors are looking for unusual particles that slip into existence when subatomic particles crash into one another at high energies. To figure that out, scientists must look at how fast the boson decays into other particles, and see how the decay rate stacks up against predictions. The $10 billion particle-smasher set a record in 2012 for the amount of energy achieved in particle collisions: 8 trillion electron volts (TeV).
