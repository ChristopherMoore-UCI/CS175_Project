Six people, including five foreigners, face execution by firing squad in coming days in Indonesia, as the country's new president upholds a hard line on drug offenders. Indonesia, which has extremely strict drug laws, carries out executions by firing squad. Also sentenced to death and facing likely execution this year are the two Australian ringleaders of the so-called "Bali Nine" ring, arrested in 2005 with more than 8 kg of heroin. Widodo had previously told a university audience he planned to reject the 64 appeals for clemency he had received from drug offenders on death row. The government of the Netherlands is also protesting the planned execution of Indonesian-born Dutch citizen Ang Kiem Soei, who was condemned to death in 2003 for drug trafficking.
