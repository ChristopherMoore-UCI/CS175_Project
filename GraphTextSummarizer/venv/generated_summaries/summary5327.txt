-- New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie called a fire raging through boardwalk buildings Thursday an "unthinkable situation" as firefighters continued to fight the high flames and black smoke in Seaside Park, New Jersey. Christie explained that fire troops were experiencing water supply challenges because of damage to the system post Sandy, and that teams were drawing lines from Barnegat Bay. Fire personnel dug a 20-foot trench on Lincoln Avenue; "that's where firefighters are making their stand right now," Christie said. After all the effort and time and resources that we've put in to help the folks in Seaside Park and Seaside Heights rebuild. " The famous boardwalk of Seaside Heights was thrown into the public eye shortly after Superstorm Sandy tore its famous Jet Star roller coaster into the water.
