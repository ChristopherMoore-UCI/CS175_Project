A selfie taken by a homicide suspect posing with his alleged victim and later posted to the social media site Snapchat "was a key piece of evidence that led investigators to the defendant," John Peck, district attorney for Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, said Monday. The photo shows the victim, 16-year old Ryan Mangan, sitting in a chair with a gunshot wound to his face, according to police documents. According to the criminal complaint, Mangan was found dead by his mother last Wednesday after he was shot in the face inside his home. A couple of days after Mangan's body was discovered, police received a call from a mother whose son received a Snapchat photo from the suspect, 16. Police say he confessed to using the firearm to shoot Mangan in the face and leaving him in his room.
