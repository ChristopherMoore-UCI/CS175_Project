-- As fear about the spread of Ebola continues, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power says she'll be following standard health protocol following her return from Africa. For those traveling overseas to areas of Africa where Ebola runs rampant, the CDC advises a self-monitoring period of 21 days and seeking medical care immediately if any of the symptoms -- like a strong fever, headache or vomiting -- are displayed. Power tweeted pictures of herself Friday morning being screened at the airport upon arrival in the U.S. The tweet also says that she'll be monitoring her health for 21 days, as per guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Power has said she will "obey the law and whatever requirements are in place."
