Wanted by some nations and sheltered by others, Posada's journeys through some Latin American nations during civil wars illustrate the checkered political map of the region as the U.S. sought to undermine Marxist movements in Central America, many backed by Cuba's Castro regime. -- Luis Posada Carriles told CNN recently he would "be gentle" with a newspaper reporter who accused him of masterminding decades of violent terrorist attacks in Central America, several to overthrow Fidel Castro. Born in Cuba, Posada dedicated his life to anti-Marxist, anti-Castro covert activities. " Venezuela has dismissed as "farce" the Texas jury's decision to acquit  Posada, who faced charges of lying to U.S. immigration officials and involvement in attacks on Cuba. But far from a docile fawn, critics say, Posada is behind a string of hotel bombings and other deadly attacks in Latin America, including the 1976 bombing of a Cuban jetliner that killed 73 people on board.
