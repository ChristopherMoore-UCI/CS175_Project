Susanne Klatten's spokesman Joerg Appelhans told CNN Tuesday that the BMW heiress alerted police in January this year that she was the victim of fraud and blackmail by a man he identified as Mr. S. Appelhans said the man had been threatening since autumn 2007 to release pictures of their "meetings" together. Rome daily La Repubblica, quoting documents German investigators sent to Italian prosecutors, has reported that the suspect allegedly tried to obtain â‚¬40 million ($51 million) from Klatten, according to The Associated Press. Later, he attempted to solicit a much larger sum." Anton Winkler, from the Munich state prosecutor's office, confirmed that an investigation has been opened and that a man called Helg Scarbi was arrested in January and is in custody in Munich. Klatten "came to the conclusion that the relationship with Mr. S. was of a solely criminal nature," Appelhans said. Susanne Klatten holds a 12.5-percent stake in BMW.
