Students aboard the stricken Sewol ferry had to use rising water levels to float out of their cabins after the ship listed, survivors told a South Korean court Monday. It has been alleged that the crew did not use available resources, such as life rafts, life vests and announcements, to evacuate passengers. At least 294 people died -- including hundreds of high school students on a field trip -- when the Sewol capsized off South Korea's southwestern coast April 16. The student said she could see coast guards near the emergency exit, but she never saw them enter the ship. The second student to testify said she heard an announcement asking those on board to put on life jackets and remain on the ferry.
