A fourth person also may have been injured in the Thursday incident in the parking lot next to Sports Authority Field at Mile High, but authorities have yet to find that victim, Warneke said. The Denver Broncos referred questions to Stadium Management Company, which runs the team's stadium. Steve Warneke said Friday. A late-night scuffle after the Denver Broncos-San Diego Chargers game, which left at least three people with stab wounds, appears to be over a parking space rather than a football rivalry, police said Friday. That person left without seeking treatment, according to authorities.
