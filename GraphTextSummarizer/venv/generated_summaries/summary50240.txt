How to eat Wagyu beef Most chefs recommend Wagyu steaks be cooked a little longer than those from Western countries -- medium-rare or even medium. Although many ranching outfits in Australia and the United States are now raising Wagyu crossbreeds, only four facilities in Japan are certified to export Wagyu beef to the United States. Wagyu beef and Kobe beef are the same thing A common misperception is that all Wagyu beef is Kobe beef. There are four Wagyu breeds: black (accounting for more than 90% of Wagyu beef), brown/red, shorthorn and polled. But they've also led to confusion about what Wagyu is and what separates Wagyu beef from the even-more heralded Kobe beef.
