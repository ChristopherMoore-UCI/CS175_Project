Demba Ba scored his 16th goal of the season, second only to Arsenal's Robin van Persie, to give Newcastle the lead, only for Robbie Keane to level for Villa from close range. Chelsea remain in fourth place on 43 points, but Newcastle are now only a point behind in fifth after their Senegalese international strikers combined to beat Aston Villa 2-1. By now United were in the ascendency, and they drew level when Hernandez found space in the area to head home Ryan Giggs' cross from close range six minutes from time. Wayne Rooney smashed home the 58th minute spot-kick to make it 3-1 and Rooney again held his nerve from the spot just 11 minutes later, this time Branislav Ivanovic was adjudged to have tripped Danny Welbeck. -- Substitute Javier Hernandez scored a late header as champions Manchester United fought back from three goals down to earn a remarkable 3-3 Premier League draw at Chelsea on Sunday.
