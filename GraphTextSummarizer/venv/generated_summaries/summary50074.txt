The nation plunged into chaos after a coalition of rebels named Seleka ousted President Francois Bozize in March, the latest in a series of coups since the nation gained independence. Late last year, the U.N. said the number of child soldiers in the nation had doubled to 6,000 as violence escalated. "We are witnessing unprecedented levels of violence against children. Concrete action is needed now to prevent violence against children,"  Diabate said. Escalating violence in the Central African Republic is posing a threat to children, with at least two beheaded and thousands recruited as soldiers, the United Nations said.
