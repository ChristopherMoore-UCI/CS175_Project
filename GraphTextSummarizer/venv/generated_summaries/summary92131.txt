Once upright, Charles places his hand across his heart as the band plays the national anthem at Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island, the training facility for all Marine recruits east of the Mississippi River. The former chief petty officer in the Navy, who served a one-year tour of duty as a crew member on patrols along the Mekong River Delta in South Vietnam during that war, had just one wish for Father's Day -- to watch his son, Ryan, graduate from Marine Corps boot camp. When I came here to Parris Island, it was 'I'll finish boot camp as long as you make it to my graduation.' Ryan left for boot camp in April. It's mission accomplished for Ryan, now an official U.S. Marine, and his terminally ill father.
