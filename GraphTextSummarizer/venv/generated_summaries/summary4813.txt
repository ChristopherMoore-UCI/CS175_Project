-- As violence raged on Thursday in central Kiev, 21-year-old volunteer medic Olyesa Zhukovska was providing first aid to wounded protesters when she was struck in the neck by a sniper's bullet. The bullet had pierced her neck, somehow missing vital vessels, but doing serious damage nonetheless. Dozens of other demonstrators who were defending the barricades in Independence Square were killed on Thursday, nearly a third of them by snipers. CNN's Tom Watkins contributed to this story "I'm dying," she tweeted as blood gushed from her throat.
