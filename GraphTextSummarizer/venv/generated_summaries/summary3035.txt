-- Aaron Sorkin, the celebrated screenwriter whose punchy dialogue propelled TV's "The West Wing" and the Facebook movie "The Social Network," will write and direct an upcoming film on the life of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs. Sony Pictures has confirmed that Sorkin will adapt "Steve Jobs," the in-depth biography of the tech icon that was written by Walter Isaacson and released shortly after Jobs' death last year. "Steve Jobs' story is unique: he was one of the most revolutionary and influential men not just of our time but of all time," Amy Pascal, co-chair of Sony Pictures Entertainment, said in a written release. Sorkin won an Academy Award for adapting "The Social Network," which in 2010 propelled Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg to household-name status. The yet-unnamed Steve Jobs film will be Sorkin's first movie-directing gig.
