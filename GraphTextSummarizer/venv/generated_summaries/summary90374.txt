Ford says a faulty cruise control switch did not start the blaze that engulfed Dolly Mohlis' F-150 truck. Although Ford has denied -- and continues to deny -- the switch started the fire that killed 74-year-old Dolly Mohlis in 2005, the company recently settled a lawsuit brought against it by Earl Mohlis. CNN has learned, however, that federal investigators were continuing to observe what one safety official said were elevated levels of suspect fires in Ford vehicles that had not been the subject of a recall. In 2005, CNN began airing a series of investigative reports on unexplained and sudden fires in Ford cars and trucks. Dolly Mohlis woke up smelling smoke in May 2005, Earl Mohlis has told CNN.
