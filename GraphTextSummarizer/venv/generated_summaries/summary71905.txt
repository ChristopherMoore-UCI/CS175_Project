The strandings, where dolphins get stuck in shallow water or wash up on shores, are more than five times the historical average in the affected areas: New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and Florida, according to NOAA. After consulting with disease experts and conducting tests on dolphins in several states, NOAA determined that morbillivirus is likely the cause for 1,283 dolphin "strandings" on the East Coast since last July. The declaration brought special federal attention to the deaths as something that serves as an indicator of ocean health and may give "insight into larger environmental issues which may also have implications for human health and welfare," according to NOAA's website. " NOAA officials say there is no way to stop the spread of the virus. Many dolphins had  lesions on their skin, mouth, joints, or lungs, according to data published on NOAA's website.
