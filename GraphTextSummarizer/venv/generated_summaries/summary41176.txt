Pain & Gain, which stars Mark Wahlberg and Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson, redeemed both stars following unimpressive box office results for action films earlier this year. 'Rocky' musical headed to Broadway in '14 Star-studded romantic comedy The Big Wedding flopped in its opening weekend, with just $7.5 million from 2,633 theaters, giving it a sad $2,848 per theater average. Iron Man 3 achieved the best opening weekend ever in a number of Asian countries (Hong Kong, Indonesia, Vietnam, Taiwan, Philippines, Malaysia, and Singapore), which is a testament to the continent's booming box offices, but perhaps also to Disney's efforts to tailor the picture to better appeal to Asian filmgoers. The $35 million Lionsgate release got off to a weaker start than other recent wedding titles like The Five-Year Engagement, License to Wed, and The Wedding Date â€” and all of those were considered misfires upon release. In the final weekend before Iron Man 3 kicks off the summer movie season in earnest, Michael Bay's R-rated action comedy Pain & Gain topped a slow weekend at the box office with $20 million from 3,277 theaters, giving it an average of $6,103 per location.
