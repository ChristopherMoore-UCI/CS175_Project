Coast Guard Vice Adm. Manson K. Brown, who investigated the matter, ordered the agency to look for training methods that "reduce and/or eliminate the role of live animals." Thirty-two Coast Guard members -- 29 of whom were being deployed to Iraq and the Persian Gulf -- participated at an outdoor site in Virginia Beach, Virginia. It also said an instructor cheerfully whistled while dismembering an animal as Coast Guard members made jokes. Brown's report concluded Coast Guard members behaved properly. "While no misconduct was committed by Coast Guard personnel, the controversial nature of (the program) demands the service continue to closely scrutinize its policies," Brown wrote.
