The three Al Jazeera journalists -- Fahmy, Peter Greste and Baher Mohamed -- face charges of spreading false news that harms Egypt's national security and social peace and having membership in an illegal organization, the Muslim Brotherhood. They said the prosecution charges refer to a different Al Jazeera channel, Al Jazeera Mubasher Misr, which was banned by an Egyptian court. One of the defendants, Al Jazeera bureau chief Mohamed Fahmy, argued that "a TV channel can't destroy a country." For five months, defense lawyers picked apart the case, stressing that the prosecution failed to provide hard evidence that the defendants altered facts or misrepresented reality, especially in a way that would endanger national security, social peace, and unity as the charges claim. The prosecution had argued that channels like Al Jazeera brought down Iraq and were planning to do the same in Egypt.
