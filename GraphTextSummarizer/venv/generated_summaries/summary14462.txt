Polunin became one of the country's best known clowns, later creating the "Academy of Fools," an international organization uniting clowns, and the "Caravan of the World," a traveling theater that meandered from Red Square in Moscow to Paris's Tuileries Gardens. Fantasy land Stepping inside Polunin's rambling home is like walking into a dream -- staircases melt into the walls, a psychedelic caravan parked out front beckons the visitor inside, and childlike murals swirl on every surface. " Provocative performer Polunin performed on state television throughout the 1970s and 1980s, using his wordless routines to mock the authorities without falling foul of draconian censorship. " Childlike Chaplin It was watching Charlie Chaplin film "The Kid" on TV as a seven-year-old growing up in Soviet Russia, that Polunin first decided to make a career out of clowning. Polunin was fascinated by the way movement could convey emotion, and studied dances from across the world -- everything from Japan's surreal Butoh performances, to rock 'n roll, and tango.
