Becker believes fatherhood will only enhance Djokovic's game and says children can have a positive effect on a player's psyche both on and off the court. That result sparked skepticism over Becker's appointment, though he dismissed that as "part of being Boris Becker." I see some similarities between him and a young Becker." Becker began his partnership with Djokovic in December 2013 and was courtside when the Serb star claimed his seventh grand slam title at Wimbledon in July -- one more than his coach managed during a 15-year career. Becker, whose first of three triumphs at the All England club came as a raw teenager, was heavily criticized when he moved away from the microphone to become an integral part of Djokovic's coaching set up. While Becker received a couple of phone calls from players curious as to whether he would be willing to take up a coaching role, it was only once Djokovic got in touch that he began to consider moving back onto the circuit.
