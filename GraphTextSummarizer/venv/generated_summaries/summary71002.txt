"In the aftermath of yet another series of bloody attacks that indiscriminately hit pilgrims, schoolchildren, journalists, as well as ordinary citizens trying to go about their daily lives, the special representative of the United Nations secretary-general for Iraq, Mr. Nickolay Mladenov, called on political, religious and civil leaders to work together with the security forces and take joint action to halt the accelerated surge in violence and bloodshed," the U.N. Assistance Mission for Iraq said in a statement issued Sunday. " More than 5,000 civilians have died and 12,000 have been wounded in terrorist attacks and other violence in Iraq in 2013, the U.N. Mission in Iraq reported last month. Iraq has seen a sharp increase in tension between its Shiite and Sunni populations since April, when security forces raided a site used by Sunni protesters to demonstrate against the Shiite-led government. Monday's violence came after at least 88 people were killed and more than 300 were injured in bombings and other attacks throughout the country on Saturday and Sunday, according to police officials. -- A series of car bombs ripped through parts of Baghdad Monday evening, killing at least 28 people and wounding dozens in the latest deadly incident in violence-torn Iraq, police said.
