Some 47 years since that pole played an integral role in deciding the 1966 World Cup final, FIFA, the game's governing body, has announced that goal-line technology will be used at the tournament in Brazil in 2014.

"I am against technology coming into force to actually make decisions. So why don't we have technology for offside decisions as well? Frank Lampard's strike, ironically against Germany, was not awarded by Uruguayan referee Jorge Larrionda, despite the ball quite clearly landing over the goal line.
