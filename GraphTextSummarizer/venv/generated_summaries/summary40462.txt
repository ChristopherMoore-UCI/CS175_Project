Some 5,500 officers will be on duty at the carnival on Sunday and 6,500 on Monday -- a public holiday in Britain -- with 4,000 additional officers deployed elsewhere across the city on top of usual police numbers, London's Metropolitan Police, or Met, said. More than a million people are expected to head to west London over the course of the colorful two-day event, which features music, parades, dancing and stalls serving up Caribbean favorites like jerk chicken and rice and peas. Speaking to the press earlier this week, he said police had intelligence to suggest that some gangs intended to cause trouble at the event. Tens of millions of dollars of damage was caused to shops and business in the violent disorder, with the west London borough of Ealing, north London's Tottenham area and Croydon to the south of the city among the worst affected. The event started four decades ago as a local festival set up by the West Indian community of the Notting Hill area.
