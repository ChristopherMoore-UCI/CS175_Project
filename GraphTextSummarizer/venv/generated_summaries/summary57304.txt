Police said they did so to minimize the possibility of violence after calls were issued in Palestinian media to "come and protect the Mount. Palestinian official Sabri Saidam accused Israel of "stepping up its hostile confrontation to the Palestinian population" by systematically seeking "to alienate worshippers and the Palestinian inhabitants of East Jerusalem and beyond by allowing Jewish worshippers to visit al Aqsa mosque." In one incident, though, police arrested 10 Palestinian youths Monday after some people threw rocks at Orthodox Jews, said Mickey Rosenfeld, spokesman for the Israeli police. Police re-opened the Temple Mount on Monday for Muslim males age 50 or older and to Muslim females of any age, but it remained closed to tourists. "Such attitudes may ignite the situation on the ground and are widely seen by Palestinians as an attempt on the Israeli government side to divert attention from the pressing need to end its occupation of Palestinian land and thus reduce international pressure on its different political domain," he said.
