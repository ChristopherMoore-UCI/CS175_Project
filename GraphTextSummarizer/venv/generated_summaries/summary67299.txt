Although streets were plowed, snowfall obscured the iconic Boston Marathon finish line on Boylston Street. "In my heart of hearts, I thought: Boston Strong  I love this city, and love that someone would do that." After the mystery man was identified as Chris Laudani, a Boston bartender, people began calling him an American hero. Philip Hillman, 44, took the photo and told CNN he was working out of a hotel room in downtown Boston on Tuesday afternoon because he didn't want to commute during the snowstorm, and happened to notice something strange outside his window. More than two feet of snow covered the streets and sidewalks, shutting down Boston's schools, businesses and roadways this week. This good deed shows how brightly the #BostonStrong spirit still shines, Hillman said, almost two years after the Boston Marathon attack.
