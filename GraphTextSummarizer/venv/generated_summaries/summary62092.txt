In closing arguments, Assistant U.S. Attorney Hadassa Waxman argued that the evidence shown in court proved that Valle had entered into an agreement with his co-conspirators to kidnap the alleged targets through e-mail conversations. Jurors began deliberations to determine whether e-mail conversations Gilberto Valle had with alleged co-conspirators about plans to kidnap, torture, rape, cook and eat women were real or fantasy role-play. Cop's defense: Cannibalism chats were fantasy Defense attorney Julia Gatto began her closing statements by repeating "I have a world in my mind," Valle's words to another fantasy role-play partner extracted from e-mail conversations revealed in court. "In that world I'm kidnapping women and selling them to people interested in buying them," she read aloud from Valle's e-mail conversation. She noted that testimony in court revealed the FBI did not find the chloroform, rope, or a human-size oven that Valle alleged he had.
