Our resident coach and technical expert Chris Meadows has plenty of experience in the sport and has worked with some of the biggest names in golf. Growing up beside Nick Faldo, Meadows learned that success in golf comes through developing a clear understanding of, and being committed to, your objective. Many of his instructional books have become best-sellers, his career recently being recognized by the Professional Golfers' Association when he was made an Advanced Fellow of the PGA. Chris has been Living Golf's resident golf expert since 2003. A dedicated coach from an early age, he soon realized his gift was the development of others.
