Violence has left four million people inside Syria in desperate need of help -- shelter, food, education, clean water, health care and protection -- and has uprooted two million inside the country and sent 600,000 fleeing the horrors of war into neighboring countries. Neighboring countries have opened their borders to 600,000 Syrian refugees and, with the help of humanitarian organizations like ours, offer basic support for their survival. Most cannot flee and find safe havens in neighboring countries. What is needed now is support from the entire international community to asylum countries and organizations like ours to help us do more. We appeal to all the parties involved in the conflict to grant unrestricted humanitarian access inside Syria.
