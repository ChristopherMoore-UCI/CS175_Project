Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, a possible GOP presidential contender in 2016, said "formal congressional authorization is required by the Constitution and would force the President to commit a clearly defined strategy to protect our national security." CNN Poll: Most Americans alarmed by ISIS Senior aides from both political parties said it's hard to gauge whether a new authorization could pass until they see the administration's plans. Despite frightening international developments drawing the United States into a major military fight against the terrorist group ISIS and several unresolved policy disputes on things like immigration, members of the House and Senate come back to the Capitol with one thing in mind: Do the bare minimum and get back on the campaign trail. After demanding a plan from President Barack Obama on how he will respond to the terrorist threat, top congressional leaders will head to the White House on Tuesday to hear from the President before he outlines his strategy in a national address on Wednesday. Most Republicans oppose the approach but may vote to take it up nonetheless if for no other reason than to shrink the window into which Democrats can propose other measures Republicans consider political show votes. The brief fall, pre-campaign session will be more about political messaging than legislating.
