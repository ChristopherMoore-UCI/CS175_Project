The truth is that HIV is no longer a death sentence, and to expect a new generation of gay men to perceive it in that manner is unreasonable, unwarranted and unrealistic and seems to be dictated by anger on the part of some that HIV is no longer front and center in the minds of many young gay men -- or older gay men, either. It has been suggested that gay men, especially young gay men, no longer fear contracting the disease, that AIDS is perceived as an easily managed chronic condition and that infection holds little consequence for those newly diagnosed. It is obvious that the AIDS epidemic of my generation -- the loss and confusion and devastation that we witnessed for some two decades -- is not the same AIDS epidemic for new generation of young gay men. As we emerge into these later stages of life, perhaps battle-scarred from 30 years of living through the AIDS crisis, we also have an obligation to act as mentors to a new generation of young gay men and share our stories of survival and resilience, as we learned from the generation that preceded us and lived through the Stonewall Riots and the onset of gay liberation. It undermines the lives and struggles of a new generation of gay men trying to make their places in the world and coming of age in this, the fourth decade of AIDS.
