" Timbuktu Muslims on their way to Friday worship at the tombs were stopped and threatened by armed men from Ansar Dine, a militant group that seeks to impose strict Sharia law, Timbuktu Mayor Ousmane Halle said. He witnessed the attack together with other Timbuktu residents who had come to the tombs to pray. "The militants broke the doors and wooden gates to the grave and then used the cloth inside to set fire to the tomb," said Sankoum Sissoko, a resident in Timbuktu. -- UNESCO on Saturday condemned the destruction of three sacred tombs in Timbuktu, Mali, by Islamic militants who say they will destroy more. "Today we will destroy all the mausoleums," Ansar Dine representative Sanda Ould Boumama said.
