Because pigs fed on specially-grown soya no longer eat waste food, this creates the further problem of how to dispose of food waste. 80% of consumers in the UK want businesses to cut food waste, and Feeding the 5000 is urging everyone around the world to sign the pledge calling on food businesses, governments and citizens to stop wasting so much food. The event demonstrated how easy it is to reduce the unimaginable levels of food waste both in the UK and internationally, and how governments, businesses and individuals can all help to change the way waste has become rife in our globalized food chain. In my book, Waste: the Global Food Scandal (2009), I calculated that 10% of all greenhouse gas emissions come from producing food that no-one eats. The answer, as the event on Friday aimed to demonstrate, is to bring common-sense back into the food chain: eat what you can, redistribute what you can't, feed food not fit for humans to pigs, and only then turn to other waste solutions, such as composting or anaerobic digestion.
