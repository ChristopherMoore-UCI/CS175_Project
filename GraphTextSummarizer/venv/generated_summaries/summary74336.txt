Contract talks between the school district and union fractured over teacher pay, class size and how educators are transferred between schools. Earlier Wednesday, Washington Gov. Christine Gregoire announced she would referee the feud between the Tacoma school district and striking teachers that had kept 28,000 students from classrooms for seven days. Wood said teachers could go back to school as early as Friday if they approve the deal. Last week, a state judge ordered the teacher's union and school district to restart stalled negotiations and told striking teachers to get back into the classroom. But the teachers, who have rejected school district proposals for a new three-year contract, continued their protests.
