-- At least 1,200 people have given up their jerseys bearing the name of New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez at the team's official shop now that Hernandez has been charged with murder, the team says. After prosecutors brought charges against Hernandez, the Patriots offered fans who had purchased Hernandez jerseys the chance to trade them in. The exchange applied only to Hernandez jerseys purchased from the Patriots' ProShop and PatriotsProShop.com. We know that children love wearing their Patriots jerseys, but may not understand why parents don't want them wearing their Hernandez jerseys anymore," spokesman Stacey James said in announcing the offer last week. It's a different story on eBay, where Hernandez merchandise is fetching big bucks.
