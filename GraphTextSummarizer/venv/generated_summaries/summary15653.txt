-- A coalition of liberal and progressive groups, including unions and civil rights activists, rallied in Washington Saturday to press for good jobs, immigration and education reform and to make a show of strength one month out from midterm elections. Commentator Glenn Beck drew Tea Party activists to the Lincoln Memorial for his revival-style rally August 28. The "One Nation Working Together" rally was held at the Lincoln Memorial, just five weeks after Tea Party enthusiasts met in Washington. NAACP President Ben Jealous told CNN the "One Nation" movement is not "the alternative to the Tea Party, we're the antidote to the Tea Party." Jealous said he welcomes Tea Party members, but takes issue with extremists in the movement who critics say harbor racist views. The "One Nation" movement, he said, would rather see jobs for 99 percent of Americans instead of tax cuts for one percent of Americans.
