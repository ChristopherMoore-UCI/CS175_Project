-- NASCAR driver Tony Stewart won't face charges in connection with the on-track death of sprint car racer Kevin Ward Jr., a New York district attorney announced Wednesday. Our thoughts and prayers remain with the Kevin Ward Jr. family and Tony Stewart as they all cope with this tragic incident at Canandaigua Motorsports Park," NASCAR spokesman Brett Jewkes said in a written statement. The focus should be on actions of Mr. Stewart and not Kevin. "The videos did not demonstrate any aberrational driving by Tony Stewart until the point of impact with Kevin Ward, at which point his vehicle veered to the right up the track as a result of the collision," the district attorney said. Stewart, a three-time NASCAR top series champion, was driving a dirt-track car when the right rear tire hit Ward, who was walking on the track as cars slowly circled during a break in an Empire Super Sprints series race August 9 in Canandaigua, New York.
