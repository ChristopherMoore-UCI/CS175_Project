Not only does this help identify which candidates with industry background will succeed in the company, but it also opens the door to strong candidates without prior industry experience. Limiting salesperson hiring to just those with industry experience creates a scalability problem for the company. Many executives cite "complexity of the industry" as a reason to exclusively hire salespeople from competitors -- inferring that industry knowledge is too hard to teach. Our executive team, like so many others, was blinded by the myth of assured success when hiring those with industry background. Rather than blindly pursue those salespeople with industry mastery, first study each sales role and identify the factors that affect performance.
