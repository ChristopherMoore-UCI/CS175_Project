Nicole Polizzi, also known as Snooki on MTV's reality show "Jersey Shore," did not attend a court hearing in New Jersey on Wednesday. Apparently, reality star Snooki is not just too pretty for jail, she is too pretty for court. McCain jokingly brought up the arrest during a recent visit to Phoenix radio station KMLE Country 108. The 22-year-old was arrested in late July on the beaches of Seaside Heights, New Jersey. The arrest of the TV star even caught the attention of Arizona Sen. John McCain.
