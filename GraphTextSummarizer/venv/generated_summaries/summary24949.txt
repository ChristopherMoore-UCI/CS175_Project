While innovators like Charlie Parker may get credit for the creation of modern jazz music by using diminished scales (as done in classical music by composers like Claude Debussy), Astake offers an alternative view: "In southern Ethiopia, there are tribes called the Derashe -- "We talked about Ethiopian music and the great African contribution -- especially the tribes in Ethiopia," recalls Astatke, "and I made him listen to our great traditional music players. " Unsurprisingly, I'm not the only one who's been presented with such questions by Astatke, whose passion about Africa's contribution to music extends back to the 1960s when he went on to fuse the traditional Ethiopian five-tone scales with western 12-note harmonies to give life to a whole new music genre: the hypnotizing and eerily seductive soundscape of ethio-jazz. " Astatke enjoyed a successful career in the last years of Haile Selassie's reign and continued making music after the Ethiopian emperor got deposed in 1974 by the Derg military regime, which lasted until the early 1990s. "When you start talking about jazz, they're usually telling us that Africans contributed to the rhythm parts of jazz music, but it's not only the rhythms.
