Many analysts who follow Kenya think the next general election in 2012 has a significant chance of descending into violence, should key government reforms not be put in place. It also said Kibaki should publicly acknowledge his commitment to ending unlawful killings by police. A U.N. special investigator, in a report issued in June, called for the resignation of top Kenyan officials and sweeping changes in the country's security forces to end reported unlawful killings by police nationwide. The U.N. investigator also advocated creating an independent civilian police oversight body, and said the International Criminal Court should investigate violence after the 2007 election. Nearly 1,500 people were killed and hundreds of thousands displaced after the re-election of Mwai Kibaki.
