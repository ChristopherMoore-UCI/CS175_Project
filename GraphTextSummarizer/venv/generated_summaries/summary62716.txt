Meanwhile, Kansas City Police Captain Steve Young said late Thursday that the Irwin family's lawyer -- at that point, presumed to be Short -- had canceled a police interview with the girl's two older brothers. Cyndy Short, the attorney who had been speaking for the family of 11-month-old Lisa Irwin, is no longer working with the family, her Kansas City, Missouri, law firm announced Friday in a statement. The "nonconfrontational" re-interview planned for Friday would have been conducted by a child services specialist without a police officer in the room, according to Young. A cadaver dog searching the family's Kansas City home indicated a positive "hit" for the scent of a body, police said. Police have said the infant's parents, Jeremy Irwin and Deborah Bradley, will not submit to separate interviews.
