Earlier in the day, Los Angeles police completed their biggest search in recent memory, with 120 investigators scouring seven acres in the Hollywood hills looking for more body parts. The victim was from Los Angeles, said Lt. David Smith with the Los Angeles County coroner's office. Upon concluding the hillside search, police Friday reopened Bronson Canyon Park beneath the Hollywood sign and urged hikers and other recreational visitors to be careful and not walk the trails alone. The real-life Hollywood mystery began Tuesday afternoon as Kornberg and her mother were walking dogs in the park below the Hollywood sign. Officers, coroner's investigators, helicopters, all-terrain vehicles, a SWAT team trained in climbing skills and mounted officers searched the section of Bronson Canyon, next to Griffith Park, Smith said.
