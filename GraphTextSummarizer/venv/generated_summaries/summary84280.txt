-- A Florida judge has signed an emergency "pickup order" authorizing law enforcement officers to get the 5-year-old son of country singer Mindy McCready, a court spokeswoman said Thursday. "The child is now an official missing person," said Aimee McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Children's Network of Southwest Florida, the lead agency for child welfare services McCready has not been charged with any crime. She was rushed to a Fort Myers, Florida, hospital last year, Cape Coral Hospital spokeswoman Karen Krieger said, after a 911 caller claimed the singer had overdosed. The latest order means that law enforcement officers now have the right to take custody of her son, Zander, who she has said is with her, even if he is not in Florida, McLaughlin explained. McCready's parents have legal custody of the child, while the entertainer has visitation rights, said Terri Durdaller, spokeswoman for the Florida Department of Children and Families.
