The "Tonight Show" had been unhip for a very, very long time, not just for the past 17 years it has been hosted by Jay Leno, but for (let's be honest) pretty much all of the Eighties -- really, the last time it was hip, Johnny Carson and his guests were still chain-smoking on the air -- and so watching O'Brien move behind the desk of desks felt less like an ascension and more like a loss, a co-opting of our guy. Photos: From "Seinfeld" to "Mad Men," see TV stars on the cover of "Rolling Stone" An overachieving golden boy since high school (where he was class valedictorian), on through college (Harvard, where he was twice voted president of "The Harvard Lampoon," something that had only happened once before in the history of the venerable humor magazine) and his early career (staff gigs at "Saturday Night Live" and "The Simpsons", the twin Holy Grails of the comedy world for the aspiring writer), O'Brien had been plucked from obscurity to host a major-network talk show -- at a time when people still watched network television -- when he was a preposterously young-looking 30 years old. O'Brien did go for long bicycle rides, and read lots of history books. At a parents' night at their son Beckett's preschool, there was a stack of volunteer sign-up sheets, and O'Brien, who still had too much time on his hands, became overly ambitious and started signing up for everything: "Oh, I'd love to come talk to the kids about natural history!"
