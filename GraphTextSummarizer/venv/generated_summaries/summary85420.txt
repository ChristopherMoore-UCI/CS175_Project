In the other half of the draw, world No. 3 Novak Djokovic remained on course for a third successive title in Dubai after coming from behind to beat Germany's Florian Mayer. At the WTA hard-court event in Doha, newly-crowned women's No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki continued her good run of form with an impressive 6-2 6-0 quarterfinal win over Italy's Flavia Pennetta in the Qatar Ladies' Open on Thursday. Berdych defeated Germany's Philipp Petzschner in straight sets, saving six break-points on his way to a 7-5 6-4 win. Former world No. 3 Nikolay Davydenko has also made himself unavailable for Russia's World Group tie against Sweden on March 4-6, and the team will instead be led by 76th-ranked Teimuraz Gabashvili. The Swiss world No. 2 won 6-3 6-4 and will on Friday play Richard Gasquet, who beat fellow Frenchman Gilles Simon 5-7 6-2 6-4 in the closing last-eight tie.
