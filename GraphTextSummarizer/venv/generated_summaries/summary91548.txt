'Serial', a podcast spinoff of the radio program "This American Life," concluded its 12-episode series in December that chronicled -- in methodic, cliff-hanging detail -- the case of Adnan Syed, the Baltimore high school student convicted in the slaying of ex-girlfriend Hae Min Lee. Lee and Syed were seniors at Woodlawn High School in Baltimore County when she disappeared in January 1999. McClain filed an affidavit in January indicating that she'd again be willing to testify, prompting Syed's new lawyers to petition the Maryland Court of Special Appeals, requesting that it release the case to a circuit court for a fresh look. " Asia McClain claimed in a January affidavit that she was with Syed in the library at the time of the slaying, but she says her attempts to relay this potentially exculpatory evidence to his lawyer fell on deaf ears. The prosecution centered largely on Wilds' testimony, which ultimately prevailed, according to Syed, thanks to missteps allegedly made by his lawyer at the time.
