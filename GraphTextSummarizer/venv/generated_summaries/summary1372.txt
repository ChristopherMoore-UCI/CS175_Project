New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly told reporters Wednesday that investigators were awaiting autopsy results but that an official from the medical examiner's office declared the death "somewhat suspicious" after examining the body at the hospital. "We have no cause of death at this time," Kelly said. "There were bruises on the baby's body, and the investigation is going forward," Kelly told a news conference. Wanda Hernandez, 52, superintendent of the building where the infant lived with his parents, told CNN affiliate NY1 that at about 1 a.m. Wednesday police questioned her about the family after the baby's death. In its statement, the Mexican consulate said, "As required by international law, we will offer all assistance and consular protection required by the parents under these circumstances and the Consulate will closely monitor the developments in this case.
