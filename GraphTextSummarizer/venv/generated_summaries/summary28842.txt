On Wednesday, a second Wisconsin National Guard member was also suspended with pay from the funeral honor team, Rickert said. "We expect all of our Soldiers and Airmen to live by a core set of values, in word and deed," said Maj. Gen. Donald P. Dunbar, Wisconsin's adjutant general. Harrison remains working full time, performing other duties, said Maj. Paul Rickert, spokesman for the Wisconsin National Guard. The other people are members of other military units, but Rickert didn't know to which branches or units they might belong. Luis Jimenez has been assigned to other duties pending the outcome of the investigation, Rickert said.
