The deputies, along with members of the West Virginia State Police and the Mountain State Fugitive Task Force, were serving an arrest warrant on Charles E. Smith, 50, who was wanted on a charge related to possession of cocaine with the intent to distribute, as well as a felon in possession of a firearm charge, Carter said. Hotsinpiller had been serving with the Northern District of West Virginia office in Clarksburg since his graduation from the U.S. Marshals Academy, Carter said. Supervisory Deputy U.S. Marshal Alex Neville, 42, was expected to be released from the hospital Thursday. Smith and the officers exchanged fire after the initial shot, and Smith was killed, Carter said. -- Two U.S. marshals who were shot while carrying out an arrest warrant in West Virginia are expected to make a full recovery, a spokesman said.
