As of Wednesday afternoon, the Waldo Canyon wildfire has burned more than 15,000 acres in the mountains just outside Colorado Springs. -- "Uh-oh, I smell smoke again, hang on ..." Robbie Trencheny, a 20-year-old programmer based in Colorado Springs, Colorado, walked away from our Skype video call to look at the billowing clouds of smoke outside. The information from Twitter comes from all sorts of places: from official agencies such as the Colorado Springs Fire Department to people in and near the city sharing what they're witnessing with other people around the state and the nation. " Colorado Springs has a fairly small tech community, and most people there don't use social media much, aside from Facebook, Trencheny said. In fact, Trencheny plans to spin off a version of the Web app to track other current wildfires in Colorado, such as the High Park Fire outside Fort Collins, which has burned more than 87,000 acres, or the Flagstaff Fire burning just outside Boulder.
