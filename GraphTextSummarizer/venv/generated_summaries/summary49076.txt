Travel + Leisure: Best U.S. hotels for the holidays Hôtel Ormelune, Val d'Isère, France An old-school sporting institution at the foot of the legendary Val d'Isère resort, in southeastern France -- adjacent to the famed Les Trois Vallées -- the Hôtel Ormelune got a Pop makeover two years ago. From France to Switzerland, these great European ski chalets pair contemporary design with traditional winter charms. Le Lodge Park, Megève, France Owned by husband-and-wife team Jocelyne and Jean-Louis Sibuet, Le Lodge Park is a mere five-minute walk from the center of the action at Megève, France's hippest ski resort. The restored 1913 Arts and Crafts country house merges vintage and contemporary styles: tufted chesterfield sofas sit alongside George Nelson bubble lamps, while painted Windsor chairs play off custom wallpaper by Timorous Beasties. Don't Miss: Have dinner at L'Étable d'Alain (33-6/08-99-13-20; dinner for two $130), a nearby farm-to-table restaurant where you can watch cows graze as you dine on raclette, the regional specialty.
