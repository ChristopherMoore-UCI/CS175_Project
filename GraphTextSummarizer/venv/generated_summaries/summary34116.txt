-- Goals from Lee Jung-Soo and Park Ji-Sung earned South Korea a comfortable 2-0 win against Greece in the opening match of Group B played in Port Elizabeth. Aside from a chance which fell to defender Vasileios Torosidis in the third minute, and an error from South Korea's goalkeeper Jung Sung Ryon late in the first half Greece never looked like scoring. Central defender Lee Jung-Soo opened the scoring for South Korea in the seventh minute, volleying home from close range from a well directed free kick delivered by Ki Sung-Yong. The goal did seem to finally wake Greece from their slumber, and striker Theofanis Gekas forced a fine save from Jung Sung Ryon in the 80th minute South Korea should have gone 2-0 up after 23 minutes when Monaco striker Park Chu-Young was sent through on goal by a defense-splitting pass from the boot of Park Ji-Sung.
