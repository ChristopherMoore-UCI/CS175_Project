See photos of Tomb's cracks and its history Â» "The overall appearance of the memorial is not what it should be and we know this is a problem," said John C. Metzler Jr., the superintendent of Arlington National Cemetery. -- The Tomb of the Unknowns at Arlington National Cemetery is at the center of combat between preservationists and cemetery officials. The report said cemetery officials believe the "cracks cannot be repaired indefinitely without the monument acquiring a patched, worn and shabby appearance, which is the antithesis of its purpose and contrary to [Arlington National Cemetery's] mission of maintaining a dignified, fitting memorial to our country's fallen soldiers. The sarcophagus contains the remains of three unknown service members who were killed in World War I, World War II and the Korean War. Hildreth's group, the Washington-based National Trust for Historic Preservation, and its allies successfully lobbied Congress to force the cemetery to examine all repair options.
