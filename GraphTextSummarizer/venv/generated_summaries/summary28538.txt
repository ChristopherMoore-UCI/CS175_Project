"The way I ended the second session was obviously not part of the plan," Schumacher told the official website. -- Venezuelan Pastor Maldonaldo was fastest in a rain hit second practice session at the German grand prix. The German driver, known for his ability to handle wet track conditions, had been going well at his home race. Seven-time champion Michael Schumacher had a day to forget at Hockenheim, crashing his Mercedes into a wall in the final few minutes of the second session. "We didn't expect the rain to be this bad today, but it was quite heavy at times - we even used the extreme full wet tire," the Australian, who won the previous grand prix at Silverstone, told the official website.
