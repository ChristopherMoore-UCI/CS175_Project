-- Roger Federer said Andy Murray can claim multiple Grand Slam titles after the eight ATP World Tour finalists were introduced to British Prime Minister David Cameron. Ahead of the season-ending event in London, Mr Cameron invited Federer, Murray, world number one Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic, Andy Roddick, David Ferrer, Tomas Berdych and Robin Soderling to a reception at Downing Street. "I hope that seeing the world's top players compete right on our doorstep, including Britain's very own Andy Murray, will inspire our next generation of sporting heroes." Murray, who has yet to win a Grand Slam title, said: "It's the second time I've been here. "If Murray wins a first grand slam title, that could possibly open the floodgates," Federer told British newspaper The Daily Telegraph. But on the eve of the tournament, Federer, who has 16 Grand slam titles to his name, said Murray had the potential to dominate the sport if he can clinch his first major crown.
