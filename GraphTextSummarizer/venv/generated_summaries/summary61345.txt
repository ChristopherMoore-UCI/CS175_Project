The National Hurricane Center said those in the hurricane warning area -- coastal North Carolina from Bogue Inlet up to the Virginia state line, including Pamlico and Albemarle sounds -- could see storm surge of 3 to 5 feet. -- Weakening by the hour but still covering a massive area, Hurricane Earl spun off the North Carolina on Thursday night, lashing parts of the Outer Banks with rain and high wind. Tropical storm watches and warnings were in effect for most other coastal areas between North Carolina and Nova Scotia. The North Carolina coast should begin experiencing tropical storm-force winds of at least 39 mph by Thursday evening, forecasters said, with hurricane-force winds of at least 74 mph arriving later. North Carolina Gov. Bev Purdue urged residents and visitors to prepare for the storm and heed evacuation orders.
