According to TMZ, Abraham underwent a new kind of procedure in which a doctor uses an implant in the lip instead of fillers. In another tweet, she joked that her lip injections make her look like Leela from the animated series "Futurama." The TV personality and adult film actress recently shared photos on Twitter of the procedure's results, which left her top lip egregiously swollen. Reality star Farrah Abraham has nothing to hide, and that includes a lip augmentation procedure gone horribly wrong. Abraham reportedly believes she had an allergic reaction to the anesthetic used.
