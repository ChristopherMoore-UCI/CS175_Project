-- Apple CEO Steve Jobs this week rebuffed the suggestion that Apple will revolutionize TV in the same way it has reshaped the music industry, mobile phones and tablet computers. So my bet is that Apple will indeed strike deals with cable companies to produce a comprehensive offering for TV watchers. The reason is simple: Thanks to Android, Google TVs will benefit from the app ecosystem Google already built for mobile phones. The glaring opportunity is for Apple to bring the App Store to TV. Apple's iTunes is an obvious starting point to turn the TV into an entertainment hub; it brings your purchased music, TV shows and movies to the big screen.
