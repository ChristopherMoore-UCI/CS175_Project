Saying it was "shocked and alarmed" after a Chinese man and infant were killed in a botched robbery in Rome, the Chinese Embassy urged Italian authorities to protect Chinese citizens in Italy. Zhou Zheng, 31, and his 9-month-old daughter were killed Wednesday, according to Italy's ANSA news agency. "Rome's patience and that of her citizens is finished," Mayor Gianni Alemanno said, according to the news agency. About 130 new police officers were to arrive in Rome in Friday, authorities told ANSA. The killings come amid a wave of unrelated slayings in Rome, ANSA reported.
