But her earliest release date is now March 17, 2009, Chief Deputy Secretary Scott Kernan said, calling the error "an aberration." "Our department immediately rearrested her, and she will serve her full sentence," Kernan said. From the Los Angeles airport, authorities took Olson to her home in Palmdale, California, where she remained until she was arrested midday Saturday, when the review was completed, Kernan said. Olson was taken into custody at Los Angeles International Airport on Friday night, Kernan said. David Nickerson, one of Olson's attorneys, said he and co-counsel Shawn Chapman Holley intend to file a petition with Los Angeles Superior Court on Monday. The administrative error was verified late Saturday morning, Kernan said, after a thorough review of Olson's case.
