-- Max Page, the 7-year-old who played a mini-Darth Vader in a Volkswagen commercial, Monday left a hospital in Los Angeles where he had undergone heart surgery. You can almost see Max's eyes, wide-open with amazement, as he holds his arms out and turns to his unseen parents as if to say, "Did you see that?" "Star Wars" fans might note Max bears some resemblance to the actor who played young Anakin Skywalker, who later turned into Darth Vader. Max is best-known for playing the role of a mini-Darth Vader character in a Super Bowl advertisement for Volkswagen. "We're hopeful that this will be -- quite possibly -- the last major surgery that Max will need," said Michael Silka, co-director of The Heart Institute at the hospital. And fans are also comparing him to a young Mark Hamill, who played Vader's son, Luke Skywalker.
