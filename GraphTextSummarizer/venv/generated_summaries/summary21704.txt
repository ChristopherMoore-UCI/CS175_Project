The building collapsed Friday with a "huge whoosh and then thump," said eyewitness Ali Jawad Bhimani, a hotel owner who lives near the building in Dar es Salaam's normally bustling Kariakoo central business district. Five children are believed to be among the missing, rescue official Walji Ali said. -- Rescuers planned to search for survivors under a mountain of concrete and twisted metal Friday night after a high-rise building collapsed in Tanzania. In addition to the deaths, at least 17 people were injured, said Suleiman Kova, a regional police commander. Construction workers were among those injured, Ali said.
