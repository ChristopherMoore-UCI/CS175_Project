Mental Floss: Henry Ford and others who survived bankruptcy Ford was legendarily contemptuous of experts, but he could have saved some serious dough if he'd just hired a consultant to tell him that the plantation wasn't at all suitable for growing rubber. Although Ford spent 17 years trying to produce rubber on the plantation, no Ford car ever rolled off the assembly line with a single bit of Fordlandia's rubber in it. Ford didn't check to see if the plantation was suitable for growing rubber. According to Greg Grandin, author of "Fordlandia: The Rise and Fall of Henry Ford's Forgotten Jungle City," Ford never consulted any sort of expert on rubber cultivation; he just sent a bunch of supplies and managers into the jungle hoping to grow some rubber. After the perfection of synthetic rubber in 1945, Ford sold the plantation at a $20 million loss and left Brazil.
