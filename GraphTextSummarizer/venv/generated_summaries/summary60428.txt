So maybe if he were alive today, President George Washington could tell a New York City library what he did with two books he checked out 221 years ago. Soon after, the capital was relocated to Philadelphia and then Washington D.C. The New York library, a subscription library that was New York's first library open to the public, has known about the missing books since the 1930s. The library first learned of the missing books when it discovered a yellowed ledger in its basement It listed all the people who had checked out books from the city's oldest library between July 1789 and April 1792. At the time, New York was the capital of the United States, and the library was the only one in town. "I'm sorry, math is not my thing at all," said Jane Goldstein, the assistant head librarian when asked to hazard a guess.
