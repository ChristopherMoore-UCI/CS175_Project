The program sets out to make a college education a reality for underrepresented students and communities experiencing high poverty. I started at the University of Texas at San Antonio in fall 2002 and graduated with a bachelor's degree in English and a Master's in public administration. All of my siblings after me went to college and today we have a public administrator, a teacher and a medical school student in the family. If my father had not been brave and hungry for a better future in America, there would be one fewer public administrator, one fewer third grade teacher and one fewer student in medical school in my family. I am now responsible for helping many young children reach their potential and live a life our ancestors could only dream of.
