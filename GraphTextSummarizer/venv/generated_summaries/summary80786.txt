Hobbyists and professional photographers might enjoy carefully editing images, but average people just want to share their best vacation or family photos and move on. Google announced updates to both tools on Tuesday in a San Francisco art gallery decorated in photos taken by Google+ users. Google added features to schedule and promote Hangouts On Air before they happen, more control for producers screening questions and moderating viewers, and auto-enhance features to improve video quality. The company has spent the past two years forcefully pushing Google+ into every nook and cranny of Google products. People have thousands of photos, hours of videos, and not enough time to cut through the noise, edit and share images.
