But their last tournament together didn't go as planned, with Sharapova slipping twice on the grass at Wimbledon against Larcher de Brito and suffering her earliest grand slam exit in three years. The coaching shuffle comes about two weeks after the U.S.-based Russian was upset by qualifier Michelle Larcher de Brito in the second round at Wimbledon. Two days after announcing she was ending her successful three-year partnership with Thomas Hogstedt, Sharapova said former great Jimmy Connors will be Hogstedt's successor. It was under Hogstedt, a former touring pro from Sweden, that Sharapova completed her grand slam collection last year at the French Open. "I have known Jimmy for many years and we briefly worked together in 2008 just before the Australian Open," Sharapova told her website.
