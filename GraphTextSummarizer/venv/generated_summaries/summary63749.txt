-- Although Elizabeth Woodville lived centuries ago, author Philippa Gregory believes women today will find they have a commonality with her. One of the funny things is that getting the history right, doing intense amounts of research, trying to make the characters come alive, living with the characters and putting it all in first person, present tense which is technically quite challenging, all of that keeps me busy enough. And, of course, she is the mother of the Princes in the Tower which is possibly the greatest mystery in English history. I know women identify with that because they often write to me and say they draw great strength and courage from these women who are, in a sense, our heroines. Philippa Gregory took years to research and write "The White Queen." Gregory's new novel "The White Queen" focuses on the life of Woodville, who was Queen consort to England's Edward IV, and the events that came to be known as the Wars of the Roses.
