On free trade, for example, Sanders has already staked out a position that is antithetical to the White House when he wrote a letter to the administration blasting the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a free trade deal with 12 Pacific Rim countries. This was clear in the first meeting of the new Senate Energy Committee on Thursday, when Warren -- who has repeatedly said she isn't running for President -- used her first speech to lambast Republicans for kowtowing to foreign oil companies and business interests by pushing the Keystone XL pipeline. For the next two years, liberals like Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren -- a pair oft-discussed during 2016 speculation -- will be able to use the Republican control as a foil for their rhetoric and message. "I want to know why the pipeline is the very first, No. 1 item on the agenda in the new Congress," Warren said of the 1,179-mile-long project that would move oil from Canada to refineries in the United States. After making the case that the pipeline was not about jobs or energy costs -- two points Republicans regularly make -- Warren upped her rhetoric.
