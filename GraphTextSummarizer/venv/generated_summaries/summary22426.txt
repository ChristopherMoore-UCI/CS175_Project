Additional studies showed that individuals with underactive PCSK9 genes had low levels of LDL and, much more important, low levels of cardiovascular disease. "It's given by subcutaneous injections (into a lower level of skin), but this can be done with very small needles." Researchers say patients would need to give themselves injections only every two to four weeks, which, depending on how often they're taking pills to lower cholesterol, may be a less cumbersome option. "PCSK9 inhibitors could offer an important treatment option for patients, particularly for those who are in need of greater LDL-C reductions beyond what the current standards of care can offer," said MacKay Jimeson, a spokesman for Pfizer, one of the companies working on this new type of drug. Ten years ago, researchers found a family in Paris with a long history of extremely high levels of LDL, incidents of cardiovascular disease and early deaths, says Dr. Jay Edelberg, global head of PCSK9 development for Sanofi, a pharmaceutical company working on a PCSK9 inhibitor in partnership with Regeneron. This excites doctors like Antman, who is not connected to the research but often sees patients with cholesterol numbers in the hundreds.
