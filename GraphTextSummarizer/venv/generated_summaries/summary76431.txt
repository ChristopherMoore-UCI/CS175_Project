"It is essential that the further political, economic and social reforms President Mubarak has promised are implemented fully and quickly, and meet the aspirations of the Egyptian people," said a joint statement issued by British Prime Minister David Cameron, French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. -- Several Western powers banded together Saturday in urging Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to do all he can to prevent bloodshed and speedily fulfill his promises of reform. "They are looking to their government for a meaningful process to foster real reform." President Barack Obama had said Friday that he had spoken with Mubarak after the Egyptian president made a televised speech. In an interview conducted Friday morning in Davos, Switzerland, British Prime Minister Cameron told CNN's Fareed Zakaria that "reform and progress in the greater strengthening of democracy and civil rights" is needed in Egypt. "We urge President Mubarak to embark on a process of transformation, which should be reflected in a board-based government and in free and fair elections."
