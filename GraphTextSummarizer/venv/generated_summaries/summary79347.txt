Forty of Sony's top executives, including Kazuo Hirai, the chief executive since last year, are to give up bonuses worth 30-50 per cent of their pay after they failed to keep a promise to return the division to profit. Last year was no different: its financial arm earned a profit of Y149bn, three times more than the next most profitable division, its US-based film studio. The Japanese electronics and entertainment group said net profit for the year that ended in March totalled Y43bn ($435m), a turnround from its massive Y457bn loss a year earlier. Sony has for some time relied on profits from the banking and insurance operations it owns in Japan to make up for weakness in other businesses. Sony said operating profit -- earnings before tax, depreciation and other adjustments -- would probably remain static this year at Y230bn, even as its sales increase by an expected 10 per cent thanks in part to more advantageous exchange rates.
