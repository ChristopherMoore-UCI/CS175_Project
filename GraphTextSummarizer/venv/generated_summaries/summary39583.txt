As a CNN All-Platform Journalist, it's my responsibility to research stories and follow news events in a specific region. Choosing a story: Although not all stories make for good multimedia production, the best multimedia stories are multidimensional. When you have more time to work on a story, shoot multiple takes of the same subject for editing variety and for a more creative and narrative approach to the story. The basics for your story should include the subject, and any other elements that help explain the story, externals of a building, streets, the scene of an accident, etc. Pulling it together: It's important for you to decide the parts of a story, the flow of a story, and what's most important in each section of your story.
