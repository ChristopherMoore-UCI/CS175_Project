" Hirscher, whose only medal at Sochi was silver in the slalom, has the chance to win the World Cup title in that event on Sunday -- he trails Neureuther by five points. " Fenninger, who won gold in super-G at Sochi and silver in giant slalom, will seek to add another World Cup globe in the latter on Sunday. It was enough to put him 131 points clear of closest rival Aksel Svindal Lund, who did not complete his first run. "I need some time to process everything that happened today, it was a crazy race," said Hirscher, who was denied a double success when Germany's Felix Neureuther clinched third place on the final run by just 0.01 seconds. With the two speed titles I had a good season that could have been a great season," said the Norwegian, who left Sochi early after failing to win a medal, citing allergy problems.
