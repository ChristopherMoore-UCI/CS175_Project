Under questioning by Tamerlan, Danny played up being Chinese and tried to humanize himself by talking about cell phones and family. Before forcing their way into Danny's vehicle three days after the bombings, the brothers fatally shot a campus police officer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, police said. The Massachusetts driver, whom CNN is identifying only as Danny because of privacy and safety concerns, gave his account of the April 18 incident and described the very different behavior of Tsarnaev and his younger brother, Dzhokhar. Tamerlan Tsarnaev said right after he got in the vehicle that he was responsible for the bombings and the officer's death, according to Danny. Tamerlan started driving, using back streets in the Boston area, trying to avoid police and searching for an open gas station.
