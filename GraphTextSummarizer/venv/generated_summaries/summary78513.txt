The other two tickets were sold in New Jersey, one at a Super Stop n Shop in South Brunswick and the other at an Acme Market in Little Egg Harbor, according to Carole Hedinger, the executive director of the New Jersey Lottery. -- A woman in Little Egg Harbor, New Jersey, came forward as part of a group of 16 that won a piece of the $448 million jackpot from Wednesday's Powerball lottery drawing. Susan Nichel told CNN affiliate WPVI in Philadelphia on Friday that she was part of a group in the Ocean County vehicle maintenance facility in Toms River that pooled their money together to buy a ticket. Sixty people work at the Toms River facility, though only 16 decided to pool their money together. Powerball is played in 43 states, the District of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
