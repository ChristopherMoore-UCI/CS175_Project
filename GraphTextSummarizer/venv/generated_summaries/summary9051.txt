-- U.S. Education Secretary Arne Duncan said Saturday that he plans to recruit more African-American and Latino teachers in a bid to narrow achievement gaps among students.

"If we want to close achievement gaps, if we want to make sure that many more African-American and Latino male students are graduating rather than dropping out ... Earlier this month, he told CNN's "John King, USA" that the dropout rate in African-American and Latino communities in many areas is as high as 50 percent. He added he is planning a campaign in the fall to recruit the next generation of teachers.
