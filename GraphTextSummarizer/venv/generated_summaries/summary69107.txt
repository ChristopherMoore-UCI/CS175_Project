Justice Department officials met Tuesday with Arpaio and his lawyers to request additional documents in the investigation. -- Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County, Arizona, is challenging the Justice Department's request for certain documents in its investigation of alleged civil rights violations by the sheriff's office. In a letter to the Justice Department on Friday, Arpaio's lawyer said the sheriff couldn't agree to the department's September deadline to supply all documents requested for its investigation and questioned the government's pursuit of broad access to documents, personnel and facilities in the inquiry. On Saturday, a Justice Department spokesman said the department expects to receive the documents on time, despite the Friday letter. " If it doesn't turn over the documents, the government has threatened to sue the sheriff's office "to compel access to the requested documents, facilities and personnel," Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights Thomas Perez has said.
