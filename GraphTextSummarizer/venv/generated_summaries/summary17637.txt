Following the September 9 meeting between Treasury and National Bankers Association officials, Moore "was actively involved in assisting OneUnited representatives with their request for capital from Treasury and crafting legislation to authorize Treasury to grant the request" for financial assistance, the report said. Waters, a senior member of the House Financial Services Committee, helped arrange a meeting in September, 2008, between Massachusetts-based OneUnited Bank and Treasury Department officials, according to ethics investigators. She said Kevin Cohee, OneUnited's chairman and chief executive officer, spoke up at the meeting, "and said, 'I'm an example of what's happening with minority banks' and went on to try and make his case for the fact that OneUnited was losing $50 million that they had invested in Fannie Mae." "It just so happens that some of the officers -- at least one of the officers of OneUnited Bank -- happens to be the chairman of the NBA (National Bankers Association)," the congresswoman said. The report also states that Waters approached Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank, D-Massachusetts, to say that she was "in a predicament because her husband had been involved in the bank, but 'OneUnited people' were coming to her for help.
