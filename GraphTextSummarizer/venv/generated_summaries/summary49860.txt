Before deciding to join the Miami Heat, James, a reigning two-time NBA MVP, looked at several teams, including New York, Chicago and Cleveland. He led the Cavaliers to the NBA finals in 2007, where they lost to the San Antonio Spurs, but never reached the finals again, despite Cleveland management bringing in supporting stars such as Shaquille O'Neal and Antawn Jamison. Stern also criticized civil rights leader Jesse Jackson for comments he made saying Gilbert's letter showed a "property-owner's mentality. In a press conference which was posted on the NBA's website Monday, Stern said that James was "certainly entitled" to leave the team, but he would have advised the basketball star to handle his departure and announcement differently. NBA Commissioner David Stern said Monday that team owner Dan Gilbert's words, "though understandable, were ill-advised and imprudent."
