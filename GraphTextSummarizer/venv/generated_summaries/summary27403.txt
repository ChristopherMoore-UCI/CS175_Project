The group was formed by senior al Qaeda members based in Pakistan who traveled to Syria to direct operations, CNN national security analyst Peter Bergen reported, citing British and U.S. officials. Targeting Ahrar could backfire If Ahrar al Sham has been targeted -- rather than another target being sought that happened to be in Ahrar's headquarters, or the strike being a targeting blunder -- it could be a complex matter for U.S. policy, while also raising the specter of so-called mission creep. One of the more conservative Sunni militant groups in the rebel alliance, Ahrar al Sham has members that sometimes fight alongside the al Qaeda-affiliated Islamist militant group Jabhat al-Nusra, but against ISIS. The United States fired at a vehicle it believes was carrying David Drugeon, a skilled Khorasan bomb-maker who also has  ties to core al Qaeda members in Pakistan. Airstrikes by the U.S.-led coalition against ISIS targeted the Islamist rebel group Ahrar al Sham for the first time overnight in Syria, a monitoring group said Thursday.
