Vince Abad, an airman at a major U.S. Air Force facility in Japan, said he and his wife, Kelli, had fought over the phone on the night of October 26 after he had gone to see their pastor, who had helped resolve disputes between them in the past. Also inside the car was a note, Abad said, that read, "Love my kids, love my hubby and parents. Bye." Cape Zanpa is known locally as a place for committing suicide, Abad said. But when Kelli Abad, 27, didn't come back by the following morning, he became concerned and raised the alarm. The family is "always hoping for the best -- that she's out there," Abad said.
