"Yale is very pleased with the positive developments in the discussions about the return of Machu Picchu artifacts to Peru," the university said in a statement Saturday. The artifacts were excavated from the site by historian Hiram Bingham in 1912 during the first of several expeditions he led to Peru. Peruvian Foreign Minister Garcia Belaunde pointed out that a November 1916 letter from Bingham to the National Geographic Society, which funded the Peru expeditions, stated that the artifacts were on loan. -- Peru and Yale University have reached an agreement that will return a massive collection of pre-Columbian Inca artifacts to the South American country -- a settlement that could end a lengthy dispute over relics excavated nearly a century ago. "It has always been Yale's desire to reach an agreement that honors Peru's rich history and cultural heritage and recognizes the world's interest in ongoing public and scholarly access to that heritage."
