"Touch is here to stay, and I'm pretty sure every laptop will have touch in the future," Pichai said. "This is for power users who live in the cloud," Senior Vice President of Chrome Sundar Pichai repeatedly told a select group of journalists at a low-key launch event in San Francisco. The Chromebook Pixel, available for order on the Google Play store and shipping in April, features a 12.85-inch touch-sensitive Gorilla Glass screen. But Pichai hoped web developers would start making their interfaces touch-sensitive â€” so that content on the device would be indistinguishable from Android. Having a touchscreen doesn't mean that Google plans to integrate its mobile OS, Android, into the device.
