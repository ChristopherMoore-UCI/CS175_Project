I started The Lopez Foundation in December of 2009, and the mission is to create positive and permanent change for underprivileged children, adults and, very importantly, military families, as well as increasing the awareness of kidney disease and organ donation. The group also increases awareness about kidney disease and organ donation. -- George Lopez is helping to create positive change for underprivileged children, adults and military families.
