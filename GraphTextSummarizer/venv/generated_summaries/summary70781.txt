In addition, Hostler moved more than two dozen BP managers from Fairbanks, which is more convenient to pipeline operations, to offices in Anchorage. The panel has been examining allegations by several pipeline managers that stringent cost-cutting measures have put the integrity of the pipeline at risk, government sources told CNN's Special Investigations Unit. He called on BP and the four other companies involved in Alyeska to take those findings "very seriously" and replace Hostler with "someone with the character and management style to move the company forward. Kevin Hostler will step down as CEO of Alyeska, the BP-dominated consortium that operates the 800-mile pipeline, on September 30, the company announced. " "In our committee staff's meeting with Mr. Hostler last week, we expressed serious concerns about a recent internal report showing significant issues with the management culture at Alyeska," Rep. Bart Stupak, D-Michigan, said in a statement following the news.
