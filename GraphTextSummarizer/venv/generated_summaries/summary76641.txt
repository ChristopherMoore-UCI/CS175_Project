-- The Florida Department of Health confirmed an increase in the number of cases of dengue fever acquired in the Key West area. Of those, 18 involve Key West residents, five are residents of other Florida counties and one case involves a resident of another state. New statistics from the department said 24 cases of dengue fever have been reported in Key West through mid-July. In addition, 49 so-called "imported" cases of dengue fever are reported in Florida. They include sudden onset of fever, severe headache, severe pain behind the eyes, muscle, joint and bone pain (giving the disease the nickname "break-bone fever") and bleeding.
