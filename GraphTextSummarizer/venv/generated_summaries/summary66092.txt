The nude photos are part of an effort by Ai fans to show their support for the controversial artist who says he's being investigated on porn charges. The latest allegations come after Ai was slapped with tax evasion charges, which he says is punishment for his outspoken criticism of the Chinese government. Beginning this month, thousands of Ai supporters have donated money to help him pay an estimated 15 million yuan ($2.3 million) fine that the Beijing tax bureau says his design company Beijing Fake Cultural Development Ltd. owes in back taxes. As a result, Ai says he is under investigation on porn charges. Despite the support, Ai says he is not optimistic when it comes to his tax charges and says he doesn't believe in justice from the government since his detention for 81 days in April.
