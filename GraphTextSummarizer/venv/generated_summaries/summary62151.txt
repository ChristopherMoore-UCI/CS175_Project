In April, Nicks and Buckingham will join drummer Mick Fleetwood and bassist John McVie for their first tour in three years. Last year, he went into the studio with Fleetwood and McVie to record eight songs they hoped would become the catalyst for a new Fleetwood Mac album. -- It's 35 years after the release of Fleetwood Mac's groundbreaking album "Rumours," and Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham are holding hands. The "old" tune predates Fleetwood Mac: an unreleased nugget written for the "Buckingham Nicks" LP, which marks its 40th anniversary this year. "Go Your Own Way" was Buckingham's anguished kiss-off to Nicks.
