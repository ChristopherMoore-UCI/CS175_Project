The community (at the time of this review, it was filled with levels created by beta players) has a wide array of selections, from first-person zombie shooters to driving games to traditional platforming games. Media Molecule, the team that developed "Little Big Planet," takes another crack at opening the imagination of players with new challenges, weapons and rides. Indeed, Alex Evans, one of the co-founders of Media Molecule and technical director on "LBP2," said that players from the first game wanted more options to be able to share their own creations with others. With the addition of new tools like the Create-a-nator, which lets Sackboy make whatever he needs to solve a puzzle, new community levels are expected to be more expansive and imaginative. It is also backward-compatible, meaning that anything that was created in the first game will play just as nicely in "Little Big Planet 2."
