Costa Rica claims that in addition to the Nicaraguan troops, a dredging  project in the river is dumping sediment on its side of the border, and that a  Costa Rican flag in the area was replaced with a Nicaraguan flag. In a statement Thursday, Costa Rica's foreign ministry said the country had filed a lawsuit at the International Court of Justice in The Hague, Netherlands, to end a situation that "threatens imminent and irreparable harm" to Costa Rica. Nicaragua  denies its troops are in Costa Rican territory. The suit asks the court to stop "the construction of a canal on Costa Rican soil," according to the statement. -- Costa Rica has taken its border dispute with Nicaragua to international court, repeating claims that its territory has been invaded.
