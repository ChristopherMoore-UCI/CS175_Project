Yankees pitcher CC Sabathia said of the kids on the tour, "Being able to hang out with them going on a bus tour in New York City, I think is pretty cool After the game, first baseman Jorge Posada had the students race around the infield bases before they boarded a double-decker tour bus along with a few of the Yankees for a tour of the city. But Wednesday was a day to put those memories aside, if even for a short while, and to enjoy a baseball game and other good times provided by the New York Yankees. Nine-year-old Frantz Blues summed it up pretty well when he said, "New York is really, really big." It stands for Helping Others Preserve and Excel, an initiative in which the Yankees reach out to an individual, family or organization they think is "worthy of recognition and support."
