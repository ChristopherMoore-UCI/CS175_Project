-- U.S. leaker Edward Snowden did not violate the terms of his asylum in Russia when claims surfaced that a National Security Agency surveillance operation targeted German Chancellor Angela Merkel's cell phone, a spokesman for President Vladimir Putin told Russian daily newspaper Kommersant. Top senator: Obama didn't know of U.S. spying on Germany's leader Snowden was granted a year's asylum by Russia in August, after arriving there from Hong Kong in June. European Union lawmakers also visited Washington this week, where they met with National Security Council staffers. Allegations that the NSA monitored Merkel's cell phone sparked outrage among German leaders. But Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, is cited by Kommersant in a report published Saturday as saying that the reports published in the German press were not distributed from Russia.
