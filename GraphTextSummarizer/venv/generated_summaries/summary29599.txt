But before we start congratulating ourselves about how "advanced" we are now, we should make note of this one little factoid: For much of the country, high school football practice started last month, and for much of the country, high school classes start next month. Studies as far back as 1906 have indicated that over summer vacation children forget significant portions of what they learned during the school year, and yet we keep using the same academic calendar that was instituted in the 19th century -- before schools were air-conditioned or teachers certified. And high school sports starting before high school classes literally screams misplaced priorities. His first day of school is after Labor Day. Many parents as well as students are against year-round school, noting the lessons that can be learned during summer vacation.
