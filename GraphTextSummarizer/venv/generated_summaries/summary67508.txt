The teenager's mother, Zarine Khan, condemned ISIS and accused it of using social media propaganda to brainwash Muslim youths. In a letter, Khan wrote that there is an obligation to "migrate" to ISIS-controlled territory. Mohammed Hamzah Khan, 19, had invited his family to join him in his plans to travel to join ISIS in the Mideast, authorities said. An Illinois teenager accused of trying to support ISIS pleaded not guilty Tuesday in federal court. A round-trip ticket was purchased for Khan from Chicago to Istanbul, authorities said.
