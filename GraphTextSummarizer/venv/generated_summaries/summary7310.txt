Mark Webber in the second Red Bull will join Alonso on the third row. By his standards below-par performances at the British Grand Prix won by Alonso and at the Nurburgring last week, had left some question marks hanging over him, but he answered in fine style. Germans Nico Rosberg of Mercedes, Force India driver Adrian Sutil and Michael Schumacher in the second Mercedes were next best. Vettel, only fourth behind Hamilton in last weekend's German Grand Prix, re-asserted his season-long dominance with a time of one minute 19.815 seconds in his Red Bull in the last few moments of the session. Hamilton's McLaren teammate and 2009 world champion Jenson Button was third fastest and will occupy the second row with Felipe Massa of Ferrari.
