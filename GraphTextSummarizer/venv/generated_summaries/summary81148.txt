-- Atletico Madrid paid emotional tribute to former player and coach Luis Aragones Sunday before sweeping to the top of La Liga with a style of football which would have made him proud. He spent the majority of his football career with Atletico and is still the club's leading scorer, claiming La Liga titles both as a player and coach. Giant banners were unfurled in the Atletico stadium in his honor and tributes were observed before all the matches in the La Liga program. They held their own for much of the match after Villa's 12th of the season just before the break, but a late flurry by Atletico sealed the win to take them three points clear of Barca, who suffered a shock 3-2 home defeat to Valencia Saturday. Atletico manager Diego Simeone said he was proud of his team and their fans.
