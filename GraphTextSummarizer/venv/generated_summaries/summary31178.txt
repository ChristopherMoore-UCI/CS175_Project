" Judge Elden Fox signed a bench warrant for Lohan's arrest but is holding it until a hearing at 8:30 a.m. Friday, according to Los Angeles Superior Court spokesman Allan Parachini. She spent 23 days in a court-ordered drug rehab program last month, which followed a 13-day jail stint imposed when a Los Angeles judge ruled that Lohan violated her probation. -- A judge revoked Lindsay Lohan's probation Monday and the actress was ordered to appear in court Friday, a Los Angeles court spokesman said. It included weekly counseling sessions for alcohol and drug rehabilitation, random drug tests and behavioral therapy. Lohan made fun of her substance abuse troubles in a backstage skit broadcast during last Sunday's MTV Video Music Awards.
