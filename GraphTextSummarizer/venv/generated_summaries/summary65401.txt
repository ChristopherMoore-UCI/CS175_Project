United Airlines flight returns to Newark airport after severe turbulence Transatlantic flights set to be bumpier Last month, a United flight returned to Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey after turbulence injured five flight attendants. "There was a lot of screaming, a lot of hollering," Bill Dahlin told CNN affiliate KTVQ. Just as it was about to land, turbulence struck. According to the FAA, turbulence can be unexpected and can happen even when the sky appears to be clear.
