Kitterman said he was tired, so police chaplains arranged a room for him, and police called his family to pick him up. Paul Kitterman, 53, was found safe Tuesday night in Pueblo, Colorado, about 110 miles south of Denver's Sports Authority Field at Mile High. Pueblo police got a report Tuesday that a man fitting Kitterman's description was in a Kmart parking lot. Kitterman further told police he'd ditched his Broncos hat so no one would recognize him and "mentioned sleeping in treed areas and in bushes during his journey to Pueblo," the statement said. Kitterman was attending his first game with his stepson, Jarod Tonneson, and two friends who sat in another section in the stadium for the Thursday Night Football showdown.
