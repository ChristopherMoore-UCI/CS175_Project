Shipping companies may have found a new tool to fight piracy: It turns out, pirates like to tweet. Lincoln has put together data from social media, mainstream media, academics, governmental organizations, and NGOs to create a virtual representation of the social networking web of pirates in Somalia. As a result, the high-seas clash between pirates and commercial shippers is becoming more of a technology race, security experts say. While, for example, Al-Shabaab may claim an attack was carried out, Lincoln will confirm this claim with other online sources, like the Kenyan army or the IMO. But the same weakness Lincoln exploits can favor criminals.
