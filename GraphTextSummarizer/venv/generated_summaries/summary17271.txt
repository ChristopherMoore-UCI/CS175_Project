If this climax feels a shade hurried, the poignant coda is written and acted with immense delicacy by Irrfan Khan and Rafe Spall. That's prosaic in comparison, and the first act is not quite as nimble as it might have been (there's a necessary framing device, but also a redundant romantic interlude concocted by screenwriter David Magee for reasons that have more to do with conventional Hollywood wisdom than the demands of this particular tale). But the most glaring problem facing any aspiring filmmaker would have to be Richard Parker, the full-grown 450-pound Bengal tiger who shares the lifeboat with Pi. We don't usually think of "Brokeback Mountain" director Ang Lee as an effects filmmaker, but he gave us the romantic swordplay above swaying bamboo forests in "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" and, less happily, "Hulk" bouncing across the desert like a rubber ball. Interesting to note that the movie revises and pretty much demolishes the tiger-taming tips Martel came up with -- worth bearing in mind should you ever find yourself in close proximity to a man-eater for a prolonged period of time.
