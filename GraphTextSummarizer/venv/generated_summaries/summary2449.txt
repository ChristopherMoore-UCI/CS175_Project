The Interior Ministry announced Wednesday that overnight, headstones were damaged in a small Christian cemetery in Saint-Beat in southern France and swastikas were scrawled in Jewish cemeteries in Challans, in the west, and Issoudun, in central France. After the Paris attack on the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo and kosher market siege, numerous mosques in France were attacked -- with shots fired in some cases and other instances in which a pig's head was stuck on a prayer room door and  messages of hate were sprayed on walls, according to French media reports. Whatever the motive, the Sarre-Union vandalism spurred strong condemnations from French officials, with Prime Minister Manuel Valls calling it "a vile, anti-Semitic act" and Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve vowing, "The French Republic won't allow another act against our values." Authorities took five teenagers -- one of whom turned himself in and none of whom have criminal records -- into custody in that incident and charged them with desecration of graves and with organized damage on property for the public benefit, Saverne prosecutor Philippe Vanier said Monday. Those three incidents are in addition to the defacing of tombstones in western France's Tracy-sur-Mer and the desecration of about 250 graves late last week in a Jewish cemetery in Sarre-Union.
