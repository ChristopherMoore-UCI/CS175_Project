-- As video game technology improves, games are getting quicker, deadlier and more reactive. Turn-based strategy games harken back to the days of playing board games with dice and individualized pieces. Ed Beach, lead designer for "Civilization V: Gods & Kings," designs historical board games in his spare time, but appreciates how turn-based strategy games now create a better experience for the player. Beach points out the future of turn-based strategy gaming is already playing out in other casual games like "Words With Friends," where players take turns playing a "Scrabble"-like game with opponents. "I think it is unique to strategy games," he said.
