U.S. authorities have described him as extremely violent, and Brazilian police said he was behind at least 15 killings in the United States and more than 300 in Colombia. Police and media reports detailed a business empire run by Ramirez Abadia that included property, car dealerships, import and export companies, even a jet-ski store on a busy Sao Paulo avenue. SAO PAULO, Brazil (Reuters)  -- A Colombian man who authorities say is one of Latin America's biggest drug traffickers wants to be extradited to the United States from a Brazilian jail and is willing to cooperate with U.S. anti-drug agents, his attorney says. Ramirez Abadia, 44, and his wife lived in luxury in a million-dollar mansion in a Sao Paulo suburb, but they kept a low profile. In a 2004 indictment issued by a grand jury in Washington, Ramirez Abadia was accused of shipping about 500 tons of cocaine worth more than $10 billion from Colombia to the United States between 1990 and 2004.
