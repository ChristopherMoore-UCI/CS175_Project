Pepper was built in a collaboration between Softbank and Aldebaran Robotics, makers of other humanoid robots like Nao and Romeo. Softbank says that instead of being programmed, Pepper learns how to behave over time. Softbank's Son, who also is chairman of Sprint Mobile, said the company envisions a future when household robots are commonplace and used for tasks ranging from simple companionship to tending to the sick and elderly. "People may look back 100 years later, or 200 years later (and say) that was a historic moment we are having today," said Masayoshi Son, Softbank's CEO, in a translated video on Softbank's website. "He tries to make you happy," Kaname Hayashi, Softbank's project manager, told CNN.
