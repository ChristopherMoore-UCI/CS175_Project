The eastern part of DR Congo, which includes Goma, has been embroiled in violence since 1994, when Hutu forces crossed the border from Rwanda fearing reprisals following the genocide. The M23's occupation of Goma and another nearby town, Sake, had been in the face of "significant resistance" by the Congolese army, supported by MONUSCO, the U.N. mission in DR Congo, he said. A spokesman for the rebel M23 group said its successful operation to take Goma on Tuesday, the culmination of several days of heavy fighting against government forces, was just the beginning. Security analysts say the rebellion in eastern DR Congo has dangerous regional implications, including the risk that it could lead to renewed conflict with neighboring Rwanda. Rebels seize control of Goma amid clashes in Democratic Republic of Congo Kinshasa, the country's capital, lies nearly 1,000 miles to the west of Goma, the capital of North Kivu province.
