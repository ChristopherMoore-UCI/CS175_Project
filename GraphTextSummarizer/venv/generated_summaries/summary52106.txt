As two Osprey military aircraft appear on the horizon, signalling the opening of an air bridge from Senegal that will put more U.S. troops on the ground in Liberia, Williams can't contain his excitement. As Williams inspected the construction of the Monrovia Medical Unit, a facility specifically for infected health workers to be run by U.S. government health teams, a crowd of local residents monitors progress from just across the road. Maj. Gen. Darryl Williams, the commander of U.S. Army Africa who is leading the advance team into Liberia, says the mandate here -- straight from President Barack Obama -- is different from other missions. "There is no question in my mind that we are making an impact," the U.S. unit's chief medical officer, Colonel Jim Czarnik says. Thanks to one lab in Bong County, patients now wait hours, not days to get test results.
