-- UK police found 15 suspected illegal immigrants covered in cocoa powder in the back of a truck that was apparently headed to a Mars chocolate factory, police and border officials said Thursday. The Mars factory in Slough produces chocolate snacks including Bounty, M&Ms, Mars, Milky Way, Snickers and Twix, according to the company. "They were all physically fine, although the ambulance services had to check them," said a police spokesman who asked not to be named, in line with policy. The men, aged between around 20 and 40, were found Wednesday morning in Slough, west of London, Thames Valley Police said. Authorities suspect the truck was going to the Mars factory in Slough, he said.
