During that visit, he pressed Prime Minister Naoto Kan to provide more information on conditions at Fukushima Daiichi, where three of the six reactors may have suffered core damage since the March 11 earthquake that struck northern Japan. Amano told reporters Monday that information coming from Tokyo now is "more extensive," and that damaged instruments at the plant may have prevented Tokyo Electric or Japanese regulators from having all the facts. In Washington, the head of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission said information coming out of Japan "is sometimes conflicting, and certainly isn't at the level that any engineer would like to have to do a thorough analysis." "I don't believe we have anywhere near a clear understanding of what the plant conditions are like within the reactor building -- what kinds of electrical cabling has been damaged, what kinds of pumps and valves remain operable is a significant unknown right now, " NRC Chairman Gregory Jaczko, whose agency has sent specialists to Japan to assist with the effort, said Monday. Japan's government and the Tokyo Electric Power Company, which owns the damaged plant, have been criticized for failing to share information about conditions there fully and promptly. -- International regulators need to rethink their procedures for handling nuclear accidents in the wake of the crisis in Japan, the head of the U.N. atomic watchdog agency said Monday.
