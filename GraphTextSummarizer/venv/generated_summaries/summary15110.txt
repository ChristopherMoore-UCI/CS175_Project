The Obama administration will give more time to people who try to apply for health insurance coverage through the federal marketplace by Monday but encounter difficulty, administration officials said Tuesday evening. Administration officials said this move, similar to the one in December for the large number of people who were trying to sign up by January 1, will accommodate people who face special circumstances or complex cases and need extra time to complete their enrollment. Monday is the deadline for people to enroll in order to have coverage for this year or face penalties under the Affordable Care Act. "Another day, another Obamacare delay from the same Obama administration that won't work with Republicans to help Americans suffering from the unintended consequences of the Democrats' failed health care law," Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said in a statement. "As was the case for the December deadline, we're going to want to make sure that people who are already in line can finish their enrollment," Carney said.
