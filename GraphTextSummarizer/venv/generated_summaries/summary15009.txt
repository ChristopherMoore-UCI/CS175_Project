Compared to the United States and Europe -- where several countries are saddled with deficit crises -- Canada is on a clear path to a balanced budget by 2014, Flaherty said. Asked if Canada had contingency plans for a default, Flaherty said, "What we are doing in Canada is what we're able to do in Canada." Still, some Canadian business owners expressed frustration with what they called American fiscal recklessness and its impact on Canadians. Nobody can predict the precise global consequences of a U.S. default, but several economic experts said the ensuing panic could fall hard on Canada, the United States' largest trading partner. Perhaps in an attempt to assuage worries, Canadian Finance Minister Jim Flaherty said this week that he was "relatively confident" the United States will raise the debt ceiling. In a worst-case scenario, this would grind bank lending to a halt, slowing economic activity and plunging the United States -- where Canada does 75% of its trading -- back into recession, according to Jack Mintz, a professor of public policy at the University of Calgary.
