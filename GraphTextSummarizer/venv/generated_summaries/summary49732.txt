One of the accidents last year was actually with an illegal crop-dusting operation in Russia. Though this does not make flying in Russia unsafe, it certainly was one of the hotspots that should cause alarm for Russian aviation officials. There was an accident on a domestic flight in Iran, one on a tourist flight in Nepal, one on a prop in Papua New Guinea and five on turboprops in Latin America. A couple of bush flying accidents in Northern Canada claimed three lives as well, but that was it for this immediate part of the world. This number includes military and cargo aircraft accidents as well as airplanes on test flights.
