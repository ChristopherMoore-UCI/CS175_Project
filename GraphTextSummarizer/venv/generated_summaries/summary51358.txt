Bob Barker will celebrate 90th birthday on 'Price is Right' The difference between us is that when I was choosing college classes by their attendance policy, Blatt graduated from Harvard with a degree in applied math -- and then used what he learned to figure out how to win at "The Price is Right." Blatt's article outlines some more strategies (including another game where he found a strategy that works 100% of the time) and includes a "Price is Right" cheat sheet that's so complete, it even earned a retweet from Drew Carey, the show's host. Since you get unlimited guesses, you just need to be quick about each guess and victory is yours! When Blatt, a staff writer at Slate, discovered that there were collections of data based on the outcomes of the over 70 pricing games from the show, the mathematician inside leaped at the chance to look for patterns, and he found a few places where a person could not only do better than chance, but even win 100% of the time!
