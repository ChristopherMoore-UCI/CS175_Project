The Noll era spawned one Steeler Hall of Fame player after another, such as quarterback Terry Bradshaw; "Mean" Joe Greene, who anchored the "Steel Curtain" defensive line; center Mike Webster, linebackers Jack Ham and Jack Lambert; receivers Lynn Swann and John Stallworth; and running back Franco Harris, whose career rushing yards rank 13th in NFL history. " Noll and the Steelers took their first Vince Lombardi Trophy in January 1975, beating the Minnesota Vikings 16-6 in Super Bowl IX, then went on to win three of the next five, capped by a 31-19 victory over the Los Angeles Rams in Super Bowl XIV. " Four Super Bowls in six years Noll began his pro football career in the 1950s, playing as a guard and linebacker for the Cleveland Browns. His Super Bowl triumphs are the tip of the iceberg of the winning legacy Noll left behind. Chuck Noll, the man who led his team to four Super Bowl victories -- the most by any head coach -- died late Friday.
