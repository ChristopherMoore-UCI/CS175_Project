-- Security forces killed seven militants in a counterterrorism operation in Russia's southern republic of Dagestan, security officials said Saturday, according to the country's state news agency RIA Novosti. It also came as Russian security forces have tried to address security concerns before next month's Winter Olympics in Sochi, which is perhaps a 12-hour drive from Dagestan on the other side of the Caucasus range. The six men and one woman were killed after a siege in Makhachkala, capital city of Dagestan, Russia's Anti-Terrorism Committee said in a prepared statement, RIA Novosti reported. The investigators said that the seven killed Saturday included a local militant leader and the widow of a dead militant preparing for a suicide attack, RIA Novosti added. Concerns about security in Russia were heightened after twin bombings on public transit that killed more than 30 people in the southern city of Volgograd at the end of last month.
