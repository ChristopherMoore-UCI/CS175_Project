Potter's DJ business goes with the number, a necessary provision to get around phone company rules against selling telephone numbers, he said. While Potter is overlooking the fact that "867-5309" is an active phone number in dozens of other area codes, it does get called a lot by curious people. The song is about a guy who finds Jenny's name and number scribbled on a bathroom wall. Potter said he has gotten about 40 calls a day since he got the area code 201 version for his Weehawken, New Jersey, DJ business. Bids for a New Jersey version of the number, stuck in the minds of millions since Tommy Tutone's "867-5309/Jenny" hit the Top 10 in 1982, had reached $5,100 on eBay as of Monday morning.
