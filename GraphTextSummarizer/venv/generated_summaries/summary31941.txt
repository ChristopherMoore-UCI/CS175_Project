"I grew up in environment that had more women in science," Gianotti told me. The brain is much more useful in life than beauty." Interestingly, Gianotti sees physics in a decidedly feminine way. Why is it, she wonders, when girls reach the age of 6, brains take a back seat to beauty even if they have both? I'm not saying they are solely to blame for the Wiki-How site that instructs girls to be smart without being nerdy, but something in our culture is causing girls to tune out math and science. In many countries, girls now outperform boys in science, but not in the United States, according to a study by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, reported by The New York Times.
