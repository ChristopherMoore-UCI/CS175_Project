Oculus believes that over the next 10 years, virtual reality will become ubiquitous and affordable. "After games, we're going to make Oculus a platform for many other experiences," said Zuckerberg in a post announcing the purchase. Based in Irvine, California, Oculus (rhymes with "octopus," sort of) is a young company founded by Palmer Luckey, who designed its core product -- the Oculus Rift headset -- as a 20-year-old engineer at the University of Southern California. Gaming legend John Carmack, the lead programmer of pioneering games like "Doom" and "Quake," came aboard last year as Oculus' chief technology officer. Reviewers have been wildly enthusiastic, inspiring such breathless headlines as "Mere Words Can't Do Justice To How Awesome The New Oculus Rift Gaming Headset Is" and "I Wore the New Oculus Rift and I Never Want to Look at Real Life Again."
