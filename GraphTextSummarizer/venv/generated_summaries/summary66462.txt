" "Tiger Eyes," which opened June 7, may not be Blume's most popular book, but it's the one she and son Lawrence Blume (the inspiration for Fudge) had always wanted to bring to the big screen. Among them was Donna Liska-Johnson, now a 44-year-old special education teacher with a bookshelf full of first edition Judy Blume novels procured via eBay. Before we had "16 and Pregnant," push-up bras for tweens or mandatory sex education, girls like Donna Liska-Johnson learned about the birds and the bees from author Judy Blume. A sold-out crowd showed up to the suburban Atlanta movie theater for a screening and Q&A of "Tiger Eyes," many carrying tattered copies of Blume's books for her to sign afterward. Normally, Blume keeps a box of tissues on the table at book signings, she said, keenly aware of her effect on fans.
