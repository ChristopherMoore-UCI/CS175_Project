A couple of years ago, I asked civil rights leader and former ambassador to the U.N. Andrew Young to tell me something about Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. that most people did not know. With youth and inexperience on his side, young King had the improvisational space to carve out a movement philosophy and strategy that has been replicated many times over where people challenge oppressive governments. Young King synthesized Henry Thoreau's treatise on civil disobedience, Howard Thurman's theological philosophy, Mahatma Gandhi's Satyagraha and the Old Testament's views of justice to form a personal vision and tactic that awakened the moral consciousness of the nation. It's fortunate for us that King was not a middle-aged pastor when the moment in history demanded transformational leadership. Young's depiction of his mentor as a joking hoopster reminded me of an important factor we often overlook when considering King's civil rights legacy: he was very young when he changed the world.
