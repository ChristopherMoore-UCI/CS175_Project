Robert and Gladys Zimmerman have filed a lawsuit against Barr, accusing the comedian and actress of posting "an open and obvious call for vigilante justice," which she intended "to cause a lynch mob to descend" on their Lake Mary, Florida, home. The tweet was published a month after their son killed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in a Florida subdivision, when national attention was focused on the incident and amid calls for Zimmerman's arrest. "Roseanne Barr acted extremely and outrageously in making the tweets which were intended to cause severe emotional distress to Robert and Gladys Zimmerman and possible great physical harm, if not death," the lawsuit contends. "It was foreseeable that the tweets would cause Robert and Gladys Zimmerman to have to flee their house in the middle of the night and never to be able to return, have to face a descent of media and others who would seek to do harm to Robert and Gladys Zimmerman and to their home, and have to live in seclusion to protect their personal and emotional well being," the civil complaint said. "These losses are permanent and continuing in nature and Robert and Gladys Zimmerman will continue to suffer these losses in the future.
