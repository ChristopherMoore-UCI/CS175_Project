It's been a month since violent clashes between opposition demonstrators and government forces in Venezuela first grabbed global attention. Opposition protesters and government officials have traded blame for the violence for weeks. The weeks of protests across Venezuela mark the biggest threat President Nicolas Maduro has faced since his election last year. After a meeting in Santiago, Chile, to discuss the crisis in Venezuela, foreign ministers from the Union of South American Nations said they would send a special commission to support and advise a process of peaceful political dialogue in Venezuela. At a U.S. House hearing Wednesday, Secretary of State John Kerry said the U.S. government is prepared to sanction Venezuela if the situation worsens, but he also cautioned that the country's economy is already fragile.
