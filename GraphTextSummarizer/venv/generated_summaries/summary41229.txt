Toni spent the second half of last season on loan at Italian side AS Roma after being deemed surplus to requirements at Bayern by coach Louis van Gaal. -- German Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich and Luca Toni have agreed to cancel the Italian striker's contract. "I would like to warmly thank Luca Toni for his efforts and his goals, especially in our double-winning 2007/8 season," Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge said on the club's official Web site. Toni reportedly fell out of favor with Van Gaal and was allowed to leave for Roma in January this year. Toni joined Bayern in 2007 and scored 24 goals in his first campaign at the club to become the Bundesliga's top scorer, as Bayern won both the league and the cup.
