For many liberals, President Obama has failed to deliver on key promises from 2008, ranging from measures to combat climate change to liberalized immigration rules and dealing with the growing problem of economic inequality. President Obama has done a lot of talking, but he has not been as successful at achieving his goals. For tea party Republicans, the problem is a leadership that has become too embedded in Washington, too comfortable with the political status quo. President Obama has become the problem as he finds himself in a similar position to President George W. Bush. For moderates and independents, there is growing unease and discomfort with the way in which Obama has handled the implementation of health care, the problems with the economy and the response to the growth of ISIS.
