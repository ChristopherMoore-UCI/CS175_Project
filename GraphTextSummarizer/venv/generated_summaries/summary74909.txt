He noted that bed sharing can strengthen the bond between parents and infants, and that the practice could make breastfeeding easier for mothers. That revelation, published in the journal JAMA Pediatrics, concerns doctors, as in that same time, greater awareness of the dangers of bed sharing, which include sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), accidental suffocation, and getting trapped in bedding, have also increased. Caregivers who believed that their family doctor did not approve of bed sharing were 34% less likely to report co-sleeping with an infant than caregivers who did not receive such advice from their doctor. The findings point to the weak penetration of public health messages urging parents to give each child her own place to sleep not just for safety reasons, but to make the transition to independent sleeping arrangements easier later on. More studies may be needed to tease apart the relative benefits and risks of the practice, especially since the latest data shows that co-sleeping is becoming increasingly popular with parents.
