Well, for starters, any fanboy or fangirl will love the loading screens with Green Day specific graphics and sounds. When it was announced last year that we would be getting a Green Day version of "Rock Band," fans of the band (myself included) were pretty excited. " Hardcore "Rock Band" fans have posted videos on YouTube of themselves playing in expert mode and achieving five gold stars, which is something that not even the members of Green Day were able to do, according to a recent interview with MTV. Sore arms and scratchy voice aside, "Green Day: Rock Band" is a lot of fun. Playing songs like "When I Come Around" and "Pulling Teeth" brings back memories of college days, and yes, I will admit I wish they had put "All By Myself" in the game, because it's the only hidden track that Green Day has ever included on an album.
