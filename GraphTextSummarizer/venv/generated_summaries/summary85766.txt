We have had the, probably the first big crisis that we had was the Tiananmen Square incident and that was a huge problem for us because I think 90 percent of our business was in China and one day we were closed down. And that, I think, was fundamental to the future of the company, because we helped out people when they needed help, and people have respected that and helped us out as well, when we have needed help. Whatever happens in life, you cannot take away education. But we carried on and we had some requests from certain people to continue shipping and certain people said could we assist them and pay some debt that they had to pay because the banks had been closed at the time 90 percent of your business is in China, there is a crisis there.
