"By designating the area as wilderness, Congress could preserve the Coastal Plain in perpetuity -- ensuring that this wild, free, beautiful, and bountiful place remains in trust for Alaska Natives and for all Americans." The shift came in how the White House announced that it would now treat the refuge as wilderness, which has infuriated Alaska Republicans since it could prevent oil and gas drilling on a contentious piece of land, at least for now. Yet, until a surprising announcement from the Obama administration on Sunday, that's rarely what the public has heard about Alaska's highly politicized Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. " It's a throwback to John Muir, the Sierra Club founder, who wrote, according to that group's website, that "our bodies were made to thrive only in pure air, and the scenes in which pure air is found." "If Congress chooses to act, it would be the largest ever wilderness designation since Congress passed the visionary Wilderness Act over 50 years ago," the U.S. Department of Interior said in a news release.
