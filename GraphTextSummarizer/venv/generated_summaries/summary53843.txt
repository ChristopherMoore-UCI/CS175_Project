But life as a crime kingpin brought a growing list of enemies, said Arthur J. Lurigio, a professor of criminology at Loyola University Chicago, who is also working on a documentary and book about organized crime in Chicago. State University of New York at Oswego professor emeritus Luciano Iorizzo, who wrote "Al Capone: A Biography" in 2003, said he has never come across evidence that Capone visited the Wisconsin hideout. From 1925 to 1931, Capone was Chicago's most notorious organized-crime boss. No one can say for certain whether Al Capone ever stayed in the Wisconsin lodge. A Wisconsin lodge that may have been one of Capone's old hideouts goes on the auction block this week with a starting bid of $2.6 million.
