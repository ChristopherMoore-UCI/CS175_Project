We won't know how many people enrolled in December until HHS releases its enrollment report sometime in mid-January. Do I have to have coverage beginning January 1? Coverage will be retroactive to January 1. If you live in one of the 36 states serviced by the federal enrollment website, HealthCare.gov, your best bet for getting hassle-free coverage in 2014 is to select a policy by end of the day Monday and pay your first month's premium by January 10. In Washington, residents who try to apply by Monday but run into problems have until January 15 to pick and pay for a plan.
