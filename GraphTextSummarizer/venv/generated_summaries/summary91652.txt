Sales of British music abroad reached $2.9 billion in retail value in 2011 with British artists accounting for almost 13% of global sales of recorded music, according to BPI (the representative body of the British Music Industry) figures. Geoff Taylor, the chief executive of BPI -- a body that represents independent and major record labels in the UK -- told CNN in a statement: "I think British people are more obsessed by music than any other people in the world, they buy more CD albums per capita than any other nation, it's fundamental to our life. Compared to Britain's share of world trade in goods (2.7%), the trade of recorded music is four times the nation's average share of trade in services, accounting for 12.6% of the global market, according to figures from the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. Jamie Fullerton - features editor for the NME (New Musical Express), Britain's pre-eminent weekly music magazine, told CNN: "What's really interesting is the set included bands like New Order and Happy Mondays, organizers tipping their hat towards the cult element of British rock 'n' roll music, which is very different to what you see at an event like the Superbowl. In Europe, British acts accounted for 52.7% of all sales.
