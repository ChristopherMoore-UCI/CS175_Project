After he was released in May in exchange for five senior Taliban members held by the U.S. military, Bergdahl underwent counseling and medical care at a hospital in San Antonio, where he is back on regular duty at Fort Sam Houston. Former Taliban prisoner Bowe Bergdahl will meet Wednesday with an Army general leading the investigation into the sergeant's disappearance five years ago, his lawyer said. Bergdahl was a private first class when he was captured, and the Army extended his enlistment and twice promoted him on schedule while he was in captivity. The Army has no definitive finding that Bergdahl deserted because that would require knowing his intent, something officials couldn't learn without talking to the soldier, a U.S. military official recently told CNN. He will eventually be given a position commensurate with his rank of sergeant, the Army said last month.
