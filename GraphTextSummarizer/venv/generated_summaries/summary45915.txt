iPhone speculation has focused on a handful of expected new features, including a slightly larger screen, a smaller dock connector and NFC technology that would make it easier for shoppers to make payments through their phones. More details about the presumably imminent release of the next iPhone have emerged, if the typically anonymous spate of Internet sources are to be believed. The site's "Instant Sale" feature, which offers a pre-determined amount for electronics based on what someone else has offered, saw its number of phone trade-in offers jump 70% between July 30 and August 1. Both reports from the blog cite "sources that have provided iMore with accurate iPhone related launch dates in the past." iMore, the first blog to publish reports that Apple plans to unveil its latest iteration of the smartphone on September 12, is now saying that pre-orders will begin that day and that the phone will be released nine days later, on September 21.
