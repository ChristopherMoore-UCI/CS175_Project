In a post on the blog ReadWriteWeb, Ethan Stillman says that the new sites that are adding "game mechanics" to websites are doing a better job than their predecessors, but that adding games to Web browsing can go terribly wrong. Badgeville, which was a finalist in a contest for innovative startup companies at the TechCrunch Disrupt event this week, aims to work with media companies to develop loyal website users using similar techniques. "The Badgeville Platform offers turnkey widgets & an API that allow media sites, publishers, brands, marketers, and community managers to leverage game-based techniques to create highly engaging web experiences," the site says in an introductory blog post. The site awards digital "patches" to people who complete certain challenges. BigDoor Media is another company trying to sell game-like features to websites.
