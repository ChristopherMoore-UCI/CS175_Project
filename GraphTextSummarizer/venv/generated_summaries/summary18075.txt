Philadelphia priest abuse trial a test case for Catholic church Lynn's defense team argues that the monsignor repeatedly sent word of child sex abuse up the chain of command. Deliberations resume Monday in Philadelphia in the landmark trial of Monsignor William Lynn, the highest-ranking cleric charged with endangering children by allegedly helping cover up sexual abuse. Lynn is the first high-ranking church figure charged with child endangerment for allegedly shuffling predator priests from parish to parish. Lynn, a defendant with another Philadelphia priest, is accused of knowingly allowing dangerous priests to continue in the ministry in roles in which they had access to children. It said Lynn was never formally trained to handle child sex abuse allegations and learned on the job.
