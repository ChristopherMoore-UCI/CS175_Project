-- There was nothing about last Friday's biology department faculty meeting at the University of Alabama in Huntsville that portended the carnage that was to come, Professor Debra Moriarity told a reporter Wednesday. " Moriarity returned to her office on Wednesday and said she plans to resume teaching next week. It was really actually one of the easiest faculty meetings we've had." Among the participants was Amy Bishop, a Harvard-trained geneticist with whom Moriarity had developed a professional relationship nurtured by the fact that the two women worked with cell cultures. "I think right now most of us want to get back there and get things going, make plans for who is going to cover classes." A memorial service to honor the lives of the dead -- faculty members Maria Davis, Adriel Johnson and Gopi Podila -- is to be held Friday. "Just dropped to the floor and crawled under the table and crawled towards Amy," said Moriarity, who was focused on one thing.
