At times, I watched families appear quietly outside Mandela's home and silently soak up the atmosphere. It was called "Mandela Magic"-- and now that he was gone it felt like the 'magic' that had sustained a battered, racist nation would go with him. However, I had made a promise to my sources that I would not go to air with any information they gave me about his condition until there were an official announcement by President Jacob Zuma. It was 9 p.m. and Nelson Mandela was gone. It was as if a whole generation of South Africans wanted their kids to feel and breathe in that last little bit of "Mandela Magic.'
