Around 2000, at age 4, Alex asked her mom if she could start a lemonade stand to raise money for pediatric cancer research. By that time Alex had raised over a million dollars for pediatric cancer research. Today, Alex's parents, Liz and Jay Scott, have continued her mission to find a cure for pediatric cancer. Alex was diagnosed with neuroblastoma, a type of childhood cancer, shortly before her first birthday. I hope that you will join me and the many others who are continuing Alex's dream to find a cure for childhood cancer, one cup at a time.
