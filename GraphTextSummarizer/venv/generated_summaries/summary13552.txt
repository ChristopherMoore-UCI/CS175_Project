Shortly after landing here for his first stop on a 10-day tour of Asia, the president and first lady Michelle Obama quickly headed over to this city's Gandhi Museum, a three-story home where Gandhi stayed when he was in Mumbai. The president spent several minutes in the library, which has Gandhi quotations on the walls, such as, "Freedom is like a birth. On Saturday, Obama was particularly tickled about getting to sign a guest book at the museum and taking a peek at an older guest book that was signed by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., who also saw Gandhi as an inspiration for the civil rights movement in America. " Mrs. Obama wrote simply, "This visit will be one that I will always remember ..." The Obama tribute to Gandhi will continue Sunday, when the first couple lay a wreath at his grave site. For a man who used to hang a framed picture of Mohandas K. Gandhi in his Senate office, President Obama declared that checking out a museum honoring the Indian independence hero's legacy was "pretty cool" Saturday.
