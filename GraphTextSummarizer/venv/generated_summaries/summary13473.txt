Kaufman County Judge Bruce Wood said he thought there was a "strong connection" between the slayings of Mike and Cynthia McLelland and the shooting death of Kaufman County Assistant District Attorney Mark Hasse, who was killed on his way to work in January. And Kaufman Mayor William Fortner told CNN that he thought the men were targeted by people seeking revenge. Authorities are providing extra security for others, and the Kaufman County district attorney's office will be closed on Monday. On Saturday, authorities found the McLellands' bodies in their home in Kaufman County, east of Dallas. Hasse had feared for his life and carried a gun to work, said a Dallas attorney who described herself as his longtime friend.
