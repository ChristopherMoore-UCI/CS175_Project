Some library patrons reported waiting lists for popular e-books, or that the library e-book wasn't offered in a format compatible with their device. Pew also found that 12% of all Americans age 16 and older who read e-books have borrowed an e-book from a library in the past year -- and they're generally pretty happy with the experience. Furthermore over half of e-book users who also hold library cards told Pew that they prefer to buy -- not borrow -- their e-books. -- About three quarters of American public libraries currently lend out e-books, and in the past year libraries have seen a sharp growth in e-book borrowing. If e-books encourage people to read more, that's good for public libraries -- which have a core mission to foster literacy and community engagement with information, culture and civic life.
