More officers showed up and others with the wedding party interfered to keep officers from arresting O'Balle, who threw punches at the officers, police said. -- Thirteen Galveston, Texas, police officers have been disciplined in connection with a brawl last year between officers and wedding guests. "The investigators also determined that these paperwork failures, all of which occurred after the incident and related arrests, did not cause or contribute to the events in question or lead to any improper conduct by any officer in their responses to the situation presented by O'Balle and the others who were arrested," according to police. There were failures by some officers and supervisors "to properly file affidavits, supplemental reports, booking reports, use of force reports and arrest warrants. The incident centered around the drunk and disorderly behavior of Daniel Cole O'Balle, 19, who had been attending his sister's wedding at a convention center, police said.
