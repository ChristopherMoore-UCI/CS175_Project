Schalke moved to within a point of German Bundesliga leaders Bayer Leverkusen after winning 2-0 away to fellow title hopefuls Werder Bremen on Saturday night. Bremen could also have closed to within a point of Leverkusen, who were held 2-2 at bottom club Hertha Berlin on Friday night, but ended the night two points adrift of Bayern. Defender Karim Haggui twice put into his own net -- the first an lucky rebound from goalkeeper Florian Fromlowitz's attempted clearance in the 15th minute to open the scoring, and he also contributed the game's eighth goal with his second faux-pas. All the goals came in the second half as Eljero Elia's 47th-minute strike opened the floodgates, and he helped set up Marcell Jansen for the second on the hour mark. Louis Van Gaal's Bayern, runners-up to Wolfsburg last season, briefly reached their highest league position since he took over as coach in the summer as Mario Gomez continued his recent scoring run with the opening goal at Bochum and strike partner Ivica Olic netted twice.
