Power Africa has already served to focus the American private sector on Africa as the new frontier for energy investment and has encouraged African countries not selected as Power Africa countries to undertake reforms of their regulatory structures, so as to participate in future power deals and partnerships. I coined the term "Africapitalism" to describe our approach to business -- our belief that long-term investment in key sectors, like in power, can create economic prosperity and social wealth, benefiting investors and Africa's development future. Yet Power Africa must be viewed by the administration and Congress as only a start. Corporate Africa has taken up the challenge. Recognizing the centrality of power to Africa's ability to sustain its own development, Congress is now looking to enact legislation that would ensure that the Presidential initiative defines the future of U.S. engagement on the continent.
