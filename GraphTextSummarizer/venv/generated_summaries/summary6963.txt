She instructed educators to run with girls on the playground, to play dolls with boys and to be mindful of messages in books and music. With the help of her friends and contacts, including poet Shel Silverstein and co-producer Carole Hart, the album and book were born. Her young niece's storybooks were the same ones Thomas had read as a kid, and recent entries to the bedtime canon reinforced that boys were pilots and doctors while girls were stewardesses and nurses. She wrote in "When We Were Free to Be" about her feminist mom's righteous letters and calls demanding her daughter be able take wood and mechanical shop, or that girls need not wait for boys to ask them to square dance. Ideas that seemed so new in "Free to Be... You and Me" now turn up every day in "Dora the Explorer," "Brave" and long shelves of picture books.
