That man is Mark Cavendish -- the man who won Wednesday's fifth stage of the Tour de France and took his tally of wins to 24 to move to within 10 of record holder Merckx. Merckx, a five-time winner of the Tour, won six stages in 1969 and 1972, and eight in 1970 and 1974 during an illustrious career. The morale is good in the team and the only way to make it better is by winning more stages. The Orica-GreenEdge man was pleased with his day's work -- despite teammate and main sprinter Matt Goss being held up by a crash 12 km from the finish. " Australia's Simon Gerrans retained the leader's yellow jersey following the 228.5 kilometer stretch -- the second longest stage of the Tour.
