"In 2010, we launched two major algorithmic changes focused on low-quality sites," Matt Cutts, Google's leader for search quality, wrote on The Official Google Blog last month. Blekko, a new engine launched last year to fight this very problem, is already crowdsourcing quality by letting users mark results as spam. There's a rising backlash against "spam" search results and other low-quality content, and that could spell the death knell for content farms like Demand. The material produced by Demand Media -- and other content farms, like AOL's Seed -- is usually not as egregious as the example above, but it's often not far behind. At Farsight 2011 this week, the conference at which Loopt's Altman appeared, Cutts indicated that the search giant is looking for algorithmic ways to improve the quality of search results.
