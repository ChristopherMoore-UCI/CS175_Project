-- The wife of CNN talk-show host Larry King suffered an apparent drug overdose last month, just over two weeks after the couple reconciled and dropped their divorce petitions, according to a Utah police report. King was taken to Utah Valley Regional Medical Center, where she was listed in critical condition later that night, the report said. Her father, Karl Engemann, called for an ambulance to come to his Provo, Utah, home around midday on May 28 because he found Shawn King, 50, unconscious on a bed. Paramedics found "multiple pill bottles all of which were empty" on her bed, along with a letter a police officer said "led me to believe that (Shawn) King had intentionally taken the quantity of pills. "At this time it is unknown whose writing this letter was in, however, wording on the letter led me to believe that King had intentionally taken the quantity of pills," Officer Martin Webb wrote in his report.
