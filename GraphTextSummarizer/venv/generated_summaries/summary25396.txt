Let it be for the good of Mexico," Pena Nieto said in a tweet directed at Vazquez Mota after the National Action Party selected her on Sunday. Vazquez Mota told supporters Sunday that she is confident and ready to face off against Enrique Pena Nieto, whose Institutional Revolutionary Party ruled Mexico for seven decades, until 2000. Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, a former mayor of Mexico City who lost the presidency in a disputed vote in 2006, is vying for the job once again as a candidate for the leftist Democratic Revolution Party. In a January poll by Mexico's Consulta Mitofsky, 41 percent of voters backed Pena Nieto, 23 percent supported Vazquez Mota and 18 percent supported Lopez Obrador. She has emphasized her desire to be Mexico's first female president, and pointed to her qualifications for the job.
