About eight years ago they began running a series of studies on babies under 24 months to see how much these babies understand about good and bad behavior. Show a baby an example of good behavior, and then an example of bad behavior, then let the baby decide what she likes. The Baby Lab has developed a series of studies based on the simple premise that babies have this simple understanding of good and bad. Dr. Karen Wynn runs the Baby Lab, and she and her team have been studying the minds and behaviors of babies for decades. The team at the Baby Lab has been very careful in their studies to change the puppets, shirt colors and placement of the animals before presenting them to various babies, and they feel confident their published research is sound.
