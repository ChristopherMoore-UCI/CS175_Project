"The AUA does not have data showing any link between March Madness and an increase in the number of vasectomies performed," the AUA said in a statement to CNN. Urologists recommend vasectomy couch potatoes wait a week before they become romantic but offer a warning when they rediscover their inner Austin Powers.
