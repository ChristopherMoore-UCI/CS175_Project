From there I started DJ'ing at clubs in the tri-state area, from New Jersey to New York to Connecticut, and eventually also in Atlanta and Chicago. My mother and I were told that I had significant hearing loss and that the hearing I had left was not guaranteed to stay. When I began attending public school, I didn't understand how the severity of my hearing loss would affect me; neither did my parents or my teachers. I ended up losing full hearing in my right ear and 80% hearing in my left. I was born in the United Kingdom, then moved to Portugal, Venezuela and eventually New Jersey.
