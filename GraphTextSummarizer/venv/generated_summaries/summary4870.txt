The homemade bombs were planted inside a garbage container and attached to a bicycle at Karachi's Haidari Market, said government official Roshan Ali Sheikh and Iqbal Kazmi, a spokesman for the city's emergency rescue crews. Officials say there is no indication that the blasts were connected to recent protests against the U.S.-made anti-Islam film that has drawn condemnation around the world. -- At least six people, including a child, were killed in back-to-back explosions Tuesday at a busy market in Karachi, Pakistan, government officials said. Karachi has long been the scene of deadly turf wars fueled by ethnic and political rivalries. Haidari Market is about a 40-minute drive from the U.S. Consulate in Karachi.
