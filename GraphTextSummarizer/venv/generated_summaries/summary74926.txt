Jonathan Roth was arrested by state police last week and faces charges of insurance fraud, conspiracy to commit insurance fraud, and filing a false report, the district attorney's office said. Roth's wife, Evana, said she believes her husband and son conspired to fake his death in order to receive life insurance payments after Roth was fired from his job last month. Davis added that Raymond Roth was treated at a hospital for two weeks after he reappeared for "acting erratically" and for potential self-endangerment Evana Roth said during the news conference last week that she was "disgusted ... angry. After an extensive search lasting several days, New York State Park Police said, authorities learned that Roth was not "drowned and dead," but had instead been pulled over for a speeding violation while driving in South Carolina. Evana Roth revealed the e-mail during a news conference last week, and police later confirmed it.
