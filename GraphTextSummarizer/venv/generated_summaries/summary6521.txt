"The Tree of Life" is open in limited release in New York and Los Angeles, with wide release on July 8. Let's get the things we already know about the ambitious film out of the way first: It stars Brad Pitt as a stern but ultimately disappointed father of three boys in 1950s Texas, Jessica Chastain as his luminescent wife and Sean Penn as one of their grown-up sons many years later; there is little in the way of linear narrative or dialogue outside of breathy voiceovers contemplating the existence and disposition of God; there are lengthy sequences of volcanoes erupting, cells dividing and many other awe-inspiring natural phenomena that recall both "Nova" and "2001: Or, as the film's stars put it at a press conference in Cannes: "It's like (Malick) is waiting with a butterfly net to catch what was going by that day," Pitt said. In a move that rankled many at Cannes, Malick declined to do any press and was only on hand unexpectedly and briefly at the Palais to premiere the film. He juxtaposes explosive imagery and a soaring operatic score with smaller, tender moments like natural light shining through blades of grass and a baby's first steps to create the complete mood and mosaic of "The Tree of Life."
