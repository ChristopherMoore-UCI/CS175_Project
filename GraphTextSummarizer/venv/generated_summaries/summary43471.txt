In an e-mail to CNN, Google said it received reports of problems with Google services from users in West Virginia, North Carolina, Nebraska and Georgia. Among the services affected were Gmail, Google Plus, Google Drive and YouTube. Others were stunned that Google, a foundation of the Internet for many users, could be shut down. Reports of outages began by 9:30 a.m. ET and quickly spread on Twitter, with users asking if the problem was affecting others as well. The outage drove some users to rival search engine Bing, while prompting jokes on Twitter about the apocalypse.
