the first attempt at a live TV musical production in almost 50 years -- while a few more have tweeted their hope that the intense criticism of the production won't stop NBC or other major broadcast networks from giving live theater in primetime another try. "It's that she doesn't know how to use that voice to sing in character, or what to do with her face when she's trying." Even though it's been repeated that NBC was re-creating the stage version of "Sound of Music," rather than the beloved 1965 film starring Julie Andrews, the comparisons between the TV musical and the movie were inevitable. Critics have commended country star Underwood for attempting live theater without acting experience, but they haven't been able to ignore the result.
