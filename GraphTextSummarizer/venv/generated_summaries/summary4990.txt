But because tugboats go slower than ships sailing at their normal speeds, that same trip was expected to take seven to 10 hours, said Gulliksen, the Carnival spokesman. Even once the ship docked, Carnival officials said it would take four to five hours to get everyone off, which will likely seem like an eternity to those waiting to see loved ones. Additionally, a ship-to-ship transfer at sea would be considered too risky," he said. It provided easier re-entry for passengers and crew, particularly for the roughly 900 guests on board traveling without passports, Carnival said. We have a huge team involving multiple departments working around the clock to get our guests home as quickly as possible," Carnival said on its Facebook page.
