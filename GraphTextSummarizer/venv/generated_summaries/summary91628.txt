According to a grand jury report, Paterno back in 2002 was informed by a grad assistant that he had seen former Penn State football coach Jerry Sandusky naked and forcing a boy who appeared to be about 10-years-old to have anal sex in the showers of the school's sports complex. And through all those college scandal headlines -- paying players, inflating SAT scores, falsifying classroom grades -- I have held Penn State up as a shining example of all that is good and right and pure about college sports. This year, Penn State tied with Stanford for the top graduation success rate among teams ranked in the October 30 Bowl Championship Series and AP Top 25 rankings, according to the NCAA. Those words still give me goosebumps nearly 20 years after I left State College, Pennsylvania, lovingly called Happy Valley. That is the only real alternative after the shocking allegations that Jerry Sandusky, 67 -- a former assistant coach who worked with the program for more than 30 years and who was viewed by many as Paterno's heir before he retired in 1999 -- has been charged with multiple felonies in the alleged sexual abuse of eight boys during a 15-year period.
