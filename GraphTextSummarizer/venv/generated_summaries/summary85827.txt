Ramsey began developing the Delancey Underground project (named after the old New York street under which the park is planned) after persuading the local transport authorities to give him, and co-founder Dan Barasch, a guided tour of its derelict carriage terminal. "In the end, we will have to compete with other proposals, which will no doubt offer compelling commercial arguments for things like a car-parking lot or shopping mall," said Ramsey, who plans to finance the entire initiative through private funding and donations. "Effectively, we'd gather an image of the sky and sun at street level and distribute it underground," said James Ramsey, former NASA satellite engineer-turned-architect and the brains behind the idea. Ramsey and Barasch's romantic vision includes a polished, undulating ceiling plane from which the "remote skylights" -- developed by Ramsay to filter out harmful ultraviolet and infrared light frequencies -- will flood the park with sunrays all year-round, night and day. "Sixty years of accumulated filth aside, I was struck by the beautiful historic qualities of the space -- with its cobblestone floors, original footway tiles and high-vaulted arched ceiling," recalled Ramsey.
