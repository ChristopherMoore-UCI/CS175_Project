The two, who will contest the Ballon d'Or in Switzerland on Monday, are also up against Germany's World Cup winning captain Manuel Neuer. Brazil and Barcelona star Neymar is one notable absentee from the top 10, he finished just one place outside ahead of Manchester United's Angel di Maria, Bayern Munich's Mario Gotze and 2014  World Cup star James Rodriguez. It also takes into account levels of performance, characteristics and results achieved at both club and international level. According to the Football Observatory, which is part of the International Centre for Sports Studies, Messi leads the way ahead of Real Madrid star and principal rival Cristiano Ronaldo. There may be a constant argument over which player is the best in the world -- but there's no doubting which boasts the highest transfer fee.
