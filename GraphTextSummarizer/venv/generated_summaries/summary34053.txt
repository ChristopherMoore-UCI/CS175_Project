Denmark: The link between gangs and extremism Soei has an unusual insight into the background of a young man he said was living on the fringes of society for years. "It was an environment with a lot of gang wars where you couldn't move around freely," Soei said. The sociologist met El-Hussein and other members of a Copenhagen gang called "Brothers" in 2011, a time when rivalry between gangs was intense. Two weeks after leaving prison, he carried out the shootings at the Krudttoenden Cafe, which was hosting a free-speech forum involving Prophet Mohammed cartoonist Lars Vilks, and the synagogue. Authorities said he was "well-known by the police for several criminal incidents," including weapons violations and violence, and that he was "known in connection to gangs."
