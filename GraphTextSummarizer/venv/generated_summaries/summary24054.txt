Nine people were carrying Afghan passports, Anadolu quoted Turkey's Transport Minister Lutfi Elvan as saying. The Bosphorus is a strait that runs through the city of Istanbul, dividing Turkey's Asian and European shores and linking the Sea of Marmara to the Black Sea. A local fisherman told Anadolu the dead and survivors had been wearing life jackets. Twelve children were among 43 people on board the boat, which sank in the far north of the Bosphorus, near the Black Sea, Anadolu reported. "Search and rescue operations are underway to find unaccounted people," Elvan said.
