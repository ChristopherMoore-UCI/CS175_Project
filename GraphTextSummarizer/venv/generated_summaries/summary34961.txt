She knows better now thanks to her involvement with activist group SPARK Movement, which is putting women on the map, with a little help from Google. The encounter led to talks about another SPARK project on representation of women and people of color in parks, monuments and public spaces -- "all the places outside a school textbook where we learn about who's important in the world," SPARK Executive Director Dana Edell said. " The initiative started in 2013 when SPARK approached Google with data showing that women and people of color were underrepresented in the popular doodles featured on its search homepage. After all, SPARK's vision fit into Field Trip's goal to help people "discover the stories around them," said Google's Yennie Solheim Fuller, who worked with SPARK. Through this project and other SPARK initiatives, she hopes to change that.
