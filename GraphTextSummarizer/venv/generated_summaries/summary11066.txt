But how greatly it will be involved in Syria under Sheikh Tamim "is the big question," said Ingram, since Qatar has already started to pull back on that front and let Saudi Arabia take a lead. The transfer of power is unlikely to lead to major policy changes, at least initially, said Ingram, since Sheikh Hamad would have been unlikely to hand it over unless his son was "capable and willing to take Qatar down a broadly similar path." But Ingram predicts that Sheikh Tamim is likely to focus more on domestic issues than Qatar's international role to start with. While the timing of the handover was unexpected, Sheikh Tamim has been heir apparent for the past decade and was appointed deputy commander-in-chief of Qatar's armed forces. Sheikh Tamim was involved in the bid to bring the tournament to Qatar, as well as heading his country's Olympic Committee since 2000.
