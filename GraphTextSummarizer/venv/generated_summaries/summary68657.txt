Wake County is a booming school system with unprecedented growth that often requires the students to attend different schools, Evans said. Currently 85 percent of the system's 143,000 students attend a school within five miles of their home, said system spokesman Michael Evans. "You have in your hands the future of 140,000 young people ... you know educationally, legally and morally your policy changes are wrong." Another minister, David Forbes, also spoke at the rally, saying, "'Neighborhood schools' is a trick word to re-segregate a city that worked hard to bring about a progressive new possibility. Tuesday's meeting agenda did not address the issue, but it was raised by speakers during public comment, Evans said. "This board cannot and will not permit these distractions to divert our attention away from our priority, and that is of increased achievement for all students," school board chairman Ron Margiotta has said.
