Iran's new President Hassan Rouhani took the oath of office Sunday, replacing controversial President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Then, in April 2006, to a crowd of dignitaries, Ahmadinejad announced that "Iran has joined countries with nuclear technology" -- sparking the conflict that continues to this day. If Khamenei is willing to end international pressure over Iran's nuclear program, Rouhani provides the perfect opportunity." Iran insists its nuclear program is purely for civilian nuclear energy. The White House congratulated Rouhani, and in a statement called his inauguration "an opportunity" for Iran to "resolve the international community's deep concerns over Iran's nuclear program."
