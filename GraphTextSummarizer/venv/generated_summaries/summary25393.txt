A Marine official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the victim was based at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina, and that the alleged attacker is stationed at the Marine Barracks. The Marine Barracks, located in southeast Washington D.C., is the residence of Marines stationed there who serve as guards at the White House and other locations. "Information uncovered during the course of the preliminary investigation indicates that there was a verbal exchange, and during the exchange a homophobic slur was heard from the suspect prior to the stabbing," Washington's Metropolitan Police Department said in a statement. -- A U.S. Marine allegedly stabbed another Marine to death after a bar fight early Saturday morning across the street from the Marine Barracks in the nation's capital, police said. Two Marine guards on duty outside the Marine Barracks saw the fight and moved in to break it up.
