Nuance is releasing the SDK for Nina today, and the company says the first crop of apps incorporating the service should arrive in the fall. Nuance, which works with Apple on voice control, now plans to take Siri-like abilities to more apps. Nuance says it's the first voice assistant with an SDK (Siri still doesn't have one), and Nina obviously has access to all of Nuance's data on the industries that use its tech: banks, airlines, hotels, retailers and more. The product is called Nina, and it'll let businesses build voice capabilities right into their apps -- iOS or Android -- via a software development kit (SDK).
