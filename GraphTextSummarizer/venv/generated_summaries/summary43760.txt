The forgotten history of "American History X" Before director Tony Kaye embarked on his first feature film, 1997's "American History X," he'd already been declared a genius of the advertising world. During a period of unemployment in the mid-1980s, Kaye ran a full-page ad in London's "Evening Standard" proclaiming, "Tony Kaye is the Greatest English Director Since Hitchcock." An up-and-coming genius in his own right, Bakshi was looking to make an animated movie for adults, and Fritz seemed like perfect source material. Yet in spite of Kaye's insistence that the movie was horrible, "American History X" went on to garner terrific reviews -- not to mention a Best Actor Oscar nomination for Edward Norton. To avoid making a choice, Crumb left the decision up to his wife, who thought both the film and the immediate paycheck were good ideas.
