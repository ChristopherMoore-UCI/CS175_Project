For me, of course I do it for business, but also because my husband experienced bad things due to operations in North Korea, I feel like it's my duty to continue this business to ensure his death does not go to waste. Is the South Korean government supportive of Hyundai groups operations and interests in North Korea? He said he hopes the North and South Korean government can talk things through so to have a lot of South Korean companies enter the North, and he also said that since they have the natural resources and the South has the skills to sell, if both sides work together he expects the North and South to prosper. Hyun traveled to North Korea in August to secure the release of a Hyundai worker who was detained on accusations he insulted the government. Subsidiary Hyundai Asan has led efforts to build economic ties between the North and South, so Hyun is not only managing a multinational through a recession but also through global tensions over the North's nuclear program.
