-- Investigators only recently were told that a natural gas pipeline that ruptured last year in San Bruno, California, killing eight people, had a leak more than 20 years before, federal officials said Wednesday. Hersman, who said the recent discovery of the PG&E document raises questions about its ability to conduct proper risk assessments, met Wednesday with several affected families. The initiative is partly a response to a series of deadly pipeline explosions, including the one in San Bruno. It made several recommendations in January, and announced three more Wednesday. "We are glad to see it," Hersman said of the document on the 1988 incident nine miles away from San Bruno, "but we expected to see it sooner."
