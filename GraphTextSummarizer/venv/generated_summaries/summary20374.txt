-- President Obama said Wednesday he told government lawyers to object to a court-ordered release of additional images showing alleged abuse of detainees because the release could affect the safety of U.S. troops and "inflame anti-American opinion." President Obama discusses the alleged prisoner abuse photos at the White House on Wednesday. Releasing the photos could have a "chilling effect" on further investigations of detainee abuse without adding to the understanding of past abuses, he said. "The disclosure of these photographs serves as a further reminder that abuse of prisoners in U.S.-administered detention centers was systemic," ACLU National Security Project Director Jameel Jaffer said before Obama's decision. The publication of the photos would not add any additional benefit to investigations being carried out into detainee abuse -- and could put future inquires at risk. More than 400 people, Whitman said, have been disciplined based on investigations involving alleged detainee abuse.
