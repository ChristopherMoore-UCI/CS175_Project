-- Zlatan Ibrahimovic upstaged Lionel Messi as Barcelona edged past lowly Osasuna with a 2-0 victory to go top of Spain's La Liga. The result takes Barcelona three points clear of rivals Real Madrid at the top of the league but Real can regain first place if they beat Getafe on Thursday. In Italy, league leaders Inter Milan moved four points clear at the top of the table after a 3-0 win over Livorno. Valeri Bojinov got the only goal of the game before Milan's Andrea Pirlo was sent off. Elsewhere, Valencia moved clear in fourth after David Villa's goal was enough to see off Malaga.
