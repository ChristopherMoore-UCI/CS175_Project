To be sure, the presence of large Russian and offshore funds in Cypriot banks is cause for a different format than those used in other peripheral countries. At all levels, for depositors, future foreign investors and Eurozone policy, the decision on tiny Cyprus is going to have huge ramifications. In the past few hours, I've spoken to bank CEOs and top economists. There were more sophisticated and rapier like ways to achieve the same goal, taxing deposits under â‚¬100,000 at over 6% is effectively punishing the Cypriot people. Cypriots are already going to feel the ferocity from the effects of a recession caused by lower wages and high unemployment,  they do not need the additional confiscatory measures of their deposits being taken.
