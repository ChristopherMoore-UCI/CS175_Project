Laredo's International Bridge I is one of four that connect the two cities, but because it has the lowest elevation it was closed, said Laredo spokeswoman Xochitl Mora Garcia. -- Two international bridges between Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, and Laredo, Texas, were closed Wednesday because of rising water on the Rio Grande, Laredo officials said. Water service in Laredo will not be affected, but residents in Nuevo Laredo may have water service at 50 percent of the city's operating capacity, Laredo officials said. Laredo owns and operates the four bridges, Mora Garcia said. It will take about a day to remove the canopies at International Bridge I and another day to reinstall them after the high waters subside, Mora Garcia said.
