" Christine Levinson released a computer-enhanced photograph showing what the family thinks Bob Levinson may look like today. Nelson and Rep. Robert Wexler, D-Florida, have said they plan to introduce legislation in their respective chambers calling on Iran to cooperate with the United States and come up with information about Levinson. "We reiterate our commitment to determining Mr. Levinson's welfare and whereabouts, and reuniting him with his family," acting State Department spokesman Robert Wood said in a statement on Sunday. Levinson disappeared during a business trip to Iran's Kish Island in 2007. In December 2007, Levinson's wife and other relatives traveled to Iran and met with officials.
