Nina Osegueda was 19 years old, 5 feet tall and around 180 pounds when she remembers her boyfriend saying the thing no boyfriend is supposed to say: "You know, you'd look better if you lost weight. He told her his mom had lost a bunch of weight on the high-protein, low-carbohydrate Atkins Diet. Convenience store junk food, meals at McDonald's, big family dinners heavy on pasta, rice and bread, and doughnuts on Saturdays before soccer games or swim meets. "I might never be the skinny Barbie-doll figure I had in mind, but neither would I allow myself to fall into bad habits that would make me think less of myself. "He was the tall, blonde, skinny type of guy who had no idea what it was like to be a short, Latina, chubby teenage girl," Osegueda wrote on CNN iReport.
