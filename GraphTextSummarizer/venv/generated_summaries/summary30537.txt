After the U.S. military withdrawal, sectarianism began to re-emerge with a vengeance, plus al Qaeda in Iraq and various other groups are trying to re-establish themselves and there is fallout from what's happening in neighboring Syria. Those tribes feel they are being oppressed by Shias whether it's the government in Iraq or the Alawite sect of Shia to which Syria's President Bashar al-Assad belongs. Additionally, Iraqi security forces are viewed by some as abusing their power; viewed not as a national force protecting the country but as a force protecting the Shia government. There have been long tribal ties between Iraq's Sunni heartland and tribes in Syria. At the same time Iraq's Sunni population has its own legitimate reasons for demonstrating against the government which have nothing to do with what is happening in Syria.
