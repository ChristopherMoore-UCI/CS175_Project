Edberg spent a couple of days with Federer in Dubai earlier this month and his hiring follows a recent trend, started when reigning Wimbledon champion Andy Murray took on Ivan Lendl before the start of the 2012 season. The 32-year-old Swiss announced the move on Facebook, revealing that Swede Edberg will join the team for the first grand slam of 2014 in Australia next month. Roger Federer has become the latest tennis star to turn to a former legend for help with the 17-time grand slam champion adding his "childhood hero" Stefan Edberg to his coaching team for the upcoming season. "I am happy to announce that beginning in Melbourne, Stefan Edberg will join Severin Luthi on my coaching team," Federer posted. But Swiss Davis Cup captain Luthi has remained in the fold and told Federer's official website that he was looking forward to working alongside Edberg.
