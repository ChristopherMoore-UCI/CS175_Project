In what's become a White House tradition, Obama hosted immigrants who signed up to serve in the military, or whose spouses enlisted, and watched as they were sworn in as American citizens. That measure has stalled in the Republican-controlled House, leading Obama this week to announce he was planning to take executive action to make some changes on his own. "I'm going to keep doing everything I can do to keep making our immigration system smarter and more efficient so hardworking men and women like all of you have the opportunity to join the American family and to serve our great nation," Obama said during the naturalization ceremony on Friday. -- President Barack Obama sought to put a human face on the heated political debate over immigration on Friday when he oversaw a naturalization ceremony for members of the military. Immigration debate Friday's event, however, comes amid a fiery debate among lawmakers over immigration reform and border security, spurred in part by an influx of immigrant children arriving in the United States without their parents.
