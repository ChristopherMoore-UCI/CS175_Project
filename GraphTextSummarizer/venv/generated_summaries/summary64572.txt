Arsenal and Manchester City, the two title rivals in action Saturday, displayed opposing tactics as both recorded victories. Although Cardiff pulled back a surprise equaliser thanks to Craig Noone, City were undeterred and Jesus Navas soon nosed them back in front. Our defenders deserve credit." Anxious Arsenal fans had to wait for the London club to beat rivals Fulham and hang onto their English Premier League lead by a single point from City. Edin Dzeko scored City's 100th goal of the season -- a neat feat so early in the campaign -- as he opened the scoring with 14 minutes on the clock.
