Traditionally, drug companies have not been allowed to use so-called "compassionate use" patients like Josh as study subjects, so helping them out has been pure charity work on behalf of the drug company. Josh received doses of the drug brincidofovir Wednesday, Saturday, and Tuesday, and tests showed the level of adenovirus in his blood went down from 250,000 copies per milliliter to 367 copies per milliliter. But after reports by CNN and intense pressure from social media, Chimerix and the Food and Drug Administration came up with a plan to get the medicine to Josh and other patients who request it. After just three doses of an experimental drug, Josh Hardy -- whose parents had to launch a media campaign to get him the medicine -- is sitting up, doing homework and playing board games with his brothers, his mother said. Now that Josh is taking brincidofovir, he's no longer taking the other drug that hurt his kidneys, but the damage was done: His kidneys still aren't working and he has to undergo dialysis three times a week.
