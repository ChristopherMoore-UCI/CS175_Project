There is a satisfaction in learning to recognize the different types of cloud, from the fair-weather cumulus to the high, wispy cirrus, the fierce cumulonimbus storm cloud and the many other rare, unusual and fleeting cloud forms. Scientists still don't understand enough about the formation of clouds to predict with confidence how cloud cover will be affected by changing atmospheric conditions. It exists to remind people that, far from being things to complain about, clouds are among of the most diverse, evocative, and poetic parts of nature. Kids are often entranced by clouds. As we grow up, we start to moan about clouds.
