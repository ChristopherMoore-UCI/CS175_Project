"It's one of the Ugly Five," says Amos, our captain and guide on an afternoon safari cruise at Moremi Game Reserve in Botswana's Okavango River Delta. The stork also goes by the name of the "undertaker bird" in recognition of the grim but important role it plays in the Delta -- reducing diseases and cleaning up the ecosystem by devouring rotten carcasses. During an afternoon heading out from the Delta's Moremi Crossing resort in a mokoro dug-out canoe, we cross paths with the last of the Ugly Five: wildebeest. The list runs like a cast call for the "Lion King's" least majestic animals: marabou stork, hyena, vulture, wildebeest and warthog. "They can grow up to five feet long," says Amos as we get close enough to see the scabby-looking beak of one these large birds.
