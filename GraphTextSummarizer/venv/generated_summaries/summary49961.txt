City suffered a relative lull in form in January with key players injured, suspended and away on international duty, but this month has brought three league wins and a two-leg double over Europa League champions Porto of Portugal to reach the last 16 of the continent's second-tier competition. The former City captain ended his three-month exile last week and apologized for his absence without leave, but is lacking match fitness. Strike partner Sergio Aguero doubled the lead seven minutes after halftime with his 16th league score, pouncing after Blackburn keeper Paul Robinson failed to deal with a corner from David Silva, who was also involved in the first goal. However, the Blues bounced back from the Champions League defeat at Napoli on Tuesday to earn a first victory in six games in all competitions. Lampard, whose European omission along with other key players prompted Abramovich to interrogate Villas-Boas about his tactics, made the veteran England international the first player to reach double figures in the Premier League nine seasons in a row.
