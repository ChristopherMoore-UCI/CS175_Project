I am disappointed that I have reached this point and will not put myself in this situation again." Roethlisberger, who led the Steelers to Super Bowl titles in 2006 and 2009, faced the threat of criminal charges after a woman accused him of raping her in a Milledgeville, Georgia, bar during a night of drinking in March. -- Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger said Monday he won't appeal the six-game suspension imposed by the National Football League and apologized to his teammates and fans for a night out that left him under a Georgia prosecutor's microscope. The 28-year-old quarterback owns a home at a lake near Milledgeville, Georgia, about 115 miles southeast of Atlanta. But NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell slapped the quarterback with a six-game suspension for "conduct detrimental to the NFL" last week, ordering him to undergo a "comprehensive behavioral evaluation by medical professionals," follow their recommendations and "avoid situations that can cause legal or other problems. In his statement, Roethlisberger said the suspension imposed last week "speaks clearly that more is expected of me," and he promised to "make the necessary improvements" in his behavior.
