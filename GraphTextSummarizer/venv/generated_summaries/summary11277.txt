The VA must now ask: What does the evidence in other health care systems tell us about how to efficiently meet the needs of veterans, while strengthening the quality of care and VA health system itself? A nationally representative survey of veterans accessing the VA health care system should be conducted immediately to fully understand the depth and breadth of the problems they have faced beyond long waiting periods for their appointments. Improve the systems: We must continue to modernize the VA system through technology and data-driven approaches that demand results and make evaluation possible. I am glad the VA was spared from sequestration cuts, as the VA has, despite funding increases, a classic problem of supply and demand. For thousands of veterans in this country -- and those returning home from more than a decade at war -- the stakes could not be higher.
