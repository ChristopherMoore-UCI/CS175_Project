In 1938, she, her mother, her sister and her sister's husband fled Austria, said Peter Last, a Jewish collectible coin and banknote wholesaler who lived on East 32nd Street and befriended Fischer 20 years ago, when she lived a block away. Last said that, throughout the years he knew Fischer, she lived on East 31st Street in a 10th-floor, sparsely furnished one-bedroom apartment in a building for senior citizens. Fischer, who was in her mid-70s when Last met her in the late 1980s, gave the impression that she was just scraping by, he said. " Fischer asked Last to serve as executor and he agreed. Last said Fischer had told him she had no relatives, but he discovered after her death that she had not been truthful.
