According to reports from the state Department of Social Services, case workers had expressed concerns about the children in the past, as early as 2011, but the most recurring complaint was that the Jones' house was a mess. -- South Carolina social workers were familiar with Timothy Jones Jr. long before police accused him of killing his five children and dumping them off a dirt road in Alabama, according to documents from the state Department of Social Services. Jones, 32, was arrested Saturday in Smith County, Mississippi, and charged with driving under the influence, possession of synthetic marijuana and possession of drug paraphernalia, the Lexington County Sheriff's Department in South Carolina said. Renewed DSS interest Four months ago, a South Carolina DSS case manager spoke to one of the children, who said Jones made them do exercises for punishment. Three days later, Jones led Lexington County and federal authorities to five sets of remains near Oak Hill, Alabama.
