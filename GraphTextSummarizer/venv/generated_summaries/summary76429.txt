According to the New York Times, which first reported news of the group's creation, McConnell and his allies have conceived of the group as an answer to the Senate Majority PAC, the Democratic super PAC launched by operatives with ties to Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid that engaged heavily in Senate races this past cycle. Senate Leadership Fund will aim to pick up some of the slack at the Senate level, and will coordinate messaging, media buys and fundraising with American Crossroads. Republican operatives linked to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have launched a new super PAC focused on keeping the Senate in GOP hands in 2016, when they'll face a much tougher map and a political climate that favors Democrats. American Crossroads will also be heavily engaged in the GOP presidential general election fight, and Republicans will have 24 seats to defend in 2016 — far more than the 10 Democrats must defend, and many in blue-leaning or purple states that are more favorable to Democrats in a presidential year. The source said the group will operate largely in general election and open-seat primary battles, but may also engage in defense of incumbents facing primary challenges.
