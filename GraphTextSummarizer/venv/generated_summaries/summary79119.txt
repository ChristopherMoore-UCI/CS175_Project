Dr. White said that after reviewing the reports, evidence and analysis from investigators in Jackson's death he was not convinced Dr. Murray was responsible. Dr. Robert Waldmon was called by the defense in an effort to show Jackson's insomnia the day he died could have been caused by withdrawal from Demerol shots he was given along with botox injections, treatments that Dr. Murray didn't know about. Murray was unaware of the addiction, and therefore unable to understand why he could not help Jackson sleep, the defense contends. The defense contends Jackson became addicted to the painkiller Demerol through frequent visits to the Beverly Hills dermatology clinic of Dr. Arnold Klein in the months before his death. Jackson's personal assistant, Michael Emir WIlliams, testified earlier that Jackson's visits to Dr. Klein were "very regular" in his last months of life.
