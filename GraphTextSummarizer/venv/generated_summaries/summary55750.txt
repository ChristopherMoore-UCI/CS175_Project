But she decided to keep posting the picture and to take pictures of other members of the military who request the same picture with their babies and the flag. Navy veteran Vanessa Hicks, a Virginia Beach photographer whose website is filled with sweet images of babies and their parents, shot the picture of the sailor and his baby and posted it to her Facebook page. Clearly the military member loves his country and baby. "I do believe that this picture right here shows what it means to be an American," Hicks told CNN affiliate WTKR."That flag, the uniform, that baby -- exactly what every service member is out there fighting. It's a striking image: a new baby cradled in the American flag, held by a Navy sailor whose face we can't see.
