Iraqi dependence on Iran is bound to grow now that the Americans -- who had tended to favor the Shia over the Sunni in Iraq -- have departed the shores. Iran is now Iraq's second largest trading partner after Turkey, which has a near monopoly on trade with Iraqi Kurdistan. While the major Shia parties in Iraq -- the Dawa Party, the Sadrists, and the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq -- are not Iranian creations per se, all of them are beholden to Iran in multiple ways. -- Iraq is on the edge of the precipice as a consequence of the standoff between Shia Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki and Sunni Vice President Tariq al-Hashimi, with the former accusing the latter of engaging in terrorism and the latter accusing the former of dictatorial ambitions. What the American invasion ended up doing was creating unprecedented sectarian strife and totally debilitating Iraqi capabilities, thus tilting the regional balance of power in the energy-rich Persian Gulf substantially in favor of Iran.
