Oklahoma City Mayor Mick Cornett said that another is that there's no one, clear path toward emotional recovery from such a traumatic event. Meanwhile, Acting National Police Chief Sveinung Sponheim said that although only one man had been arrested as of Saturday, Norwegian police have yet to determine definitely that only a single person was responsible for both of the Norwegian attacks. The suspect in the bombing and mass shooting in Norway conceded the terrorist attacks in that nation were "horrible," but "in his head (they) were necessary," a man who identified himself as the suspect's lawyer told Norwegian broadcaster TV2. The fact the Norwegian suspect doesn't look the part of a terrorist, especially in an age marked by threats and strikes by members of the Islamic fundamentalist group al Qaeda, doesn't surprise Watkins. Anders Behring Breivik, who Norwegian media have identified as the first and then only person detained in the more recent attack, appears to fit the role of a quintessential Norwegian.
