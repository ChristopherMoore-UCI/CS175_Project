Sharapova has battled shoulder injuries throughout her career and underwent major surgery in October 2008. But at Wimbledon she lost in the second round to qualifier Michelle Larcher de Brito before injury problems struck again. Last year's tournament was played to capacity crowds in the Sinan Erdem Dome and Sharapova progressed to the final where she was beaten in straight sets by current No.1 Serena Williams. They join Williams, Victoria Azarenka, Agnieszka Radwanska and Li Na in the $6 million event with one place still to be decided. "The fans in Istanbul have welcomed us each year with such intense passion and warmth, I will sincerely miss the energy and excitement they brought to the year-end tournament."
