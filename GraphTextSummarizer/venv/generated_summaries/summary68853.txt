Female service members sue U.S. military for alleged rape, sexual assault Last fall, I introduced bipartisan legislation that would create a path to justice for service men and women who are victims of rape or sexual assault. It is clear that the inherent conflicts within the chain of command structure are at the core of the epidemic of military rape and sexual assault. These disturbing statistics illustrate an ongoing epidemic of rape and sexual assault in the military that Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta believes amounted to 19,000 incidents just in 2010. One of the instructors is charged with having sexual contact with 10 women, including sodomy and rape.
