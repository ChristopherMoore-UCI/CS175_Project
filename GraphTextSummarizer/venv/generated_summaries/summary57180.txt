Chaco is jointly owned by Pan American Energy and the Bolivian Pension Fund, each with a 50 percent stake, BP spokesman David Nicholas said from Great Britain. -- Bolivian President Evo Morales nationalized the Chaco petroleum company Friday, taking over the BP subsidiary with the military on standby. BP owns 60 percent of Pan American Energy, and Bridas Corp. owns the other 40 percent, Nicholas said Nicholas declined comment on the nationalization. His actions Friday came less than 48 hours before Bolivians vote Sunday on a new constitution that would give the central government more power and control. Bolivian leader Evo Morales speaks before parliament Thursday in the capital, La Paz. "With this decree," Morales said in a nationally televised address from an oil field in Cochabamba, "we nationalize all the petroleum business in Chaco for all Bolivians."
