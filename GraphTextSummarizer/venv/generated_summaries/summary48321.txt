Some White fans misread the headline of a satirical story published by Empire News on Wednesday that said the 92-year-old actress "Dyes Peacefully In Her Los Angeles Home." Witjas is actually White's agent, but he told CNN that he never dished to the Empire News writer about his client's hair coloring. Witjas gave a real comment to CNN Thursday, saying White "will outlive us all. " The story included an alleged quote from White's agent, Jeff Witjas, saying that she "has been dying her own hair in her home for decades. "A little thankful that Betty white trending isn't because she had some photos hacked," @bdbdleeroybrown tweeted CNN's Carolyn Sung contributed to this report.
