Lee was with a CNN team traveling with anti-Gadhafi fighters and other journalists towards Sirte, where fierce fighting unfolded again Saturday. -- A Libyan revolutionary fighters' convoy came under attack Saturday on the outskirts of Sirte, the birthplace of Moammar Gadhafi, injuring a CNN journalist who was traveling with them. From a roundabout on the edge of the city, where revolutionaries have been amassing, the CNN team followed fighters heading north towards the sea to evacuate civilians, said CNN correspondent Phil Black, who was with Lee. The CNN journalists pulled back, rushing Lee to nearest field hospital, Black said. Two vehicles near the CNN team were hit by at least two RPGs.
