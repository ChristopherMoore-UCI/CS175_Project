For example, it just became a lot easier to access YouTube channels on your Xbox. Will this make you use YouTube channels more? Unlike parent company Google, which tends to roll out redesigns over a period of days, YouTube pressed the button and switched the homepage for every user worldwide at 4:30 p.m. ET Thursday.
