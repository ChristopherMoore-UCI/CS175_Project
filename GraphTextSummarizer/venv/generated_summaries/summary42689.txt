With 28,596 points, O'Neal is fifth on the all-time NBA scoring list and is second only to Michael Jordan on the all-time list of NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Awards. The former NBA player will graduate from Florida's Barry University on Saturday with a doctorate degree in education focusing on organizational learning and leadership. "For the past four-and-half years, O'Neal pursued his doctoral degree in education while juggling the roles of athlete, student and entrepreneur," Barry University said in a statement. The 7-foot-1 retired basketball star and NBA analyst is expected to be one of 1,100 students who will don graduation gowns at a ceremony in Miami, the school said. "He completed the requirements of the doctoral program while adhering to the grueling NBA schedule prior to his retirement last year as well as fulfilling commitments in broadcasting and business." O'Neal graduates with a 3.81 grade point average and he completed 16 courses mostly using satellite classrooms and video conferencing, the university said.
