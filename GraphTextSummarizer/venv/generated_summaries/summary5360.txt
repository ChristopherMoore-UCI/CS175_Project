In the other Champions League match, Manchester United overcame French side Marseille 2-1. With the clock ticking down, Samuel Eto'o slalomed through Bayern's defense, squaring for Pandev who shot powerfully into the top left hand corner, leveling the tie 3-3 on aggregate and sending Inter through on away goals. Despite taking an early lead through Samuel Eto'o, goals from Thomas Muller and Mario Gomez had put Bayern back in control. After holding the Red Devils to an impressive 0-0 draw at the Stade Velodrome in the first leg, Marseille rarely looked like scoring at Old Trafford following some wayward finishing, with French international Andre-Pierre Gignac and Souleymane Diawara particularly profligate. A late Wes Brown own goal gave Marseille some hope, but Manchester United held on to a deserved victory.
