Mohammad brokered the cease-fire in late February between the Pakistani government and his son-in-law, Maulana Fazlullah, who commands the Taliban in Swat Valley. In the months that followed, the Taliban seized control of the region and carried out a violent campaign against government officials, including local politicians. Critics of the cease-fire have called it a major concession by the Pakistani government in an attempt to hold off Taliban attacks. Last May, Pakistan's government announced it reached a peace deal with militants in Swat Valley. Pakistan's previous leader, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, reached a cease-fire deal with militants in South Waziristan in 2006 which was widely blamed for giving al Qaeda and the Taliban a stronger foothold in the region.
