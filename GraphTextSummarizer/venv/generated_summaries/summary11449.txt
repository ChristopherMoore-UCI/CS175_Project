The 29-year-old allegedly choreographed an attack intended to blind Bolshoi artistic director Sergei Filin, the man who put him in the roles of Ivan the Terrible and Swan Lake's evil genius. Police declared their case was solved this week with a confession by Dmitrichenko Russian police question suspect in Bolshoi director's acid attack "I organized this attack but not to the extent that it happened," he is heard saying in a video released by police. Dmitrichenko, who studied Filin's schedule, called Lipatov and Zarutsky when he saw Filin leave the theater on the cold night of January 17, police said. Ballet dancer Pavel Dmitrichenko, often cast as the villain in Bolshoi Ballet productions, is now the lead defendant in a plot worthy of a Tchaikovsky score. The trio of conspirators obtained battery acid at a car parts store, and made the acid stronger by evaporating the water from it, police said.
