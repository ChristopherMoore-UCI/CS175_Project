"There's a different social contract to how we communicate these days," said Dan Chastney, Qik's principal program manager. The company thinks that not saving everything will help some people loosen up and become more comfortable with asynchronous video conversations. They include Viber, WhatsApp, WeChat, Snapchat and Facebook Messenger, as well as traditional texts and instant message apps. Skype's video calls are still hugely popular, but mobile devices have upended how people communicate. "We didn't want people worrying about having to look perfect on camera or that a message recorded might be taken out of context later," Chastney said.
