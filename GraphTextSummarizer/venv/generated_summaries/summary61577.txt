Police have confirmed that one instance involves Makopo allegedly grabbing a girl by the throat and throwing her against a wall, but Winfrey also mentioned sexual abuse of the girls. Oprah Winfrey tells a Monday news conference how she found out about abuse charges and what she did. School authorities removed Makopo from the campus and notified police, Winfrey said, and set up an independent team of investigators "because my experience with child predators is that no one ever, ever abuses just one child. Indecent assault is defined in South Africa as touching the private parts of another person without consent; crimen injuria involves verbal abuse which violates the victim's dignity. " The remaining dorm matrons were removed because students were afraid of "repercussions," Winfrey said, and teachers were assigned to oversee the dorms.
