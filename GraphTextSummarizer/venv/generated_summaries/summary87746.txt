When Secretary of State Hillary Clinton greeted Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Geneva on Friday before sitting down to their working dinner, she presented him a small green box with a ribbon. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton laugh about their "reset' button. On the proposed missile defense system the United States is considering installing in Poland and the Czech Republic, one official said, "Minister Lavrov made it clear he had listened quite attentively to Secretary Clinton's comments about missile defense ... and I think it's got them thinking." "We are resetting, and because we are resetting, the minister and I have an overload of work." Asked by a Russian reporter whether he had pressed the button, Lavrov said that he and Clinton did, indeed. Lavrov was asked about Russian intentions to install S-300 missiles in Iran.
