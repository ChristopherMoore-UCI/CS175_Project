U.S. Apache helicopters struck ISIS targets in Iraq's Anbar province over the weekend in an effort to push back ISIS forces advancing near Falluja, a senior U.S. defense official said. Given ISIS advances, the official said, there will be more attacks against ISIS targets in Anbar, as well as in other contested areas such as along the Turkish border. But because Iraqi forces were close to ISIS forces, the Apaches were used because they fly low and can strike with precision, the official said. So far, the U.S. doesn't see ISIS making a direct run for Baghdad, but there is concern that ISIS elements are in the city and around the airport, the official said. But with ISIS forces in such a populated area, that precision was needed, the official said.
