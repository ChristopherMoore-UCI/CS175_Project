The Riley County Police Department received a report Tuesday that "Baby Lisa" may have been sighted in Manhattan, Kansas -- more 100 miles west of Kansas City. Authorities have obtained a search warrant for the home where a missing 11-month-old Missouri girl was reportedly last seen, Kansas City police said Tuesday. " Irwin said it's possible someone could have entered the house without Bradley hearing, as the couple's bedroom is on the opposite corner of the house from Lisa's room and Bradley sleeps with a fan at high speed. Authorities were able to "confirm that the child seen was not the child missing from Kansas City," police said. Lisa is described as being 30 inches tall with blue eyes and blond hair, according to police.
