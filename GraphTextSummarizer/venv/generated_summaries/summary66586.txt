In a holiday season set to feature big album releases from Taylor Swift, Nicki Minaj, Pink Floyd, Foo Fighters and possibly Kendrick Lamar, Adele's new LP was expected to be the marquee event and a dire shot in the arm for a music industry that has endured record low sales this year. Adele's '21' becomes first album to sell over 3 million digital copies The good news is that XL made $15 million net profit this year, but further down in the report, which the label sent to regulators today, they added this sobering note: "There will not be a further new release by Adele during 2014 and consequently there will be a fall in XL's turnover and profits. A financial report from Adele's label XL Recordings reveals that there are no plans to drop an album from the "Rolling in the Deep" singer in 2014. Adele's toddler son wins damages from paparazzi photos "21" sold more than 25 million copies worldwide, so the quiet revelation that 2014 will be Adele-less comes as an equally disappointing update to both XL's distributor Columbia Records and the singer's fans. XL will continue to achieve success with other artists.
