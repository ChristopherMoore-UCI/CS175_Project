"I want to apologize to the people of Portland for my dishonesty and for embarrassing them," Mayor Sam Adams, a Democrat, said at an afternoon news conference. "This was a serious error that happened about four years ago," Portland Mayor Sam Adams tells reporters. Adams said he had lied about the relationship during the campaign, and had asked Breedlove to lie, because of "untrue rumors being circulated saying that I had broken the law regarding sex relations with a minor." "The allegation coming at me was 'sex with a minor,' " Adams said. During the mayoral campaign, questions had emerged about whether Adams and Breedlove had a sexual relationship. Adams returned to Portland from Washington, where he had planned to attend the inauguration of President Barack Obama, to hold the news conference.
