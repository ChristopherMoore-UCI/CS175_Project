About targeting Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, about working in concert with Libyan rebels, about the risk of a military stalemate, Gates wouldn't bite, saying the future there is for the Libyans themselves to decide. At the end of his remarks before the assembled media, before a 50-minute closed-door meeting, Gates added that he looked forward to discussing the central -- but elusive -- element of U.S. peace proposals for Israel and the Palestinians, a two-state solution. " Gates offered his condolences to the families of the victims of the terror attack and those enduring the rocket attacks in southern Israel. Next stop for Gates, after a wild convoy ride through Israeli traffic, was the West Bank, and a reminder of how many administrations have tried and failed to nudge the sides toward Mideast peace. He arrived in Israel just after a bus stop bombing in Jerusalem and continuing rocket attacks in the south.
