At 66, Allen Sowell is 16 years older than his half-brother, and the two didn't meet until Anthony Sowell was 9. Her body was among the first identified in the home of Anthony Sowell, who is now facing five counts of aggravated murder, rape, felonious assault and kidnapping in connection with the deaths. Their stepmother, who lived in the house after Anthony Sowell got out of prison, said she knew of nothing odd going on at the time, Allen Sowell said. The stepmother tried to get Anthony Sowell evicted from the house in 2007 because he wasn't paying rent, Allen Sowell said. Sowell has been placed on a suicide watch at the request of his attorney, according to Sowell's public defender Kathleen DeMetz.
