The gym is owned by Army veteran who designs military-inspired workouts that Galloway thrives on. Four days later, on Christmas morning, Galloway woke in Walter Reed Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. Galloway continues to push himself harder and now competes in grueling races like the Warrior Dash and Tough Mudder, in which runners tackle an obstacle course. Galloway is passionate about leading other veterans to recovery and showing them what they can do instead of what they can't, but the most important people he hopes to inspire are much closer to home. Seeing his recovery as an opportunity to motivate others, he joined Team X-T.R.E.M.E.
