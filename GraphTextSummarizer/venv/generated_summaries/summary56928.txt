South Africa's ruling African National Congress party said the verdict last month clearly indicated "that South Africa as a country is governed by laws that are applied without any fear or favor to anyone, regardless of their standing. -- South Africa's former national police chief, Jackie Selebi, was sentenced Tuesday to 15 years in prison after he was found guilty of corruption charges last month. The charges stemmed from Selebi's relationship with convicted drug trafficker Glenn Agliotti -- a friendship that was no secret. SAPA reported that Agliotti, who was appearing in a nearby courtroom on murder charges, had no comment on Selebi's sentencing. " After a four-and-a-half-year trial, the court found Selebi gave favors to Agliotti in exchange for money and expensive clothes.
