Nearly 95,000 Water Balz (round shape), Growing Skulls (skull shape), H2O Orbs "Despicable Me" (round shape) and Fabulous Flowers (flower shape) toys were sold in stores in the United States and Canada from 2010 to November 2012. -- A toy that absorbs water and can expand to 400 times its original size has been voluntarily recalled after a report that a baby ingested one and needed surgery to remove it, the Consumer Product Safety Commission said Monday. The CPSC and Health Canada, along with the importer DuneCraft Inc., based in Cleveland, announced the voluntary recall on Monday. An 8-month-old Texas girl reportedly ingested a Water Balz last year and underwent surgery to remove the toy. The toys do not show up on an x-ray and require surgery to be removed, according to the commission.
