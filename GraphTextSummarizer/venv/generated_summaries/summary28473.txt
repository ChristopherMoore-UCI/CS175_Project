In the Univision interview, Romney also said that permanent immigration reform was "badly needed" and urged Republicans in Congress to pass legislation that will make "more transparent" the process by which illegal immigrants can obtain residency. It's no wonder that Romney — who, ironically, had a father who was born in Mexico and a record of supporting immigration reform as Massachusetts governor — became persona non grata with Hispanics. Republicans should think of passing immigration reform as an investment for the future. You're telling me that Romney is sounding like a grown-up when talking about immigration? In a recent interview with Univision, the Spanish-language television network, the former presidential candidate -- whom some suspect may be gearing up to run again in 2016 -- criticized President Obama's use of executive action to temporarily re-prioritize deportations.
