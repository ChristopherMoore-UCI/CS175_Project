Even now when he wanders around the lobby at Oregon's iconic Timberline Lodge, Kohnstamm, 47, sometimes flashes back to being a kid on a tricycle, winding his way around original furniture designed by Depression-era artisans. "The Forest Service is trying to address that." Jaqua, Larsen, Munro, Ingersoll and Kohnstamm have written about their love for the hotel in an upcoming book "Timberline Lodge: A Love Story -- Diamond Jubilee Edition," due out this fall. Options at the time included either burning it or dismantling it until Kohnstamm's father, R.L. Kohnstamm, entered the picture. The site for hundreds of guests' weddings over the years, Timberline was where Kohnstamm's own younger brother chose to tie the knot. Now listed on the National Register of Historic Places, Timberline came uncomfortably close to being destroyed before Kohnstamm's father began operating it in 1955.
