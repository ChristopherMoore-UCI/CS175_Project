The Beechcraft plane was returning from a sightseeing tour when it hit a mountain and broke into pieces about 12 kilometers (7 miles) from the airport, said police spokesman Binod Singh. "We had already seen the plane approaching the airport when the accident happened," said Purusottam Shakya, the chief of operations at Tribhuvan International Airport. -- Nineteen people aboard a small plane were killed Sunday when it crashed while trying to land at the airport in Kathmandu, police in Nepal said. Ten other passengers were Indian nationals; two were Americans and one was a Japanese national, officials said. Among the occupants onboard were two Americans, officials said.
