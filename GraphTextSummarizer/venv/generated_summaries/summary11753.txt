States tighten, loosen gun laws after Newtown "Our suit focuses on this abuse of process that has resulted in enacted law that does nothing to improve public safety, while resulting in adverse effects on law-abiding citizens, manufactures, retailers and sportsmen's organizations." The bill, which passed on April 3 and was signed into law by Malloy the following day, banned more than 100 types of assault weapons, called for background checks on all weapon sales -- including private sales -- and created the nation's first dangerous weapon offender registry. -- A firearm trade group based in Newtown, Connecticut, has filed a lawsuit against Gov. Dannel Malloy and other state lawmakers in hopes of reversing the state's recently passed strict gun control law. The lawsuit also names as defendants state legislature leaders J. Brendan Sharkey and Donald Williams Jr.; state Attorney General George Jepsen; Chief State's Attorney Kevin Kane; and Reuben Bradford, commissioner of public safety. In the lawsuit filed Monday, the National Shooting Sports Foundation alleges the Connecticut bill that made history for its tough measures on gun control -- including a ban on the sale and purchase of high capacity magazines -- was illegally introduced and rushed through legislation by Malloy and other lawmakers.
