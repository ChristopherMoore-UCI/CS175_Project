Bresnan dropped India's opening batsman Abinhav Makund first ball, but it didn't mark a change in fortunes for the visitors. -- England beat India by a crushing 319 run margin with a day to spare in the second test at Trent Bridge to take a 2-0 lead in the four-test series. England will overtake India if they win the third test at Edgbaston next week. At one stage India had reduced England to 128-8 during the first innings, but it was the home side that went on to dominate the next two days with both bat and ball. Bresnan's quick-fire 90 in the morning session helped England reach a huge second innings total of 544 runs.
