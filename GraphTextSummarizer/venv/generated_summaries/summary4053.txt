"The list features some iconic spots such as the Met in New York City (No. 7), in addition to some museums that may not be household names," said TripAdvisor spokeswoman Julie Cassetina. Glowing reviews over a recent 12-month period have earned the Art Institute of Chicago the top ranking in TripAdvisor's Travelers' Choice awards for museums. In addition to the worldwide list, TripAdvisor also compiled dedicated lists for the United States, Asia, Canada, the United Kingdom, Europe, South America and the South Pacific. Free admission, a Smithsonian Institution mainstay, will be extended to include participating museums. The Louvre, the world's most visited museum, comes in at No. 19 on the global list, behind lesser-known museums such as Stockholm's Vasa Museum (No. 13) and the Instituto Ricardo Brennand in Recife, Brazil (No. 17).
