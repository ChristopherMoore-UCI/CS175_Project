In recent years, extremists plotting attacks against the United States have also shown little, if any, connection to foreign groups. The threat from homegrown extremists has changed substantially in the past three years, becoming the province of fewer individuals who are less connected to foreign groups than was once the case. And because of the measures now in place to prevent the acquisition of precursor chemicals and materials suitable for making conventional explosives, homegrown extremists have also often struggled to produce effective bombs. The threat from homegrown extremists to the U.S. homeland has been constrained in recent years by a variety of security measures. The incidents carried out by homegrown extremists continue to be limited in their lethality, and major operations such as the 9/11 attacks are well beyond the skills of even the most capable domestic extremists.
