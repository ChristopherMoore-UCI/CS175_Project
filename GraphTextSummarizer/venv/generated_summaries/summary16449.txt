Kamchatka bears are used to feeding on salmon in the summer, but there have been fewer of the fish in local rivers this year because of overfishing, contamination or natural causes. -- A team of experts gathered Friday on Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula to decide how to deal with marauding bears that reportedly have killed two people recently. Russian media reports cite local law enforcement officials as saying the remains of the two men had been "gnawed on." Groups of bears have been reported in the region since the deaths, and many people have refused to work at the mine, saying they are afraid. "When [bears] don't have salmon, they go into some of the settlements, creating bad situations both for themselves and people," Williams said. Generally, bears are timid animals and need only to be scared off.
