Some American service members are now in quarantine at an Army base in Vicenza, Italy, after returning from West Africa, according to Maj. Gen. Darryl Williams, the commander of U.S. Army forces in Africa who is among those isolated. She and Nina Pham -- the other Dallas nurse who was discharged from a National Institutes of Health facility in Maryland on Friday -- are differ from the handful of other U.S. Ebola cases in the United States because they caught the disease in America, rather than contracting it in West Africa. About two weeks ago, Vinson became the second nurse from Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas to get the virus while caring for Thomas Eric Duncan, a Liberian man who began showing Ebola symptoms after arriving in Texas and died of it there. She also voiced appreciation for Dr. Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol, two Americans who got Ebola in Africa and were treated at Emory, for their contributions of plasma for people in the United States struggling with the disease. She told reporters her visit aims "to show solidarity with the people of the region so that you know that you are not alone as you face this terrible epidemic," as well as to help Liberia emerge from the crisis "stronger and more resilient." After speaking Tuesday to members of a multiagency Disaster Assistance Response Team, who have been in West Africa since August, the President offered a hint of optimism.
