Pete Sauber bought back the outfit from BMW last week after the German car manufacturer also decided to pull out of racing's premier category. "Subject to their signing the Concorde Agreement, BMW Sauber will be awarded the 13th entry in the championship, taking the place of the departing Toyota team. "The FIA has written to inform BMW Sauber AG that their application for an entry in the 2010 FIA Formula One World Championship has been successful," the governing body said in a statement on its Web site. " Sauber have yet to indicate who next year's drivers will be, having finished sixth in the team standings in 2009 with Poland's Robert Kubica and Nick Heidfeld of Germany at the wheel. "The FIA has worked closely with the commercial rights holder (Bernie Ecclestone) and the teams involved over recent weeks, and is grateful for their support in achieving the best outcome for the sport.
