Army Maj. Gen. Rick Lynch, commander of the Multi-National Division-Center, was asked to comment on Republican Sen. John Warner's recommendation that President Bush start withdrawing U.S. troops from Iraq by Christmas. -- A U.S. commander in Iraq said he believes it's not possible to withdraw troops from his region south and east of Baghdad by year's end as an influential senator called for a day earlier. But he has so far also opposed Democratic efforts to force the president to start bringing U.S. troops home. " Lynch, whose operations cover the central part of Iraq, south of Baghdad, said soldiers have been helped by the "surge," or additional troops, and have made strides against militants. In Texas, where Bush is on vacation, National Security Council spokesman Gordon Johndroe said the White House appreciated Warner's advice but would wait for the recommendations of Gen. David Petraeus, the U.S. commander in Iraq, and the U.S. ambassador in Baghdad, Ryan Crocker, before making any decisions.
