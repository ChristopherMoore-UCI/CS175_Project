Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, who came to power in the May coup, was among the many well-wishers visiting Siriraj Hospital to pay their respects, accompanied by senior government ministers and the Thai army chief. His appeal stretches across the spectrum of Thai society, unifying urban elites and rural farmers. And in August last year, he was discharged from Siriraj Hospital after a stay of nearly four years, having been admitted in September 2009 for treatment for a lung inflammation. The palace had earlier revealed that the 86-year-old king had been hospitalized at Bangkok's Siriraj Hospital with a high fever and irregular blood pressure Friday evening. He has stayed out of the public eye during the current political crisis, which led to a coup in May, spending much of his time at the royal palace in the southern seaside town of Hua Hin.
