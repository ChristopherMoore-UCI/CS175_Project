-- Three members of the family of a Mexican marine who died in a shootout last week were killed Tuesday in the southern state of Tabasco, Mexican President Felipe Calderon said. In another incident Tuesday, local media in Sinaloa reported that the state's director of tourism was gunned down, together with a bodyguard. Marine 3rd Petty Officer Melquisedec Angulo Cordova was fatally shot during a gunbattle that resulted in the killing of Arturo Beltran Leyva, one of Mexico's most wanted drug lords. Angulo Cordova was the only military fatality in last week's operation against Beltran Leyva in Cuernavaca, Mexico. Beltran Leyva's death was a huge blow to one of Mexico's most violent groups, authorities said.
