Hotel with corpse in water tank has notorious past New guests continued to check into the Cecil in the hours after firefighters removed Lam's body from the water tank.

Two former guests have sued the proprietors of Los Angeles' Cecil Hotel, where a 21-year-old woman's corpse was found floating in a rooftop water tank. How did woman's body come to be in L.A. hotel water tank? The lawsuit claims the hotel effectively contracted with its guests to provide water "fit for human ingestion and human consumption through showering" -- an obligation that the Cotts allege the hotel did not meet.
