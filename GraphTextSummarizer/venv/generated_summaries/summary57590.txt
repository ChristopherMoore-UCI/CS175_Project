The world No. 1, who crashed out of the Australian Open last month to Ana Ivanovic, made light work of Serbian opposition this time around beating Jelena Jankovic 6-2 6-2 to set a semifinal against either Carla Suarez Navarro of Spain or France's Alize Cornet. "It definitely felt a lot more comfortable than my first match," Williams said, WTATennis.com reported, referring to her 7-6 6-0 win over Ekaterina Makarova on Tuesday. Surprisingly, Williams had lost four times in their seven previous meetings which, bar a couple of matches, have been tight affairs. No. 22 as Williams reeled off seven games on the trot to take the first set and go up a break early in the second. Eighth seed Wozniacki made lighter work of her match against Sorana Cirstea downing the Romanian 6-1 6-2.
