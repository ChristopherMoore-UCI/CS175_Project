There appears to be a certain synergy between Super Bowl ads and the menu at most Super Bowl parties. "It is a good strategy to continue to advertise food and beverage products extensively during the Super Bowl because consumption peaks during the game." Indeed, Americans are said to consume more food on Super Bowl Sunday than on any day of the year except Thanksgiving. Super Bowl partygoers probably won't have to go far to fulfill their cravings for the soda, chips, and other foods that they see in high definition. And the subconscious impact of Super Bowl ads might be even greater than that of everyday commercials, because the ads are part of the entertainment, Harris says. Thanks to pregame hype and Hollywood-quality production values, Super Bowl commercials have become the main attraction for many viewers.
