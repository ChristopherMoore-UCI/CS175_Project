All of the quarterbacks who had ever thrown touchdown passes in that stadium, all of the linebackers who had ever made jarring tackles, all of the field goal kickers who had ever won games for Logan as the scoreboard clock ticked down ... and the place was renamed for the boy who could never run a single stride. Yet I found myself, during the last year, thinking about Bill Sauer Field, and Logan, Ohio, and how it's possible for all of us, if we make the effort, to find the best in ourselves -- to find the best in each other. "It's with pride for what this town once did." Bill Sauer Field was the core of public life in Logan. No. Bill Sauer was born in Logan more than 100 years ago -- in 1908. The Logan football stadium had been constructed in 1925.
