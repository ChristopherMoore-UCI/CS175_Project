In his first official interview since George's July 22 birth, William told CNN's Max Foster that Lupo is taking the addition to the royal family in stride. " Future king talks fatherhood, baby George Lupo will be a perfect playmate for George, whom William calls "a little bit of a rascal." The photos were shot by Michael Middleton, Catherine's father, in early August in the garden of the Middleton family home in Bucklebury, Berkshire. "He either reminds me of my brother or me when I was younger, I'm not sure, but he's doing very well at the moment," William told CNN, in describing the youngest member of the royal family. They are accompanied on the left by Tilly the retriever, a Middleton family pet, and on the right by Lupo, the couple's cocker spaniel.
