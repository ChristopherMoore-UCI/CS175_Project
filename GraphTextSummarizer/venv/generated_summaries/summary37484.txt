-- On Wednesday, Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer rightly vetoed the state bill that would have allowed businesses to deny service to gay people on religious grounds. Since then, a lot of similar signs showed up in the windows of Tucson businesses saying "We reserve the right to serve anybody." But Prohibition, Jim Crow, Indian schools -- where they tried to make Native American children abandon their identities -- and anti-Chinese immigration laws are not so far in the past that we can safely ignore them. One business owner, reacting to this legislation, even told me: "Arizona is the American Uganda" -- where they put gay people in jail. Tucson is a little more liberal than Maricopa County and Phoenix: We're a university town.
