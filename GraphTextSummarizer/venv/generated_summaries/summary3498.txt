-- Years on the run as a suspected member of the feared "Pink Panthers" gang of international jewel thieves have ended for a Serbian man who's been arrested in a Madrid suburb, Spanish police said Wednesday. Spanish police have been on the trail of Pink Panther suspects, and they zeroed in on Ilincic in the town of Alcala de Henares near Madrid. Spanish police said that robbery netted 3 million euros ($4 million) in jewels, but the international police agency Interpol says "the gang made away with jewelry worth an estimated 11 million ($15 million). Interpol, which had him on its wanted list, says the Pink Panthers are "behind armed robberies targeting high-end jewelry stores in Europe, the Middle East, Asia and the United States." Police in Britain named the gang the "Pink Panthers" after the famed movie in which a thief steals the so-called Pink Panther jewel and hides it in a face cream jar to elude detection. Spanish police released video of the 2007 robbery at the Dubai shopping mall that showed a frightened store employee hiding behind a door while a hooded man, in another room, smashed glass windows to steal jewels.
