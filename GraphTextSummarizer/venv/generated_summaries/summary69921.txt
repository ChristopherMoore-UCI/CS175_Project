The duchess joins other Princess Cruises godmothers in naming a ship, including her husband's late mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, actresses Audrey Hepburn and Sophia Loren and late British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. "It is a great honor for Princess Cruises that Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Cambridge has accepted our invitation to become the Godmother to Royal Princess," said Alan Buckelew, the line's president and CEO, in a statement. Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, will name Princess Cruise Lines' new ship, the Royal Princess, in a naming ceremony in Southampton on June 13, according to the cruise line. -- Just before she becomes a new mother, the Duchess of Cambridge is set to become a godmother -- to a cruise ship. The new ship features balconies on all outside state rooms, a glass-bottomed walkway that extends over the water 28 feet beyond the edge of the ship and a private dining experience called Chef's Table Lumiere that envelops diners in a curtain of light.
