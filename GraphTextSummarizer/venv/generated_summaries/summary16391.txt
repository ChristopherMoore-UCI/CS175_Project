The review could lead to increased use of iPads, portable DVD players and other consumer electronics in aircraft cabins. The FAA, meanwhile, limits devices because of fears that consumer electronics could interfere with airplane communications and navigation systems. A study completed last year cited 75 instances in which consumer electronics were suspected of interfering with plane systems, although it is hard to verify pilots' suspicions because of the difficulty of replicating incidents. "With so many different types of devices available, we recognize that this is an issue of consumer interest," Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said in a statement. The FAA says the current regulations simply allow passengers to use devices when it has been demonstrated that they can be used safely, and some airlines are more aggressive at testing than others.
