-- A police officer was killed Friday morning in a motorcycle accident as Sen. Hillary Clinton's motorcade made its way through downtown Dallas, police said. A Dallas police officer since December 1988, Lozada-Tirado was married with four children, according to police. In the past 18 months, there have been two fatal accidents involving motorcycle officers escorting President Bush. There were no other vehicles involved in the accident, police said, and the motorcade was able to continue to the site without further incident. Clinton said she called the Dallas police chief and would contact the officer's family at an appropriate time.
