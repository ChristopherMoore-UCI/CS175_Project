Instead of sending regular SMS text messages via wireless carriers, iMessage transfers messages across Apple's own servers to allow iPhone users to message one another without paying carrier fees. -- Apple's Internet-based messaging service, iMessage, has long had problems when it comes to interacting with non-Apple devices. Users can turn off iMessage on all their Apple devices to remedy the problem, but sometimes the issue persists, especially if a user doesn't disable iMessage before selling his or her old iPhone. Business Insider has a handy guide to help ensure your texts don't get caught in iMessage purgatory forever. But some people who switch from an iPhone to a non-Apple device have found it difficult to dissociate their phone numbers from iMessage.
