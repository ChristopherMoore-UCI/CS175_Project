So while most social apps are about connecting with friends, family or good-looking strangers, Moore began to wonder if a mobile tool could use the same readily available location information to help you avoid certain people. The app lets people set up push alerts for acquaintances they'd prefer to avoid such as exes, frenemies or annoying co-workers. "We feel like we've reached the point of social fatigue -- too many networks with too much information, all the time," Baker says. It maps out the positions of people you know based on their most recent social posts so you can give them the slip. Some are exploring Instagram images by using the map, while others have set up alerts for people they do want to see.
