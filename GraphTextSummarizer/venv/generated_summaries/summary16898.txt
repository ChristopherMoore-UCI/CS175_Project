As the fall out from his divorce from ex-wife Elin Nordegren continued, Woods failed to win a single title and was even beaten to the tournament he hosts by U.S. Open winner Graeme McDowell last week. "Last week was the first time he's played three good rounds in succession this year," he was quoted as saying on New Zealand news website stuff.co.nz. But after showing an upturn in form as the season neared its end, Woods' caddie Steve Williams is confident his man has what it takes to start winning again in 2011. As you would expect for a loyal caddie of 12 years, Steve Williams is backing Tiger Woods to bounce back from his slump in form as he prepares for the new season. " Woods opted to remodel his swing after finishing tied fourth at The Masters in Augusta back in April and Williams says he knew then that the rest of the season would be a rebuilding process.
