Internal Justice Department e-mails obtained by CNN showed Perez helped persuade the city to withdraw, then pushed other federal officials to back out of separate private lawsuits against St. Paul. At issue is whether Perez -- who heads the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division -- improperly intervened with St. Paul, Minnesota, officials last year in getting them to drop the city's pending Supreme Court appeal over public housing conditions. Holder, testifying before the Republican-led House Judiciary Committee, sparred with GOP Rep. Darrell Issa of California over congressional requests for private e-mails of top Holder aide Thomas Perez, who is President Barack Obama's nominee to be Labor Secretary. Issa suggested Perez in the call was trying to keep any arrangement with St. Paul officials from being disclosed publicly. Other contentious issues at the hearing dealt with a Justice Department investigation of Associated Press phone records as part of alleged leaks by government officials, and a probe into whether the IRS unfairly targeted conservative advocacy groups seeking tax-exempt status.
