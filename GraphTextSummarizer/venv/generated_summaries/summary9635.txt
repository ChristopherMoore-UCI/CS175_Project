Sno has played in for Bristol City in England, following earlier spells with NAC Breda and Feyenoord. CNN -- Ajax midfielder Evander Sno has suffered a heart attack whilst playing in a reserve match against Vitesse Arnhem on Monday. Spain international Antonio Puerta died in 2007 after suffering a heart attack in his club side Sevilla's 4-1 win against Getafe. A statement on the club's website said the 23-year-old Dutch midfielder had to be resuscitated before later being transferred to hospital, where he is expected to stay for two weeks. As a result of the former Celtic player's trauma the match was abandoned and he was treated on the pitch for more than ten minutes before regaining consciousness.
