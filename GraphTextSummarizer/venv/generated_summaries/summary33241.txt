"What Liu Xiang did today reflected the true Olympics spirit," said Feng Shuyong, the leader of the Chinese athletics team, in quotes carried by Chinese state news agency Xinhua. China's sympathetic response this time around may be attributed to Liu's symbolic completion of the race, as well as the Olympics not taking place on Chinese home turf. -- China is rallying around fallen hurdler Liu Xiang Wednesday after he failed to make it past the first-round heat for a second consecutive Olympics. Chinese media reported that Liu will undergo surgery for his Achilles tendon at a London hospital Wednesday. " "Liu's spirit and sportsmanship won praise, not only from Chinese sport officials and millions of Chinese, but also from his foreign friends and opponents," wrote Xinhua.
