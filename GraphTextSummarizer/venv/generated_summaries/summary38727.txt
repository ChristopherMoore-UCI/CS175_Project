Karen Quigley told CNN on Saturday that Elwood, her Chinese Crested and Chihuahua mix that shot to national prominence after winning the World's Ugliest Dog Contest in 2007, had died. Elwood was a mere 2-years-old -- barely a teenager in dog years -- when people outside southern Jersey first saw his distinctive mug. The judges at the World's Ugliest Dog Contest -- an annual event held at the Sonoma-Marin Fair in Petaluma, California -- apparently did not agree. "The best part was he did not suffer, he was in my arms and with me," Quigley said from her home in Sewell, New Jersey, 15 miles east of Philadelphia. " "For a little dog he touched a lot of lives in his short time," she said Saturday.
