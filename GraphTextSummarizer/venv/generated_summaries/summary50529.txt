She was in seven (yes, SEVEN!) films in 2011: "The Debt," "Tree of Life," "Coriolanus," "The Help," "Wilde Salome," "Texas Killing Fields" and "Take Shelter." This one pretty much blew me away and nothing would make me happier than if Chastain and co-star Michael Shannon ("Boardwalk Empire") were to receive Oscar nominations. I'm still making my way through all seven, but this gives me an opportunity to mention a film that just missed my top 10: Jeff Nichols' "Take Shelter."
