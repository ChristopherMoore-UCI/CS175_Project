Based on that probe, Justice Department prosecutors won't recommend civil rights charges against Wilson because there is not sufficient evidence to support them, a U.S. official told CNN. "Our investigation will assess the police department's use of force, including deadly force. The Justice Department report has not been completed, and Attorney General Eric Holder ultimately will make the final decision whether to press federal civil rights charges against Wilson. If Holder decides, based on prosecutors' recommendation, not to press federal civil rights charges against Wilson, that could rile things up yet again. Benjamin Crump, a lawyer for the family, has said he felt federal civil rights charges against Wilson were "not very likely" given the "very high standard" that has to be met.
