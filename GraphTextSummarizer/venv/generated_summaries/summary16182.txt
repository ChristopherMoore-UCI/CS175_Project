-- His father, Ryan O'Neal, and sister Tatum O'Neal sat behind Redmond O'Neal in court Thursday as he entered a not guilty plea to charges he possessed heroin and an illegal handgun. Ryan O'Neal, Redmond O'Neal and half-sister Tatum O'Neal sat together for an interview on June 25, 2010, the first anniversary of Fawcett's death. "Redmond O'Neal remains cautiously optimistic that all these matters can be favorably resolved so that Mr. O'Neal can receive opportunity for additional treatment," his lawyer Richard Pintal told CNN after Thursday's arraignment. Redmond O'Neal was still on probation for drug convictions when he was arrested in Santa Monica, California, Tuesday morning. The Los Angeles judge denied bond for the 26-year-old son of Farrah Fawcett and Ryan O'Neal.
