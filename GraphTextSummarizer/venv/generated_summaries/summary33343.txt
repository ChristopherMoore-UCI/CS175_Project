She was being treated for "horrific" injuries after being found beaten, malnourished and covered with scars Tuesday afternoon, Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey told reporters. Beatrice Weston had burn marks on her body and marks on her ankles as though she'd been struck by pellets, Ramsey said -- injuries that clearly had been inflicted over some length of time. The 19-year-old was being held in the apartment rented by Linda Weston's daughter, Jean McIntosh, who became the fourth person charged in the case Wednesday afternoon, Philadelphia police spokesman Lt. Ray Evers told CNN. When police returned to the building Tuesday with a warrant to search McIntosh's apartment, Beatrice Weston had been moved. McLemire, Breeden and a Knowles, told CNN affiliate KYW that their Social Security information was taken from them, that they had been beaten and that they lived in fear of their alleged captors.
