-- A fire station in a historic area of Philadelphia caught on fire Friday morning, said Battalion Chief Michael Richey. "There was significant damage to the firehouse and the apparatus floor area, and the medic unit looks like the engine area is completely lost," said Richey, who said the blaze was put out in nine minutes. Efforts to repair the damaged firehouse are already underway, but it is unknown when the fire station will reopen, Richey said. The firehouse sits on a block between the Betsy Ross house and Benjamin Franklin's tomb, Richey said. Forty firefighters and eight fire trucks responded to the scene, including the engine's own firefighters, who were out on a training mission when the fire started, Richey said.
