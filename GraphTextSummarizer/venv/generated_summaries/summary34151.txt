"Rampant illegal detention and torture are clear evidence of Bangladesh's security forces running amok," said Brad Adams, the Asia director of Human Rights Watch who was quoted in a news release about the report. "While few would dispute that corruption, organized crime, politicization of the bureaucracy and political violence had to be addressed in Bangladesh, the interim government must realize that reform cannot be built on midnight knocks on the door and torture," said Adams. Human Rights Watch is calling for the government in Bangladesh "to make the protection of human rights as much of a priority as its fight against corruption." It says Khalil was punished for criticizing "the security forces' role in extrajudicial killings, torture, arbitrary arrests, and other abuses." He described being taken to a small room that resembled a "torture cell" and being severely beaten. -- Human Rights Watch on Thursday issued a first-person account of the incarceration and torture in Bangladesh of one of its consultants -- an outspoken human rights advocate, journalist and blogger.
