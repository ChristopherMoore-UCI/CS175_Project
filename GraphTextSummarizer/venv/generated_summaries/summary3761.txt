-- Iran's supreme leader said Friday the Islamic republic isn't seeking and doesn't believe in pursuing nuclear bombs. "They're pushing on things that make them look like they're going for nuclear weapons, and that's risky. "The spread of nuclear weapons is the greatest threat facing the country -- and I would argue facing humanity -- and that is why we are working both to stop their proliferation and eventually to eliminate them," Biden said in remarks at National Defense University. The draft report became public on the same day that U.S. Vice President Joe Biden gave a speech in Washington warning about the dangers of nuclear proliferation. It has not been approved by its board of governors, but the agency has expressed concerns over the years about Iran's nuclear activities.
