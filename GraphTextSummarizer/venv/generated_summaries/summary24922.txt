Six days earlier, Kinyua was involved in a fight on the Baltimore campus of Morgan State University, school spokesman Clint Coleman told CNN on Friday. Noting the university's no-tolerance policy against violence, Coleman said that after the incident, Kinyua was no longer considered an active student at Morgan State, even though he'd compiled enough credits to warrant beginning the fall semester as a senior. The fight led to charges against Kinyua, including first-degree assault and reckless endangerment, according to court records. Harford County Sheriff Jesse Bane told reporters a day earlier that Kinyua admitted killing his housemate, cutting him up, and then eating his heart and part of his brain. Kinyua was detained and released from jail on May 23, according to records posted online by the state judiciary system.
