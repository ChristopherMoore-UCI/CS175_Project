In the big picture, the MetroPCS plans might deepen the mobile digital divide by normalizing the practice of charging users more to get full mobile access to a free choice of internet services and content. Here's how The Washington Post summarized these flat-rate-per-month offerings: • $40 "for unlimited talk, text, 4G Web browsing with unlimited YouTube access;" • $50 "for unlimited talk, text, 4G Web services and unlimited YouTube; also international and premium text messaging, navigation, mobile instant messaging, corporate e-mail and 1 GB of additional data access. This indicates a strong drive for mobile internet access. We continue to offer consumers a full service, unlimited data plan. This would disproportionately affect lower-income mobile users and people of color, who are more likely to rely more heavily on mobile devices for internet access.
