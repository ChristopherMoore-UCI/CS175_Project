The TSA statement on Monday said the delay would enable security planners to weigh new feedback and continue workforce training. Airline passengers had been cleared to carry knives with small blades, including some pocket knives, beginning on Thursday. TSA Administrator John Pistole had previously told a House Homeland Security subcommittee that his decision on permitting small knives would stand. The U.S. government will temporarily delay a controversial rule that would again permit passengers to carry small knives on commercial flights three days before it was due to take effect. Knives are probably the most common items surrendered by passengers at screening points, aside from liquids.
