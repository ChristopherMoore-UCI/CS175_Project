Both sides were playing on Sunday following disappointing Europa League defeats on Thursday at the hands of Athletic Bilbao and Sporting Lisbon respectively. -- Manchester United have overtaken rivals Manchester City at the top of the Premier League table after a double from Wayne Rooney saw the champions defeat West Bromwich 2-0 on Sunday. Rooney's brace gives the defending champions a one point lead over rivals Manchester City, as Roberto Mancini's side surrendered top spot following a 1-0 defeat at Swansea. United were outplayed in their 3-2 home defeat by Bilbao, but they put that performance behind them to brush aside a 10-man West Bromwich side in comfortable fashion. And the hosts should have taken a sixth minute lead when they were awarded a penalty after Wayne Routledge was fouled by goalkeeper Joe Hart.
