" Germany's Stefan Bradl starts third for LCR Honda, while two-time MotoGP world champion Jorge Lorenzo and Rossi, his fellow Yamaha racer, begin fifth and sixth, respectively. Marquez, the reigning world champion from Spain, finished well ahead of the pack Saturday in qualifying for the Grand Prix of the Americas in Austin, setting a record lap time and beating Repsol Honda teammate Dani Pedrosa by 0.289 seconds. "The progression from the first practice on Friday is very big, we were two seconds behind and now half a second," said Lorenzo. Marc Marquez barely held off the legendary Valentino Rossi in a nail-biting conclusion to the opening race of the 2014 MotoGP season in Qatar but judging by his performances this weekend the second race won't be as close. I'm sure we'll be fighting with Pedrosa, he is our strongest rival.
