-- The flag of Arizona, skeletons and the Statue of Liberty are just some of the images evoked by a group of artists to give life to their views on Arizona's new immigration law. "My mother was undocumented, my father born in Texas, and she feared immigration all her life, even after she became a citizen," said Martin Moreno, whose painting, Born in the USA, depicts the wake of a son of a Mexican-born wife and American husband. A call to artists in Arizona for contributions was quickly met with more submissions than the show could hold, prompting its organizers to rotate pieces each time the show moves to a new space. In their works, the artists bring their personal history and experiences with immigration in Arizona -- a divisive issue in the border state long before SB1070 brought it under the national microscope. The show will move to galleries throughout Arizona and across the country in an effort to educate the public on how artists from the state that has become ground zero in the immigration debate perceive the matter, said the show's organizer.
