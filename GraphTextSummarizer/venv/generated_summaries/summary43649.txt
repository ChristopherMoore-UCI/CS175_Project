Run, decked out in full Adidas regalia, made no secret of his elation over returning to the stage: "Damn, this feels good," he said at the start of a 40-minute set that peaked with "It's Tricky" and "Mary, Mary." Performing for the first time since the 2002 murder of co-founder Jam Master Jay, seminal hip-hop crew Run-D.M.C. reunited for a triumphant Sunday afternoon set. After bringing out Kanye West and most of his G.O.O.D. Music crew on the first night during his headlining set, the Brooklyn emcee returned on Sunday, joining Pearl Jam for an airtight, riffing take on his Black Album cut "99 Problems," a version of the song only comparable to a 2004 collaboration with Phish. Surviving members Joseph "Run" Simmons and Daryl "D.M.C." McDaniels paid tribute early and often to their late partner ("Jam Master Jay was everything to us, so we put a silence on the group," Run explained of the group's decade-long hiatus), even having the late DJ's two sons, DJ Mizell and J'Son, behind the decks. Punk rockers X attracted a thin crowd late Sunday night at the Liberty side stage; today's punks were nowhere to be found, as the band brought in a markedly older demographic.
