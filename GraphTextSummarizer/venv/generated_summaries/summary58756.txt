It began at 11:30 p.m. when Cage, who is in the city to work on a movie, began arguing with his wife on the 600 block of Dumaine Street, New Orleans Police Officer Garry Flot said. -- Oscar-winning actor Nicolas Cage went on a drunken tear in New Orleans' French Quarter Friday night that ended with his arrest on several charges, including domestic abuse battery, according to a police spokesman. Cage was charged with domestic abuse battery, disturbing the peace and public drunkenness, Flot said. While he called himself "a truly dedicated fan of Mr. Cage," Chapman insisted he was simply doing his job "as a bail bondsman and not in connection with our show. "I do not believe the latter will be the case for Mr. Cage." Calls and e-mails from CNN to the actor's lawyer and representative have not been returned.
