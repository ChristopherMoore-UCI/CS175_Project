Whether intentional or not, the message is clear: Society is both actively and passively discouraging girls from exhibiting leadership qualities, and that is translating to a generation of girls afraid to take the reins of leadership for fear of being disliked. We've found that women's leadership journeys begin as girls, and their future depends on receiving the same kind of encouragement and support boys receive when they demonstrate leadership capacities in life. As early as the third grade, girls report anxiety about taking leadership roles, become overly concerned about pleasing others and aspire to be perfect. But words have power and meaning, especially during the critical early grade-school years, when boys and girls alike are developing their sense of self and finding their place in the world. That is why at Girl Scouts, we have teamed up with Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg and former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to launch our "Ban Bossy" campaign: a call for society to stop calling girls who exhibit leadership "bossy" and instead encourage and reward those behaviors the same way we would for boys.
