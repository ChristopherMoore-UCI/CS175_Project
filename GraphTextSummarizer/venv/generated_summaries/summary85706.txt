After a chance encounter with one of those Forbes list stalwarts, steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal, at another Indian tycoon Niraj Bajaj's party downstairs, it's off a Jazz soiree, hosted by insurer Zurich, where Grammy Award-winning trumpeter Terence Blanchard strikes a balanced note as CEO Martin Senn works the room. If anything, with 40 heads of state and government now gathered in Davos, the captains of industry have even more swagger, hobnobbing with the creme de la creme of G-20 politicians. At drinks laid on by CNBC and the Financial Times, I spot former EU Trade Commissioner and one-time New Labour spin doctor, Peter Mandelson rubbing shoulders with JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon. Before calling it a night, I stop by Munich-based events firm DLD's do where I have a photograph with Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer in the corridor. Having recently collected a $1.3 million windfall from the sale of her business, Stone has shunned the usual extravagances afforded to most Davos millionaires and informs me she's moving back into the Covent Garden bolt hole where her business originally began.
