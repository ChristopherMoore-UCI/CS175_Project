The writings said explosives had been placed at San Clemente High School, Orange County Sheriff's Department spokesman Lt. Jim Amormino said. "We just don't know what his motive is at this time." Wednesday was the first day at San Clemente High School, which has 3,200 students and 180 faculty. Writings officials allegedly found in Hospitalman Daniel Morgan's quarters at Camp Pendleton's military barracks prompted the evacuation of an Orange County high school earlier in the day. -- Authorities evacuated more than 3,000 students from a California high school Wednesday after military officials at a nearby base said they found information related to a possible bomb threat. Authorities evacuated the school, but later declared that the campus was clear of explosives, said Marcus Walton, a spokesman for the Capistrano Unified School District.
