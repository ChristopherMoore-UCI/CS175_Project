Former Al Wefaq MPs Matar Matar and Jawad Fairuz were "tortured" while in the custody of Bahraini national security forces, Matar said. Nabeel Rajab, president of the Bahrain Center for Human Rights, said he believes  -- based on what people previously in detention have told him -- about 98 percent of people in custody had suffered physically abuse, including beatings, elect shocks and sexual assaults. The beating took place after Matar said he had completed answering questions from a military investigator. Matar had been held in detention since he was taken from his car by armed men May 2. Following an interrogation with a military prosecutor, Matar said he, Fairuz and a few others were taken to what he believes was a military site.
