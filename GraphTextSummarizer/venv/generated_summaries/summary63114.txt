The lives they lived CNN's Denise Quan and Todd Leopold contributed to this report. "I was deeply saddened to hear about the passing of my friend and bandmate Ray Manzarek today," said Doors guitarist Robby Krieger. A show producer approached them in the dressing room shortly before they were to perform, Manzarek recalled in an interview with CNN in 2002. The Doors formed in 1965 after Manzarek happened to meet Jim Morrison on California's Venice Beach. Manzarek went on to produce the Los Angeles punk band X. Bassist John Doe said the band learned a lot from him.
