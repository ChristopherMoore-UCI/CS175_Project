Police have said they are confident that the Americans were planning terrorist acts, according to Tahir Gujjrar, deputy superintendent of police in Sargodha, where the men were arrested December 9. Jaish-e-Mohammed is the group believed to be responsible for the murder of journalist Daniel Pearl. Subira Farooq, the wife of Khaled and mother of Umar, said in December that she and her husband had traveled to Pakistan to arrange a marriage for Umar, and that she was surprised to see her son arrive in the country shortly afterward. Gujjrar told CNN a preliminary investigation suggests that the men came to Pakistan to wage jihad and had sought to link up with Jaish-e-Mohammed and Jamaat-ud-Dawa militant organizations, neither of which showed interest, he said. -- A Pakistani court Monday gave police two weeks to prepare their case for charging five Americans whom police suspect of planning terrorist attacks.
