Though Park did hold and win a number of elections during his reign, he is also accused of human rights abuses and delaying the advent of democracy in South Korea. Earlier in the campaign, Park Geun-hye spent months defending her father's actions, insisting different times required different methods. Park stepped in as first lady until her father's assassination in 1979. His wife, Yuk Young-soo, remains to this day the most popular first lady South Korea has seen, according to polls. Park defeated liberal rival, Moon Jae-in, a former human rights activist, who was imprisoned during the 1970s for protesting against the regime of Park's father.
