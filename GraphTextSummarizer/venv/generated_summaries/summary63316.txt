The British government accuses Argentina of trying to coerce island residents by intimidating those involved in fishing and oil exploration and trying to isolate the remote islands by limiting access by sea. Residents of the islands, which Argentina calls the Malvinas, voted earlier this month to remain under British rule. -- Falkland Islands lawmakers say they won't back down in the face of Argentina's efforts to claim the South Atlantic territory. Asked whether they wanted to remain a British Overseas Territory, more than 99% of Falkland Islands voters who cast ballots said yes, according to a government spokesman. "The results were fixed." Argentine Foreign Minister Hector Timerman and other Latin American leaders are scheduled to meet Tuesday with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and other U.N. officials over the matter.
