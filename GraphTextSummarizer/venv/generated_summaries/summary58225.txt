It being winter and all, social media sites are packed with millions of snow photos. Most capture the typical moments: pets tentatively venturing out, delighted children and comfort food for the cold winter days. We've seen countless more on Flickr, Twitter and CNN iReport. As always in severe weather conditions, stay safe and do not put yourself in harm. Upload it to iReport and we may add it to our gallery.
