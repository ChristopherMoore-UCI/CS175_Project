It's a bust for actor Ben Affleck at one Las Vegas casino. The source did not say whether casino security accused Affleck of card counting, which is not a crime. The actor was "banned from playing blackjack at the Hard Rock casino in Las Vegas," a source close to Affleck told CNN on Friday. The Hard Rock Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment about the Tuesday incident. Rather, the source says, he was asked to leave after casino security told him: "You are too good at the game."
