Earlier Saturday, William and Catherine wrapped up their last day in Ottawa by planting a tree and meeting with Canadian war veterans. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge had visited a center for troubled street youth and attended a "Freedom of the City" ceremony at Quebec City Hall earlier in the day. Canadian broadcaster CBC reports that Quebec's relationship with the monarchy has often been strained, with the Queen met by booing protesters on a visit to the province in 1964. They were met by cheering supporters at City Hall, where Prince William addressed the crowd in French. They then greeted veterans of conflicts and peacekeeping missions, including some who have served in Afghanistan, and representatives of the many British women who migrated to Canada to start a new life after World War II.
