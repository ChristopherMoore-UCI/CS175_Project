"Rugby is very much part of the community," Melrose RFC marketing director Douglas Hardie told CNN's Rugby Sevens Worldwide show. -- Few games seem so well suited to the mores of the modern sports fan as rugby sevens. "Melrose sevens was purely for rugby aficionados a few years ago, but that has now changed to a degree and it is perhaps getting to be as much of a social event as it is a sporting event." Sevens rugby kicks off On April 28, 1883, Melrose Football Club hosted the world's first sevens tournament at its Greenyards ground. Recalling the moment some years later, Haig said: "Want of money made us rack our brains as to what was to be done to keep the club from going to the wall, and the idea struck me that a football tournament might prove attractive, but as it was hopeless to think of having several games in one afternoon with 15 players on each side, the teams were reduced to seven men."
