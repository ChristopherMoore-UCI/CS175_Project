At the White House Summit, the President will likely call on technology companies for help, and we encourage the administration to involve talented and passionate start-ups in addition to brand name companies. The Obama administration will therefore need to figure out how to help companies navigate the inherent risks of the private sector countering violent extremism. Moreover, the start-up community is increasingly emphasizing social impact as a core business imperative, and this trend likely will accelerate as more millennials start new businesses. America is the vanguard of entrepreneurship and innovation, and there are start-ups ready to heed President Obama's call, including start-ups led by passionate Muslim Americans who are building businesses and social enterprises that challenge violent extremist narratives. Part of the challenge is that, although large companies clearly want to help, they have to navigate complicated priorities that distinguish them from governments, such as shareholders, profits, brands and market forces.
