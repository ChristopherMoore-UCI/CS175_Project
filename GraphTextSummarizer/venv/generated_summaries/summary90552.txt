Lt. Col. -- An Army social worker who was preparing to deploy to Afghanistan in 2009 told a military court Monday that she thought the shooting at Fort Hood was a training exercise. Hasan is accused of killing 13 people and wounding 32 others in the shooting rampage at the Army post near Killeen, Texas. Also Monday, a nurse relived the chaos as she hid from Hasan and called 911. Shanika Hairston choked back tears as prosecutors introduced the 911 call she made as gunshots rang out while she administered immunizations to soldiers who were about to be deployed.
