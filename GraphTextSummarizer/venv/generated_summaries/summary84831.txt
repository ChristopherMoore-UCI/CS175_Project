Jalbert said authorities believe the bear was a grizzly, but the husband said he thought it might be a black bear. -- An elderly couple survived a bear attack in rural British Columbia, and authorities are hunting for the animal. During this time of year in that area, bears are starting to hibernate. Because this bear has cubs, it may be out of its den longer to gather food, Jalbert said. The bear turned on the woman, Jalbert said, and her husband tried to help her.
