Douglas Kennedy is the youngest son of the late Robert F. Kennedy, who was the younger brother of slain President John F. Kennedy and had served as U.S. attorney general and U.S. senator. Once he kicked the nurse, Kennedy only got as far as the next landing when hospital security stopped him, Lane testified Monday. Defense lawyer Celia Gordon suggested Monday that Kennedy was calm during the situation, and that things only deteriorated because of Lane. It was Kennedy's instinct, not Lane's, to protect his baby from being ripped from his arms, she said in her opening statement. But their attorney, Elliot Taub, has said neither Lane nor Luciano recognized Kennedy as the child's father.
