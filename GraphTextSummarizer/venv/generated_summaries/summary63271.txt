While many are still mourning the loss of comedic icon Joan Rivers, Texas Gov. Rick Perry invoked her death to defend a controversial abortion bill he signed last year. The regulation Perry referenced requires abortion clinics in Texas to meet the same facility standards as ambulatory surgery clinics in the state. "The will of the Texas legislature -- which I agree with -- (says) that it is a state's right to put particular types of considerations into place -- to put rules and regulations into place -- to make a clinic be as safe as a hospital," Perry said. It's a curious thought that if they had had that type of regulations in place, whether or not that individual would be still alive," Perry said at a Texas Tribune event Sunday. In June, Perry received harsh criticism for an analogy he made between homosexuality and an alcoholism.
