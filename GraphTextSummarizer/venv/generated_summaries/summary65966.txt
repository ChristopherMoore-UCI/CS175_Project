-- A protest march against U.S. drone strikes in Pakistan, led by former cricket star turned politician Imran Khan, came to a halt on Sunday when authorities blocked access to the demonstration's final destination in the tribal region, officials told CNN. Khan has been a fierce critic of U.S. policy in Pakistan and the use of drone strikes, calling them a violation of Pakistan's sovereignty and a strategy that fuels militant anger towards Washington. In recent years Washington has sharply stepped up the use of drone attacks in Pakistan's mostly ungoverned tribal region, widely believed to be a safe haven for militant groups fueling the insurgency in Afghanistan. Authorities used steel shipping containers and security forces to seal off the road entering South Waziristan, where protesters had planned to hold a rally on Sunday, local government official Shahid Ullah said. The anti-drone march set out in a convoy of more than 100 vehicles from the capital, Islamabad, on Saturday and reached the border of South Waziristan on Sunday afternoon, where it was turned back.
