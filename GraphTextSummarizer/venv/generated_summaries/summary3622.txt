The former House speaker told the congregation that President Washington would not have apologized "to those who are killing us." Now, besides the fact Obama did not apologize "to those who are killing us" or that our generals also apologized for the mistake or that the Lord's Prayer asks God to forgive us of our trespasses as we forgive those who have trespassed against us -- I'm trying to figure out who, besides a "Jeopardy!" contestant, whips out a George Washington card in the first place? Speaking to a church in Georgia, Gingrich criticized President Barack Obama for apologizing to the Afghan people for the accidental burning of Qurans at a military base -- an incident that spurred riots and dozens of deaths in retaliation. That change is reflected by Obama's double-digit lead over the GOP field. But Newt Gingrich took the card game to a whole new level this past weekend when he whipped out the hardly used, rarely seen "George Washington card." Usually, a tough primary makes a candidate stronger for the general election, but between the exposure of character flaws and this dumbing-down of rhetoric, itÂ seems to be having the reverse effect on the GOP.
