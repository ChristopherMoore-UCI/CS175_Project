What was so pressing that he just couldn't care for Michael Jackson, that he had to call Sade Anding?" It will never be known how long Jackson had not been breathing when Murray dropped the phone in the middle of his conversation with Anding, the prosecutor said. "What they're really asking you to do is to convict Dr. Murray for the actions of Michael Jackson," Chernoff said. Chernoff argued that the prosecution fabricated the theory because they "desperately needed a drip," because "without a drip, what Dr. Murray gave Michael Jackson would not have harmed him." "If Dr. Murray did what he said he did, there was no danger to Michael Jackson," Chernoff said. Prosecutor David Walgren told them Thursday the evidence that Murray caused Jackson's death is "overwhelming" and "abundantly clear," while defense lawyer Ed Chernoff argued no crime was committed. Dozens of Jackson fans filled the plaza outside of the downtown Los Angeles County courthouse, shouting slogans, waving signs and sometimes arguing with Murray supporters.
