Ricardo Medina, the former "Power Ranger" arrested Sunday in the fatal stabbing of his roommate, has been released from custody while law enforcement investigates Joshua Sutter's death. Local media reported Sutter's death Saturday, and TMZ was the first to identify Medina as the actor who played the Red Ranger in 2002's "Power Rangers Wild Force." No charges have been filed against Medina, who police said stabbed Sutter in the abdomen with a sword, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said this weekend. Police said Medina told them he stabbed Sutter after Sutter forced his way into Medina's bedroom. The Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office has asked law enforcement to continue to investigate, spokesman Ricardo Santiago said.
