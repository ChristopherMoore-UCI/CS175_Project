Google's response to this is that because many different manufacturers are competing to sell Android phones, consumers will always win out in the end. Phone manufacturers -- and the mobile carriers with whom they form partnerships -- are free to add code to Android as they see fit before loading it on to their handsets and selling them to you. So, while Google likes to say that Android's openness is about giving the consumer freedom, the real freedom here has nothing to do with consumers. (Business Insider) -- Google loves to talk about how "open" Android, its operating system for mobile devices, is. But letting handset makers and, especially, carriers make the Android experience worse is a bad move, and one the hurts Google's customers.
