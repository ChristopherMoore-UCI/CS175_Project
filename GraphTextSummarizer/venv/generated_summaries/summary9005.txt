In the future, cars could communicate with each other and share information about speed and traffic to better address issues that individual drivers can't fix on their own. But Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Berthold Horn has developed an algorithm he thinks can be used by cars to better reduce these kinds of "phantom" traffic jams: slowdowns not caused by obvious culprits like accidents or road repairs. Cars with adaptive cruise control are outfitted with radar sensors or digital cameras on the front of the vehicle. Completely autonomous car technology is under development at universities, car companies and even Google. -- Can mounting radar sensors or cameras on cars help prevent some traffic jams?
