-- The Supreme Court has struck down a federal law designed to stop the sale and marketing of videos showing dogfights and other acts of animal cruelty, saying it is an unconstitutional violation of free speech. Stevens was charged in 2004 with violating interstate commerce laws by selling depictions of animal cruelty. He predicted mores crush videos will soon flood the underground market, because the ruling has "the practical effect of legalizing the sale of such videos. Nearly every state and local jurisdiction have their own laws banning mistreatment of wild and domesticated animals, and usually handle prosecutions of animal cruelty. He concluded Congress had not sufficiently shown "depictions" of dogfighting were enough to justify a special category of exclusion from free speech protection.
