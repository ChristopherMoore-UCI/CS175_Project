On Friday morning, about 9:20 a.m. PT (12:20 p.m. ET), a gunman opened fire at a Transportation Security Administration checkpoint. The FBI was still working the shooting scene Saturday inside Terminal 3, and its flights had been assigned to other terminals during the morning, airport officials said. Throughout Saturday morning, LAX struggled with flight delays, but authorities were able to allow passengers to retrieve their possessions that had been abandoned during Friday's emergency evacuation. Uniformed and undercover police will continue a high security posture "for the foreseeable future," said Airport Police Chief Patrick Gannon. Meanwhile, the airport entrance's 100-foot pylons "will light the night blue through Sunday in honor of fallen TSA Officer (Gerardo) Hernandez," airport officials said on its Twitter account.
