-- UEFA's decision to fine Denmark striker Nicklas Bendtner for revealing a sponsor's name on his underpants during a Euro 2012 game may have opened a can of worms for football's European governing body. For Irish bookmaker Paddy Power, who has announced it will pay the fine on Bendtner's behalf, the hefty fee probably represents good value for the publicity the stunt has gained. " But there are potential downsides too, Chadwick warns, not least the fact that Bendtner's fine eclipses the $31,000 UEFA fined the Croatian Football Federation for disturbances in their match against the Republic of Ireland. Ronaldo double dumps out Dutch, Danes also exit "For brands entering into sports sponsorship, it's all about eyeballs," said Simon Chadwick, professor in sports business strategy at England's Coventry University. Chadwick tweeted in response that those comments could equally have been made by UEFA towards Paddy Power.
