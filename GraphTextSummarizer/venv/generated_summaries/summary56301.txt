And, just five minutes later, Liverpool doubled their advantage when United winger Nani inexplicably headed Suarez's cross from the right back towards goal -- and an unmarked Kuyt was on hand to nod home his second from close range. Wolves remain second bottom of the table with 29 points, although only nine points separate ninth place Newcastle with bottom team Wigan Athletic. And they were made to pay for that miss when Kuyt completed his hat-trick, again from close range, converting a 65th-minute rebound after goalkeeper Edwin Van der Sar had parried Suarez's free-kick into his path. United pulled one back in the final minute when substitute Javier Hernandez nodded home Ryan Giggs' right-wing cross from close range, but the goal had no impact on the final outcome and Liverpool were able to give a second-half debut to record signing Andy Carroll -- the most expensive English player in history following his $55m deadline day transfer from Newcastle. The Uruguayan striker twisted and turned in the area, skipping around three challenges before getting to the by-line and knocking the ball across the area for Kuyt to apply the simplist of finishes from in front of goal.
