Paul Ryan and Gen X GOP Generation X represents more fertile ground for Republicans in November than younger Millennials of Generation Y who overwhelmingly supported President Barack Obama four years ago. With Ryan, 42, holding down the No. 2 spot, the ticket hopes to strengthen his Generation X demographic ahead of November and broaden the campaign's appeal to a wealth of younger voters, a much more challenging prospect. Young Democrats say Ryan's deeply conservative views diverge from many of his generation and may not appeal to younger voters either. -- Paul Ryan symbolizes for many Republicans of his generation a passing of the torch and a call to embrace the Reagan-era principles that appealed so strongly to young voters in the 1980s. Amy Holmes, anchor of GBTV's "Real News" at the Blaze, a conservative news site owned by Glenn Beck, said Ryan's Reagan-like sensibilities resonate with voters who came of age in the 1980s.
