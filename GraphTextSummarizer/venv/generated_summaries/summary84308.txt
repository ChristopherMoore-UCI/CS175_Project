The drinking of baijiu at CNY is a ceremonial affair that goes like this: there will be one uncle at the table who quietly designates himself the "baijiu assassin" -- empty baijiu glasses and sober people are his prey. If you do a little research into CNY, you'll be told it's a two-week period during which everyone goes home to honor their ancestors, worship deities and partake in superstitions and dragon dances that hark back centuries. I didn't just lose my CNY cherry last year; it was ripped out of me, the flesh devoured and the stone spat back in my face. CNY was, as far as I understood, an annual get together for families and loved ones to enjoy each other's company. It is this 100-proof (57% ABV) pungent, nasal-cavity-searing liquid that will forever tinge my memories of that first CNY experience.
