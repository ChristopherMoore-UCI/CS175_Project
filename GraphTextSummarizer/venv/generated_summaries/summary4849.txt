The family petitioned Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius to change the rules so Sarah could qualify for adult lungs. She wasn't able to qualify for adult lungs because she was too young; the agency that oversees transplants, the Organ Procurement and Transplant Network, had a policy that children only 12 or older could be prioritized for adult organs. Days later, the organ network approved a change to their policy to allow lung transplant programs to request additional priority for younger transplant candidates. -- The family of Sarah Murnaghan, the 10-year-old girl whose quest for a lung transplant prompted a change in national transplant policy, said Thursday her first biopsy shows no rejection of her donor lungs. Sarah received a new set of lungs three days later.
