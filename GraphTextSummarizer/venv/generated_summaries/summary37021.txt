A Hail Mary pass by sensational Seahawks rookie quarterback Russell Wilson was caught in the end zone -- by sticky-handed Falcons receiver Julio Jones, who was put in on defense for just such an emergency. Finally on Sunday night, Tom Brady and the New England Patriots manhandled the Houston Texans 41-28 in Foxboro, Massachusetts, to capture the final spot in the division championship round next weekend. Later that day, young 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick set a rushing record and racked up 400 total yards to humble the vaunted Green Bay Packers defense in a convincing 45-31 win in San Francisco. If you think NFL football is boring, you must not have been watching this weekend. First, on Saturday, the Baltimore Ravens kept retiring linebacker Ray Lewis' career alive by stunning Peyton Manning and the Denver Broncos 38-35 in double overtime.
