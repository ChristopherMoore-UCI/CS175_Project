Shahid says The Malala Fund will try to battle the things standing between many girls and education, including culture, violence, poverty and a lack of quality schools. While attending school, Malala seems ready to continue to inspire other girls through The Malala Fund  and a growing social media movement. The Malala Fund is officially described as being focused on helping girls go to school and raise their voices for the right to education. A big focus of The Malala Fund is to continue to facilitate a  social connection between Malala and girls around the world. " Shahid met Malala several years ago and even helped organize a summer camp for Malala and other girls in Islamabad in 2009.
