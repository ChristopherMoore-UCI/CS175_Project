How to help and support young rape victims Larry Pott said that he wanted other high school students who might know what happened to his daughter -- including those who were witnesses -- to speak up. During Monday's press conference, stepmother Lisa Pott read messages that the family found on the teen's Facebook page after her suicide. A fellow student told KGO that along with the shock of Pott's death, there was chatter about who was involved and how they remained in school. Pott had too much to drink at the party and passed out before the attack, Santa Clara County sheriff's detectives say. She couldn't handle it, and she did the worst thing a parent can imagine -- she took her life," said Robert Allard, attorney for Pott's father, mother and stepmother.
