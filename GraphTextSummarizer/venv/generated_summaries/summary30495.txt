In a June interview, McConaughey mentioned that he used to wear a headdress when attending Dallas-Washington games in Dallas. "Matthew McConaughey wants the Redskins to keep their name, basically bc he digs the emblem & hamburgers," Emmy Weikert tweeted. "I wish ppl would stop saying 'everybody was fine with the Redskins' name, then all of a sudden...' Comedian Hari Kondabolu believes he has a solution to the issue: keep the Redskins name but replace the logo with a severely sunburned white person. A number of tweeters repeated a headline from the Independent Journal Review, a conservative viral news site: "Guess Who Just Weighed in On the Redskins Logo Controversy with a Non-PC Take Some Sure Won't Like." This isn't the first time McConaughey has defended the Redskins and his love for the team.
