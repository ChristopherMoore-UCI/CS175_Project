Worcester police said they learned that "a woman connected with Ms. Haynes" told her acquaintances she had delivered a baby sometime during the night of July 23 or morning of July 24 at an undisclosed Massachusetts hospital. They found her with a newborn in Plymouth, New Hampshire, during an investigation into the death of 23-year-old Darlene Haynes, whose body was found Monday in the closet of her home in Worcester, Massachusetts. The baby was determined to be a few days old, said Michele Hutchins, spokeswoman for Speare Memorial Hospital in Plymouth. Hospital officials are expecting to transfer her custody to Massachusetts child welfare workers. Officers received tips from women who became suspicious of another friend of Haynes' who turned up with a newborn girl when Haynes disappeared.
