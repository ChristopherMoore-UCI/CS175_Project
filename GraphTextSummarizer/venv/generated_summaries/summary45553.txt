Mr Paulson plans to infuse chess with the same mix of lucrative sponsorship deals and general razzmatazz that helped the Indian Premier League to revolutionize international cricket. "Chess tournaments have traditionally been organized by ex-chess players, who are reductionist, and have lost touch with the cinema, the drama of this game," he says. The complexities of chess are bad enough, but the game faces a further barrier in enticing big-money corporate sponsors: the curious reputation of Fide president Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, who has run the sport for nearly 20 years. Going Global showcases entrepreneurs taking their businesses around the world, tackling issues like business strategy, marketing and international logistics. An imposing, shaven-headed American media entrepreneur with an intellectual air, Mr Paulson last year paid Fide, the world chess federation, $500,000 for exclusive global rights to commercialize the sport over the next decade.
