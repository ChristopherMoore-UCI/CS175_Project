AEG Live to put Michael Jackson on trial in his own death AEG Live's lawyer argued televising the trial could create a frenzy among Jackson fans at the courthouse that could pose a threat to witnesses. CNN had requested its camera be allowed in the courtroom during the trial, but Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Yvette Palazuelos issued a ruling Friday denying the request. The Jacksons' lawsuit accuses AEG Live of liability in Jackson's death through the negligent hiring of Dr. Conrad Murray, the physician who is serving a prison sentence after being convicted of involuntary manslaughter. The wrongful death trial of concert promoter AEG Live filed by Michael Jackson's mother and three children will not be televised, a judge decided Friday. If AEG Live is found liable by a jury, it could mean a multibillion dollar judgment for the Jacksons, based on the potential earnings of Michael Jackson had he lived past his 50th birthday.
