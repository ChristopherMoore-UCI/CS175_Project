-- Singer Fantasia Barrino revealed during a concert Sunday what has been rumored for months -- she is pregnant. Barrino's weight gain fueled online rumors seven months ago that the R&B singer was expecting a child, but her manager said she was gaining 45 pounds in preparation to play legendary gospel singer Mahalia Jackson in a movie. "God has given me this child and I don't have to hide it from none of y'all," Barrino told fans at the outdoor show in Jacksonville, Florida. "You are the first person that I share this news with, and I share this with you because I can relate to you," Barrino told fans. Barrino later testified in the child custody case that she knew from the first day of her relationship with Cook that he was married and still living with his wife, according to court records.
