Why the Pope and Obama turn to Twitter "For the first time in history, a man can communicate directly with some low-level press officer in Vatican," tweeted @EsaMakinen. The wait is over for Pope Benedict XVI's many Twitter followers, and they have been quick to respond to the much anticipated first tweet from his personal account Wednesday morning. Pope Benedict has some previous experience at tweeting, having launched the official Vatican news site on Twitter, @news_va_en, in June of last year. While Benedict is the first Catholic pope to take to Twitter, he isn't the first twitterized pope. But while the pontiff pressed the button to send his very first tweet, others are expected to send future tweets on his behalf.
