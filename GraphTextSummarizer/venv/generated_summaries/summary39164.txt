The $24 million production has now earned $38.5 million after 17 days in theaters, and it will pass the total of Julianne Hough's first feature film, "Burlesque" ($39.4 million), sometime this week. That was good enough for a $3,774 per theater average, which does not merit huge expansions in the coming weeks. The found footage horror sequel has scared up $81.3 million after ten days in theaters, and considering the huge business the film will likely do on Halloween, "PA3" is only a day away from passing Paranormal Activity 2's $84.8 million cume. Check out how they performed below: Dreamworks Animation's "Puss in Boots" was the top cat this weekend, clawing its way to a $34 million debut, 51 percent of which came from 3-D screens, and 7 percent of which was from IMAX theaters. "Puss in Boots" entered theaters a week earlier, but it will need to endure even better than "Megamind" to earn back its budget.
