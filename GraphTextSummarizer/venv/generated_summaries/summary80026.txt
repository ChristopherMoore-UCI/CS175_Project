The win extends Wiggins' overall lead to nearly three-and-a-half minutes over his teammate Chris Froome, and more than six minutes over Liquigas rider Vincenzo Nibali who is third. Sunday's final stage to Paris does not traditionally involve a contest for the coveted yellow jersey meaning Wiggins has virtually guaranteed his place in history as the first British rider to win the Tour. The 32-year-old Sky team rider crossed the finish line in first place, completing the 53.5-kilometer time trial in one hour, four minutes and 13 seconds. The Australian finished the stage in seventh place overall, nearly 16 minutes behind Wiggins. -- Bradley Wiggins all but secured his maiden Tour de France victory on Saturday with a storming ride in the 19th and penultimate stage of the race from Bonneval to Chartres.
