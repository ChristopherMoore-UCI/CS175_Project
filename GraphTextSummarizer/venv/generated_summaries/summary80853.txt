Beyond the crippling of one high-profile newspaper website, the incident has people asking broader questions about U.S. cybersecurity: How vulnerable are U.S. websites to attack? "The Syrian Electronic Army is a murky, underground group that has made a name for itself by plastering pro-regime propaganda across some of the Internet's most trafficked sites," a U.S. official told CNN. " "It appears to be a loose collective of a few individuals," said former hacker Marc Maiffret of the group, which supports Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The Syrian Electronic Army might not be the most sophisticated gathering of hackers at the moment, but experts say its shown the ability to wreak plenty of havoc -- primarily with media outlets so far. Those three ominous words -- especially for an organization in the highly competitive news business  -- were seen on computer screens nationwide as customers tried to access The New York Times website this week.
