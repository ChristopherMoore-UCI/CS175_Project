"These documents, once again, refute misleading attempts to equate routine scrutiny of other groups involved in advocacy to the systematic scrutiny of Tea Party groups by IRS officials," spokesman Ali Ahmed told CNN. Cummings accuses Issa of conducting a partisan witch hunt and making false accusations about the scandal first uncovered in May by an inspector general's report that detailed how the IRS targeted conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status for extra scrutiny. Under tax law and IRS regulations, groups that primarily engage in political activity are ineligible for tax-exempt status. " In response to the documents Cummings made public last week, Issa's office said conservative groups underwent tighter scrutiny than liberal groups. In particular, the report said IRS workers in the tax-exempt unit used "Be on the Lookout" or BOLO lists of words such as tea party to assess what applicants came under extra scrutiny.
