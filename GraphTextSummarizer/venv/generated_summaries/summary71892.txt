-- A New Hampshire jury on Monday found a Nashua woman guilty of second-degree murder for running over a man who had heckled her for being a New York Yankees fan. But prosecutors said in New Hampshire Superior Court, "a few curse words and some insults to a baseball team do not justify murder." Beaudoin's sister, Faith, said her family was delighted with Monday's verdict. It escalated when Beaudoin noticed a large Yankees decal in the rear window of Hernandez's Dodge Intrepid and started to taunt her about the major league baseball team. Ivonne Hernandez, 45, was accused in the May 2008 killing of 29-year-old Matthew Beaudoin. "We believe it's a fair and just verdict based on the evidence." Calls to Hernandez's attorneys weren't returned Monday.
