Earlier this month, Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter signed an order moving curfews to 9 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays for people younger than 18 in Center City, the heart of Philadelphia's downtown, and in University City, home to the University of Pennsylvania and Drexel University. In England, where riots erupted earlier this month, authorities say social networking sites and mobile messaging services were used as tools to organize looting and violence. The government was working with the police and intelligence services, he said, "to look at whether it would be right to stop people communicating via these websites and services when we know they are plotting violence, disorder and criminality." And last week, Prime Minister David Cameron told Parliament that "when people are using social media for violence, we need to stop them." Meanwhile, police in northwest England said Tuesday that two men have been jailed for four years each for inciting disorder via social networking sites.
