Store Manager Geoff Bell told CNN affiliate KREM that the phones began to ring off the hook when news surfaced that the store had sold one of the two winning tickets. As days went by without a winner, residents in the 42 states that take part in the Mega Millions drawing rushed to stores to buy more and more tickets, pushing the jackpot to $380 million -- the second-highest in the drawing's history. -- A family in Washington that was one of two jackpot winners in the Mega Millions drawing will speak to reporters about its windfall Thursday. Tuesday's Mega Millions numbers were 4, 8, 15, 25, 47 and 42 (42 was the Mega Ball number). Washington lottery officials have so far only disclosed that the family is from Ephrata, a small town with a population of just over 6,000.
