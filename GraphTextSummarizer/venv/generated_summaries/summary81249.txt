West, who welcomed his first child with girlfriend Kim Kardashian in June, opens up to Jenner about his baby girl, falling in love with Kim, and dealing with the press. "Kids weren't monitoring every day what Kim Kardashian was wearing, or where Kanye West was going on vacation, and thinking that somehow that was the mark of success. -- Kris Jenner worked her magic — and familial connections, of course — to land an interview with the typically media-shy Kanye West, the father of her granddaughter North. He also addresses President Obama's comments last month about how celebrities like Kanye and Kim have shifted the idea of the American dream. " "Kris" airs on select Fox stations, including in New York, Los Angeles, and Dallas.
