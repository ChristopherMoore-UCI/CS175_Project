That sort of family lore -- compiled just after Mexico recovered from its tumultuous, bloody Revolution of 1910-20 -- not only piques the interest of prominent Latinos such as Olmos but also stands to sate the curiosity of 31.9 million U.S. Hispanics of Mexican descent. Nearly 18% of the population were recorded as "soltero" (single); 11% were "casado por lo civil y la iglesia" (civil and church marriage); 10% were "casado por la iglesia" (church marriage); and 8% were "union libre" (free union, or living together without marriage). Therefore, it is fitting that the world's largest online family history resource now has an expansive collection to serve this important demographic," said Josh Hanna, Ancestry.com executive vice president, in a statement. It's considered a rich mine of information because that year's census is Mexico's earliest, most accurate accounting of its population, with 90% of its people counted, according to the firm Ancestry.com. Mexico's 1895 census is considered the country's first national census, but those records aren't available to the public and aren't considered as complete as the 1930 census, said representatives for Ancestry.com, which claims to be the largest online family history resource.
