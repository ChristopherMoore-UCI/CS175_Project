Another blogger asked, "Just who gave these city inspectors such absurd powers?" Known as "chengguan" in Chinese, city inspectors are auxiliary support for police. In the central city of Zhengzhou last year, 1,000 college students scuffled with police and overturned cars after city inspectors roughed up a female student who had set up a street stall. Days after Wei's January 7 death, a government official in Tianmen city, Wei's hometown, was fired, four others detained and more than 100 placed under investigation. These incidents prompted the government to redefine the role of city inspectors. Wei Wenhua's death stands as clear proof of the violent ways of local city inspectors.
