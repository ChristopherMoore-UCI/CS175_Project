According to the NFL, players paid into a "bounty" fund, that reached as high as $50,000 and Saints' defensive coordinator Gregg Williams would dole out the payments based on game performance. The NFL said that in addition to Williams, sanctions could be brought against New Orleans Saints head coach Sean Payton. On Monday, NFL security officials continued interviewing coaches and players across the league. Many former players say "bounty" incentive programs have existed in professional football for a long time. "We really have to figure out where to draw the line and what kind of rules and regulations need to be drawn up to make sure that nothing goes too far anymore so that we can make a safer game for future players."
