Few studies have been conducted on the psychological effects on young defendants facing life in prison, said the Equal Justice Institute, which is representing Sullivan in the high court case. After a daylong trial, Escambia County circuit court Judge Nicholas Geeker sentenced Sullivan to life without parole. And while about a thousand people every year under 15 are arrested for rape, none have been given life without parole since Sullivan. Only a handful of states -- including Alaska, Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico and Oregon -- prohibit sentencing minors to life without a chance for parole, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. "The juvenile system has been utterly incapable of doing anything with Mr. Sullivan."
