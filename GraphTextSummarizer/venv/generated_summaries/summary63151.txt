The deal reverses billions in budget cuts so that the military's discretionary budget will actually go up $2 billion next year (over the budget-cut amount this year).

In addition, this bill adds a new set of forced budget cuts and a few extended fees (customs fees, for example) for 2022 and 2023. How exactly the numbers will land is still unknown, but because the budget deal replaces budget cuts for nonmilitary programs, nonprofits are hopeful. Budget deal passes key Senate vote â€¢ Federal employees: Two biggies -- the deal slashes the chances of a shutdown in January or any furloughs in 2014.
