So, if that makes Facebook the go-to platform for social photos, maybe Vine makes Twitter the default place for fun mini-videos. But let's be honest: Among Twitter's millions of users are a lot of people who will probably be sharing the banal and the stupid. It surprisingly took a few months after Facebook bought the aforementioned Instagram, an app that lets users slap groovy-looking filters onto their photos, for it to cause a falling-out with Twitter. Facebook pulled Twitter's ability to show Instagram images in its feed. Maybe Vine will do the same for Web video.
