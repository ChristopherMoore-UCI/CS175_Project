Disaster officials report that torrential rains and landslides have left at least 46 people dead, 56 injured, and 16 missing. Constant rains have forced rescue crews to stop and restart their searches for the missing, as anxious family members look on. Roughly 263 people have died in Guatemala so far this year as a result of rain, the president said. Over the weekend, authorities closed parts of the Inter-American Highway after rains washed out sections of the road and caused at least two accidents. The May downpours created a sinkhole the size of a street intersection in northern Guatemala City.
