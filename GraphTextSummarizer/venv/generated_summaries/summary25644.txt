This week, Aiken once again presented himself as an unassuming candidate, this time jumping into North Carolina politics as a Democrat to challenge U.S. Rep. Renee Ellmers, a Republican, for her 2nd Congressional District seat. He proudly shared Christian beliefs and his passion for young people with special needs, both traits that resonated with viewers -- and likely with North Carolina voters. As a former political appointee and reality TV show participant, I am intrigued by Aiken's foray into the world of politics. Aiken wowed viewers and judges early in the second season auditions of "American Idol." Nearly a decade ago, Americans were introduced to the adorable schoolteacher from North Carolina.
