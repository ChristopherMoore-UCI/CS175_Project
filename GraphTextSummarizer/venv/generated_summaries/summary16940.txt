Officials closed the canal around noon Wednesday after heavy rain in the Chagres River area, caused water behind the Gatun Dam -- which creates Lake Gatun, a significant part of the canal -- to rise. Then, after 20 years of joint U.S.-Panama control, the Panamanian government assumed administration on December 31, 1999. The last time the canal closed was in 1989, after the United States invaded Panama to topple strongman Manuel Noriega. The canal was built from 1904 to 1914 by the United States, which had sole control over the channel across the Panamanian isthmus until 1979. -- The Panama Canal reopened Thursday after heavy rains and flooding prompted its closing for only the third time in its storied 96-year history.
