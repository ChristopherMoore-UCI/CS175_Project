-- Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood was released on bail Thursday after being arrested on suspicion of domestic assault. The assault charge follows Wood's highly publicized divorce last month from his wife of 24 years, Jo, on grounds of adultery. Wood will face police questioning again in January. The 62-year-old was arrested near his home in southern England on Wednesday and spent the night in police custody before being released. Wood has reportedly been dating a 20-year-old Russian cocktail waitress, Ekaterina Ivanova, for a year.
