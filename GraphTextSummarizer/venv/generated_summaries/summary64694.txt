The second change: a requirement that no person could be elected president without prior military experience. And in this same vein, it would also make sense to establish term limits on members of Congress, and cap the amount of money one can spend on elections. President Obama's open mic comment, telling Russian President Dmitry Medvedev that he would have "more flexibility" to discuss missile defense after the November election, wasn't as much an appalling gaffe as it was an accurate assessment of the inherent flaw of a two-term system for presidents. The third change I would like to see may seem small, but it's a long overdue amendment: Raise the age of eligibility to run for president from 35 to 45 -- and cap it at 70. The first would recognize that the functioning of the federal government is impeded by a president's bid to run for re-election.
