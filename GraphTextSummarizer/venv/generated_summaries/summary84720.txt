"The Florida Forest Service and Miami-Dade Fire Rescue have worked around the clock to protect Southwest Miami-Dade County," Florida Agriculture Commissioner Adam H. Putnam said in a statement. What started as a nonthreatening and seemingly shrinking grass fire on Sunday, consuming fewer than 100 acres according to Miami-Dade Fire Rescue Battalion Chief Al Cruz, grew to be more than 10 times that within the next 24 hours. Several fire units and a helicopter with the capacity to drop 400 gallons of water at a time were battling the blaze, Cruz said. High temperatures and gusty winds helped the fire spread, State Forester Jim Karels said. Parts of Miami-Dade County's skyline was hidden from view Monday as smoke from a growing 1,850-acre wildfire loomed over portions of the Florida county.
