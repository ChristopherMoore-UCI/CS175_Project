May he rest in peace," Mexican President Felipe Calderon said in a Twitter post. Mexico's national arts council described Fuentes as "one of the most prolific and recognized Mexican authors in the world." -- Mexican author Carlos Fuentes, a prolific writer known for his novels and political commentary, died Tuesday. "Carlos' influence on literature goes far beyond borders of Latin America, and the impact of his intellect and activism will not be forgotten," said Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, who presented Fuentes with a key to the city in 2006. Fuentes, a former ambassador to France who became known as much for his political commentary as his literary prowess, regularly wrote columns for the Spanish newspaper and the Mexico daily Reforma. At the Buenos Aires Book Fair earlier this month, Fuentes spoke of the problem of drug trafficking in Latin America and criticized the candidates running for president in Mexico this year.
