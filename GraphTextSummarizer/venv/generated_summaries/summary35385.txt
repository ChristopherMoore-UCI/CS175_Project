New York City College of Technology student Trayon Christian, who was 18 at the time, entered Barneys New York on Madison Avenue on April 29 to buy a Ferragamo belt he had seen rappers wear on television, Christian's attorney, Michael Palillo, told CNN on Wednesday. An African-American college student is suing Barneys New York and the city's police department, saying he was racially profiled and later detained by police, according to court documents filed in Manhattan Supreme Court. In a prepared statement, a Barneys representative said that Barneys New York "typically does not comment on pending litigation." Barneys New York has zero tolerance for any form of discrimination and we stand by our long history in support of all human rights. Christian was detained in a holding cell for two hours and interrogated, as police contacted Chase Bank to check his card, Palillo said.
