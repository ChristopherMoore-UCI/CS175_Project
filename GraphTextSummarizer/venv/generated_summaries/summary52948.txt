According to New York magazine, the new show will have some regular cast members, a few panelists and Wilmore, anchoring it all with monologues and his distinct take on the news. The writer and comedian, whose new "The Nightly Show" debuts on Comedy Central on Monday after Jon Stewart's "Daily Show," has generally stayed behind the scenes. After success as a writer for "In Living Color," "Sister, Sister" and "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air," he turned producer with "The PJs," the animated Eddie Murphy show, and the offbeat "Bernie Mac Show." "I knew Hollywood wasn't going to find me," he told New York magazine of his acting years, when the standard casting call wanted black men closer to Eddie Murphy's fast-talking types. Wilmore has distinguished himself on "The Daily Show," where his Senior Black Correspondent has chimed in on such subjects as Black History Month, Barack Obama's presidency and the Ferguson violence.
