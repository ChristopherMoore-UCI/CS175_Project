The first is a policy lesson for urban school systems: They need something individualized and intensive, like Match tutoring, as a safety net to help prevent students who start falling behind from falling completely through the cracks. What urban school systems need is a "safety net" to catch students who start falling behind and get them back to up to grade level so they can re-engage with regular classroom instruction. The cost of providing students with both intensive individualized math tutoring and the opportunity to participate in BAM was about $4,400 per student per year. The cost of providing this type of intensive tutoring is between $2,000 and $3,000 per student per year. Match has partnered with urban school districts in cities across the country to provide this "tutoring on steroids" model to hundreds of students in each city.
