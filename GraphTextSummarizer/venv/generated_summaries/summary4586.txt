Perhaps on Friday night, Rodriguez went to sleep and dreamed of how he'd score the perfect World Cup goal. When the ball popped up to him, some 20-yards from goal, most would have expected Rodriguez to control the ball, take it down, and possibly have an effort on goal. Its second goal was a case in point -- a wonderful team move which led to Rodriguez slotting the ball home from close range after Juan Cuadrado had headed the ball back across goal. His two strikes propelled Colombia to a 2-0 victory over Uruguay and into its first ever World Cup quarterfinal where it will play Brazil and made him top scorer in the tournament with five goals. Rodriguez took the ball on his chest, allowed the ball to drop, and then unleashed a volley which flew past Fernando Muslera in the Uruguay goal, hit the underside of the crossbar, and nestled in the back of the net.
