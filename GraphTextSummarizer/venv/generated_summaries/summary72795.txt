"If I was in charge of it, we'd probably have a frenzied rush." AAA said the slight increase in the number of Thanksgiving travelers from last year reflects improved consumer confidence as well as "a growing sense among many consumers that the worst of the global economic crisis is behind us." Travelers are still concerned about the economy, said AAA spokesman Geoff Sundstrom, and the numbers remain well down from two years ago. According to the association, Thanksgiving travel dropped 25.2 percent last year, compared with 2007. -- A slightly higher number of Americans will travel Thanksgiving holiday weekend compared with last year, but those traveling by air is expected to decline, AAA said. The bulk of Thanksgiving travelers -- about 33.2 million -- will be traveling by car, AAA said. The association, which surveyed 1,350 American households, projects that 38.4 million Americans will travel over the holiday weekend, up from 37.8 million last year.
