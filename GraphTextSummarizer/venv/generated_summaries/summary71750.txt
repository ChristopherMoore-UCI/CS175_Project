Averting what could have been another gas crisis across Europe, Russia and Ukraine have fixed a price on natural gas for 2008 while Kiev has promised to pay its 2007 gas debts. Ukraine is the largest facilitator of natural gas to European Union countries, and the disruption caused shortages in Western Europe. A consortium of countries banded together to fund the Nabucco pipeline, a $7.4 billion (5 billion euros) project that will bring gas from Turkey's borders with Georgia and Iran to Turkey, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary and Austria, and then on to Central and Western Europe, according to the Nabucco Web site. Last week, the managing director of Nabucco Gas Pipeline International, Reinhard Mitschek, announced that Gazprom may also send gas through the Nabucco pipeline. The Russian natural gas company, Gazprom, had threatened to stop supplying gas to Ukraine on Monday, then extended the deadline until Tuesday evening while talks continued.
