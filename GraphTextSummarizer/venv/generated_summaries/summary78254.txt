Twenty-seven percent of Facebook users surveyed in the U.S. plan to spend less time on the site in 2013, compared with only 3% who plan to spend more time, according to a study from the Pew Research Center's Internet & American Life Project. The number of Facebook users in the U.S. may be plateauing, as only 8% of non-users said they would be interested in joining. (Another 69% of Facebook users say they plan to spend the same amount of time on the site this coming year.) The most common motivation was not having enough time for the site, with 21% of people saying they were just too busy with real-life responsibilities to spend time reading posts, liking and commenting. The Pew study also found that 61% of Facebook users have taken a break from the service for several weeks or more.
