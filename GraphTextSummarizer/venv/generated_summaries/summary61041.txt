We have discontinued pursuing "wars of choice," although it may take generations to recover from the mistake of invading Iraq, which will cost the American taxpayers two trillion bucks -- with health care for veterans taxing our children and grandchildren for years to come.

He has spoken repeatedly about America's right to act on its own in the world, saying (for instance) in one speech at West Point: "I believe in American exceptionalism with every fiber of my being." He may have done this in part out of frustration over the Shia-led government's inability to provide legal protections for American troops that would have remained. I will dare to hope that, in the waning years of his presidency, Barack Obama might actually begin to communicate with the American people about his real dreams for a better world.
