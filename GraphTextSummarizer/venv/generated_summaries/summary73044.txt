Mills-Westley was a retired county council worker in Norfolk, eastern England, council leader Derrick Murphy told CNN. A knife-wielding man attacked a Mills-Westley in a supermarket, eventually cutting off her head and running away with it, government officials in Tenerife said Friday. She was retired and living between Tenerife in the Canary Islands and France, where a daughter and grandchildren live, her family said in a statement Saturday. The British Foreign Office confirmed Friday that a British national had died in Tenerife. The man entered a shopping center in the town of Arona, in the Cristianos area of Tenerife, and stole a knife from the supermarket before attacking the apparent stranger, a central government spokeswoman said.
