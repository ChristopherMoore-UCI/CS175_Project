Analysts say economic reform is needed to create more jobs for the country's young people, particularly many university graduates who are unemployed. The more votes for the PJD appear to indicate a desire for greater change, she said -- as opposed to votes for the bloc of traditional loyalist parties, which would suggest voters favor the status quo. "Seeing the number of people who actively spoiled their ballots as well as those who did not participate, it is clear that the path to real change will take more effort and time," Rae said. The youth-based February 20 Movement called for jobs and an end to corruption its members say stems from royal cronies. Even the lower figure of 80 would give the PJD more seats than any other party, according to the Moroccan government's website.
