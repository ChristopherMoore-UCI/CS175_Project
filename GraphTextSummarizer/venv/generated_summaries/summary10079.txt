Allowing domestic drones to act as spies for the government is a complete violation of our basic right to personal privacy. The domestic use of drones to spy on Americans clearly violates the Fourth Amendment and limits our rights to personal privacy. My bill will restate the Fourth Amendment and protect American's privacy by forcing police officials to obtain a warrant before using domestic drones. The judicial branch must have some authority over drones, as they do with other law enforcement tools. But like other tools used to collect information in law enforcement, a warrant needs to be issued to use drones domestically.
