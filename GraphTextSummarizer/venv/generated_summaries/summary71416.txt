The new study, which was co-authored by Budnitz and appears in the journal Pediatrics, found that cold medicine-related ER visits by children under the age of 2 dropped by 55 percent in the 14-month period after the product withdrawal, compared with the 14 months immediately before. The number of infants and toddlers under age 2 who landed in emergency rooms after ingesting too much over-the-counter cold medicine dropped by more than half following the discontinuation of medicines targeted to that age group, a new study has found. The overall number of ER visits among kids under 12 remained the same in the pre- and post-withdrawal periods, which suggests that the decline was limited to infants and toddlers. Although Budnitz and his co-authors can't say with absolute certainty that the sharp drop in ER visits was caused by the product withdrawal, it does seem likely. Both before and after the product withdrawal, the vast majority of ER visits resulted from overdoses.
