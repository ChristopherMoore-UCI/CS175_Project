-- Roberto Sanchez, the Argentine singer known as "Sandro" and who drew comparisons to Elvis Presley, died Monday night after complications from surgery, his doctor told reporters. Some accounts place Sandro as the first Latino artist to sell out Madison Square Garden in New York. Sandro died at the Italian Hospital in Mendoza, Argentina, where he was being treated for complications from a heart and lung transplant last month. In his long career, Sandro recorded dozens of albums and also acted in 16 movies, according to the Web site Rock.com.ar. Sandro's romantic ballads made him a star in the 1960s, but he first found the limelight as rock and roll singer who imitated Elvis' style.
