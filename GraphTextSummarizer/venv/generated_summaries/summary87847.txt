The prosecutor, defense attorneys and Judge Howard Whitehead talked about whether Chism should be treated as a juvenile on this new charge or as an adult. That indictment came down three months after, authorities say, Chism killed Colleen Ritzer, 24, his math teacher at Danvers High School. Police say Chism used a box cutter he'd taken to school to kill Ritzer on October 22 in a girls' bathroom at the school. -- After Massachusetts teen Philip Chism pleaded not guilty to rape, lawyers on Thursday discussed whether he should be treated as a juvenile on that count or as an adult, as is the case for the murder charge he's facing in his teacher's death. The judge set the next court date for the afternoon of April 7, noting that a pretrial hearing on the case should take place "sometime in late May or early June."
