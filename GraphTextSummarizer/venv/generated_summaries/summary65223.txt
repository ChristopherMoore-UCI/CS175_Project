'Hurt Locker' team to take on Bergdahl story The Fox Searchlight film will be written and directed by Todd Field, best known for his Oscar-nominated movies "In the Bedroom" and "Little Children," studio spokesman Russell Nelson said. Bowe Bergdahl: Strong, well-rounded and easy to talk to, friends say CNN's Lorenza Brascia and Todd Leopold contributed to this report Army general to start investigating how, why Bowe Bergdahl left base Bergdahl went missing from his post in Afghanistan's Paktika province in June 2009. The announcement came a day after the Oscar-winning team of director Kathryn Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal revealed they would make a film about Bergdahl, the American soldier who recently returned to the United States after five years as a prisoner of the Taliban in Afghanistan. The Army has no definitive finding that Bergdahl deserted because that would require knowing his intent -- something officials couldn't learn without talking to the soldier, a U.S. military official has told CNN.
