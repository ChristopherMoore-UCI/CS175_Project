According to Wilcox, it's the first to address the causes of the "observed retreat from marriage in Middle America," and finds that shifts in marriage attitudes, increases in unemployment and declines in religious attendance are among the trends driving the retreat. According to the report, "in the early '80s, 13% of babies of moderately educated mothers and 33% of babies of least-educated mothers were born outside of marriage, while 2% were born to highly educated mothers.'' "The State of Our Unions," released by the National Marriage Project at the University of Virginia and the Center for Marriage and Families at the Institute for American Values, was authored by sociologist W. Bradford Wilcox of the University of Virginia. For mothers with a four-year college degree, births outside of marriage increased to only 6%. The 2010 edition of "The State of Our Unions" -- a report on attitudes toward marriage -- indicates highly educated Americans are "embracing a pro-marriage mindset" even as middle Americans lose faith in the institution.
