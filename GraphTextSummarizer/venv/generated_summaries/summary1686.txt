"Despite having some of the strongest anti-gun laws in the nation, gun violence continues to plague this city," District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. said. Shootings, and homicides by way of shootings, increased slightly in Manhattan this year, while nearly a quarter of the 240 defendants indicted on gun possession charges in 2010 were identified as 18 years old or younger, according to the district attorney's office. "So we have a full-court press on those who possess loaded firearms in Manhattan, or who those sell loaded firearms." -- Rapper Ja Rule will face two years in prison after pleading guilty to attempted criminal possession of a weapon on Monday, according to a Manhattan District Attorney statement. The 34-year-old hip-hop star, whose real name is Jeff Atkins, faced a single second-degree weapons charge after police found a loaded semi-automatic firearm -- with the serial number scratched off -- hidden in the backseat of his luxury Maybach sedan, the statement said.
