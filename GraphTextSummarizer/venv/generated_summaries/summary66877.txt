His compatriot Allyson Felix followed up her 200m win on Friday by claiming a double as she triumphed in the 400m from Russia's European champion Tatyna Firova and fellow U.S. runner Debbie Dunn. Meanwhile, American runner Jeremy Wariner clinched his fifth consecutive Diamond League victory this season when he won the 400m in London on Saturday. Pistorius, who won the right to compete against able-bodied athletes in 2008, was a clear winner in the Paralympics-ratified race as he finished 4.61 seconds ahead of British runner-up Ian Jones. He ran in a 400m B race in London on Friday night, but the damp conditions were unsuited to his carbon-fiber prosthetic limbs and he finished outside of the qualifying time with 46.93 as he placed seventh. The triple Olympic gold medal winner came home in 44.67 to head off Jamaicans Jermaine Gonzales (44.80) and Ricardo Chambers (45.18).
