Two schools in Yemen were being looked at in connection with the plot and had been on the radar of U.S. officials, the official said. Yemen needs "a lot of help" to fight al Qaeda, an aide to the country's prime minister said Monday. An embargo on shipments from Yemen, which was set to expire Monday, was extended through November 8, a U.S. Transportation Security Administration official said. Germany banned all incoming flights from Yemen, air traffic control officials said. Somalia was included in the ban because of the possibility of contact between al Qaeda in Yemen and terrorist groups there.
