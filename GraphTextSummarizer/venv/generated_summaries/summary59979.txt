Applications of image processing include such popular consumer features as light balancing and face recognition, now standard on most digital cameras, which can also be associated with voice recognition. Current research in audio processing includes noise suppression and continuous speech recognition, which can be applied as much to cell phones as to voice-controlled telematic devices in vehicles. Among the corporate sponsors of telematics research and development are Samsung, LG Electronics, Hyundai and General Motors, who all have speech-interfaced applications targeting consumer products launching in early 2008. R&D value is measured in industry impact, which depends on market analysis and consumer trends. Within Korea University, the School of Electrical Engineering's Intelligent Signal Processing Lab (ISPL), headed by Professor Ko Hanseok, specializes in both image and speech processing.
