Chicago officials have said homicides this year are below the 2012 pace. Two of the suspects -- Tabari Young, 22, and Bryon Champ, 21 -- fired shots onto a full basketball court, Chicago police said. The 3-year-old boy was shot in the face last week and now says that whenever the sun goes down in Chicago, people might get shot again. The FBI's annual crime report last week showed Chicago had 500 homicides in 2012, up from 431 in 2011 and more than any other American city. For Chicago, 7 weekend homicides represent progress CNN's Mariano Castillo and David Simpson contributed to this report.
