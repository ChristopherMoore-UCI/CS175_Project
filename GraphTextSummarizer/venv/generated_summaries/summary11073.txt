Geoff Lawton says that permaculture "revs up" systems of soil creation. "Permaculture does the same thing." "We've taken the systems of soil creation and soil life and we've revved them up. Lawton says it's about rehabilitating areas that have been damaged by pollution or overuse by recycling nutrients and energy back into the soils. But Lawton argues the time and energy expended in a permaculture garden is offset by the quality of the experience, and the richness of the end result. That rich soil lays the groundwork for Lawton's revolutionary method of food production.
