The association also notes in the statement that holding apple juice to the same arsenic guidelines as drinking water isn't appropriate because people consume more water on a regular basis. After prodding from consumer groups, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has conducted their own investigation and is proposing a maximum limit for arsenic levels in apple juice. "Apple juice producers, as well as the FDA, want people to know they can be confident that apple juice is safe," Rick Cristol, president of the Juice Products Association, said in a statement, noting that juice companies routinely test their products. The FDA plans to limit the amount of inorganic arsenic to 10 parts per billion -- the same amount the Environmental Protection Agency allows in drinking water. Inorganic arsenic has been classified as a human carcinogen by the EPA.
