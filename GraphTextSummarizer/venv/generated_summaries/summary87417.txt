Near-Earth objects are comets or asteroids in orbits that allow them to enter Earth's neighborhood. "There are lots of asteroids that we're watching that we haven't yet ruled out an Earth impact (for), but all of them have an impact probability that is very, very low," Don Yeomans, manager of the Near-Earth Object Program Office at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said at a press briefing. There's an important distinction between these two types of objects: Comets are mostly water, ice and dust, while asteroids are mostly rock or metal. An object the size of asteroid 2012 DA14 appears to hit Earth about once every 1,200 years, Yeomans said. Both comets and asteroids have hit Earth in the past.
