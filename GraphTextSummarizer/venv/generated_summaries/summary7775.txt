Daphne Joy, who was born in the Philippines, has a baby by the rapper and is now focusing on safety for the child and herself, said Jim Yeager, a spokesman for the Los Angeles law firm of Meyer, Olson, Lowy & Meyers, which is representing her. "It is important to note, Mr. Jackson has not been arrested and there is no warrant outstanding for his arrest," Leemon said. Jackson denies the allegations, said his attorney, Scott Leemon. "Daphne Joy and Curtis Jackson have been together for a few years in an exclusive relationship," said a statement by the law firm. "We have been in contact with the LA City Attorney's Office and are currently conducting our own investigation into these allegations." Jackson is accused of ransacking Joy's bedroom during an argument at her Los Angeles condo last month.
