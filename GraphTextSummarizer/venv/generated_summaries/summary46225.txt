" When the news broke this week that Pope Benedict XVI was stepping down as the spiritual leader of 1.2 billion Roman Catholics because of his concerns about being able to do the job, many began to speculate that there were other reasons for the decision. Pope Benedict XVI knows full well the Catholic Church cannot grow and prosper if its leader is limited in traveling and attending to his flock. He has more days behind him than in front of him. Whether we want to be honest or not, it was sad to watch the decline of Pope John Paul II. I'll leave it to others to try to figure out other reasons behind the resignation.
