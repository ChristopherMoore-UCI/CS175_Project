"No, there have been no decisions about other members of the Sterling family, and I should say that this ruling applies specifically to Donald Sterling and Donald Sterling's conduct only," Silver said. Technically the team is now owned by the Sterling family's trust, with Donald and Shelly Sterling serving as co-trustees. "The truth of the matter is that Mrs. Sterling has denounced in the strongest terms possible her husband's racist comments," he told CNN. "Mrs. Sterling is a wonderful woman and doesn't have any racial animus," he said. During his news conference announcing Donald Sterling's lifetime ban, Silver was asked if there would be sanctions against Shelly Sterling.
