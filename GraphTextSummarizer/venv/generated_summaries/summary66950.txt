Vettel's Red Bull teammate Daniel Ricciardo will sport the No. 3 during his first season with the all-conquering marque, while 2013 runner up Fernando Alonso will race with the No. 14 on his Ferrari as a throwback to his karting days. -- He is Formula One's undisputed No. 1, and next season Sebastian Vettel will have proof of that fact emblazoned on his Red Bull but choosing a number was not so simple for the rest of his rivals on the grid. Kimi Raikkonen will mark his first season back at Ferrari with the No. 7 on his "Prancing Horse." Four-time champion Vettel chose the No. 5 -- fitting as he chases a fifth successive drivers' championship -- to brand his car with but, as the reigning title holder, he will automatically run with the No. 1 on his Red Bull chassis. McLaren's Jenson Button requested 22 as it was the number he had on his Brawn GP car when he was crowned world champion in 2009.
