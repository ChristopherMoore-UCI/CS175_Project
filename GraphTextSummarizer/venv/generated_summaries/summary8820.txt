The latest poll, which was conducted between Sept. 27 and Oct. 1, comes after a push from national Republicans to bolster Roberts with several Washington campaign operatives, who have helped develop a new, more direct campaign strategy: painting Orman as a Democrat in disguise. Independent candidate Greg Orman now has a 10-point lead in his campaign to unseat three-term incumbent Sen. Pat Roberts, according to a NBC News/Marist poll released Sunday. And while Orman hasn't said which party he will caucus with if he makes it to Congress, Roberts' campaign has done more than suggest Orman will join forces with Democrats, even calling Orman "Obama's candidate for Senate" in a recent ad. NBC News/Marist polling released Sunday also gave Democratic Senator Kay Hagan an edge over her Republican rival Thom Tillis, a good sign for Democrats in a toss-up state that could be crucial to determining the balance of the Senate. The survey of 636 likely Kansas voters has Orman with 48 percent of the vote to Roberts' 38 percent of the vote, outside of the poll's 3.9 percentage point margin of error.
