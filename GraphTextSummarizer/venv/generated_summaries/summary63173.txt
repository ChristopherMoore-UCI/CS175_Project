A video on YouTube.com claiming to show the protest showed students chanting slogans in support of Banias and Daraa, where the anti-government protests started in the country last month. The country's official news agency, SANA, published on Monday the names of six police officers who SANA said were killed and 166 others who were injured "when militants fired at them over the last few days in Daraa, Reef, Damascus, Homs and Latakia." -- Syrian authorities have arrested at least 117 activists, intellectuals and anti-government supporters since early Monday, a human rights group said. The coastal city of Banias remained sealed off Monday after violence broke a day earlier. The group said authorities raided homes and arrested opponents in the capital, Damascus, and also in the cities of Latakia, Homs, Aleppo, Jubah, Tartus and Banias.
