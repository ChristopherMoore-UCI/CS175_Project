That prompted a wide-ranging response that involved dispersants, burning oil on the surface of the water and gathering it with skimming ships, trying to prevent it from reaching shore with booms and collecting oil debris from beaches across the Gulf with an army of BP workers. Meanwhile, scientists charged with determining the flow from the leaking well said Monday that roughly 4.9 million barrels (205.8 million gallons) of oil have seeped from it. The static kill is the biggest development in the long-running saga involving BP's well since a tightly fitting cap was placed on it in mid-July, stopping oil from flowing into the Gulf for the first time in almost three months. BP proceeded with the static kill after conducting a crucial test to determine if oil in the capped well could actually be pushed back down into the reservoir and it was safe to proceed. The BP spill surpassed the 1979 Ixtoc 1 blowout in the Bay of Campeche off the coast of Mexico, which resulted in 140 million gallons of oil being spilled.
