The amount of fire activity in the big timber on the western perimeter was not as extreme," fire information officer Brett Haberstick said, according to CNN affiliate KCNC. In North Carolina, a wildfire doubled overnight in the Croatan National Forest along the Atlantic coast, U.S. Forest Service officials said Tuesday. Tuesday's forecast by the National Weather Service is similar to Monday's blazing heat and winds that whipped up the blaze. Donald Simon, a Forest Service spokesperson, said the blaze has consumed 21,248 acres since Saturday, including 6,000 acres that were intentionally set afire Monday night in a fire-control effort. -- Forecasters are expecting warmer than normal temperatures and gusty winds Tuesday in a northern Colorado area already ravaged by a wildfire, not a good combination for the legion of firefighters trying to extinguish the blaze.
