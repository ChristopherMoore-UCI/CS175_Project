Singer-actress Jennifer Hudson will deliver the National Anthem before the start of Sunday's game, her first public performance since her mother, brother and nephew were found shot to death in October. Lofgren said the NFL first asked Springsteen to play at the Super Bowl in 1975, but he declined. Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band headline the Super Bowl XLIII halftime show in Tampa, Florida, on Sunday. The 2009 Super Bowl will be broadcast February 1 in 230 countries and territories, the NFL said. E Street guitarist Nils Lofgren promises it will be "a very cool thing," but would only hint at what four Springsteen songs the band will play.
