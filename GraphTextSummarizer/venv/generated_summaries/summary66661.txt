Ms Merkel on Wednesday took a big step towards securing swift parliamentary approval of the new European Stability Mechanism and the fiscal pact, when her Christian Democrats and the opposition Social Democrats agreed outlines for a financial transaction tax, which they hope other eurozone states will adopt. Spain's vicious cycle With Barack Obama, US president, also putting pressure on Ms Merkel to switch tack, the chancellor used her first television interview in weeks to emphasise her commitment to her plan to encourage eurozone governments to cede some fiscal power to Brussels. The UK government has in recent weeks called for near-term measures including a bigger eurozone rescue fund to act as a firewall against financial market contagion, and jointly issued eurozone bonds -- ideas which the German government has repeatedly rejected as unnecessary as it pushes for longer-term fiscal integration. The German government believes only a clear roadmap for eurozone integration will ultimately restore investor confidence. As the fiscal pact requires a two-thirds majority in the Bundestag, Germany's lower house, Ms Merkel had to woo the Social Democrats with a push for an FTT, which her junior coalition partner, the Free Democrats, has long resisted.
