-- Alaska's top two elected officials on Thursday certified Sen. Lisa Murkowski's re-election in November as a write-in candidate, clearing the way for Murkowski to be sworn in on time for the new congressional session that starts next week. The Associated Press called the race for Murkowski last month when she had a lead of  more than 10,300 votes over Miller, a figure that included 8,159 ballots contested by Miller observers. Murkowski then waged the write-in campaign in the general election in November to defeat Miller, who filed a lawsuit challenging the result. Murkowski is the first senator to win election in a write-in campaign since Strom Thurmond did it in South Carolina in 1954, and her victory followed a lengthy legal battle over the way the votes were counted. Miller argued that Alaska law does not allow the counting of misspelled names on write-in ballots.
