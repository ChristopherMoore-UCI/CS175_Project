Danyel Smith says Michael Jackson sacrificed himself in the name of his art. Michael Jackson has died at the age of 50. It comes down to the fact that Michael Jackson gave. He was knowing enough about who he was to pretty much demand we all call him The King of Pop, but it was the public shyness, the nerdiness of Michael Jackson that endeared. I told people until I was in my teens that Michael Jackson touched my hand.
