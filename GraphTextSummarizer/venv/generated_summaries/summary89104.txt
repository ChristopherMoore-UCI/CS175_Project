Nadal ended the Serbian's 11-month reign at the top by reaching Sunday's final, but could not stop Djokovic winning in Beijing for the fourth time in five years. Serena Williams, meanwhile, will be taking a break ahead of the WTA Championships in Istanbul, having won the 56th title of her career in Beijing on Sunday and her 10th of this season -- the best tally since Justine Henin in 2007. Both players will next move on to Shanghai, where Djokovic will be defending his Masters title -- if he cannot then Nadal could take advantage and move further ahead in the standings, having not played there last year. " Djokovic is still hoping to be the ATP Tour's year-end No. 1 for the third successive time, but he faces a tough task to displace Nadal -- who has won two grand slams this year after returning from long-term knee problems in February. Last month China's Li Na sealed the fifth of eight spots, joining Williams, Victoria Azarenka, Maria Sharapova and Agnieszka Radwanska in qualifying.
