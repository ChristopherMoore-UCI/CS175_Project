The Clintons left the White House more than a dozen years ago "dead broke" and in debt, according to Hillary Clinton, who defended the hefty speaking fees she commands since stepping down as secretary of state last year. A CNN analysis of the family's financial records in early 2013 showed that Bill Clinton had earned $106 million from paid speeches since leaving the presidency behind. Bill Clinton made more than $9.2 million in speaking fees in 2001 and more than $9.5 million in 2002. " American Rising, the pro-Republican opposition research shop that along with the Republican National Committee, takes the lead in criticizing Clinton, was quick to ping her over her comments to ABC, saying they "reveal someone who is extremely out of touch with financial reality facing Americans." Clinton has taken responsibility for the attack in the past and she did so again in the clip released by ABC.
