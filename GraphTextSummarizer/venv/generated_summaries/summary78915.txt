Today, Kahlo's paintings sell for a whopping $5.6 million, her face adorns Mexico's 500-pesos note, and a 2002 Hollywood biopic of her life featured Salma Hayek in the Oscar nominated lead role. " A life less ordinary Kahlo's enduring allure is not simply due to her artwork, but a remarkable life which began in Mexico City in 1907. Both had extramarital affairs, with Kahlo perhaps most famously engaging in a relationship with Russian revolutionary Leon Trotsky, while he was in exile in Mexico. "It's a real phenomenon," said the curator of one of the biggest Kahlo exhibitions in the world, currently on display at Rome's Scuderie del Quirinale. Her marriage to fellow Mexican painter Diego Rivera -- 21 years her senior and a towering figure beside Kahlo's petite frame -- was a tumultuous one, the couple divorcing in 1939 and remarrying the next year.
