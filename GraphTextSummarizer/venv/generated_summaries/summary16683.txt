Schwarzenegger's office has said the governor believes more Border Patrol agents are needed to reduce illegal border crossings, human trafficking and the influx of narcotics. -- California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger ordered a temporary deployment Friday of National Guard troops to the U.S.-Mexico border. It's not the first time Schwarzenegger issued a general order directing California National Guard personnel to the border. Last month, the governor praised Obama's proposal to deploy 1,200 National Guard personnel along the southwest border of the U.S. Of those troops, 224 would be deployed in California for up to one year. In June 2006, the governor sent troops temporarily to support federal efforts to secure the border.
