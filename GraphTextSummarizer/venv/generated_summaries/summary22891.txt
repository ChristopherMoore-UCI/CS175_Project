According to the Congressional Budget Office, the estimated net cost of coverage provisions to the federal government is $36 billion for fiscal year 2014, and $1.4 trillion for fiscal years 2015 through 2024-- with subsidies accounting for most of the cost. " Albright said the health exchange marketplace has "several layers of safeguards" to verify applicant information, including a requirement that consumers submit accurate information when applying for health coverage. The ACA provides subsidies through the marketplace to eligible applicants, at significant cost to taxpayers. Nearly a dozen fake applicants were able to obtain coverage subsidies under Obamacare during undercover testing of enrollment controls, a government watchdog said. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services oversees online marketplaces, which are in turn required to take several steps to verify application information.
