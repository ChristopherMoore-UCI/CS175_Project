-- Keegan Bradley beat fellow American Jason Dufner in a three-hole playoff to win the U.S. PGA Championship in Atlanta Sunday. The 25-year-old from Vermont finished one-under-par over the 16th, 17th and 18th holes at the Atlanta Athletic Club to hold off Dufner by a shot and claim his first major title. " When Bradley, who is the nephew of LPGA legend Pat Bradley, triple-bogeyed the 15th in regular play, his chances looked over. Brendan Steele, who started the day as joint overnight leader with Dufner, fell away with a 77 and ended in a large group on level par, which included Mickelson. When Dufner bogeyed the 17th to fall two shots behind his challenge looked over, but he rattled home a birdie putt on the last to force Bradley to two-putt for par and a remarkable victory.
