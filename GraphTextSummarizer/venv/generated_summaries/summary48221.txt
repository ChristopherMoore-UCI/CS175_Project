"We are jointly confirming that 'Up Late' will not continue on MSNBC," MSNBC and Baldwin's rep, Matthew Hiltzik, told CNN in a joint statement Tuesday. Alec Baldwin's angry outbursts against photographers trailing him have cost the actor his MSNBC talk show job. "What f***ing language you want that in?" Baldwin later posted a statement on MSNBC's website saying, "I did not intend to hurt or offend anyone with my choice of words, but clearly I have -- and for that I am deeply sorry. The channel announced a two-week suspension of Baldwin's show last week amid media reports that he chased after a photographer outside his Manhattan apartment  and called him a "c**ksucking f*g. He's been photographed several times in the past two years expressing strong displeasure with persistent journalists trailing him with cameras.
