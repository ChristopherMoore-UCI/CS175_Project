"He is an entrepreneur, visionary, knight and adventurer, Sir Richard can now also add AirAsia flight attendant to his long list of credentials," joked Fernandes. Two years ago, Branson and AirAsia Group CEO Tony Fernandes wagered on their Formula 1 racing teams, each man betting his own team would finish ahead of the other's in the 2010 Formula 1 Grand Prix in Abu Dhabi. During the five-and-a-half-hour flight, Branson poured coffee and tea, served meals, distributed merchandise, made in-flight announcements and entertained the passengers, according to an AirAsia statement. On Sunday, he honored the bet by serving on a special AirAsia X charity flight. Donning red lipstick, a flight attendant's skirt and high heels, the maverick businessman served drinks, made intercom announcements and chatted up passengers on an AirAsia X flight from Perth, Australia, to Kuala Lumpur.
