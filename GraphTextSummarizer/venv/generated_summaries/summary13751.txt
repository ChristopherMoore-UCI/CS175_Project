-- A fuel pipeline exploded in a densely populated Nairobi slum Monday morning, flattening homes, reducing some bodies to dust and forcing a massive evacuation of the area amid fears that big pools of leaked fuel could ignite, police and Kenya Red Cross officials said. Authorities set up counseling centers at a stadium in the city as hospital officials made an urgent appeal for blood, saying that many of those admitted to Nairobi hospitals suffered extensive burns and would require blood transfusions to survive, state broadcaster Kenya Broadcasting Co. reported. In 2009, more than 100 people died in a fire after an oil tanker overturned in Molo, in western Kenya. Images from CNN affiliate Kenya Television Network showed flames shooting from metal-roofed buildings as firefighters and people in civilian clothing rushed to the scene and picked through the flattened remains of structures. Fatalities from fuel leak accidents are common in Kenya.
