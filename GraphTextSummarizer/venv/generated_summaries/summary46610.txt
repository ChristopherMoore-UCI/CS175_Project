In a controlled explosion carried out last year for CNN by UK explosives expert Sidney Alford, 6 grams (a fifth of an ounce) of PETN punched a large circular dent into a metal plate twice the thickness of an aircraft fuselage. Col. Richard Kemp, the former chairman of the British government's Cobra Intelligence Group, told CNN affiliate ITN that the quantity of PETN used in the latest devices was five times the amount which alleged underwear bomber Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab tried to ignite aboard a Northwest Airlines flight as it approached Detroit, Michigan on December 25, 2009. Alford said an advantage of PETN for bomb-makers is the fact that it is easily concealed: "A great potential advantage of powdered PETN is that it could look like a wide range of substances or be disguised as even more -- whereas plastic explosives do look suspiciously like plastic explosives."
