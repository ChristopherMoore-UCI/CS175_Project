Rodolfo Sanchez, 69, of Long Island City has been sneaking through toll plazas on the Robert F. Kennedy Bridge and Midtown Tunnel by "piggybacking," or tailgating cars directly in front of his cab, and slipping through the toll lane before the barrier came back down, according to Queens District Attorney Richard Brown. "This type of behavior is egregiously unfair to the millions of honest motorists who pay tolls every day, and we will continue efforts to root out toll evaders and prosecute them to the fullest extent of the law," said Donald Look, MTA bridges and tunnels chief of security. MTA investigators discovered that a certain E-Z Pass tag was regularly crossing the RFK and Midtown Tunnel toll plazas without making payments. We are actively going to pursue anyone evading paying toll," MTA spokeswoman Judy Glave told CNN. -- A New York City taxi driver is charged with keeping more than $28,000 that should have gone to the Metropolitan Transit Authority in E-Z Pass toll fees over the past two years.
