They included charges of genocide, conspiracy to commit genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity including rape and persecution. Her son, Arsene Shalom Ntahobali, a militia leader who was jointly charged in the case, was also convicted Friday of genocide, crimes against humanity including rape and persecution and war crimes, and sentenced to life in prison. Nyiramasuhuko, who was arrested in 1997 in Kenya, and taken to the U.N. court in Tanzania to await trial, was found guilty of seven of the counts she faced, ICTR spokesman Roland Amoussouga told CNN. Two charges were dismissed, one of complicity to commit genocide and a second relating to murder and crimes against humanity. She was also cleared of two charges, one alleging direct and public incitement to commit genocide and another of inhumane acts and crimes against humanity.
