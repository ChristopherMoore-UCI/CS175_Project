"They have to make sure where the mudslide occurred or anywhere else along that track, that the slope is stable enough to where there will not be any chances of an additional mudslide occurring before they release passenger traffic back onto the track," said Washington Department of Transportation spokeswoman Vickie Sheehan. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers offered support Monday to state and local officials in western Washington battling fast-moving floodwaters and rising rivers. About 300 people are staying in shelters after homes flooded in several cities north of Seattle, said Rob Harper an emergency management spokesman for Washington. "Rescue operations are still being mobilized to be available if needed." Rivers in nine counties had crested at or above flood stage by Sunday morning, the state Emergency Operations Center reported. Monday morning, the National Weather Service was reporting major flooding on the Snoqualmie River at Carnation and moderate flooding on the Snohomish River at Snohomish.
