" Here's how it works: Clients who are usually in some sort of job crisis, laid off or unhappy with their work, get in touch with Frederick, usually by phone, and give her their date of birth. She says it's all about discovering your true passion in life: "When we pick a career from our passion, from our soul's work, then that always brings us to true abundance no matter how strange or unique or unusual that work may be." Unlike traditional career counselors, Frederick uses her "intuition" to help her clients. At this point, many people roll their eyes and write Frederick off -- but she says a better job and a better life await those willing to make the leap. "Here's the myth: We're told that either we can pick work that we love and be poor and starve or we can have the job we take for benefits and security and be unhappy," she says.
