Opinion: Marijuana use is too risky a choice Anon Ymous, who declares himself to be "pro-legalization, but anti-use," writes: "My life experiences growing up taught me that my friends who smoked pot in grade school, high school and/or college suffered for it." Postmasteratfingers asks: "Is there any evidence regarding the effect on driving while stoned from pot?" Studies have shown that moderate to severe intoxication with marijuana does indeed increase a driver's accident risk. Although African-Americans are 25% more likely to use marijuana than white Americans, they are 300% more likely to be arrested for it. This, dear readers, is the enduring legacy of pot prohibition. But if cannabis is legalized, the tax revenues it brings in can be used to fund better drug education in schools.
