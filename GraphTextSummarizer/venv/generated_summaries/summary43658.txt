Filmmaker Antoine Fuqua began a program to foster young moviemakers in poor communities. After all, in Hollywood, it's all about who you know -- and Fuqua wants to give neighborhood kids the opportunity to know him. During the filming of "Brooklyn's Finest," he initiated the non-profit Fuqua Film Program -- an intense, 12-week moviemaking course eligible to young adults from Brownsville, ages 16 to 20. -- When director Antoine Fuqua rolls into a community to shoot a movie, he becomes part of that community. CNN: You've got the teens who are part of the program, and then you have a bunch of little kids (from the neighborhood) who were interested in what was going on, too -- the next generation.
