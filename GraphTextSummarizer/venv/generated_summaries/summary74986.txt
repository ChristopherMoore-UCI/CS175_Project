" Gen. Abdel Wahab, the governor of North Sinai, confirmed that a flier titled "Al Qaeda Sinai Branch" circulated outside a mosque in el-Arish on Wednesday. Ramzi Mahmoud Al Mowafi, the doctor of the late al Qaeda leader, escaped from a Cairo prison during the Egyptian revolution earlier this year and has resurfaced in the country's North Sinai area, an official said. "Al Mowafi was seen in Sinai by several Jihadist(s) according to witness testimonials," Gen. Sameh Seif Al Yezen said. The head of security in North Sinai, Gen. Saleh al Masry, told CNN that Takfir-wal-Higra had become active during the revolution that led to the ouster of President Hosni Mubarak. The general added, "Al Qaeda is present in Sinai, mainly in the area of Sakaska close to Rafah."
