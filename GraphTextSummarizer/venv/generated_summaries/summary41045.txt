Movement is calling for a mass rally in Dakar on Tuesday to protest a ruling allowing President Abdoulaye Wade to run for a third term as well as to demand the release of dozens of government critics arrested in the wake of weekend rioting that followed the decision. In June, thousands of protesters clashed with police in Dakar after Wade proposed changes to the constitution that his critics alleged were meant to make it easy for him to win re-election. The court ruled Wade could stand for re-election despite a provision in the country's 2001 constitution that limits the president to two terms in office. The opposition, however, does not trust the decision of the council, because all five judges were appointed by Wade and are widely thought to have limited independence. Wade is in his second term in office.
