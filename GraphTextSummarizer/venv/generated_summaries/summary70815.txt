Hugo Chavez had handshakes and smiles for President Obama at the Summit of the Americas last weekend. "I hope Obama, for the dignity of his race, may be the last president of an imperialist United States," he said. -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez said Friday he appreciated U.S. President Barack Obama's friendly gestures at last weekend's Summit of the Americas, but said they don't change his view of the United States as an imperialist nation. Chavez's fiery diatribes against the United States have included referring to former President George W. Bush as the devil. He was photographed with Obama at least twice at the summit -- once when Obama shook hands with him and other leaders, and again when he approached Obama to give him a book.
