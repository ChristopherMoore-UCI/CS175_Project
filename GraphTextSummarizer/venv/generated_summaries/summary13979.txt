But on a visit home that summer, he learned about the large influx of refugees that San Diego had experienced in recent years. Instead of going to graduate school, Kabban got a job with Catholic Charities, helping refugees settle into their new lives. Kabban's family lived in several places -- including the United States, where his father attended college -- before permanently immigrating to the San Diego area when Kabban was 9. After graduating in 2008, Kabban planned to go to Egypt to get a graduate degree in refugee studies. Kabban has also made it a priority to reach out to those who aren't refugees.
