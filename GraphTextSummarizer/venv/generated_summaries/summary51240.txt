The goal was "Dedicated to my brave boy Luey Jacob Sharp -- English soccer player Billy Sharp scored what he called the most important goal of his career Tuesday -- a shot in memory of his son Luey, who died Saturday, two days after he was born. He died October 29, said Sharp's team, Doncaster Rovers. That's for you son," Sharp said on Twitter after the match. "This is a minute's applause to celebrate the short life of Billy and Jade's son Luey Jacob Sharp," the announcer said.
