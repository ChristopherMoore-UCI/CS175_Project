-- Senate Republicans will block Democrats from taking up a White House-backed bill to cap rates on some student loans unless Democrats allow a vote on a GOP alternative, the second-ranking Senate Republican said Monday. If Republicans prove Democrats can't move a bill without GOP support, "I presume leaders in the House and Senate will get together and find a way to ensure the interest rate doesn't double," Kyl said. An aide to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, said negotiations over the issue are still under way. Interest rates on federal student loans are scheduled to double from the current 3.4% in July unless Congress acts. President Barack Obama has led a high profile, multi-pronged lobbying push to pressure Republicans to support the Democrats' bill.
