A Palin adviser said Wednesday that event organizers had been sending them mixed messages about the event, including the question of whether Christine O'Donnell, whom Palin endorsed in her run for the U.S. Senate in Delaware in 2010, would participate. O'Donnell's representatives told event organizers that she would be in Iowa on the date of the rally and would like to come by and "say hi" to Palin, the source said. Palin supporters from across the country are traveling to the state by plane and bus for the speech, and the governor is likely to speak to them in Des Moines on Friday evening at a meet-up organized by the online hub Conservatives4Palin. The source said O'Donnell aides lied to organizers and said Palin had been communicating via text message with O'Donnell about the rally. After a period in the wilderness (at times literally), she re-emerged and transformed herself into a curious amalgam of tea party firebrand, global celebrity, Facebook prognosticator, reality television star and, of course, potential presidential contender.
