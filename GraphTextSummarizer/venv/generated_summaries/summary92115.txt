-- German chancellor Angela Merkel reshuffled her cabinet Wednesday, moving Interior Minister Thomas de Maziere to the Ministry of Defense and naming parliamentary whip Hans Peter Friedrich head of the Interior Ministry. Merkel made the announcement a day after Defense Secretary Karl Theodor zu Guttenberg resigned amidst a scandal involving alleged plagiarism in his doctoral dissertation. Merkel said the moves would be confirmed by Germany's Federal President Christian Wulf on Thursday. " Guttenberg, 39, is a member of the Christian Social Union party, which is closely allied with Merkel's Christian Democratic Union. Guttenberg had been considered a rising star in Merkel's government.
