-- More areas of Bastrop County, Texas, were reopened to residents Monday following the devastating wildfire that destroyed more than 1,500 homes. School also resumed Monday for residents of Bastrop County, as well as in Waller and Montgomery counties, where the Riley Road fire has burned thousands of acres. "Our goal is to get everybody back in by Thursday," said county Judge Ronnie McDonald. An urban search-and-rescue team scouring the fire zone for victims was expected to complete its work Monday afternoon, Bastrop County Sheriff Terry Pickering said. While some residents expressed concern about hungry primates roaming the charred ruins, the incident gave others in battered Texas a much needed bit of comic relief.
