The Ministry of Defense said Thursday that it regrets Corrie's death. In March 2003, Rachel Corrie was working with the Palestinian-led International Solidarity Movement. From behind a wood and plastic partition, the Israeli soldier who drove a bulldozer that crushed an American peace activist to death testified publicly for the first time Thursday. Rachel Corrie was killed seven years ago. The soldier, who was born in the Soviet Union and arrived in Israel in 1995, was testifying in a civil suit filed by Corrie's parents against the Israeli Ministry of Defense.
