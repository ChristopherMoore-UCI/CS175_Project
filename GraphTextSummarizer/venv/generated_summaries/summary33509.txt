In some countries community leaders fear the balance is tipping more toward surveillance and tougher laws, to the neglect of prevention programs and community outreach. The British government has abandoned most of the ambitious Prevent program launched in 2005 to "increase the resilience of communities to violent extremism" -- the hearts and minds outreach (after groups that were funded ended up being taken over by extremists) and opted for a greater reliance on law enforcement. But given resource-stretched governments -- scarred by the unpopularity of controversial outreach programs and struggling to keep tabs on "extremist travelers" to Syria and Iraq -- are increasingly reaching for law enforcement tools to prevent terror coming to their cities, tracking the "lone wolves" is unlikely to get any easier. Canada has developed a series describing real stories of radicalization that are used "to initiate conversations with community groups." Analysis of such de-radicalization programs is in its infancy; the so-called lone wolves rarely appear on authorities' radar.
