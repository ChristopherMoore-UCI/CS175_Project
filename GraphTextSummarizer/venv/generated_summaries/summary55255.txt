But five major mosques near the center of Sunday's violence in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang, were closed Friday morning, Xinhua said. There is speculation that Sunday's protest, which took place in the predominantly Uyghur-populated Bazaar district, may have been a reaction to ethnic violence in southern China. Hundreds of Han Chinese were on the streets of Urumqi on Tuesday, holding sticks and pipes, and calling for severe punishment of the Uyghurs, who they say committed serious crimes. On Friday, about 3,000 Muslims attended a weekly prayer themed at "peace and harmony" at Id Kah Mosque in the city of Kashgar, according to Xinhua news agency. Uyghur religious leaders have condemned the violence, saying it is against the spirit of the Muslim faith and Uyghur tradition.
