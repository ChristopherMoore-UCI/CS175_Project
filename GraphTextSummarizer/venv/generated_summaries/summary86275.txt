The killings were among a series of reprisals by La Familia after federal police captured one of the group's top leaders, authorities said. The arrests were the most recent in a string of high-level apprehensions targeting La Familia Michoacana; the cartel operates in its namesake state of Michoacan in southwest Mexico. Authorities more than tripled the number of federal police officers patrolling Michoacan in response to the killings. Hit men for La Familia Michoacana linked to the killings were arrested last week, authorities said. Armando Quintero Guerra, who federal police said was in charge of the cartel's expenses, was among six people arrested Tuesday, said Ramon Eduardo Pequeno, head of the anti-drug unit of the public security ministry.
