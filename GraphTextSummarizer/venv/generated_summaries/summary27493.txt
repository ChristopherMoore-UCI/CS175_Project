A witness said the whale rider boarded a southern right whale on Friday afternoon about 20 meters (66 feet) off Middleton Beach, in the Western Australian city of Albany, the environmental agency said. Southern right whales migrate along southern Australia from June to October. If you are in the way of a tail slap or when it breaches, you are unlikely to survive," said Mike Shephard, a district manager for the Australian Department of Environment and Conservation. -- Word that a teenager climbed aboard a whale for a ride has sent Australian officials to the beach, to warn others not to try such a stunt. Right whales reportedly came by their name because they're relatively easy for whalers to hunt.
