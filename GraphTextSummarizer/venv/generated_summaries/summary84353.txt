Since Shrimpton first graced Flemington, international celebrities have become a regular feature of the Melbourne Cup, with high-profile appearances from Britain's Princess Diana in 1985, Kate Bosworth in 2006 and fellow American actress Sarah Jessica Parker last year. All eyes were on British supermodel Jean Shrimpton as she arrived at the prestigious Melbourne Cup Carnival -- or more accurately, all attention was focused on the 22-year-old's legs. " DuPont quickly employed Melbourne milliner Adele Chapeaux to create a hat for Shrimpton's next appearances. As the Melbourne Cup prepares for its 52nd "Fashions on the Field" competition, the iconic image of Shrimpton in "that dress" has gained almost mythical status in the history of a horse race now worth $6.2 million in prize money. "There she was, the world's highest-paid model, snubbing the iron-clad conventions at fashionable Flemington in a dress five inches above the knee, NO hat, NO gloves, and NO stockings!" screamed Melbourne newspaper The Sun.
