Komissarova, 23, fractured a vertebra and dislocated her spine when she crashed at the PSX Olympic skicross venue at Rosa Kuhtor, federation spokesman Mikhail Vezhba told the state-run RIA Novosti news agency. Russian freestyle skier Maria Komissarova has undergone more than six hours of surgery after breaking her back during a training run at the Winter Games in Sochi, the Russian Freestyle Federation spokesman said Saturday. A source close to the situation earlier told the Russian news agency that Komissarova's condition was too serious to transfer her to Moscow. Russian President Vladimir Putin visited with Komissarova in the hospital, news channel Russia-24 reported. Komissarova placed second in a World Cup event in 2012 but was not considered a medal contender in Sochi.
