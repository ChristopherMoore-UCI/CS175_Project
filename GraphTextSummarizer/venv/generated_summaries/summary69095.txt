-- Thousands of people are expected to march in Northern Ireland on Sunday to commemorate the 1972 Bloody Sunday massacre of local people by British troops. Even the name of the city where it happened is disputed, with pro-Irish nationalists calling it Derry and pro-British unionists calling it Londonderry. British troops fired more than 100 rounds on Bloody Sunday, in violation of orders issued to every soldier serving in Northern Ireland at the time, the report found. The killings strengthened the Provisional Irish Republican Army, increased Irish Catholic hostility towards the British army and "exacerbated the violent conflict of the years that followed," its report found. "Some members of our armed forces acted wrongly ... and for that, on behalf of the government -- indeed, on behalf of our country -- I am deeply sorry," British Prime Minister David Cameron said after the release of the long-awaited report.
