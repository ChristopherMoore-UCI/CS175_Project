It adds, "We must secure the existence of our people and a future for White Children." Jack Levin, a professor of sociology and criminology at Northeastern University in Boston, pointed to several factors behind the strength of white supremacist groups, including a flagging economy and the election of the country's first black president. -- Hundreds of white supremacist groups are active in the United States today and are experiencing a kind of resurgence, experts say. I try not to alarm the public too much, but it's something that really needs to be taken a hold of now because more and more we see facts coming out that this is happening more often and more often, and it's not going to stop anytime soon," said David Gletty, who worked as an undercover informant on extremist groups for the FBI. While the number of white supremacist groups is rising, the overall impact on membership is not clear, said Levin. His tattoos included the Celtic cross adopted by white supremacist groups, and he was a member of two "racist skinhead" bands, it said.
