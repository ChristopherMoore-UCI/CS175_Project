Fusion reactions are safe, they emit neither radioactive waste nor greenhouse gasses and fusion reactors would take up relatively little space. Sea water provides millions of years of fusion fuel. In addition to clearing our last remaining scientific hurdle, we need to advance a parallel engineering agenda into key reactor technologies that will enable commercial fusion power plants to reliably deliver electricity in a highly competitive market. In this context, the roughly â‚¬200-500 million ($260-650 million) per year needed to vigorously pursue the parallel track of technology innovation in fusion seems absurdly small. For a couple of seconds, it generated 16 megawatts of fusion power -- enough to supply around 8,000 homes.
