Provided references are no guarantee Though the majority of employers do check references, others skip this step. Not only is it labor-intensive to check references for people who might not be poised for a job offer, but Jack Harsh, adjunct professor at the University of Richmond Robins School of Business, said that many employers worry about the risk of liability in rejecting a candidate based on poor references. I think the old formal system of references is dead in most professional fields." Langerud warns that just because an employer isn't checking personal references the traditional way doesn't mean he isn't checking references at all. On the other hand, job seekers provide references they know will give a glowing report, but employers are getting smarter and finding references you didn't provide. Employers want to make sure they are hiring the right person for the job; but some thwart the process because checking references can be labor-intensive.
