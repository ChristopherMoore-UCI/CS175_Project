The signal originated from a wall-mounted satellite positioning device on the Katmai that reacts when it's touched or splashed with water, Coast Guard Petty Officer Levi Read said. With the assistance of other vessels, the Courageous and the Patricia Lee, the bodies of four other men were recovered from the water, all wearing survival suits, Read said. "What can you say?" said Jeff DeBell, chief financial officer of Katmai Fisheries, which owned the boat. "We knew the person was from the Katmai because the suit he was wearing had the name of the vessel on it," Read said. The odds of someone surviving the frigid waters off Alaska's Aleutian Islands is minimal, said Read.
