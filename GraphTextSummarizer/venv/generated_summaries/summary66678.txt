In Los Angeles County Superior Court, prosecutors dismissed two other counts against him -- a drunk driving charge and a suspended driver's license charge -- said Brown lawyer Tiffany Feder. Brown was also sentenced to one day in jail -- which he already served -- and must undergo a 90-day alcohol treatment program, Feder said. Brown, 43, showed signs of intoxication and failed a field sobriety test during the traffic stop last month in the Reseda area of Los Angeles County, California, Highway Patrol spokeswoman Tiana Reed said. Brown didn't appear in court, Feder said. Singer Bobby Brown pleaded no contest Wednesday to driving with a blood alcohol content of .08% or higher and was sentenced to 36 months of probation, his attorney said.
