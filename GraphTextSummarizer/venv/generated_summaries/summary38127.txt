More than 30,000 Syrian refugees have spilled onto Turkish soil and Turkey is hosting Syria opposition groups. He said Syrian choppers have strayed into Turkish airspace five times in 2012. After Syrian troops shelled refugees on the Turkish side of the border earlier this year, U.S. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta made clear that the bar is high for Turkey to claim the need for a collective self-defense. -- Turkey is changing its military rules of engagement and will now treat a military approach toward its borders by Syria as a potential threat that "will be dealt with accordingly," Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Tuesday. Both sides say the jet strayed into Syrian airspace, but Turkey says the incursion was accidental and quickly corrected.
