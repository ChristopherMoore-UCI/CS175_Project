Officials and many residents blame the violence on Islamist extremist groups that have grown in size and influence since the 2011 revolution that overthrew longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi. Ten days ago, Haftar launched a surprise ground and air assault on Islamist militia positions and bases in Benghazi, including attacks on Ansar al-Sharia, the group blamed in the U.S. Consulate attack. The city has been almost emptied of Westerners as diplomatic missions shut after the 2012 attack on the U.S. Consulate that killed American Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. Muftah Buzeid was also a prominent analyst who frequently appeared on TV talk shows speaking out against Islamist extremism. Many Libyans are outraged over the killing, which is likely to add to the support for renegade Gen. Khalifa Haftar and his campaign against terrorism.
