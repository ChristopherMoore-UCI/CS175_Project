-- China has stepped up its engagement with Africa in recent years, scouring the resource-rich continent in its bid to access natural resources and forge new trade routes. Cajetan is one of the tens of thousands of Africans who've gone to live and work in Guangzhou, a manufacturing city located on the Pearl River in southern China. China's booming economy has been luring an increasing number of Africans to its shores in recent years, most of them eager to export goods from the world's second-largest economy back into their continent. "China is very open for business for us," says van der Wath, founder of Beijing Axis, a China-focused international advisory firm. South African drinks giant SABMiller has been working for years with a local Chinese brewer and now produces China's biggest selling beer.
