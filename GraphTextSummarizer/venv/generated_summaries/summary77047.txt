Communications is one of the few areas where people are consuming more since the recession started, and key communications industries have continued to add jobs despite the downturn. Real consumption of cell phone services, adjusted for price changes, is up 12.6 percent since the end of 2007. Purchases of internet service, adjusted for price changes, have risen by 5.1 percent, and personal purchases of telephone equipment, adjusted for price changes, are up more than 25 percent. But whether or not you think that such a move is a good idea, such regulations are unlikely to boost investment or employment in the telecom industry, at a time when we need all the capital spending and jobs that we can get. With watchful eyes, regulators must practice thoughtful restraint that allows space for job leaders to innovate and hire, while remaining ready to aggressively confront violations of law or abuses of consumer rights if they take place.
