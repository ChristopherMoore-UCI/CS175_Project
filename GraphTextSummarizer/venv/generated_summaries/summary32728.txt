-- Four people were killed Wednesday in a two-vehicle crash on U.S. Highway 63 near Bay, Arkansas, said Craighead County Deputy Coroner Kurt Beeson. The incident involved a Chrysler PT Cruiser and a minibus that Beeson said was operated by Focus Incorporated, which is aimed at helping disabled people. Beeson said preliminary information indicates that the driver of the PT Cruiser was heading the wrong way on the highway or crossed into the wrong lane. Northbound lanes of U.S. 63 were closed. Authorities held up sheets to shield victims from the overhead helicopter from CNN affiliate WMC.
