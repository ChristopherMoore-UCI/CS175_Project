That was the goal of Cyber Security Challenge UK on Saturday, one of a series of inspirational competitions designed to find the next digital genius to defend Britain against devastating cyberattacks whose crimes cost the global economy an estimated $400 billion annually, according to a recent report. Last weekend's simulated attack was sponsored by the National Crime Agency, defense contractor Raytheon and UK telecommunications giant BT. In all, 24 contestants who were largely self-taught hackers raced against a clock in an exercise to restore power to London's BT Tower, which had been shut down and taken over by cyberterrorists. Though computer science is now making a comeback to UK classrooms, there remains a generational gap, organizers said. The issue has become urgent because UK schools had overlooked computer science.
