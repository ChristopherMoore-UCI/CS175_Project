Police arrested Martin Rouleau Couture, who reportedly converted to Islam about a year ago, last July and confiscated his passport, but lacked enough evidence to keep him in custody, said Martine Fontaine of the RCMP. Police said there are about 90 people in Canada classified as important threats. Fontaine said police monitored his activities afterward. "He was identified as a potential important threat," Fontaine said. Bernard Lamotte of the RCMP said a unit formed in 2003 keeps an eye on potential terrorist activities.
