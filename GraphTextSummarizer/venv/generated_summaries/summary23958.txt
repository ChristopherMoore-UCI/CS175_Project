There have been many instances of cross-dressing spies (including Sarah Edmonds, mentioned above), but one of the most impressive deceptions in history was carried out by Shi Pei-Pu, a singer with the Beijing Opera (in which, traditionally, all roles are played by men). During the Revolutionary War, women fought as men on both sides. Their affair lasted 20 years (on and off), during which Boursicot passed several official documents to Shi, believing that "her" safety was at risk if he didn't participate. After they were separated in 1965, Shi came back into Boursicot's life by claiming to be pregnant, and even revealed a baby boy. It was filmed in 1993, starring Jeremy Irons and former Beijing Opera player John Lone (better known for the title role in the film "The Last Emperor").
