A preteen boy died last week at Children's Hospital of La Paz, a few days after arriving with internal bleeding, hospital director Christian Fuentes told La Razon newspaper in La Paz, the nation's capital. About 250 cases of dengue fever, the milder, nonlethal form of the disease, have been confirmed in the past two weeks, said Health Minister Ramiro Tapia in the Los Tiempos de Cochabamba newspaper. Brazilian soldiers pour insecticide to fight dengue fever in 2008. Cases of dengue fever usually spike from November through January, which is Bolivia's hot and rainy season. "And unfortunately, over the last 30 years or so we've seen an increase in the number of countries infected with dengue fever."
