At the Walmart in Porter Ranch, the pepper-spraying incident occurred when a woman doused fellow shoppers with the spray as people were grabbing for Xbox video game consoles, police said. When appropriate action needs to be taken, we know where to find her," said Officer Bruce Borihanh, a police spokesman. The suspect was able to pay for her purchases and leave the store before police arrived, authorities said. In 2008, crowds of frantic Black Friday shoppers trampled a Walmart employee in New York as he and other workers tried to unlock the door at 5 a.m. , Los Angeles police said Saturday.
