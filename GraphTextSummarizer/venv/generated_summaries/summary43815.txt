In a new video, Seattle rapper Macklemore moonlights as a malodorous version of himself, aptly named Mucklemore, on Sesame Street for a "gross and awesome" rendition of his hit song "Thrift Shop" with the show's resident Grouches. Macklemore, alongside producer Ryan Lewis, won four Grammys in 2013, including one for "Thrift Shop" as best rap song. Though the Sesame Street version parodies Dumpster diving as a fetid way to thrift of sorts, the lyrics like "I'm going shopping / Rapper Macklemore is going to be a dad One man's trash is another puppet's treasure.
