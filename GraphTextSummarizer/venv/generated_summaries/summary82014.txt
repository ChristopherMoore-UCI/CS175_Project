Later on the day of the T-shirt decision, my daughter hears my reaction when I read that Sen. John McCain, whom my daughter knows well because we followed the election, is going to vote against Sotomayor's confirmation. But the lasting impact of McCain's decision will be much more profound than upsetting an 11-year-old wise Latina girl. While he drove down Broadway, I asked the cabby if he thought that President Obama was pandering to the Latino communities across the country with the Sotomayor nomination. Editor's note: Maria Hinojosa, an award-winning journalist and author, joined NOW on PBS as senior correspondent in 2005. For me, the decision to wear my own "Wise Latina" T-shirt raises all kinds of issues.
