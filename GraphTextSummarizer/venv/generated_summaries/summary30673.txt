British prosecutors said the men were inspired by a speech from the terror group ISIS, which called for attacks on "disbelievers." Nadir Sayed, 21; Yousaf Syed, 19, and Haseeb Hamayoon, 27, were charged Thursday with preparing acts of terrorism, according to London's Metropolitan Police. Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley said last month that counter-terrorism officers were "running exceptionally high numbers of counter-terrorism investigations, the likes of which we have not seen for several years. Many of the most recent terrorism-related arrests have been in London, the nation's capital and the site of deadly coordinated 2005 suicide attacks, as well as the 2013 public slaying of British soldier Lee Rigby -- who was hit with a car  and then attacked with knives by two men who were later found guilty of his murder and imprisoned for life. Three British men have been accused of plotting to decapitate a member of the public in the street, a court in London heard Thursday. None of the men in court Thursday entered a plea.
