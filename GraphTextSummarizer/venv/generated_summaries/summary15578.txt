The visitors weren't level for long as Alves floated a ball over their defense for Messi, who controlled and lobbed Granada goalkeeper Julio Cesar to spark a prolonged round of celebrations with his teammates. Leading 2-1 from the first leg, Juve edged further ahead when veteran striker Alessandro Del Piero scored on 28 minutes but Serie A leaders Milan hit back with goals from Djamel Mesbah and Maxi Lopez to force an extra half an hour. But Granada -- placed 15th in the 20-team division -- stunned Barca in the second half as Diego Mainz headed a free-kick past Victor Valdes before Dani BenÃ­tez drew a foul from Dani Alves in the box and Guillherme Siqueira fired home from the penalty spot. And Messi wasted little time in equaling Cesar's tally, with a crisp volley after Isaac Cuenca's cross had fallen to him on the right edge of the box after 17 minutes. Tello added a fifth for Barca when he slotted home in the final 10 minutes after Messi had been denied by Cesar.
