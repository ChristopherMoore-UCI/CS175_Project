-- President Obama's recess appointments to a federal agency-- made without Senate confirmation-- will be reviewed by the Supreme Court, the court announced Monday. Republican and Democratic lawmakers in the past have used the "virtual Congress" tactic to block unilateral appointments by the president when the Senate is away. Eighteen months ago, Obama had defended his moves after Senate Republicans earlier blocked giving Cordray a floor vote. "The D.C. Circuit Court today reaffirmed that the Constitution is not an inconvenience but the law of the land, agreeing with the owners of a family-owned business who brought the case to the court," Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a written statement. The legal basis comes from a 1993 Department of Justice brief saying the president should act only if the Senate is in official recess more than three days.
