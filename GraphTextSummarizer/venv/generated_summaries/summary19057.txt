The 2-1 aggregate win by Estudiantes marked the first Copa trophy claimed by the Argentinean team in 39 years, as they came from behind in a tense match that saw all goals scored in the second half. Cruzeiro's Henrique scored the game's first goal in the 52nd minute, striking a long-range shot that deflected off Estudiantes defender Leandro Desabato, according to Goal.com. For years it was dominated by Argentina, with a team from the country making it to every final between 1963 to 1979, and Buenos Aires team Independiente winning six times in that period. The Copa final this year marked the first time for Estudiantes to reach the championship round in 39 years. The Libertadores is the most prestigious tournament in South American club football, seeing the best 32 teams in the continent battle for supremacy.
