In its settlement last year with the US Department of Justice of the criminal charges against it, BP admitted that negligence on the part of its employees -- along with other companies -- was a "proximate cause" of the accident. New York (Financial Times) -- BP has put in place safety systems for offshore drilling that are ahead of any other company's, the UK oil group has said as it prepares for the trial over the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster. Another change was that the importance of process safety -- focusing on an operation as a whole, rather than small individual accidents -- was one of the lessons of the Texas City disaster and has now been emphasised in the drilling operations as well as BP's refineries, Mr Morrison said. The Deepwater Horizon disaster followed other failures including a leak from a pipeline in Alaska in 2006 and the Texas City refinery explosion in 2005, which killed 15 people in one of the US's worst industrial accidents of recent years. However, the company has been talking about what it sees as profound changes in its practices in order to improve its image in the US, and with other governments and companies worldwide.
