-- Dina Lohan, mother of actress Lindsay Lohan, entered a guilty plea to drunken driving and speeding charges in a Long Island, New York, court Tuesday. She is expected to be sentenced June 3 to perform 100 hours of community service, attend a drunken driver program and a victim impact session, and pay $3,000 in fines and fees, according to Nassau County district attorney spokesman Paul Leonard. " A test showed Lohan, who lives in Merrick, New York, had a blood alcohol concentration of 0.20, which is more than twice the legal limit, Leonard said. Lohan, 51, was arrested by New York State Police after a traffic stop last September. Lohan's driver's license will be revoked and her car must have an interlock device -- which tests breath alcohol levels before a car can be started -- installed for a year under the plea agreement, Leonard said.
