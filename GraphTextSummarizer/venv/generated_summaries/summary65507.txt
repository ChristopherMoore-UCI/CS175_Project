Surgeons took the drastic measure to remove the skin from Piper's entire face and use a skin substitute called Matriderm to re-build the foundations before grafting skin from her back and buttock onto her face -- it's the first operation of its kind to be done in one operation, according to Piper's Web site. " Piper has told her story around the world and has started the Katie Piper Foundation to help raise money for burns victims across the UK. -- Katie Piper had everything going for her -- a blossoming career, a wonderful life and a beautiful face. "I can remember going 'not her face, please not her face'," Piper's mother Diane wrote on The Katie Piper Foundation web site. Stefan Sylvestre threw the cup of corrosive liquid on Piper, burning the skin on her face, neck, chest and hands.
