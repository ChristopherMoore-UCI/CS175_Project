Eight people were killed in a bombing in Oslo; 69 young people were killed on Utoya island, in the deadliest attack in Norway since World War II. More than 500 people packed into a court in Oslo, Norway, to see the suspect's first public appearance, said Irene Ramm, head of press for the Oslo court. -- There is no reason to believe that Norway mass murder suspect Anders Behring Breivik is insane, District Court Judge Torkjel Nesheim said Monday. He is accused of killing dozens of people in a bomb attack in Oslo followed by a shooting rampage on nearby Utoya island. He has admitted the bombing in central Oslo and also the shooting on Utoya.
