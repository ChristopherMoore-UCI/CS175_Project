An emotional John Kitzhaber announced his resignation as governor of Oregon on Friday, acknowledging he had "become a liability" to his state but asserting his innocence of any wrongdoing in a scandal surrounding his fiancee's consulting and policy work. And Kitzhaber stoked the controversy this week by reportedly deciding to resign by Tuesday, and in a move his secretary of state called "bizarre and unprecedented," changing his mind by Wednesday afternoon. And the call for him to do just that grew louder into Thursday, with state Treasurer Ted Wheeler becoming the first Oregon elected official to publicly call for Kitzhaber to step down. Kitzhaber's decision to step down came as little surprise, as he had faced mounting calls to resign this week over reports indicating his finacee, Clivia Lynne Hayes, advised the governor and state employees on energy policy while getting paid by a group advocating on the issue. "Oregonians have a right to expect the highest ethical standards from their government, and today's announcement by Governor Kitzhaber acknowledges that reality," the Democratic senator said.
