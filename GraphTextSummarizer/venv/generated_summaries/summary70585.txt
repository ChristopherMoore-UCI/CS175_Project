Newman, of Palo Alto, California, has not been seen nor heard from since October 26, the day he and a traveling companion wrapped up a 10-day organized tour of North Korea, his son, Jeff Newman, told CNN. As a Korean War veteran, Newman might have told his minders he fought against North Korea. -- It was supposed to be the trip of a lifetime for Merrill Newman, a Korean War veteran who had long wanted to go to North Korea. North Korea has not publicly acknowledged that it is holding Newman. Newman was a customer of Juche Travel Services of London, and he traveled with "one other gentleman" to North Korea on the same private tour, Juche Travel spokesman David Thompson said in a written statement.
