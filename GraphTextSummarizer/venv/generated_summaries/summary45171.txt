-- Former Iraqi Prime Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari has won a non-binding vote that could influence the decision on who will be the country's next prime minister, an official in the office of radical Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr said Wednesday. Current Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki won 10 percent, and former interim Prime Minister Ayad Allawi won 9 percent, the official said. Allawi aims to quickly form Iraqi government The results play no official role in deciding who governs Iraq, but it means al-Jaafari will be the person that the al-Sadr bloc is committed to supporting as the next prime minister. As a result of being at the top of the balloting, both Allawi and al-Maliki are working to form coalition governments and are reaching out to entities like al-Sadr's group. The vote was called by al-Sadr, who has refused to back the top vote-getters in the March 7 election and wanted his followers to designate a prime minister of their choosing.
