You'll note the meticulous nature of Faldo's game, every hole is neatly ticked off and appropriately, there's even a squiggle and a correction on the card of American John Daly, the only Open champion at St Andrews since 1970 that I was unable to persuade to sign the flag. The British Open, one of golf's most illustrious competitions, is never more special than when held at St Andrews, the so-called "home of golf." This year just so happens to be the 150th anniversary of The Open at St Andrews and so it's appropriate to auction the flag and the cards in 2010. It deserves a good home, and the auction will help ensure a brighter future for many children in their darkest hour. Also up for auction are the Xeroxed scorecards of all four players when they last all played the St Andrews Open in 2000.
