Balfour is accused of fatally shooting Hudson's mother and brother inside their Chicago home in October 2008. -- Actress and singer Jennifer Hudson testified Monday in the trial of a man accused of killing her mother, brother and 7-year-old nephew. Her recent milestones include penning a memoir detailing her struggles with her weight, being cast to play Nelson Mandela's ex-wife, Winnie, in an upcoming movie, releasing a new album and singing a well-received tribute to Whitney Houston at the most recent Grammy Awards show in February. "I did everything in my power to get home," Hudson said. Balfour, Julian's stepfather, has also been charged with one count of home invasion.
