Several of Sheridan's former cast mates -- including Eva Longoria, Marcia Cross, James Denton, Felicity Huffman and Neal McDonough -- are on the list of witnesses expected to defend Cherry. Once lawyers deliver their openings to the jury, Sheridan is expected to testify in her wrongful termination lawsuit against series creator-producer-writer Marc Cherry and ABC. The suit alleges that "during a rehearsal for the show, when Sheridan questioned Cherry about something that was in the script, Cherry took her aside and forcefully hit her with his hand across her face and head." Sheridan complained to ABC executives about the September 2008 incident, but "nevertheless, Cherry's abusive and aggressive behavior towards Sheridan not only persisted, it worsened," the suit contends. Defense lawyers argue that Cherry "lightly tapped her head in giving her direction for a scene," and "the decision that the character of Edie would die was made before the incident and was primarily a creative decision." Sheridan's lawyers contend it is "exceptionally unusual for a popular character to be killed off or written out of a television series unless the actor has requested to be released from his or her contract."
