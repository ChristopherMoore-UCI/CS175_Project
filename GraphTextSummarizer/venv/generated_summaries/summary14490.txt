"The reasons for high number of incidence of female feticide in India include a deep-rooted traditional son preference, continued practice of dowry and concern for safety of the girl child and exploitation and abuse of women and girl children," India's Women and Child Development Minister Krishna Tirath told Parliament last month. It's illegal in India to abort a child just because of its sex, but such abortions happen, often aided by illegal clinics. The 2011 census recorded an alarming drop in the percentage of girls among India's preschoolers. That's the lowest ratio since India gained independence in 1947, said the preliminary census. To try to restore balance, several Indian states have announced incentives for the birth of baby girls and have criminalized sex-selective abortions, she said.
