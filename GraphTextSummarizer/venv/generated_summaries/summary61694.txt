"With old houses of any style, especially those that have been in the same family for generations, more than likely, there will be legends," said Sarah Lea Burns, a professor emeritus from Indiana University's department of art history, who researches haunted houses. "I always think of haunted houses being unwelcoming or scary," Keena said. People began to look at Victorian houses as unsanitary, gloomy and dark, Burns said. Later still, American Victorian homes borrowed romantic architectural elements from Gothic churches of Rome and castles of Northern Europe. They were, for the most part, progressive middle- to upper-class people, Carroll said, who owned fine homes that might still be standing today.
