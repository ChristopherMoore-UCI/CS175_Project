During the advance, NTC fighters "removed all the Gadhafi loyalists' checkpoints in that area, allowing for more revolutionaries to enter the town for the first time," said spokesman Adel Ghuleak with the NTC in Misrata. Earlier in the week, Elamin Belhaj, a senior member of the NTC, told CNN the formation of a Libyan government would not be announced until anti-Gadhafi forces controlled the borders of the country and liberated three cities that still remained under loyalist control -- Bani Walid, Sirte and Sabha -- a task that could take up to one month, he said. Mohammed Naser, the council member, said the formation of a government could take up to one week, but NTC members agreed that the interim government would include a premier, a vice premier, and 22 ministers. -- Anti-Gadhafi forces Saturday claimed a new military advance into the deposed Libyan dictator's hometown Sirte, while a fuel storage warehouse fire at the port of the country's capital city Tripoli in the west sent plumes of smoke into the air. The NTC, he said, will expand as cities are liberated in order to give representation to all regions of the country.
