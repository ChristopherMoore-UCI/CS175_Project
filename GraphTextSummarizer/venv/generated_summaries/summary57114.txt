In addition to Guede, two other suspects remain in custody in connection with the killing: Amanda Knox, 20, Kercher's roommate, and Knox's boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, 23. Kercher, an exchange student at Perugia's university, was killed late on November 1 in the villa where she lived, according to police. The decision on a second autopsy is expected some time Tuesday, Francesco Marasco, the Kercher family's lawyer, told reporters in Perugia Monday. Knox, from Seattle, has told police that she is unclear about what took place on the night of Kercher's death. A source in the prosecutor's office said forensic police will return to the villa before Friday's court hearing to determine whether Solliceto and Knox should continue to be held by police.
