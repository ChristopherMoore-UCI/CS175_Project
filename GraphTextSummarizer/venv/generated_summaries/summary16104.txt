" Mohammed made the difficult, sometimes dangerous journey from Aleppo to this Turkish border town to try on this third generation of prosthetic limb. " It can take months of physical therapy and a succession of different prostheses before patients' bodies can adjust to walking on new limbs. At the charity, craftsmen grind metal on lathes and sculpt, and bake plaster for new limbs. Funded in large part by Syrian expatriates, the project's directors say it has provided limbs and therapy for free for more than 350 patients. Part workshop, part physical therapy clinic, the National Syrian Project for Prosthetic Limbs manufactures artificial legs.
