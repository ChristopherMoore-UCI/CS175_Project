Or, closer to home, imagine if Mexican security forces killed civilians in an operation with any level of U.S. support, said Christopher Sabatini, senior director of policy at the Americas Society/Council of the Americas. The mission -- carried out aboard helicopters owned by the U.S. State Department and with support of Drug Enforcement Administration agents -- laid bare the reach of U.S. involvement in Honduran security missions, as well as its associated risks. Unlike other U.S. anti-drug aid, like Plan Colombia, there does not appear to be the same strict limits on the role of American agents, Sabatini said. "My sense is that Hondurans are finding themselves in a desperate situation and they really want U.S. cooperation, and that gives the U.S. some margin to make mistakes," said Michael Shifter, president of the Inter-American Dialogue. -- Nearly a month has passed since a joint Honduran-U.S. drug raid fired upon a riverboat that survivors say was carrying civilians, not traffickers.
