Paging Dr. Livingstone One of Malawi's great claims to fame is its connection to Scottish explorer David Livingstone, who in the mid-1800s led the legendary Zambezi Expedition through the area. "We have over 2,000 hippos just in this area and 360 species of birds," says Danger Chipino, a wilderness safari guide at Liwonde National Park. Catching the 'big five' Malawi only recently got in the game of introducing visitors to the "big five" (the Majete Wildlife Reserve became the first safari park in 2012 after a nine-year and $2.5 million drive to restock the park with big game). At nearly 30,000 square kilometers, Lake Malawi is the third largest lake in Africa, and the ninth biggest in the world. When we read the histories, we find he sailed through this river to Lake Malawi," says Chipino.
