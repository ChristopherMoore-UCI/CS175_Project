Beavers and other homeless say they were tired of a shelter system that often splits up families into different housing, does not provide a place for people to keep their possessions while they look for work and offers too few beds. "We're here for people in rough times and homeless, but if you are doing it to yourself, then this isn't the place for you." "One of the concerns that people had was about crime and people breaking into their home and children being molested and noise. Johnny Turner, a homeless man who helped found the camp, says he would like to see Nickelsville grow into a permanent shelter that could accept more people needing a place to go. Still, there aren't always beds available for every person needing one, and sometimes families do need to be placed in different shelters.
