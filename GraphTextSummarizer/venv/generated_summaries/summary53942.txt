The advertisement in the Apple Daily asks if Hong Kongers approve of spending HK$1,000,000 (US$128,925) every 18 minutes to take care of children borne by mainland parents and declares that "Hong Kong people have had enough!" -- Tensions between Hong Kong residents and visitors from mainland China ratcheted up Wednesday, after a full-page advertisement decrying a so-called invasion of "locusts" from across the border appeared in a local newspaper. On Tuesday, Hong Kong Hospital Authority official said in a radio interview that public hospitals may ban mainland mothers to ensure that local pregnant women can be accommodated. This follows a decision last year by Hong Kong Secretary for Food and Health, York Chow, to cap the number of non-local women giving birth in the city in 2012 at 35,000. "The greatest fear Hong Kong people have is Hong Kong becoming just one more city in China," Chinese University of Hong Kong anthropologist Gordon Mathews told Time magazine last week.
