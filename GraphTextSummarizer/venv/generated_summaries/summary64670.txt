Fiorina founded Unlocking Potential in 2014, which raised about $1.8 million for the mid-term election cycle to support Republican Senate candidates in Iowa, Colorado, North Carolina, New Hampshire and Colorado, according to reports filed with the Federal Election Commission. A Harvard Law School-educated attorney, she previously worked as the political director for Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz's campaign and advised presidential nominee Mitt Romney in 2012. RELATED: Welcome to 2015, where it's all about 2016 Fiorina, the former Hewlett-Packard CEO who ran unsuccessfully for Senate in California in 2010, has never held public office, but she is currently the only Republican woman to publicly express serious interest in running for the party nomination. She visited in New Hampshire last year, the state that holds the first-in-the-nation primary, and plans to attend a forum in Iowa, another early-voting state, later this month. Should Fiorina transition the PAC's operations into a presidential campaign, Isgur Flores would serve as deputy campaign manager, according to the PAC.
