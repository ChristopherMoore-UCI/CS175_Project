The Newton archive is part of Cambridge's Digital Library project that will eventually showcase other important scientific papers, including the works of Charles Darwin, Lord Kelvin and Ernest Rutherford. -- A huge collection of papers belonging to pioneering scientist Sir Isaac Newton -- the father of gravity -- has been posted online by Cambridge University. More than 4,000 pages of Newton material have been digitized so far, with archivists photographing and uploading as many as 200 pages a day. The archive includes Newton's college notebooks and some of his most important writings from the 1660s on mathematics and calculus, optics and gravity. They appear alongside an annotated copy of "Principia Mathematica," the book in which Newton set out his laws of motion and gravity, and which is regarded as one of the world's most significant scientific works.
