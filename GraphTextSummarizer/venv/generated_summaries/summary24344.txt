Analysts said North Korea was likely to continue with the provocative moves under Kim that have strained its relations with South Korea, the United States and others. The ruthless disposal of Jang Song Thaek -- Kim's uncle by marriage who had, until recently, been regarded as the second-most powerful figure in the secretive, nuclear-armed nation -- has serious implications for North Korea, its neighbors and the United States, observers said. Jang, who was married to Kim's aunt, was vice chairman of North Korea's top military body and had often been pictured beside the young leader, who is believed to be around 30. But exactly what is going on inside the notoriously opaque North Korea regime remains as murky as ever. "We don't have a clear sense of this at all," said Victor Cha, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies who represented the United States in nuclear talks with North Korea.
