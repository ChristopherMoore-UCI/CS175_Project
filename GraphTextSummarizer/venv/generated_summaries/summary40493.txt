Congress has worked hard to tighten laws to combat money laundering and tax evasion, but incorporation laws continue to allow the formation and operation of anonymous shell companies that fly under the radar, making it nearly impossible for law enforcement to do its job. Even more troubling, this example demonstrates just how easy it is to exploit U.S. laws and use anonymous companies to funnel money through the financial system. The president's son, despite a monthly salary of less than $7,000, used wire transfers and American shell companies to funnel more than $100 million through U.S. banks -- funds that allowed him to purchase (PDF) a $35 million mansion in Malibu and a $33 million private jet. Individuals can legally disguise their identities and assets behind anonymous shell companies. But there is no reason to believe that this is the first or the last instance of campaign finance hiding behind the opacity of anonymous U.S. shell companies.
