A few days later, angry demonstrators gathered outside parliament offices in the capital of Nairobi. "It's very telling that they can hike their bonus at night quietly and teachers had to strike for three weeks," said Edward Mburu, 38, who lives in Nairobi. The proposal violates the constitution, which mandates that parliament should not set its own pay, according to human rights groups. "Coming shortly after the increment of salaries for teachers and doctors, the severance pay for parliamentarians would lead to an unsustainable wage bill at a time when the country requires massive resources to ... meet other competing demands." They carried placards reading "greedy hyenas" and hollered "thieves" as members of parliament dashed into their offices.
