Art Caplan, professor of Bioethics at NYU Langone Medical Center, says the scatter-shot way in which individual patients are left to petitioning drug companies for access to experimental drugs creates an unfair process. The standoff between Sloan and BioMarin raises the question: When should patients get access to experimental drugs? The company points to an AstraZeneca clinical trial currently enrolling ovarian cancer patients, but Sloan's doctor says she doesn't qualify. "She has a hereditary form of ovarian cancer, so we believe she has a much better chance of responding to PARP inhibitors than patients with a nonhereditary type of ovarian cancer. BioMarin points out that to date their drug has been tested in fewer than 30 patients with ovarian cancer like Sloan.
