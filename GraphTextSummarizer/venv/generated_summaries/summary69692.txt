For the launch of the flagship FEI World Cup Finals in Lyon, France the organizing body assembled the finest talent from the worlds of elite riding and ballet to show off their skills side by side. but they're very powerful," said U.S. Jumping rider Charlie Jacobs, who joined dressage champion Charlotte Dujardin and dancers from the Minsk Bolshoi for the photoshoot. Double Olympic gold medalist Charlotte Dujardin was just as impressed with her partnership with Belarusian maestro Kanstantsin Geronik -- calling it an "exciting" prelude to the competition in which she once again shattered world records. -- While most people can appreciate the grace and athleticism of ballet, dressage -- the precision art of horse riding and training -- remains a puzzling spectacle to all but a few. The evening after the photoshoot, organizers FEI took the riders to see the dancers on their own turf -- at the Lyon Amphitheatre where the Bolshoi performed Swan Lake as part of a nationwide French tour.
