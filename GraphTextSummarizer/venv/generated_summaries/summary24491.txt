But since only the two counts of alleged tax fraud still stand, Castro must decide whether to apply a legal precedent in Spain that if the state prosecutor wasn't pressing charges for tax fraud, which is the situation for the princess, then no trial would be held. Before the three-judge panel issued its 160-page ruling Friday -- in response to appeals by various parties to the case -- the court official, by custom not identified, had told CNN that the princess almost certainly would have faced trial if the court had upheld all three charges against her. A small union called Manos Limpias, or Clean Hands, is alone in pressing the tax fraud charges against her, as a kind of private prosecution, permitted in Spain. -- A court in Spain on Friday dropped the most serious charge facing Princess Cristina, a sister of King Felipe VI, raising the possibility that she could avoid a court trial in a financial scandal. Urdangarin and some 15 other defendants who are charged in the case are expected to face trial, the court official said.
