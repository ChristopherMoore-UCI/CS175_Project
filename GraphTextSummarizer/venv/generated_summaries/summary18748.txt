In the backwaters of India's southern state of Kerala, traditional village life goes on much as it has for the last 50 years. Most companies arrange for stops at villages selling local crafts and wares. There are dozens of little canals connected by ramshackle footbridges, while local shacks sell everything from candy and soft drinks to Toddy, a popular local alcoholic drink. For centuries, Kerala's remote backwater communities used kettuvallam boats to transport rice from the paddy fields to market towns.
