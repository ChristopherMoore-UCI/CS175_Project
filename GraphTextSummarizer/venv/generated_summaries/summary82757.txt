" Oregon mall gunman: 'I have lived one crazy life so far' Roberts attended Milwaukie High School for three years but did not graduate, said Joe Krumm, the director of community relations for North Clackamas County School District. She wasn't breathing." Clackamas County Sheriff Craig Roberts said about 10,000 people were in the mall at the time. " Jordan Salazar, who attended Milwaukie High School in the Portland area with Roberts, said in an e-mail, "He was a really nice guy, and it's completely shocking he did this." Roberts then transferred to another district and graduated in 2008 from Oregon City High School, the school said in a statement on its website that also talked about the killings. I don't know what caused him to do such a horrendous, terrible thing, but I do hope that somehow answers will be available to us all." Philpot, who attended middle school and high school with Roberts, said he had recently broken up with a girlfriend and was considering moving to Hawaii.
