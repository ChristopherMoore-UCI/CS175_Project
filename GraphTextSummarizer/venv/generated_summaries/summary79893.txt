Some privately owned communities also have succeeded in asking the company to remove Street View and satellite images from Maps. " People frequently ask Google to remove content they find objectionable on its Maps pages, including Street View and Google Earth. "The Google Maps team takes a number of steps to help protect the privacy and anonymity of individuals when images are collected for Street View, including blurring faces and license plates. " The image, which was still accessible on Google Maps on Monday afternoon, shows a police cruiser and a small group of people standing near what appears to be a prone human form near a set of train tracks. The U.S. military prohibits Google from capturing images of military installations, and the company has cooperated with a request to remove ones that already existed.
