The transposed numbers were fixed Tuesday morning using composite granite, according to George Arzt, Koch's former press secretary as mayor and his spokesman until his death. Koch was born December 12, 1924, but his tombstone at Trinity Church Cemetery in Upper Manhattan made him appear 18 years younger than he was -- December 12, 1942, was set in stone. -- Former New York Mayor Ed Koch has been dead for more than four months, but a mistake on his tombstone likely would have amused him. Koch was a U.S. congressman from 1968 until he ran for New York mayor in 1977. Arzt told CNN on Tuesday.
