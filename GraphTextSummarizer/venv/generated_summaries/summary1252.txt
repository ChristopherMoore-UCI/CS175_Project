Overall, green energy investments combined with carbon taxes can create 2.7 million jobs in areas such as renewable energy, construction, manufacturing, transportation, new technologies and services -- even taking into account the transitional job loss from fossil fuel industries. Compensation to job losers, paid from carbon tax revenues, can be modeled after federal programs such as the Trade Adjustment Assistance for displaced trade workers or the Pentagon's program that helps communities that lose military bases. Without carbon taxes, we treat our environment -- air, oceans and fresh water -- as a garbage dump where we fill up excess carbon. But the garbage can is overflowing because carbon emitters don't pay the full price for carbon emissions. In fact, many fossil fuel job losses already have taken place.
