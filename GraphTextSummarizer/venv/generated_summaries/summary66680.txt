Brothers, whose charming, reassuring demeanor appealed to television audiences, became a television star as a game show contestant, a sports interviewer, then as a psychologist answering audience questions about relationships and other emotional subjects. She grew her fame as a frequent guest on television talk shows and as an advice columnist for Good Housekeeping magazine for four decades and for newspapers throughout the United States. And America saw her often on television, not only giving advice but making fun of herself. Years later, she wrote books and had radio shows. Brothers also appeared on shows like "The Love Boat" playing a character, often a doctor.
