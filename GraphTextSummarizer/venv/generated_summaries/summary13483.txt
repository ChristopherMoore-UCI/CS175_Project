"Now when you are a quarterback at Alabama, you see that lovely lady there, she does go to Auburn, I want to admit that, but she's also Miss Alabama and that's AJ McCarron's girlfriend, OK," ESPN broadcaster Brent Musburger said Monday night as the camera focused on Katherine Webb in the stands. CNN was not able to reach Musburger for comment through ESPN, but the network responded, saying: "We always try to capture interesting storylines and the relationship between an Auburn grad who is Miss Alabama and the current Alabama quarterback certainly met that test. So when a blossoming blowout between the University of Alabama and some other team in Monday night's college football championship floated into yawnfest territory, the electronic eyes of ESPN naturally went wandering -- settling on a brunette bombshell who just happens to be the girlfriend of Crimson Tide quarterback AJ McCarron. The attention prompted thousands of football fans to check out of the game and check up on McCarron's flame, turning "Katherine Webb" into Google's second-hottest search -- behind only McCarron himself.
