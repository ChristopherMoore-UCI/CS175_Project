Two of the girls have been charged with assault with a deadly weapon and conspiracy, and two others have been charged with simple assault and conspiracy, said Providence Police Sgt. Ryan said additional cell phone video of the attack was turned in to police after it was confiscated at Woonsocket Middle School. -- A man filmed a group of girls attacking a 12-year-old girl in his neighbor's garden, and told Providence, Rhode Island, police he thought it was a prank. " Gingerella said the other girls posed as her daughter via text message, quickly canceling a request from her daughter to be picked up with a message saying, "Can I please stay the night?" After the incident, Gingerella's daughter started to walk home before being picked up by one of her friends, who she begged not to tell her mother about the incident because she was afraid of retribution, Gingerella said. Gingerella said the leader of the girls invited her daughter to spend Friday night at her house and that all was normal between the girls.
