Last season Manchester City overhauled an eight-point deficit to win the club's first league title in 44 years on a dramatic final day of the season, and a similar effort will again be required this time. Not only is there the bragging rights fought for between the bitterly opposed tribes of Manchester United and Liverpool, but the result can bear more resonance than just the effect it has on the Premier League title race. "We're 24 points behind United -- but we're not 24 points behind in quality," said defiant Liverpool manager Brendan Rogers. It doesn't matter where you are in the league," United manager Alex Ferguson said after his team's 2-1 victory at Old Trafford on Sunday. The 23-year-old England international was fastest to react after captain Steven Gerrard forced a parried save from United keeper David de Gea just three minutes after Vidic's goal.
