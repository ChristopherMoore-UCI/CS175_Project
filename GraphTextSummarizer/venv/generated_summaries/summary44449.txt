Iranian forces have repeatedly shelled the border area between Iran and Iraq's autonomous Kurdish region, targeting Kurdish rebels who say they want their own independent country. Like Turkey and Iraq, Iranian forces have had repeated battles with ethnic Kurdish fighters. Iranian forces have launched a fresh offensive against Kurdish rebels, with a senior military commander telling a state-run news agency Saturday that 30 rebels were killed or injured in the operation. The PJAK group is part of an alliance of Kurdish rebel groups that includes the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, which conducts attacks against Turkey from northern Iraq. This group is considered a terror group by the United States, though the IRNA report claims that Iranian officials repeatedly have complained such Kurdish rebels are being supported by Washington.
