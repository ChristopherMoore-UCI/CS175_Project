Isner crashed out in the second round of the Sydney International warm-up event -- where he was top seed -- to fellow American Ryan Harrison and complained of a recurrence of the injury which kept him out the recent Hopman Cup tournament in Perth. Harrison chalked up his first ever win over an opponent ranked inside the world's top 15 with his 6-4 6-4 success against Isner on Wednesday, but he lost his quarterfinal match 6-4 6-2 to Frenchman Julien Benneteau. "I am extremely disappointed to announce that I have to withdraw from the Australian Open," Isner, who had been seeded 13th for the year's first grand slam, told the ATP Tour's official website on Thursday. " Isner, a winner of five titles since turning pro in 2007, has never advanced beyond the fourth round of the Melbourne grand slam. Benneteau, the 2012 Sydney runner-up, will now be seeded at the Australian Open following Isner's withdrawal.
