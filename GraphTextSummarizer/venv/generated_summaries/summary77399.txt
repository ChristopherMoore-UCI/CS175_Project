New documents shed light on Trayvon Martin killing "The encounter between George Zimmerman and Trayvon Martin was ultimately avoidable by Zimmerman, if Zimmerman had remained in his vehicle and awaited the arrival of law enforcement, or conversely if he had identified himself to Martin as a concerned citizen and initiated dialog (sic) in an effort to dispel each party's concern," the police request to arrest Zimmerman said. " Other documents released this week include Martin's autopsy report and a fire department report on Zimmerman's injuries. Another witness, however, seems to put Martin on top of George Zimmerman for at least part of the struggle, according to another recording. The girlfriend, whose name has not been made public, told Assistant State Attorney Bernie de la Rionda that Martin got away from the man, who turned out to be Zimmerman, but only temporarily. And as Zimmerman drew closer, the girl said, Martin called out, "Why you following me for?"
