"Usually when we see earthquakes of this size, we see aftershocks," said USGS geophysicist Jessica Sigala. The Solomon Islands are situated in the so-called Ring of Fire, an arc of fault lines circling the Pacific Basin that is prone to frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. Geophysicist Amy Vaughan said the USGS had received no reports of damage, and it was hard for the agency to predict what might have occurred until it hears from media or people living in the area. By 12:56 a.m. local time Wednesday, there had been five aftershocks, according to the USGS Web site. -- A 6.9-magnitude earthquake shook the Pacific Ocean near the Solomon Islands Tuesday night, one day after a string of earthquakes rattled the same area and another quake hit the Philippines, the U.S. Geological Survey said.
