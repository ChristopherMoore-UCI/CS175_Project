McCain, the Arizona Republican who will helm the Senate Armed Services Committee once new lawmakers take office in January, wrote a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder on Tuesday asking for a "fair and timely" conclusion to the case. Sen. John McCain is prodding the Justice Department to wrap up its two-year-old investigation into David Petraeus, the former Army general and Central Intelligence Agency director. He questioned the pace of the investigation into whether Petraeus inappropriately shared information with Paula Broadwell, his mistress who was also writing a biography of the former leader of U.S. military efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan. McCain said he regretted wading into an ongoing investigation, and said he wouldn't judge whether Petraeus should face charges -- only that he wanted a quick conclusion. He's also joined the investment firm KKR and has taken roles with Harvard University, the University of Southern California, the University of Exeter, Team Rubicon and the Royal United Services Institute.
