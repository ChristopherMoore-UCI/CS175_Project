Kunming's railway station is one of the largest in southwest China. As is common in the aftermath of attacks, the casualty figures were in flux: in the same story, Xinhua reported that at least 28 civilians had been killed and 113 wounded and that 29 were confirmed dead and more than 130 wounded. Members of a separatist group from Xinjiang, in northwest China, are believed to have carried out the assault, authorities said. Mass knife attacks are not unprecedented in China. Frequent outbreaks of violence have beset Xinjiang, a resource-rich area where the arrival of waves of Han Chinese people over the decades has fueled tensions with the Uyghurs, a Turkic-speaking, predominantly Muslim ethnic group.
