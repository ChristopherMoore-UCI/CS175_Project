Wednesday, the president called House Speaker John Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to discuss the impasse, the White House said. Boehner prevented a direct vote on the Senate bill Tuesday, signaling that House GOP leaders may lack enough Republican support to defeat it in the face of unrelenting pressure from the White House, congressional Democrats and some Senate Republicans. During their phone call, Boehner told Obama that House Republicans were "elected to change the way Washington does business and that we should not waste the next ten days simply because it is an inconvenient time of year," an aide to the speaker said. A two-month extension passed overwhelmingly with bipartisan support by the Democratic-controlled Senate "is the only option to ensure that middle class families aren't hit with a tax hike in 10 days and gives both sides the time needed to work out a full year solution," White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters. Despite mounting pressure on House Republicans to give in and pass a short-term extension, a well- placed House GOP source indicated his side would not consider an end-game to the standoff until next week, just days before the deadline for taxes to go up.
