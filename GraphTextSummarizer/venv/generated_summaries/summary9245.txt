Faceook has created a similar one-stop home for the tournament, Trending World Cup. Clint Dempsey may have scored the go-ahead goal for the United States in what would ultimately be a gut-wrenching tie with Portugal in Sunday's World Cup game. The Cup's opening match, between host country Brazil and Croatia, spurred 12.2 million tweets alone -- possibly not surprising when you consider that soccer-crazy Brazil has the fifth-most Twitter users in the world, behind the  United States, United  Kingdom, Canada and Australia. When a user tweets the hashtag for a World Cup team -- #USA or #MEX, for example -- the nation's flag will appear as an image beside it. In addition to letting users choose their favorite nation's flag as their avatar, Twitter has created a dedicated #WorldCup feed featuring tweets from selected clubs, media outlets, players and even FIFA, the international soccer governing body.
