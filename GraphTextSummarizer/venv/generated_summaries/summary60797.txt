Chinese state media extensively reported on "Linsanity," or "Linfengkuang," hailing Lin as the pride of China. Some Chinese blog posts have taken shots at their own government by saying that had Lin grown up in China, he would have ended up as an illiterate and mediocre player for the People's Liberation Army team, or by needling with the question, "Why is the first Asian point guard in the NBA not a Chinese national?" Second, the recent red carpet treatment of China's likely new president, Xi, in the U.S. -- and the absence of any major agreements -- shows that the future of U.S.-China relations will be difficult. The "Linsanity" story, as it is known in New York, thrives because it shatters all stereotypes -- an Ivy Leaguer who can play in the NBA; a scholar-athlete who is not just a token "racial diversity" player in a predominantly African-American league; a devout Christian, who puts God, family and team before himself in the "all-about-me" world of professional sports; an Asian-American in the NBA -- until Lin, virtually an oxymoron. After that, Chinese state media praised her as "the Empress of French tennis" and the "pride of China." Whether it is the economy (demands for China to act as a stakeholder in global economic recovery and trade fairly), security (demands for transparency on its military buildup), global affairs (complaints about China's veto of a U.N. resolution on Syria), or society (demands for better human rights in China), the U.S. list of complaints about China is long.
