Goal-line technology enters final testing Scientists and FIFA officials will analyze the results and if they prove successful, the technology could be ratified at a meeting of the International Football Association Board (IFAB) in early July. A statement on FIFA's website said: "Only the EMPA observers, IFAB and FIFA representatives at Wembley will have access to the GLT system readings. At a meeting of the world governing body's executive committee, chief medical officer Jiri Dvorak said match officials should be subject to the same tests as players. That incident in South Africa prompted FIFA to overturn their long-held stance on goal-line technology and begin trials. Forty-six years later, the same London stadium will provide the setting for a major test of pioneering goal-line technology (GLT), that could revolutionize the game of football forever.
