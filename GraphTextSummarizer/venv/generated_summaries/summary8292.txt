Mallorca, who also had a player red-carded, suffered their first home league defeat this season despite taking a fifth-minute lead through Mario Suarez. Midfielder Andres Iniesta took advantage of some slack defending to pounce for his first goal this season in the seventh minute, hooking home a left-foot effort after the ball ran loose in his 300th outing for the club. Barca took their foot off the pedal in the second half, but 18-year-old Thiago scored his first senior goal in the 84th minute with a deflected shot after Lionel Messi set him up with a cutback. The Swede is in doubt for Tuesday's Champions League trip to German club Stuttgart due to a swollen ankle. Meanwhile, Jose Mourinho extended his remarkable unbeaten run in home league matches to 130 as his Italian champions Inter Milan held on to draw 0-0 with Sampdoria on Saturday despite having two men sent off.
