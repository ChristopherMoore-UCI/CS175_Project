The Danish Security and Intelligence Service Tuesday said police arrested a 40-year-old Dane of Moroccan origin and two Tunisians in the Aarhus area of western Denmark following lengthy surveillance. CNN's Paula Newton said the arrests reinforced growing fears in Europe that radical Islam was trying to suppress free speech. Violent demonstrations erupted across the world in early 2006 after other newspapers reprinted the images as a matter of free speech. Berlingske Tidende, was one of the newspapers involved in the republication by newspapers in Denmark. Many protesters directed their ire at Denmark, prompting the closure of several Danish embassies in predominantly Muslim countries, including Indonesia and Pakistan.
