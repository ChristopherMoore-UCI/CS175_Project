Nearly one-third of passengers say they have accidentally forgotten to turn off their smartphones and other electronic devices in flight, according to this week's joint study by the Airline Passenger Experience Association and Consumer Electronics Association. During those noncritical phases of flight, the airlines set their own policies regarding passenger use of non-transmitting electronic devices. Almost every adult passenger who travels with portable electronic devices carried at least one such device on board, and nearly two-thirds used them in flight, the study found. The FAA bans the use of wireless devices during flight because of "potential interference to the aircraft's navigation and communication systems." The FCC forbids the use of mobile phones using the 800 MHz frequency and other wireless devices on aircraft in flight because of "potential interference to wireless networks on the ground."
