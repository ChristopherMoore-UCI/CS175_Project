-- Police arrested hundreds of protesters who occupied an iconic New York bridge during demonstrations against the nation's financial system, before releasing the demonstrators with tickets. "Over 700 summonses and desk appearance tickets have been issued in connection with the demonstration on the Brooklyn Bridge ... after multiple warnings by police were given to protesters to stay on the pedestrian walkway," said Paul J. Browne, deputy commissioner for the New York City Police Department. Over the past two weeks, demonstrations have addressed various issues, including police brutality, union busting and the economy, the group said. The "Occupy Wall Street" protesters extended their rally to Brooklyn Bridge, where they were cited for blocking the roadway, authorities said late Saturday. Protesters banged drums and chanted, "the whole world is watching" as police moved in.
