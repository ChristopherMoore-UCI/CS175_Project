" Human rights allegations The release of Bae and Miller comes a month after North Korean officials appeared to go on the offensive, taking questions at the United Nations, arranging human rights talks with the European Union and taking a high-level trip to South Korea. It was an abrupt about-face for North Korea, which only a year earlier had conducted an underground nuclear test and threatened attacks against South Korea and the United States. China and North Korea have been close allies, since China backed the North in the Korean War in the 1950s. "I think right now there is a charm offensive," Gordon Chang, the author of "Nuclear Showdown: North Korea Takes On the World," told CNN. "I do believe it's a positive sign," Bill Richardson, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations who tried to win Bae's release during a 2013 visit to North Korea, told CNN.
