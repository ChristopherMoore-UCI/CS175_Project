Hong Kong is home to more than 200 outlying Islands, including Lamma, which lies to the southwest of Hong Kong Island -- the city's financial center. One of the vessels, owned by The Hong Kong Electric Company, was carrying company employees and their families to watch the scheduled fireworks display when it was struck by a passenger ferry traveling from Hong Kong Island to Lamma. -- At least 36 people have died after two passenger boats collided off Hong Kong's Lamma Island on Monday evening, throwing more than 100 people into the sea. The crash happened on a night when Hong Kong's busy waters were even more crowded than usual, as the city celebrated China's National Day. Government officials said the collision occurred off Lamma's coast at around 8:20 p.m. local time.
