Boko Haram massacre: Seven questions worth asking March for Paris, but don't overlook Boko Haram horror CNN's Aminu Abubakar reported and wrote from Kano, Nigeria. Nigerian military disorganized, under-equipped in battle against Boko Haram Scores of Boko Haram militants in 10 pickups and two motorcycles attempted to storm the town, 200 kilometers (about 124 miles) south of the Borno State capital, Maiduguri, around 7:30 a.m. local time. Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan arrived in Maiduguri in northeastern Nigeria where the terror group Boko Haram is highly active, according to presidential spokesman Reuben Abati. Earlier the country's military said that Nigerian soldiers had thwarted a Boko Haram attack on Wednesday in the town of Biu in the restive northeastern section of the country. Boko Haram has terrorized northern Nigeria regularly since 2009, attacking police, schools, churches and civilians, and bombing government buildings.
