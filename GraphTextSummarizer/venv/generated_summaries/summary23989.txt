On Monday, the state-run Kenya Broadcasting Corporation reported that Kenyan troops were gearing up for an assault of Afmadow in south central Somalia, a key location in the effort to capture Kismayo. Kenyan forces entered Somalia on October 15 in a strike on Al-Shabaab, a Somali militant group that Kenya blames for the recent kidnappings of foreigners from northern Kenya. -- Somalia's president has spoken out against Kenya's military incursion into his country, saying his nation's African neighbor has overstepped its bounds by pursuing Islamic militants beyond its borders. Kenyan forces had pushed 35 kilometers (about 22 miles) north into Somalia as of Monday, KBC reported, and were conducting aerial assaults against Al-Shabaab positions in Kismayo. Victoria Nuland, a State Department spokeswoman, reiterated that point Tuesday, saying, "The United States is not participating in Kenya's current operation in Somalia."
