At the core of Janine's beliefs is that nature has already spent 3.8 billion years on research and development. In her capacity as  "biologist at the design table," Janine helps companies like Nike and Hewlett Packard to innovate and improve their designs by using what already exists in nature. "From interiors, manufacturing everything from apparel to transportation to bath and kitchen and carpets and furniture and sneakers, and even cities," she told CNN. Janine is a  champion of the biomimicry movement and helps companies to improve designs by turning to Nature. Before Janine wrote her book, there wasn't even a word to describe the work of a few scattered scientists looking for inspiration through nature in different corners of the world.
