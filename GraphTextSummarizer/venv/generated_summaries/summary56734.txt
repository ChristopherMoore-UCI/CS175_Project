-- Spain's best-known judge, Baltasar Garzon, went on trial Tuesday in Madrid for the second time in two weeks, accused of abusing his judicial authority during his investigation of human rights abuses under the former dictatorship of Spain's Francisco Franco. Since his suspension in 2010, Garzon has been working as a legal adviser outside of Spain on human rights cases and judicial issues, including in Latin America. Garzon spent 22 years as an investigating magistrate at the National Court, which handles cases of terrorism and other delicate cases. In the financial corruption case that Garzon was investigating, and which still has ongoing trials against defendants in various parts of Spain, Garzon ordered electronic surveillance against some defendants being held in jail, and some of their conversations were with their lawyers. Reed Brody of Human Rights Watch said the trial against Garzon for his Franco investigation "is the first time in a consolidated democracy" and in the European Union that a judge "is indicted for investigating human rights abuses.
