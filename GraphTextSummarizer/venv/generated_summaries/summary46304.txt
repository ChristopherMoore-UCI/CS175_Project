In early March, Borno state government closed all of its 85 secondary schools and sent more than 120,000 students home following increasing Boko Haram attacks on schools. Boko Haram, which translates as "western education is sin," is known to have carried out deadly attacks on other schools in the northeast. "The Boko Haram attackers came to town around 9 p.m. and made straight for the school where they had a gun battle with soldiers stationed at the school and killed two soldiers," said Chibok resident Maina Babagana. The group has recently stepped up attacks in the region, and its leader released a video last month threatening to kidnap girls from schools. In a clip released by the group March 23, leader Abubakar Shekau threatened to launch raids and abduct girls from schools.
