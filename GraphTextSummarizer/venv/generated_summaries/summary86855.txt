The system opens the door for what's likely inevitable: having news sites rely on Facebook to identify its users and eventually to serve ads to its readers based on their individual Facebook pages. Facebook is clearly gaining more of a presence around the web with its ubiquitous Like buttons and its easy-to-use login system for sites, including its often-creepy automated login system on sites like Yelp and Pandora. But even if you don't use Facebook Connect, the movement seems to be away from a collection of site profiles and passwords and toward a single one that gives you entry to your collection, be it from Google, Yahoo, OpenID or others. The immediate drawbacks of Facebook's commenting system match the larger issues of the social networking site. Facebook will likely create some sort of export system, if only to assuage potential publications, though given Facebook's history with exporting, it will likely be bare bones and not particularly useful in practice.
