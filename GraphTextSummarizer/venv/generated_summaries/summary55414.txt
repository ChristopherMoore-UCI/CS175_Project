The men told an FBI undercover agent they wanted to provide weapons and explosives to al Qaeda in Iraq, court documents said. "These are experienced terrorists who willingly and enthusiastically participated in what they believed were insurgent support operations designed to harm American soldiers in Iraq," stated U.S. Attorney David Hale. "These two former Iraqi insurgents participated in terrorist activities overseas and attempted to continue providing material support to terrorists while they lived here in the United States," said Assistant Attorney General for National Security Lisa Monaco. In 2010 and early 2011, Hammadi and Alwan provided sniper rifles, C4 plastic explosives, and two Stinger missiles to a truck they believed would be shipped to al Qaeda in Iraq. Hammadi pleaded guilty in August to 12 counts, including four counts of aiding al Qaeda in Iraq, authorities said.
