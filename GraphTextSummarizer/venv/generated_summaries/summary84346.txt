There's also little political incentive for those in tough congressional races to talk about gun policy since several national polls suggest voters are against stricter gun laws, and there's actually been a downturn both in the number of people owning guns overall and gun violence, said Kristin A. Goss, an associate professor of public policy and political science at Duke University and author of "Disarmed: The Missing Movement for Gun Control in America." For example, a Pew Research Center poll conducted in April, found that 55% of independent voters feel it is "more important to protect gun ownership than to control guns," with 40% saying controlling gun ownership is more important. "You can push (gun control) through, then bam, Gore loses," Lizotte said. "With the schedule we have, we're not going to get into the debate on gun control," Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, told CNN. But we're not going to address gun control.
