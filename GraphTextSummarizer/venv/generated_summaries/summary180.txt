Agee and Humayun continue working on different Black Beauty samples separately, but not as rivals, said Agee. Black Beauty had initially been described in a Science study published in February, led by Agee, which dated it to about 2.1 billion years old. Black Beauty, they say, may be the first identified example of crust from ancient Mars, and its age suggests that the planet's crust formed within the first 100 million years of Mars' existence. Once the word got out that Black Beauty was from Mars, the nomads scoured for more pieces of the meteorite, some of which ended up with Humayun. It's really old, older than we thought Black Beauty contains zircon crystal grains that are 4.4 billion years old, according to the new study.
