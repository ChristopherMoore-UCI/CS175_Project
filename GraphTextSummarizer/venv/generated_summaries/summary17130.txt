The tarmac incident is not believed to be terrorism-related, FBI special agent Michael Leverock said. Leverock said part of a shirt inside the bag was charred, but the movement of the bag is what set off the explosion. -- A 37-year-old airline passenger was arrested Tuesday in Miami after primer caps for bullets ignited while a baggage handler was unloading a roll-on bag, the FBI said. Hundreds of the primer caps were in a bag that ignited, and all of them went off after the first one did, Leverock said. Leverock would not provide details or speculate on how the bag might have gotten on the plane.
