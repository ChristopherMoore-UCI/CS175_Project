-- Futoshi Toba's wife was killed by last year's tsunami but as a father of two and mayor of Rikuzentakata in Japan's Iwate Prefecture he has little time to grieve. Send in your memories of last year's disaster in Japan Toba spends most of his days fielding questions and demands from residents, while prioritizing the endless needs of a city on the mend. As Mayor of Rikuzentakata, time is in short supply for Toba. Mayor Toba is a potent symbol of that personal sacrifice. Toba's daily routine starts by driving his two sons -- 13-year-old Taiga and 11-year-old Kanato -- to their elementary and junior high schools; two structures that were not affected by the tsunami and the reason they were not victims of the disaster.
