"That's fine," said Abigail Phelps, the daughter of Westboro Baptist Church founder Fred Phelps. Protesting members of the controversial Westboro Baptist Church were met with an unlikely group of counter-protesters Monday at Arlington National Cemetery. A larger group of about 70 protesters -- separate from the KKK -- located across the street waved pro-USA signs and took turns shouting down the Westboro Baptist Church group. Hours before President Barack Obama led the nation's Memorial Day observances at the Tomb of the Unknowns, three members of the Westboro Baptist Church were challenged by others who disagreed with them -- including members claiming to be from the Ku Klux Klan. Some of the counter-protesters, including Malaika Elias, stood in front of the Westboro participants in an attempt to block them from street view.
