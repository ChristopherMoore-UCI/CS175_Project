-- A New York teacher's aide previously accused of distributing child pornography has been arrested again, this time on a charge of making such pornography, possibly on school grounds. Last month, FBI agents searched Brooks' home and discovered more than a thousand lewd photographs and videos, authorities said. At the time, they said, Brooks admitted that he viewed and traded child pornography on daily basis. According to the complaint, the FBI found photos and videos showing Brooks spanking a naked boy inside a classroom and touching another boy. The Department of Education had suspended him without pay after learning of the initial arrest on January 13, when the FBI charged him with distributing child pornography.
