The court was then told that when relations between Wang and Gu began to break down over the issue, Wang told "the then leading official of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Chongqing Committee" -- the position Bo held -- that Gu was "highly suspected" of having murdered Heywood, Xinhua said. But when his deputy, Wang Lijun, walked into the U.S. consulate in the city of Chengdu in February last year and told American diplomats that Bo's wife, Gu Kailai, was an accomplice in a murder case, a glittering political career began to unravel. At his own trial for abuses of power in September last year, Wang -- who was Chongqing's police chief -- was accused by prosecutors of knowing "perfectly well" that Gu was suspected of murder. During her trial the previous month, after which she received a suspended death sentence, Gu admitted poisoning Heywood, blaming a "mental breakdown" for her actions after learning that her son, Bo Guagua, was in jeopardy. In a turn of events worthy of a movie script, Gu and family aide Zhang Xiaojun were arrested in early April, suspected of poisoning British businessman and family friend Neil Heywood, who died at a Chongqing hotel in November 2011.
