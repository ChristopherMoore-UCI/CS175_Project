Top congressional Democrats renewed their push Wednesday for legislation that would remove all oil spill liability caps -- a move some Republicans warn would lead to stronger monopolies in the energy sector while increasing U.S. dependence on foreign oil sources. Sen. David Vitter, R-Louisiana, in turn pushed an alternative measure specifically holding BP liable for the current Gulf disaster without permanently repealing liability caps. "We cannot close down the Gulf ... without putting ourselves at hostage even further to the Venezuelans, the Chinese, Russia (and other oil producers) that don't have to follow" the same standards. Among other things, Democrats are targeting the 1990 Oil Pollution Act, which could limit BP's liability for economic damages incurred by the Gulf disaster to $75 million. BP has said it will waive the cap on damages and pay "all legitimate claims" as a result of the Gulf spill, the largest in U.S. history.
