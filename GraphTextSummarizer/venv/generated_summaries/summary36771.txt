Pemalu is Indonesian for "shy," which fits since researchers at the Carnivore and Pangolin Conservation Program tell me P26 is one of the shyest of all the introverted pangolins they've encountered. The fine people who are taking care of P26 -- from the Carnivore and Pangolin Conservation Program --  agreed to let CNN's readers do something kind of cool: We're going to vote on a new name for this little guy, and then follow his journey. (Pangolins have been called little dinosaurs, after all; I picture Percival the Pangolin wearing a monocle and a top hat.) You can read up on P26 on this blog from the Carnivore and Pangolin Conservation Program. P26 will take on whichever name readers select.
