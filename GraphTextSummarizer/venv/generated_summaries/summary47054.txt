The driver of the van lost control of the vehicle as he was pulling into Lot D of Yale Bowl's main parking area and the vehicle suddenly accelerated, striking the women and then crashing into other vehicles, said New Haven Police spokesman Dave Hartman. The driver of the U-Haul van was speaking with New Haven Police investigators, and the cause of the accident was still under investigation, Hartman said. "You could see the path of destruction coming in," eyewitness Bill McNeff told CNN New Haven affiliate WTNH. The game, which Harvard won, kicked off at noon in New Haven, Connecticut. One woman was pronounced dead at Yale-New Haven Hospital, where one of the other women is in serious but stable condition, Hartman said.
