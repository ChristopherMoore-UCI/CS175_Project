Others have also suggested as possible venues the London church of St. Clement Danes, the central church of the Royal Air Force, in which Prince William serves -- or the Chapel of St. Salvator at the University of St. Andrews, where the prince and Middleton met as students. -- Speculation was intense Friday over where and when Prince William will marry Kate Middleton, with many predicting the couple will choose the iconic, thousand-year-old Westminster Abbey. In general, older people and those in higher income groups were more likely to take a traditional line and be more favorable toward Charles and Camilla, compared to those who are younger or in poorer income groups, according to the poll, which surveyed 2,015 adults in Britain between Wednesday and Friday. A CNN/ComRes poll out Friday found the British public largely positive about the engagement, which was announced Tuesday, a few weeks after William proposed. Westminster Abbey is the "venue of choice" for the wedding, the Daily Mirror tabloid reported Friday, and it even published a seating plan for the big day.
