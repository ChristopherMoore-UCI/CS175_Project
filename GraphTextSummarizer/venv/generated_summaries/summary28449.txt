Whether it's dollars spent, group coverage or Medicaid income cutoffs, health care goes hand in hand with numbers. Moore says that the U.S. spends more of its gross domestic product on health care than any other country. The United States spends more than 15 percent of its GDP on health care -- no other nation even comes close to that number. As Americans continue to spend $2 trillion a year on health care, everyone agrees on one point: Things need to change, and it will take more than a movie to figure out how to get there. Like Moore, we also found that more money does not equal better care.
