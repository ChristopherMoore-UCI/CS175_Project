Actress Zsa Zsa Gabor will undergo hip replacement surgery Monday after she broke her hip when falling out of bed, her publicist said Sunday. A press conference is scheduled at Gabor's Los Angeles, California, home at noon Monday, he said. Gabor, 93, will need the surgery on her right hip, publicist John Blanchette said. An ambulance rushed her to the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles, California, after he called 911. The crash occurred when the car in which she was riding with her hairdresser slammed into a light pole on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles.
