"Records show that conditions at the last known position for the vessel, on 4 June, were very rough," Maritime New Zealand said. The weather dealt Dyche and his schooner an ill-fated hand after they left the port of Opua in northern New Zealand, with his wife and their teenage son. Nail-biting wait Family members alerted maritime authorities in New Zealand in mid-June that the Nina was missing after wondering for days why they had not heard anything from Dyche. The Nina went incommunicado while running from raging seas, 400 miles north-northwest of New Zealand. New Zealand's Rescue Coordination Centre released an undelivered text message found in the satellite phone system used by the schooner Nina.
