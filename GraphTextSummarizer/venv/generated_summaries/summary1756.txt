But Van Sickle warned it might be a little early to call McIlroy the next Tiger Woods, who won the Masters at age 21 after winning three U.S. amateur championships. On a hot April afternoon, young Rory McIlroy had the lead and only nine holes to play before he could become the Masters golf champion. While it would disappoint PGA Tour officials, McIlroy will probably continue to play overseas, Van Sickle guessed. After the Open win, Nicklaus, who's counseled McIlroy for several years, said, "He's humble when he ought to be and confident when he needs to be." It wasn't McIlroy.
