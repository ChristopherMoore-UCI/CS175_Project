" Brooks, who resigned Friday as chief executive of News International, is one of 10 people arrested in connection with the phone-hacking probe and the fourth arrested in the bribery investigation, according to police. Coulson was News of the World editor when one of the newspaper's reporters and a private investigator were sent to prison after pleading guilty to phone hacking in 2007. Police in the United Kingdom have identified almost 4,000 potential targets of phone hacking in documents recovered from a private investigator working for News of the World.
