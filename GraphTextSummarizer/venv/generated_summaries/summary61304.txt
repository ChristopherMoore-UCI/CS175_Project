Program director Ernst Wisse says this is the best and most effective way to get drug addicts off heroin. It's the only clinic in Afghanistan that is allowed to dispense methadone --- a substitute for heroin. Several times a week, the health workers visit areas around Kabul where drug addicts live and hand out clean needles, sterile swabs and offer counseling. I want to use methadone until I forget about drugs completely and to find a good way to start a normal life again. "This decision means there are only 71 clients under methadone in the whole of Afghanistan," explains Wisse.
