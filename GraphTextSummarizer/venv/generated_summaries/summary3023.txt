There were nine outbreaks of gastrointestinal illnesses on cruise ships last year, 16 in 2012 and 14 in both 2011 and 2010, according to the CDC. On Friday, the CDC confirmed that illness was also norovirus. You can get norovirus from eating infected food, so that would be considered food poisoning. Norovirus is a group of related viruses that belong to the Caliciviridae family. In fact, norovirus is the most common cause of food-borne disease outbreaks in the United States, according to the CDC.
