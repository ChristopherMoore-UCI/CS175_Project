Others, meanwhile, fret about what the larger issue of selling off state assets will do to Greece in the medium to long term. Greece is in the process of shedding state-owned assets as dictated by the conditions of its IMF, European Commission and European Central Bank bailout. The Greek government hopes the sale of its stake in Hellinikon SA (the operating company established in 2011 to develop the property) to a private investor will help ease its financial difficulties as well as lead to the development of thousands of new homes, leisure facilities and commercial space. Whether the Hellinikon sale goes to plan and brings in as much income as expected, however, will help determine whether Greece's long term privatization plans are on track or if claims the country is selling the family jewels for less than their true worth are justified. Now, the site of the old Hellinikon Airport in the south of Athens could be set to bring in billions of dollars worth of international investment to the debt-stricken nation.
