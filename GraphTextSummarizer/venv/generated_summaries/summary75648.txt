And more than a foot of snow is predicted through Wednesday for much of Upper New York state, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine. Ice could become even more of a problem after fresh snow begins early Wednesday in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. After enduring a recent record-breaking snow, New Yorkers could get a mix of snow and sleet beginning Tuesday night that could encrust the city with nearly half an inch of ice by Wednesday. Last month, extreme cold, strong winds and snow pummeled communities from New York to Maine. Enterprise, 80 miles to the west, had already seen 13 inches of snow by Tuesday evening, CNN affiliate WIBW reported.
