The violence in the city of Khosous, north of Cairo, broke out after Coptic Christians drew crosses on the walls of a Muslim school, angering members of the Muslim community, said spokesman Ahmed Osman. The alleged perpetrators and other Christians took shelter inside a Coptic church, Osman said. -- At least five people have been killed and five more injured after clashes between Christians and Muslims in Egypt's Qalyubia province, a spokesman for Egypt's health ministry said. Tensions between Egypt's Christians and the Muslim majority are heightened. According to the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life, Egypt's population as of 2010 included an estimated 77 million Muslims and 4 million Coptic Christians.
