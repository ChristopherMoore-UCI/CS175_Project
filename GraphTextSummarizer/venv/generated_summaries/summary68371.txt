Thursday was the ninth day of the ninth month of the 99th year since the founding of Taiwan. -- "Love 99, Happiness forever" was the theme as 163 couples married in Taiwan's capital on Thursday. Among the couples married, according to the Taipei mayor's civil affairs department: one couple who have been in love for 16 years; one couple who've had a three-year long-distance relationship; and people with birthdays on September 9. The couples also received blessings from area temples, where bells were rung to celebrate the event. Taipei's Mayor Hau Lung-bin served as the chief witness, and sent out his blessing at 9:09 a.m.
