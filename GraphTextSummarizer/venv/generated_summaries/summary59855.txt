But he warned that flight recorders recovered from other crash sites have not worked when they should have, with the reverse also true. Investigators: Jet crash data recovered Soon after, Brazil's air control contacted Dakar's control center in North Africa and reported that AF 447 was entering an area on its route known for constant bands of severe turbulence, officials said. Flight 447 -- which was en route to Paris from Rio de Janeiro -- made its last contact with Brazil's Atlantic Control Center (ACC) at around 01:33 GMT on June 1, 2009, informing the center of the plane's position as it crossed the Atlantic. Up until recently, the memory module of the aircraft's data recorder -- a vital device for crash investigators which records any instructions sent to the aircraft's electronic systems -- had been missing. Tests have already brought into question the performance of pitot tubes, which measure the pressure exerted on the plane as it flies through the air, and are part of a system used to determine air speed.
