In just 24 hours, Phoenix saw more than 6 inches of rain, said Chad Myers, CNN meteorologist and severe weather expert. By Monday afternoon rains had stopped in Phoenix, but storms could pick up again overnight, Myers said. Videos and photographs from CNN affiliates showed cars submerged in fast-moving floodwaters. The students at Perkins Elementary school, about 60 miles from Las Vegas, were with teachers and not in danger, said Highway Patrol Spokesman Loy Hixson. In Phoenix, the flooding left morning commuters stranded on Interstate 10, CNN affiliate KTVK reported.
