Potter 101: A guide to Harry Potter Â» Heavy stuff, certainly, but it's a challenge on par with the stars' blossoming careers. Like her co-star Rupert Grint (Ron), Watson didn't have any acting experience when she auditioned for "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone" at age 9. Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint have kept each other "level-headed," said Radcliffe. Since then, Radcliffe has grown into international stardom, reportedly earning $25 million per Potter film. Now that the ride will soon come to an end, the cast is trying to fathom a life without the Harry Potter films -- an understandable difficulty, considering that they've grown up along with their characters.
