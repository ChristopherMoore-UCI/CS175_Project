The United States is looking to Libya's rebel movement to decide whether Lockerbie bomber Abdelbeset Ali Mohmed al Megrahi needs to return behind bars, the State Department said Monday. "Secretary (Hillary) Clinton has made clear, we believe (al Megrahi) should still be behind bars, that the decision to release was not the right decision to make," State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland told reporters Monday. "We asked the (NTC) to, as soon as it can, take a hard look at what it thinks ought to happen with Mr. Megrahi and it has committed to do that. CNN Senior International Correspondent Nic Robertson found al Megrahi under the care of his family in his palatial Tripoli villa Sunday, surviving on oxygen and an intravenous drip. The Scottish government has come under fire in recent years for its decision to release al Megrahi from prison in 2009 on the grounds that he had cancer and was not likely to live more than three months.
