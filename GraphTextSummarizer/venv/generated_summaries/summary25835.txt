It's not just Britain, however, where government surveillance is threatening to undermine our right to private online communications. As Jo Glanville, the editor of Index on Censorship, asks, "how can Western democracies back the fight for freedom in the Middle East while Western companies supply surveillance equipment to authoritarian governments in the same region?" So who do you fear more taking advantage of your online information: private Internet companies or the government? The use of surveillance technology by authoritarian regimes isn't, of course, only limited to the Middle East. And, a "highly placed source" told The Telegraph about its fear of losing terrorists on the Internet, "we need to take action to maintain the continued availability of communications data to the police and other agencies investigating criminality."
