A report from the UK's Financial Services Authority concluded the rate-fixing scandal was of the "utmost seriousness." Between 2005 and 2009, when Diamond was in charge of the investment branch of Barclays bank, traders were influencing the pricing of rates which impact up to $800 trillion of securities. Diamond said he hoped the decision on his pay and bonuses "will help close this chapter and allow Barclays to move forward and prosper." Agius' evidence follows that of Bank of England's deputy governor Paul Tucker Monday, in which he denied being pressured by politicians to ensure Libor rates were lowered. -- Former Barclays bank chief executive Bob Diamond will voluntarily give up bonuses worth $31 million after he resigned in the wake of a rate-rigging scandal, the bank said Tuesday. E-mails revealed as part of the rate-fixing investigation showed traders were seeking beneficial rates for their trading positions. The rate, known as the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, is is set every morning by banks posting the rate at which they are willing to borrow with the British Bankers' Association.
