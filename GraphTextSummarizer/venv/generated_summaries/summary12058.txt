Cap Haitien is in Haiti's North Department, which has had the nation's highest rate of cholera deaths. But counting the deaths that occur in the community will be difficult, said Pan American Health Organization spokesman Dan Epstein. Imogen Wall, a spokeswoman for the United Nations, said at least one U.N. warehouse has been looted and that a flight that was to have carried cholera supplies intended for Cap Haitien was suspended. The cholera outbreak, which was confirmed last month in northwest Haiti, has killed 1,034 of the 16,799 people who had been hospitalized with the disease, the Ministry of Public Health reported. Indeed, as of Tuesday, the death rate among hospitalized patients with cholera was 3.9 percent nationwide, according to the Ministry of Public Health.
