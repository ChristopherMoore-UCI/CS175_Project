Tombs said the figures also showed growth in all areas of the economy, which he noted was was a first in recent years. But according to Matthew Jaffa, spokesman for the Federation of Small Businesses, not enough is being done in the wake of the Olympics to promote "Brand London" as an exporter. Although the cultural heritage of the Olympics is important, it could take years before we see its true economic value, according to Tombs. Samuel Tombs, an economist at Capital Economics, said there was an obvious boost to UK economic growth during the Games but it was too early to see a legacy benefit. -- Over two-thirds of Britons believe the Â£9 billion ($13.8 billion) bill for the London Olympics was worth it, but economists and business leaders argue it could take years to see the economic benefits.
