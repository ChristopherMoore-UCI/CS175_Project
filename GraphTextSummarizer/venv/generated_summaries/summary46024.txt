One of them "was lucky to be alive after being shot in the torso," Malmo police superintendent Hans Nilsson told CNN. In similar incidents, two men of an "ethnic minority background" were recently shot while waiting at bus stops, according to police. The recent slew of shootings has also prompted a mobile phone text message that has circulated among Malmo's youth. One 17-year-old girl, identified only as Fatima, told TV4 that she refuses to go to school by bicycle or bus and will only travel by car now. The shootings have all been well planned, under the protection of darkness and at places familiar to the shooter, according to CNN's Swedish affiliate TV4, citing police.
