"The reward of this work at Covenant House is watching kids claim their place in the universe: their first graduation, first apartment, first great report card -- all of those moments of them claiming their dignity." Peters currently is training to become a medical assistant. Covenant House International has served over a million homeless youth in the United States, Canada and Latin America as a bridge from poverty to opportunity, according to their own statistics. Peters, like many homeless young people, had been living with abuse and violence at home, she says. Besides providing basic needs like food, shelter and immediate health services, the organization tries to prepare homeless kids to live successful and independent lives. The program trains at risk kids to find and keep a job, save money, pay bills on time, cook healthy meals and clean.
