Two people died in clashes between police and the military after hundreds of troops arrived at a hospital outside the country's capital to rescue Correa on Thursday night, Ecuador's Red Cross reported. His departure comes a day after a chaotic uprising by police officers left President Rafael Correa trapped for several hours in a hospital. Hours after the rescue, Correa repeated his claim that compensation issues were merely a pretext for police to kidnap him and try to overthrow his government. Both of the men killed in Thursday night's clashes were police officers, the Red Cross said. Violence erupted early Thursday when police officers took to the streets, claiming a new law would take away their bonuses and reduce their compensation.
