Actress in anti-Islamic film files lawsuit against filmmaker and YouTube -- A California judge denied Thursday a request from an actress who, claiming she was a victim of fraud who'd been caused irreversible harm, wanted an inflammatory anti-Islam video in which she had appeared to be removed from YouTube's website. The defendant "made an anti-Islam propaganda film, in which plaintiff is falsely made to appear to accuse the founder of the Islamic religion of being a sexual deviant and child molester," says the complaint. Last week, the actress told CNN she had been unaware the filmmaker dubbed over dialogue in the movie and had inserted anti-Islam sentiments.
