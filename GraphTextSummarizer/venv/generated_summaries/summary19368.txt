His last posting on Twitter came Monday when Shankman posted a red carpet photo with "Glee" stars Jane Lynch and Darren Criss, along with singer Adam Lambert. Director-choreographer Adam Shankman has entered a rehab facility, but no details have been made public about what treatment he is seeking. The photo was taken Sunday night at the Trevor Live charity event in Hollywood. A representative for the "Hairspray" director and "So You Think You Can Dance" judge confirmed to CNN Tuesday that he was admitted to an undisclosed rehabilitation facility. Shankman, 49, has three "Glee" episodes on his directing resume.
