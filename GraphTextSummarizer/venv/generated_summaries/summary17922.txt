-- Four-time world soccer player of the year Lionel Messi and his father have paid Spanish authorities $6.6 million after allegedly committing tax fraud between 2007 and 2009. He scored all three goals for Barcelona in its 3-2 win at Valencia on Sunday and has netted five league goals in his two games. The "reparatory" payment was made on August 14 and includes interest, the High Court said in a statement sent to CNN. It covers the period between 2007 and 2009, Spanish media reported. The move comes more than two months after Messi paid $13 million in taxes to cover the tax period of 2010-2011.
