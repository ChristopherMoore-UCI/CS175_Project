Coal ash, the byproduct of burning coal, is made up of aluminum oxide, iron oxide and silicon oxide. The company said Clean Water Act violations concerning unauthorized discharges occurred at these company facilities in North Carolina: the Dan River plant in Eden; the Riverbend Steam Station in Mount Holly; the H.F. Lee Steam Electric Plant in Goldsboro; and the Asheville Steam Electric Generating Plant. The case concerns problems at several Duke Energy locations, but the major problem occurred at the Dan River Steam Station in Rockingham County, near the Virginia border. A filing of criminal information said Duke "negligently" discharged pollutants and that employees failed to "exercise the degree of care that someone of ordinary prudence would have exercised in the same circumstances with respect to the discharge of ash and coal ash wastewater. ... "We are accountable for what happened at Dan River and have learned from this event," said Lynn Good, president and CEO of Duke Energy.
