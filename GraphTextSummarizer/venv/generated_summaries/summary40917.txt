The horror Holmes allegedly unleashed inside the movie theater has been better documented, thanks to accounts from survivors and law enforcement sources. Holmes surrendered without resistance within seven minutes of the first calls from panicked moviegoers reporting the shooting, Aurora Police Chief Dan Oates said. One was that Holmes had colored his hair red and told police he was "the Joker," one of Batman's archenemies, according to a federal law enforcement source with detailed knowledge of the investigation. His only brush with the law in Colorado appears to have been a 2011 summons for speeding from Aurora police. Their deaths -- and injuries to dozens of others -- came after a man dressed head to toe in protective tactical gear sprayed the Century 16 theater in Aurora with bullets from an AR-15 rifle, a 12-gauge shotgun and a .40-caliber pistol, weapons police discovered at the scene.
