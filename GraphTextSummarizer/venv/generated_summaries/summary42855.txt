-- They have long played second fiddle to their more illustrious city rivals, but Atletico Madrid took another giant step out of Real Madrid's shadow on Saturday with a 2-1 win at the Bernabeu. Neymar came off the bench to score a brace in the final 10 minutes of the match to make it three league wins out of three for new manager Luis Enrique. "I think it is the first time we have won twice in a row in the league at the Bernabeu and that is very important for our fans and a new group of players," Simeone said. Real's efforts to salvage something from the game ultimately came to nothing leaving the European champions pondering a second successive league defeat. The deadlock in an evenly contested second half was finally broken by the visitors with 14 minutes remaining when a Raul Garcia dummy left subsitute Turan (who replaced captain Gabi in the 60th minute) to sweep home a low shot into the left corner of Casillas' net.
