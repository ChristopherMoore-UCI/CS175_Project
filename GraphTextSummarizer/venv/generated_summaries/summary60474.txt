With Yemen's population growing at 2.3% a year, (again according to the World Bank), and oil -- the source of 70% of government revenues -- running out, Yemen's economy needs a massive shake-up. New faces may appear, but their ability to implement the kind of economic reforms Yemen needs will be limited, as has become clear over the course of the transition, with the country's 'unity' government achieving little in the way of reform. As the IMF notes in its most recent note on Yemen, the subsidies "are not targeted and create major economic distortions and opportunities for corruption". In our new Chatham House report, "Yemen: Corruption, Capital Flight and Global Drivers of Conflict," we argue that Yemen's former president Ali Abdullah Saleh used a huge system of patronage, involving everything from diesel allocations to access to military budgets and state contracts, to foster co-operation among members of the country's small tribal, economic, and military elite. Yemen's poor people -- around half the country's population -- do not have much of a voice at the talks.
