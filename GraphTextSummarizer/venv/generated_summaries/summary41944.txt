In April, Francis recommended that the church's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith "act decisively with regard to cases of sexual abuse, first of all by promoting measures for the protection of minors, as well as in offering assistance to those who have suffered abuse, carrying out due proceedings against the guilty," the Vatican said at the time. But the Center for Constitutional Rights, a nonprofit legal group which has worked alongside SNAP, said the Vatican had "consistently refused to accept responsibility" for sexual abuse of children and that its response was still "unsatisfactory." "The Vatican attempted to relegate the issue to the past and claim it is a new era, that they now 'get it,' but they continue to refuse to turn over records for prosecution, punish higher-ups that covered up the crimes, or provide any real evidence that they are now putting the safety of children above the reputation of the Church," said an attorney for the center, Pam Spees. Pope Francis lays down the law on child sex abuse on Vatican grounds Pope: 'Act decisively' Vatican sets up commission against sexual abuse of minors Scicluna: No 'coverups' Scicluna said he was there to say that "the Holy See 'gets it' " with regard to the issue and that no one should stand in the way of the prosecution of abusive priests. -- A senior Vatican official acknowledged Thursday there is "no excuse" for child sex abuse, as he and others were grilled by a U.N. committee about the Catholic Church's handling of pedophile priests.
