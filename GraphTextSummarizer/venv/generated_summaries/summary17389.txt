-- Time magazine on Wednesday named Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke as its 2009 Person of the Year, calling him "the most powerful nerd on the planet. One of his responsibilities is for full employment in society, and he hasn't really stepped up on that, but basically in terms of influencing how the economy went this year, Bernanke was the guy." " Bunning called Bernanke a "moral hazard," accusing him of supporting the "easy money policies of his predecessor, Alan Greenspan," who made the cover of Time in February 1999, along with then-Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and his successor, Lawrence H. Summers. " Wednesday's announcement comes a day before a Senate Banking Committee vote on whether Bernanke should be given another term. Bernanke was sworn in as Federal Reserve chairman in February 2006.
