U.S. troops arrived in Turkey on Friday to man Patriot missile defense batteries near the Syrian border, Turkish state media said. U.S. officials did not release any information about the troops' arrival, but had said last month that forces would be deployed to Turkey. If successful, the assault on Taftanaz Air Base in northern Syria would shut President Bashar al-Assad's military helicopter pads and diminish his ability to launch airstrikes in the region. "We've made very clear to them that we're going to protect countries in this region,"  Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said last month. U.S. officials: Syria using more accurate, Iranian-made missiles The missiles and troops are under the control of NATO, but the missiles are to be operated by U.S. forces.
