William Massa, head of collection development for Yale libraries, said that while the original audiotapes are being kept in a Yale library shelving facility in nearby Hamden, Connecticut, researchers, including those without a Yale ID, are welcome to use Yale's digital archive to access the tapes that have already been restored and processed. He said he thought they would be accessible to a wider range of people at a large research university -- particularly one with a strong interest in Middle East collections, such as Yale. The university has already digitized 335 of the tapes and will have the rest of the project completed in a few years, Yale spokesman Tom Conroy said. Despite the tapes' high-profile content and recent coverage in major news outlets such as the New York Times and the Los Angeles Times, many Yale history and political science professors interviewed for this article, including those who specialize in the Middle East, said they were unaware of the recordings' residence in Yale's libraries. Yale is in the midst of processing, preserving and archiving 1,500 audio tapes recorded in bin Laden's Afghanistan headquarters from 1988 through 2000 -- a collection that includes recordings of everything from celebrations after militant actions to religious sermons to, yes, bin Laden's poetry.
