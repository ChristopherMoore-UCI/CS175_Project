Opinion: Myanmar faces unfolding crisis Before meeting Suu Kyi, Obama spent an hour with Myanmar President Thein Sein, whose reform drive has seen the release of hundreds of political prisoners and steps to open the country's economy. In a diplomatic show of support, Obama referred to the country by the government's preferred name -- Myanmar -- rather than the colonial name of Burma used by Suu Kyi and democracy activists. Barack Obama became the first sitting U.S. president to visit Myanmar on Monday, praising the courage of fellow Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi while also providing a symbolic nod to initial reforms in a nation once notorious for political repression. Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes told reporters that Obama exercised  "diplomatic courtesy" in referencing Myanmar instead of Burma when meeting with Thein Sein. Monday's highlight was the several hours Obama spent in Myanmar, the formerly secretive country also known as Burma.
