A quick glance at a list of common phobias, such as fear of flying and enclosed spaces, reveals that a perceived loss of control is the root of most fear. A few days into training, we tackled our first group bike ride. Three months later I boarded a plane to Clermont, Florida, to meet up with my teammates and coaches for a week of intense triathlon training. At the beginning of this journey, my friend advised me to "lean into the fear" of triathlon training. It's simple: I feel completely out of control.
