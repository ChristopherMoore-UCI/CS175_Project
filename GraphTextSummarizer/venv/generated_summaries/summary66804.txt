Particularly curious, Nigeria analyst John Campbell said, is why Jonathan would choose now to resurrect the Nigerian government's repeated efforts to scuttle the fuel subsidy, which is highly popular with the country's 155 million residents -- many of whom live on less than $2 a day. -- Nigeria's government is facing rising religious violence in the north, a long-simmering separatist movement in the oil-rich south and now a nationwide strike fueled by widespread anger over the end of fuel subsidies seen by many as one of the few benefits of living in the largely impoverished state. Much of the anger has to do with a sense that Nigerian elites are not sharing in the sacrifice Jonathan says is necessary to move Nigeria forward, Tilley-Gyado said. And government plans to embark on a building program in the Muslim-dominated north, along with threats of reprisals against Muslims over the killing of Christians, threaten to inflame tensions in the south and reopen wounds from the country's civil war in the late 1960s, Campbell said. More than 30 Christians died in violence last week in Adamawa, prompting a 24-hour curfew in that northwestern Nigerian state to guard against Christian reprisals, a government chaplain said Saturday.
