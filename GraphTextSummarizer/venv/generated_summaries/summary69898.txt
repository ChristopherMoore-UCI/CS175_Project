Radical cleric Anjem Choudary, who was a co-founder of the banned UK Islamist group Al Muhajiroun, told CNN last month that the world had been split into two camps. It comes a day after nine men were arrested in London on terrorism charges, one of them named in British media reports as radical British cleric Anjem Choudary. One suspect, aged 33, was arrested on suspicion of being a member of a banned organization, supporting a banned organization and encouraging terrorism, London's Metropolitan Police said in a statement. "These arrests and searches are part of an ongoing investigation into Islamist related terrorism and are not in response to any immediate public safety risk," the police statement said. UK police arrested two more men Friday in connection with an investigation into suspected membership of a banned organization.
