The act Obama signed Friday reaffirms "unwavering commitment to the security of the State of Israel as a Jewish state" and calls for providing Israel with "the military capabilities necessary to deter and defend itself against any threat or possible combination of threats. -- The day before Mitt Romney makes a highly publicized trip to Israel, President Barack Obama on Friday signed a bill passed by Congress designed to increase security ties with the Jewish state. In signing the measure Friday, Obama spoke of the "unshakeable commitment" of his government to Israel's security and announced a previously authorized $70 million in U.S. funding for Israel's Iron Dome missile defense system. The event reinforced the Obama administration's support for strong ties with Israel as his GOP rival prepares to meet with Netanyahu and other Israeli leaders in a visit that begins Saturday. In particular, he accused Obama of failing to fully support Israel, an accusation the White House strongly denies.
