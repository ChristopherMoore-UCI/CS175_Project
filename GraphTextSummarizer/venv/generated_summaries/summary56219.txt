I started substitute teaching at Yoga Works for Shiva Rea and Seane Corn and Eric Schiffmann, which is really funny. Here are five questions for Marino: CNN: You started doing yoga as a teenager when you were living in New York, but you didn't really get serious about it until you moved to Los Angeles. Whatever it looks like in your life, as minimal or as big as it could be, people of service are usually happier because when you're of service, you realize you're a part of a whole. There are just so many things you don't actually see when you see a person, even if they appear healthy and strong and beautiful, which there's a lot of in L.A. CNN: In fact, you say you've been drawn to Buddhism because they don't "rainbow-color" everything and simply encourage people to think good thoughts. So I started going to a few vinyasa flow and power flow classes in Los Angeles.
