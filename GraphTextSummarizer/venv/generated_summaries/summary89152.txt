And now the competition is hitting the national stage, with the HUD-led $1 billion National Disaster Resilience Competition, which is aimed at encouraging local businesses, community development organizations, nonprofits, and local and state governments to rethink how cities plan in the face of a growing number of natural disasters. Rebuild by Design is succeeding not only because of the creativity of the projects, but also due to the collaboration of multidisciplinary teams of engineers, architects, planners and, importantly, local communities -- all of which partnered in unprecedented ways. Building resilience is a process with no ideology: Natural disasters in our country are destroying Republican and Democratic communities alike. For years, communities have received federal recovery funds after the fact -- when they were knocked on their heels by a disaster. What if we focused on planning and preparing as much as we do on disaster reaction and response?
