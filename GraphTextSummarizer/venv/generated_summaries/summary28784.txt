Hernandez left his New Jersey home voluntarily Wednesday and took detectives back to the scene of his alleged crime, New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said. In the years that followed, Hernandez told a family member and others that he had "done a bad thing" and killed a child in New York. And with that and everything else that happened to Hernandez this week, life on quiet East Linwood Avenue became the focus of an entire nation. Police believe the confession Hernandez made and signed: that he lured 6-year-old Etan Patz, who vanished near his Manhattan home on May 25, 1979, to a store with the promise of a soda, choked him and placed his body in the trash about a block and a half away. The two-story tan house on East Linwood Avenue is unremarkable for suburban Maple Shade, just outside Camden, New Jersey.
