Since the launch of the campaign in April, PSI -- which partnered with UNICEF and UNAIDS -- told CNN it has already seen a 25 percent increase in couple testing and a 400 percent in general testing year-on-year. The nationwide initiative -- funded by the United States government and implemented by global charity 'Population Services International' (PSI) -- is aimed at couples because tests can be useless if partners are not aware of the others' HIV status. McNeill said: "In Swaziland it is difficult to convince men to get tested as it makes them feel inferior." PSI said it found that one of the most successful campaigning tools has been to directly target men in areas where they are often concentrated. "If partners get tested separately, they may not disclose the results and not get the support they need," Dominic McNeill, spokesman for PSI Swaziland, told CNN. " PSI Swaziland received $3 million this year from the United States' President's Emergency Plan for Aids Relief (PEPFAR) and has so far spent $35,000 on radio, TV and print advertisements.
