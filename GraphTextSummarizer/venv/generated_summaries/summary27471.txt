At issue was whether the 90-minute "Hillary: The Movie" and television ads to promote it should have been subject to strict campaign finance laws on political advocacy or should have been seen as a constitutionally protected form of commercial speech. "This sounds to me like campaign advocacy," said Justice David Souter. He said groups like General Electric (which owns NBC News), National Public Radio and progressive financier George Soros (who often privately funds his political projects) could air such films in the name of informing the American people, but not his clients because of the film's perceived negative tone. Some on the bench were not sure, probing the limits of the definition of candidate advocacy. The comprehensive 2002 McCain-Feingold law bans broadcast of "electioneering communication" by corporations, unions and advocacy groups if it would be aired close to election dates and would identify candidates by name or image.
