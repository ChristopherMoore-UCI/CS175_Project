Months ago, Latino Review reported that Bradley Cooper was being considered for the Indiana Jones role as part of a James Bond-ian recasting, in which different actors would helm the franchise over the years. Variety writer Justin Kroll tweeted that Pratt didn't even know he was under consideration. Even "Modern Family" star Sarah Hyland and Matt Shively  of "True Jackson" weighed in to give their thumbs up. Would Pratt be a good choice for the role, or nah? Is there such a thing as too much Chris Pratt?
