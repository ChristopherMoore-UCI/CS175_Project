"The department also is providing assistance to and cooperating with the state officials in their investigation into the incident." Florida Gov. Rick Scott also weighed in Monday evening, noting that the case has "caused significant concern within the Sanford community and the state" and asking the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to provide "any assistance necessary" to local investigators. At the Seminole County courthouse, a handful of student protesters and a law professor from Florida A&M University met with a representative of the state attorney's office to discuss the ongoing investigation while protesters demanded Zimmerman's arrest. The death drew protesters Monday to the courthouse in Seminole County, north of Orlando, to demand justice for Trayvon Martin, the 17-year-old who was shot and killed last month while walking back to his father's fiancee's house in Sanford. In a statement to the Orlando Sentinel, his father says Zimmerman grew up in a multiracial family and has moved out of his home after receiving death threats. " "I think that's an issue that Mr. Zimmerman himself considers as someone suspicious -- a black kid with a hoodie on, jeans, tennis shoes," Martin said.
