" Safarova didn't leave Charleston empty-handed, however, securing her first WTA doubles title alongside Russia's Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova as they beat Spaniards Anabel Medina Garrigues and Yaroslava Shvedova 5-7 6-4 10-6. It was her second success at Charleston, following a 2008 triumph, and fourth on clay after winning both the French Open and the Italian Open in 2002. "I hope I can make it three and four and five and six and more and more and more," the former world No. 1 said on the WTA website after returning to the top 10 of the women's rankings. -- American tennis star Serena Williams is hoping to keep up her blistering momentum after a landmark victory at the Family Circle Cup in Charleston --- the 40th WTA Tour title of her illustrious career. I've never played so consistently at such a high level with low errors like this, and the scary thing is I could have served so much better." Williams took just 58 minutes to defeat Safarova, hitting 27 winners to eight as she topped off an impressive performance at the opening event of the tour's clay-court season.
