The university's board plans to appoint Provost Larry Robinson as interim president, but he is subject to confirmation at the next board meeting in August. At Monday's meeting, some board members requested time to consider additional candidates and research Robinson's background. Robinson has a doctorate in nuclear chemistry and has taught in the university's Environmental Sciences Institute. The board agreed to the delay Monday in order to give members time to get to know Robinson better. " Ammons waived a 90-day notice of resignation Monday that would have kept him on staff through October.
