A fire likely started on board the balloon, sending it plummeting to the ground, said Superintendent Mike Rusbatch, Wellington District commander for New Zealand Police. -- A hot air balloon crash in New Zealand early Saturday killed 11 people -- the pilot and 10 passengers -- officials said. A witness to the crash told Radio New Zealand that the balloon was on fire as it fell. When the balloon hit the ground, a large cloud of smoke ascended, Radio New Zealand reported. A police spokeswoman said all the victims were from the wider Wellington area.
