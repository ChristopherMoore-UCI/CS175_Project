The Foreign Ministry in Beijing responded Monday to the publication by German magazine Der Spiegel of new documents purportedly from NSA leaker Edward Snowden. One document reveals that U.S. authorities believe China stole "many terabytes of data" related to its new state-of-the-art F-35 fighter jet, including detailed engine schematics and radar design. According to Reuben F. Johnson, a correspondent for IHS Jane's Defence Weekly, the FC-31 "looks" stealthy and its shape mimics that of the F-35 in some respects, but it's questionable whether it rivals its American counterpart from a performance and technological point of view. China has strenuously denied it stole designs for America's next generation fighter jet, calling the accusations "baseless." The Chinese are currently designing their own stealth fighter aircraft, the FC-31, which analysts have noted resembles the F-35.
