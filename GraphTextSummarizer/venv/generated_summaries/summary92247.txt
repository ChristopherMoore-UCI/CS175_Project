-- Arsenal fought back from going two goals behind to draw 2-2 at home to holders Barcelona in a classic Champions League quarterfinal that more than lived up to all its expectations. Meanwhile, former Arsenal hero Thierry Henry, who is the Gunners' record goal scorer after eight sensational years with the club, was given a heroes reception by the home fans for his first return since leaving London for Barcelona in 1997. Barcelona tore into their opponents in the opening 20 minutes, with only goalkeeper Manuel Almunia standing in their way. The winners of the tie will face either Inter Milan or CSKA Moscow in the semifinals and Italian champions Inter hold a slender advantage after winning the first leg 1-0 at the San Siro. Then, with the clock showing five minutes left to play, a superb Arsenal move resulted in captain Cesc Fabregas being bundled over by his opposite number Carlos Puyol in the penalty area.
