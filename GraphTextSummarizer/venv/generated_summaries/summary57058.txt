Florida State University quarterback Jameis Winston was awarded the 79th Heisman Trophy on Saturday, an honor that comes amid lingering questions about a rape allegation that has cast a pall over his claim to the coveted bronze statue. Winston's Heisman honor comes one day after attorney Patricia Carroll called on Florida officials to investigate how authorities in the state capital handled the now-closed investigation into the alleged sexual assault of her client. Power candidates for 2014 Winston, who received 686 first-place votes according to Heisman trustees, finished ahead of Manziel, Auburn's Tre Mason,  University of Alabama's AJ McCarron, Northern Illinois University's Jordan Lynch and Boston College's Andre Williams.

Carroll accused the Tallahassee police detective who handled the case of spending time and resources investigating her client instead of Winston.
