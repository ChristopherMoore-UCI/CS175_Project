It is more like what one organizer calls, "a party with a purpose": a program called Hip Hop Public Health, which uses music as a vehicle to communicate health messages to children. Peer-reviewed studies conducted by Williams and colleagues found that immediately after caloric literacy interventions, children changed their food purchases. After reaching tens of thousands of children in New York, Hip Hop Public Health got a shout-out -- and a request to collaborate -- from the Partnership for a Healthier America, whose ambassador is first lady Michelle Obama. Williams admits that teaching children the importance of cooking meals at home and purchasing healthy groceries would also be effective, but he says that teaching "caloric literacy" can also provide a substantive impact. "That's the power of children, the potential role that children can play within the public health chain of survival," Williams said.
