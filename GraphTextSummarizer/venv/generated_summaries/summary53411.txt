-- Former Real Madrid and Spain midfielder Ruben de la Red officially announced his retirement from football in an emotional press conference on Thursday. De la Red is a product of the Real Madrid youth system and made his debut for the Spanish giants in 2004, before being sold to Getafe in 2007 with an option for Los Blancos to re-sign the player. De la Red has not played since he collapsed during a Copa del Rey match in October 2008, with what has since been diagnosed as a heart problem. I am also very grateful to all the people who have supported me," said de la Red, who was visibly emotional as he addressed the Spanish media. The 25-year-old, who was a part of Spain's victorious Euro 2008 squad, will stay at the club and begin a new career as a coach at the Bernabeu.
