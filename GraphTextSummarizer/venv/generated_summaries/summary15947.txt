Final rules issued by the Environmental Protection Agency on Friday exempted logging road runoff from storm water permit requirements, saying timber firms may continue to use "best management practices" that suit local conditions. The justices Tuesday will tackle another ongoing dispute over whether water on a navigable river that flows through a concrete channel-- or an "engineered improvement"-- can be considered "discharge" subject to greater Clean Water Act regulation. At issue was whether logging road operators must obtain federal Clean Water Act discharge permits for ditches, drains, and culverts channeling rain runoff from those roads-- treating it the same as industrial storm water. That appeals concerns responsibility over billions of gallons of polluted storm water flowing into the Los Angeles and San Gabriel Rivers. The Portland-based Northwest Environmental Defense Center last year won an important victory in a federal appeals court.
