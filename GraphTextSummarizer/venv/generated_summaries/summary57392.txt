Freedom of the press is stressed as "one of the most important reforms in the long run" by Suzanne Dimaggio, vice president of global policy programs at Asia Society, a nonprofit organization that aims to strengthen ties between the United States and Asia. The new freedoms may represent dashes instead of solid double lines, but more reforms must be made for Myanmar's press to be labeled truly open and its people completely free. "Basically, we try to teach what language to use in reporting on conflict that will not inflame the situation -- making sure your facts are right, getting them verified, basic journalism ethics," Hoffman said of Internews' operation during Myanmar's military rule. Hoffman, recently returned from Myanmar to assess the progress of the media, described it as "the most exciting thing" he's ever seen. But August 20 was a new day for Myanmar, the day the government rescinded repressive media censorship laws that had hindered and intimidated the country's journalists for decades.
