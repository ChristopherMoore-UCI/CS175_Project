As sites get more traffic and are linked from other sites, they gain traction in Google searches, rising closer to the coveted first page of results. On Friday, a Google search for Romney's name was delivering a site called "Spreading Romney" as one of its top results. The Romney site also offers a fake definition for his name, one that's not quite as foul as Santorum's but still profane and far from complimentary. Now, the former U.S. senator's chief political rival, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, appears to be joining him. The spoof site (which, as will soon become apparent, is in no way associated with the Republican candidate or his campaign) is a twist on a site that caused Santorum to ask Google to bury it.
