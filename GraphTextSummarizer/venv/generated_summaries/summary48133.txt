We will work toward building our new facility and helping more veterans and hiring veterans. Mary Cortani: Since June, I have received emails and phone calls from all over the country asking for information on how to get service dogs for veterans. I hope it helps (our group) enlighten the public and government that service dogs can be a viable tool for assisting veterans, especially those suffering from PTSD and sexual trauma. There are animals in shelters that will make outstanding service dogs, and there are veterans in desperate need of them. She often helps match veterans with dogs from shelters or rescue groups.
