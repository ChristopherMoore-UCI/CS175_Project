Azar declined to say exactly how much money the mall paid to get Lyuba from her home at Russia's Shemanovsky Museum but he did hint it was in the realm of several million Hong Kong dollars -- 7.8 million Hong Kong dollars equals about $1 million in U.S. currency. He says the "headaches" and "red tape" -- including a Hong Kong promise to Russia to return Lyuba -- were worth it for the archaeological significance. "We're doing it more for the cultural connection for the Hong Kong people and to get something interesting for the shopping mall." A trio of real skulls from other extinct ice age animals round out Lyuba's coterie -- a woolly rhino with a long single horn, a steppe bison and an open-mouthed cave lion baring its sharp predator's teeth. Scientists say Lyuba, which means "love" in Russian, died after 32 days of life, drowning in river mud in present-day Siberia.
