-- Egyptian security forces arrested a senior Muslim Brotherhood leader on suspicion of inciting violence after last month's ouster of then-President Mohamed Morsy, state-run media reported Thursday. Many of the deaths occurred when the military used force to clear two pro-Morsy sit-in sites in Cairo, and when violence raged after pro-Morsy supporters staged demonstrations two days later. The military and Morsy opponents have battled Muslim Brotherhood members and other Morsy supporters. The Egyptian military and other security forces have arrested a number of Muslim Brotherhood leaders since the ouster of Morsy, who belonged to the brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party. Egypt has been in turmoil since the military ousted Morsy in early July.
