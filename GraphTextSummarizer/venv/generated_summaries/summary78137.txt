A day earlier, suspected drone strikes targeted al Qaeda fighters in Yemen for the second time in two days, killing "at least a dozen," the government official said. Strikes on suspected al Qaeda figures resumed in 2009, with more than 100 reported since then, according to the New America Foundation, a U.S.-based think tank that tracks the raids. Did the United States miss top al Qaeda meeting in Yemen? He would not confirm whether drones were used in the attack, but the United States is the only country known to have conducted drone strikes in Yemen -- and as a rule, U.S. officials don't comment on those strikes. Yemen's state news agency SABA said three strikes targeted an al Qaeda training camp in the village of  Wadi al Khila, about 450 kilometers (280 miles) south of the capital Sanaa.
