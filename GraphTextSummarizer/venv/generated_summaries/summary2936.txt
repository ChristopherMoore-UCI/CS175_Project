Young, who introduced the system at the South by Southwest music festival in March with endorsements from the likes of Tom Petty, Eddie Vedder and Sting, believes that the quality of the listening experience will draw enough fans willing to pay more. The idea behind Pono is to boost digital music from the compressed and lossy formats to high-quality resolution. By comparison, the 64GB iPod touch sells for the same price, and the iPod classic, with 160GB of storage, sells for $249. Young, a longtime critic of what he calls the "underwater listening" experience of compressed digital music, thanked backers on the campaign's homepage Tuesday. "You have helped to set the stage for a revolution in music listening," Young wrote.
