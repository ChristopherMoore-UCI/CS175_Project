The justices considered the limits of two key interpretations of copyright law -- the "first sale doctrine" and its complex relationship to foreign distribution rights. It ensures a distribution chain of retail items, library lending, gift giving and rentals for a range of intellectual property. The high court already had ruled in prior cases that copyright holders cannot block U.S.-made goods sent overseas from later being brought back into the country for resale. In federal law, she said, "Congress intended to provide copyright owners with a remedy against unauthorized importation of foreign-made copies of their works, even if those copies were made and sold abroad with the copyright owner's authorization." The first sale doctrine generally gives copyright holders the ability to profit only from the original sale.
