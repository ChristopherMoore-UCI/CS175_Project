A long history, a strained relationship Obama has more than three years left in his presidency and the next battle is just months away because the deal approved by Congress that he signed only funds the government through early January and only extends U.S. borrowing authority until early February. -- The morning that the federal government reopened after 16 days of political stalemate, President Barack Obama stood at the podium in the State Dining Room of The White House. "For us to go to a negotiation, to the negotiating table with President Obama after what he has done over the last two and a half weeks, I think would be probably a very big mistake," Labrador said. From his bully pulpit on Thursday, Obama invoked his professorial tone and implored Congress that their working relationship "has to change." "Because we've all got a lot of work to do on behalf of the American people and that includes the hard work of regaining their trust," Obama said. "Let's work together to make government work better instead of treating it like an enemy or purposely making it work worse," Obama said.
