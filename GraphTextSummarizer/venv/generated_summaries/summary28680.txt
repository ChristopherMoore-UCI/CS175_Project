The two years of talks between environment groups, unions and industry representatives failed to find the resolution to bring the industry out of crisis and protect Tasmania's high conservation value forests. No deal means clear-felling of old growth forests is set to continue. Verified by scientific experts to be of world heritage value, it should have have been on its way to formal protection. I hope my action will be a catalyst, inspiring others to say no to wood products that come from unsustainable forestry practices. And the message is clear, people don't want to buy furniture and flooring made from the destruction of endangered species habitat, community water catchments or globally significant carbon sinks.
