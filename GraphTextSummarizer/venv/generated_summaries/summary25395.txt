Watch for more on the U.S. cases Â» New York health officials said Friday they were testing about 75 students at a school in New York City for swine flu after the students exhibited flu-like symptoms this week.

Swine flu commonly affects pigs and occasionally infects people in contact with pigs. More than 1,000 people have fallen ill in Mexico City in a short period of time, U.S. health experts said.
