The Rider University students, at the school's campus in Lawrenceville, were brought to hospitals late Wednesday night, the school said Thursday. Rider officials worked with health authorities throughout the night "to identify ill students in the residence halls and treat them either on site or send them to area hospitals," the school said. Some of those taken to hospitals have been discharged and returned to campus. Infection can occur by eating contaminated food; touching contaminated surfaces and then putting contaminated fingers in your mouth; or having direct contact with an infected person. The school's food and custodial services are taking necessary steps, including cleaning all residence hall bathrooms and other areas.
