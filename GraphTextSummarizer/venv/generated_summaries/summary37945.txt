The controversy surfaced last week when a group of former Southern Weekly journalists said, in an open letter, that a local propaganda chief had dramatically altered the paper's traditional New Year message, which had called for certain reforms and greater respect for constitutional rights. The Chinese newspaper at the center of a censorship storm hit newsstands in the capital Thursday for the first time since journalists went on strike in protest against apparent editorial interference from the government. "For these new bosses, what they do not need from Southern Weekly is that kind of advice! " Chinese actor Chen Kun tweeted: "I am not that deep and don't play with words, I support the friends at Southern Weekly." Protesters carried posters calling for press freedom.
