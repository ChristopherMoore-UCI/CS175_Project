-- Before President Obama says a word during his Tuesday Oval Office address, the backdrop will make a statement for him: that he is the decider. That's the president's office, that's where he supposedly makes decisions, where he governs," says presidential historian Robert Dallek. " The Oval Office symbolizes power, command, and authority, Dallek said. Obama's other Oval Office address was two months ago to address the nation about the Gulf oil disaster. Obama is set to give his second Oval Office address, a speech meant to mark the end of combat missions in Iraq.
