"We believe the suspect drove the car into the canal, with little Juliani inside," Stanislaus County Sheriff Adam Christianson told HLN's Nancy Grace. An Amber Alert was issued for Juliani Cardenas, who authorities say was abducted by Jose Esteban Rodriguez in the northern California town of Patterson. The boy, Juliani, is 3 feet, 6 inches tall, weighs 40 pounds and has brown eyes and black hair, according to the Amber Alert. "He (Rodriguez) wanted to be with my son," Tabitha Cardenas told reporters Thursday, adding that she had broken up with Rodriguez four or five months ago. The boy's school later called Tabitha Cardenas after Rodriguez had gone there asking to spend time with the boy.
