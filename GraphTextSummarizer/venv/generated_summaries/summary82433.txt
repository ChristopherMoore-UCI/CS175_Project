" Parliament acts to free opposition leader Hours after that deal was signed, Ukraine's Parliament, the Rada, moved quickly to pass a series of measures seemingly in line with protesters' demands. The same official characterized such travel to eastern Ukraine by the President as "not unusual." The agreement -- hashed out overnight and into the afternoon among Ukrainian leaders, opposition figures and European Union representatives -- drew some cheers when it was announced to the Maidan crowd. Later, a protester -- not a leader, not part of any political group, just an ordinary Ukrainian he insisted -- expressed disappointment with the deal and proposed that action should be taken if  President Viktor Yanukovych doesn't resign by 10 a.m. Saturday. As the crisis brewed in Kiev, a senior U.S. State Department official -- who talked to reporters on condition of not being identified and who had just been on the phone with Ukraine's foreign minister -- said that Yanukovych had gone to Kharkiv, Ukraine's second's largest city, for a meeting.
