John and Furnish tied the knot in 2005, becoming one of Britain's first gay civil unions, but Ukraine doesn't recognize gay unions. Apparently in the Ukraine, God's No. 1 priority is preventing gay couples from giving sick kids a better life. In the United States, organizations like the National Adoption Center, the American Psychological Association, and the American Academy of Pediatrics all agree that having homosexual parents does not negatively affect children. Let's hope Sir Elton finds a different, more tolerant country willing to let him be a poor child's loving father. There are even a few married Bible-thumpers spending their time trying to keep sex out of our lives -- yet they talk about sex more than anyone!
