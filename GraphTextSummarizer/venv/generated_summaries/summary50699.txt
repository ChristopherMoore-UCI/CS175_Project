Transport NSW, which provides public transportation throughout the New South Wales area, issued a warning that many public services across the region have been disrupted because of the weather. The storm system also brought destructive flooding that washed away houses and brought down trees onto streets and buildings. The dangerous conditions have prompted the police department to issue pleas on social media for people to not attempt driving through flooded areas. About a quarter of a million Australian homes and businesses have no power after a "once in a decade" storm battered Sydney and nearby areas. About 4,500 people have been isolated by flood waters as "the roads are cut off and we won't be able to reach them for a few days," Michael Langley, spokesman for the New South Wales State Emergency Service said.
