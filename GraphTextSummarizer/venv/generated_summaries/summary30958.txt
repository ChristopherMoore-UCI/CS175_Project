The part number of each pin must be checked and pins with certain part numbers must be replaced with new, improved attach pins. The FAA says premature failure of the pins could cause reduced structural integrity of the horizontal stabilizer to fuselage attachment, resulting in loss of control of the airplane. -- The Federal Aviation Administration is ordering that more than 1,000 Boeing 737 jets be inspected for a problem which could cause pilots to lose control of the aircraft. According to the FAA, the inspections will focus on pins which attach the horizontal stabilizers to the fuselage. The aircraft included in the directive are relatively new, entering service in 1998 or later.
