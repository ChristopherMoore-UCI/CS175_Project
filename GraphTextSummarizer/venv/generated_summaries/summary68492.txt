"That could happen tomorrow or Tuesday, or a month from now, or both." Robyn Broyles, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Interior's Burned Area Emergency Rehabilitation team, explained that forests, shrubs and other flora generally mitigate the impact of monsoon rains. -- If the still raging fires didn't destroy their homes, New Mexico residents could be done in by flash flooding this monsoon season -- the ravaged landscape heightening the danger, and likelihood, of mudslides and other problems. "It will simply take just one thunderstorm in the right area of a burn scar to potentially have devastating affects," National Weather Service meteorologist Kerry Jones said. That's why the weather service issued a flash flood watch into Monday evening for a large swath of New Mexico including the Jemez and Sangre de Cristo mountains. With monsoon season having just kicked off, more precipitation could help firefighters contain the wildfire, one of several still burning in the Southwest.
