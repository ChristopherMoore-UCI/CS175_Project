Cyborg says Unplug was created "in shared spirit with" Stop the Cyborgs, a campaign that urges restaurants and other public spaces to ban Glass and other surveillance devices. Billed as a "wireless anti-surveillance system," Unplug is, essentially, a portable router that can detect drones, surveillance cameras and mobile tech like Glass trying to access your Wi-Fi signal and boot them off of it. This spring, Oliver made headlines in the tech press by writing glasshole.sh, a Web script that can be used to find and kick Glass, specifically, off local computer networks. To be clear, Cyborg Unplug can't stop anyone from using mobile devices to record or photograph you. That's what the creators of Cyborg Unplug promise.
