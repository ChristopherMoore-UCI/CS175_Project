Earlier, Morne Morkel (5-75) took two wickets in two balls to put England on the back foot, with Swann caught at slip by Smith for five from a fierce rising delivery and James Anderson following in identical fashion. That gave the Proteas a first-innings lead of 18 runs, and it looked like the home side might also find batting difficult when makeshift opener Ashwell Prince continued his miserable series, falling leg before wicket to spinner Graeme Swann for 15. The opener thought he was out soon after reaching his 19th century in the five-day format, but England wicketkeeper Matt Prior admitted that the edge off seamer Graham Onions had not carried. Captain Graeme Smith ground out a potentially match-winning century to put South Africa on top in the third cricket Test against England at Newlands on Tuesday. England struggled from the outset, losing two wickets in the day's opening over and added just 32 runs to their overnight total of 241-7.
