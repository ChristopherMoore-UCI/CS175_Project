The campaign encourages consumers to share their personal connection to newspapers through the papers' Facebook and Twitter accounts -- with the hashtag #smartsexy -- to spark conversations online. "We want to generate a national dialogue about the value of newspaper media," said Cheryl Sadowski, vice president of communications for the NAA. The "Smart is the New Sexy" catchphrase promotes the idea that gaining knowledge from reading newspapers makes people more attractive -- as an NAA tagline explains, "because a little depth looks great on you." Three different ads will run for six weeks in more than 1,000 member newspapers, digitally and in print. And surveys have shown that more younger readers are getting their news not through traditional news sites, but from Facebook and Twitter. That is why Tarabocchia is exactly the type of reader newspapers are trying to seduce with a saucy new marketing campaign.
