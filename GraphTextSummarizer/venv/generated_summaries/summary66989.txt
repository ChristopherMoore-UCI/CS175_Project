Neighbors, family and friends told police that the suspect, who had not worked for several months, had said in recent days he was having had extreme financial difficulties, Moore said. Inside the house, police also found three letters, one to law enforcement acknowledging responsibility for the killings, a second to friends and relatives and a third that appears to be the suspect's will, Moore said. Rajaram was involved in a financial holding company as part owner "at least," Moore said. Moore said it was clear to police that the family members were close and "had an affection for each other." There is no evidence he had had any history of mental difficulties, nor was there an indication he had sought counseling, Moore said.
