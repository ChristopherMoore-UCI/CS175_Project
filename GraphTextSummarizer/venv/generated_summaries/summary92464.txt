When Aimee Copeland does return home, she will find a new "Aimee's Wing" on the Copeland's residence in Snellville, just east of Atlanta. Aimee Copeland has two hooks she uses for hands and a leg prosthetic but her injured left side where she lost that leg may require one more surgery, Andy Copeland told CNN's "Erin Burnett OutFront." Andy Copeland said his daughter is racing through rehab and might return to the family's home on August 22. "She knows that she can accomplish anything she wants and that lacking the hands or feet to accomplish such tasks is only a minor inconvenience." A number of bacteria that are common in the environment but rarely cause serious infections can lead to necrotizing fasciitis, or flesh-eating bacteria syndrome. Andy Copeland: 'I have become a better father because of Aimee' Three days later, still in pain, she went to an emergency room. Aimee wants a quiet homecoming, Andy Copeland said.
