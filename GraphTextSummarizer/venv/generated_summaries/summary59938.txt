I practice primary care in southern New Hampshire near the Massachusetts border, which gives me a firsthand look at how health reform has impacted my neighboring state. The Affordable Care Act doesn't do nearly enough to make primary care enticing, despite the anticipated shortfall of primary care providers approaching 30,000 by 2015. It's their stories that have made me realize we desperately need to fix our broken health care system, and accept health reform despite its shortcomings. Despite flaws with the Massachusetts approach, and the president's Affordable Care Act which is modeled after it, I believe that health care reform needs to move forward. Beginning in 2014, health reform would expand the eligibility of Medicaid and provide federal tax credits to help buy private insurance.
