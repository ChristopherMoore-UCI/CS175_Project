" 'Most Wanted Terrorist' al Libi nabbed in native Libya after years tied to al Qaeda U.S. officials: Navy SEALs launch raid on Al-Shabaab leader One operation took place Saturday in the Libyan capital of Tripoli, when U.S. forces captured Abu Anas al Libi, an al Qaeda leader wanted for his role in the deadly 1998 bombings of two U.S. embassies in Africa. Al Libi tied to U.S. embassy bombings Al Libi, 49, has been high on the radar for years. Al Libi has been indicted on charges of conspiracy to kill U.S. nationals, murder, destruction of American buildings and government property, and destruction of national defense utilities of the United States. Citing al Libi's wife, the source said the al Qaeda leader tried to reach into his car to grab his gun -- but the U.S. forces quickly snatched him.
