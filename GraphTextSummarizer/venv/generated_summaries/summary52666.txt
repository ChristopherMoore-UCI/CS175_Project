" As well as making screens you can feel, Disney Research is also developing tactile equipment that doesn't require any actual contact at all -- like an Xbox Kinect, but where you feel as though you can touch objects in front of you in thin air. The Aireal works by blowing small rings of air at a user to simulate touch, movement or collisions with objects. Ivan Poupyrev, the Principle Research Scientist at Disney's Interaction Group, told CNN that in his view the future will see "touch screens on mobile devices, tablets, laptops, tables and walls. The device is called the "Aireal" and in its developers' words it provides "interactive tactile experiences in free air." In general creating tactile feedback in free air is a very important research direction.
