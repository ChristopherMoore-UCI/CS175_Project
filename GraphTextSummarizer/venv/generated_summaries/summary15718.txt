Michigan investigators talk with boy about basement ordeal Parents locked Georgia boy in basement for 'disciplinary reasons' Car bakes in sun for investigation into toddler's death Petitions seeking state custody of Charlie and his younger siblings were filed this week. Developments included a psychological evaluation being ordered for the 12-year-old to determine whether his father can have visitation rights, and discussions of petitions on termination of parental rights. Charlie made national news in June when his father Charlie Bothuell IV said his son went missing for 11 days, prompting a search that involved the FBI and that ended bizarrely when the child turned up barricaded in the father's basement. He told CNN, "It's possible" that investigators "didn't see" the boy while they searched the home from attic to basement.
