Rimm notes that doctors have since learned more about how to help heavier patients to apply the same principles to achieve more lasting success in shedding pounds. "It's amazing to us in this day and age of instantaneous communication that there would be days between the correspondence between Taft and Yorke-Davies, but that was still enough. " Rimm says Taft's diet looks pretty unappealing, and being forced to follow such a strict schedule every day can quickly lose its flair. "That seems to be something that helped Taft, and kept him from quitting sooner," says Rimm, of the weekly letters he wrote to Yorke-Davies. Dr. Eric Rimm, an associate professor of epidemiology and nutrition at Harvard School of Public Health, thought the diet would have been quite a challenge for Taft, and recognized many good intentions but little in the way of motivational support for the struggling president.
