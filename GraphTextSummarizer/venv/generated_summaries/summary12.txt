-- Patriotism could reach fever pitch when the USA and Europe collide in golf's Ryder Cup ... and it looks like American star Rickie Fowler has let it go to his head. During the 1999 event at the Brookline club in Massachusetts, the USA team was criticized for celebrating a dramatic victory on the green while European player Jose Maria Olazabal was still waiting to take his putt. So expect star spangled banners and roars of "USA, USA" to accompany Fowler around the course throughout the three days of competition. While golf courses are usually the epitome of peace and quiet, the Ryder Cup galleries are altogether more raucous. Played every two years, it pits the best golfers from Europe and the USA against each other with the winner securing bragging rights in the sport's most partisan contest.
