-- The global stock sell-off that began Friday on the back of worse than expected U.S. unemployment data rolled into Asia trade on Monday morning, as stocks opened sharply lower. It was trading at $1.19 on Monday morning after falling below $1.20 for the first time in four years on Friday. Monday's stock sell-off was led by the Nikkei 225, which was down more than 4 percent near the end of morning trading on Monday. The Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong, the Kospi Composite index in Seoul and the S&P/ASX200 in Sydney were all down more than 2.5 percent in morning trading. Markets plummeted on Friday after a monthly U.S. jobs report said employers added 431,000 jobs in May, below the expected increase of 500,000.
