The libertarian Reason magazine provides a list of Huckabee quotes intended to damn him, including one in which he describes their anti-tax agenda as "a heartless, callous, soulless type of economic conservatism because it says 'look, we want to cut taxes and eliminate government. Americans may have a cultural distrust of large government in general, but polls and election returns suggest they still favor those parts of state activity that benefit them personally. Huckabee would likely not use the state for progressive causes as the Democrats would, but for conservative ones. Huckabee quit early due to a shortage of cash, so we never got to see how well he could run in a great number of states. Such an ability to sell conservative ideas with a glimmer of humanity hasn't been seen since Ronald Reagan.
