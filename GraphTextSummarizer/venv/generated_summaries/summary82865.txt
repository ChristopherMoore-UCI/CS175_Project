A lawmaker for the area, Northern Ireland government minister Danny Kennedy, said there was no doubt dissident IRA groups were behind the Newry device. -- An abandoned van containing a device with 600 pounds of explosives was found in Newry, Northern Ireland, near the border with the Republic of Ireland, police said Saturday. The device, believed to be linked to dissident IRA groups opposed to the peace process, was "fully primed and ready for use," police said. Dissident IRA groups are suspected in that attempted attack too although police continue to investigate the motive. My fear is unless these dissidents are dealt with they have huge potential to cause death and destruction." A small bomb was also found under a parked car in Belfast overnight and disarmed by the army, police said Saturday.
