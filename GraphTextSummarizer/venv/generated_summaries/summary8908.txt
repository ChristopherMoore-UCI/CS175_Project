Eaton's first day total of 4,441 points puts him 48 points of reigning world champion Hardee with five disciplines -- 110m hurdles, discus, pole vault, javelin and the 1500m -- to complete on Sunday. Bolt's compatriots Nesta Carter, Michael Frater and Yohan Blake are also safely through to the semifinals as are the United States trio of Justin Gatlin, Trell Kimmons and Walter Dix. Reigning world and Olympic champion Usain Bolt has eased his way through the 100m heats on the first day of the IAAF World Championships in Daegu, South Korea. But it was a day of despair for reigning Olympic champions Australia's Steve Hooker and Britain's Christine Ohuruogu. The Jamaican sprinter, who broke his own 100m world record at the 2009 World Championships in Berlin with a time of 9.58 seconds, won his heat in 10.10 seconds to advance to Sunday's semifinals.
