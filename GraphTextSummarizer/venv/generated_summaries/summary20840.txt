John Hay, a private assistant to Lincoln and later secretary of state, and Henry Adams, an author and descendent of presidents John Adams and John Quincy Adams, both lived on the site the hotel now occupies. They had hoped to move earlier into nearby Blair House, which presidents-elect traditionally occupy five days before moving into the White House. Their discussions of politics, literature, science and art attracted the likes of Theodore Roosevelt, Mark Twain and author Henry James. Local legend holds that Henry Adams' wife, Clover, committed suicide in 1885 and now haunts the hotel. The Obamas will move into Blair House on January 15.
