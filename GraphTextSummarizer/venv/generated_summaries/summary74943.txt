Roddick, the last U.S. male to win a grand slam when he triumphed in New York in 2003, announced last week that it would be his last tournament. "I just didn't come up with the goods tonight," said Federer, in quotes carried on the official tournament website, after his first match in four days following a walkover against American Mardy Fish. The match had been moved from the main Arthur Ashe Stadium to the Louis Armstrong court, and 2008 U.S. Open finalist Murray struggled in front of an initially small crowd against a player who beat him at the same tournament three years ago. " Earlier, 2009 U.S. Open champion Juan Martin Del Potro brought the curtain down on Andy Roddick's glittering career by beating the home favorite in four sets in their rain-delayed fourth-round match on Arthur Ashe. Berdych will face Olympic champion Andy Murray in the last four, after the Scot came back from a set down to oust giant Croatian Marin Cilic, winning 3-6 7-6 (7-4) 6-2 6-0.
