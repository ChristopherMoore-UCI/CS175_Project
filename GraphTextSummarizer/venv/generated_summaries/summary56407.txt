Most of this is food aid, which is used to tackle acute hunger -- but even this form of aid is not without controversy. Research demonstrates that food aid can be poor value for money, especially when food grown in donor countries is shipped to the developing world. While FDI and remittances undoubtedly contribute to economic growth in developing countries, aid is the only international resource flow which can be targeted explicitly to improve the lives of the poorest people around the world. Perhaps even more surprising is the fact that large amounts of aid money never actually leave rich countries. Contrary to popular perception, aid is not one homogenous entity or a single transfer of money from donor to recipient countries.
