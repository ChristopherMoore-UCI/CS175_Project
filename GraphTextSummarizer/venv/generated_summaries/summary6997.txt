"It's very, very important to keep that place open, giving good services" to the people of Juarez, De La Vega says. For De La Vega, who frequently visits patients and is active in administrative, operational and financial aspects at the hospital, her work not only saves lives but has given meaning to her own life as well. De La Vega has always been passionate about health care, volunteering with the Red Cross when she was 8 years old. With a staff of 144 doctors and 192 nurses, Hospital de la Familia performs emergency care as well as routine and specialized surgeries for adults and children. De La Vega went to visit the woman in jail and asked her why she did not practice family planning.
