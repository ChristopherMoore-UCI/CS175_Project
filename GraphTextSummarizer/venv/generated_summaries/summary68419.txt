In Litvinenko's case, such evidence could involve matters of national security, and his widow, Marina Litvinenko, had argued that a public inquiry would enable the fullest possible investigation. The British government has rejected requests to hold a public inquiry into the 2006 death of former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko, a spokesman for the coroner's inquest said Friday. In a deathbed statement, Alexander Litvinenko blamed Russian President Vladimir Putin for his poisoning, an accusation the Kremlin has strongly denied. Putin foe, exiled Russian oligarch found dead in UK home Marina Litvinenko told CNN on Friday that "everybody is down, because we didn't expect this." Litvinenko's widow has been pressing for a public inquiry in addition to a basic inquest -- a coroner-led investigation that is held as a matter of course in the case of unnatural deaths in England, where Litvinenko died after being poisoned.
