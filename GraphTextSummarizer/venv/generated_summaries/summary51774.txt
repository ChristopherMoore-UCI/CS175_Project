"I'm very excited to exercise my right to vote today," Nopphorn Tabupha said from Bangkok's Bueng Kum district. -- Thailand's national election day has morphed into a day of tense uncertainty after chaos prevented voting in several districts. And in the Bangkok district of Din Daeng, voting was called off because government protesters blocked officials from distributing ballot boxes. The Bangkok district of Laksi postponed its election for about 87,000 voters Sunday because protesters were blocking the administrative office where the ballot boxes are kept, national security chief Paradorn Pattanathabutr said. Laksi, a district of mixed pro- and anti-government sentiment, saw violent protests Saturday when gunfire erupted during anti-government protests, witnesses said.
