Then we head out into the city to meet guerrilla gardener guru Richard Reynolds and discover the fruits of his labor blossoming in grass verges and central conservations throughout London. After graduating from Ontario College of Art in Toronto with a degree in jewelry and metalsmithing, Vanessa moved to the United Kingdom to pursue a master's degree in design interactions from the Royal College Collect of Art in London.
