Vanity Fair recently gathered a panel of movie experts in Hollywood to chat about the Oscars, and Fandango's Dave Karger offered a theory as to why the critically acclaimed film may not win. In the scene Karger refrenced, Chris and Taya Kyle (Bradley Cooper, who is up for the best actor Oscar, and Sienna Miller) are having a conversation in their new baby's room. Get ready for the conspiracy theories if "American Sniper" doesn't snag the Academy Award for best picture on Sunday. The Clint Eastwood-directed film is based on the autobiography of  Chris Kyle, a Navy SEAL who had more documented kills than any other U.S. sniper since statistics have been gathered. "The reason why 'American Sniper' is not going to win is because of the plastic baby," Karger said, probably jokingly.
