" Her daughters, Gladys and Jamie Scott, were released from a Mississippi prison Friday after 16 years behind bars. Jamie Scott, 38, is gravely ill and needs a kidney transplant, said attorney Chokwe Lumumba. The sisters were convicted of armed robbery and sentenced to life in prison for their role in a 1993 ambush in Scott County, Mississippi. In Florida, the sisters will be under the supervision of the Florida Department of Corrections parole office, said Suzanne Singletary, a spokeswoman for the Mississippi Department of Corrections. Lumumba said Friday that Gladys Scott had not yet been tested to determine whether her kidney could be used in a transplant.
