Forty-four percent on Mediterranean diet needed diabetes medication, compared to 70 percent on low-fat diet. "The people on the Mediterranean diet had better blood-sugar control because of the diet, and the trigger for diabetic drugs is when blood sugar is higher than you want it to be," explained Dr. Christine Laine, the editor of the journal. Studies already suggest that the Mediterranean diet -- rich in fish, fruits, nuts, and olive oil -- can prevent second heart attacks, delay Alzheimer's disease, and maybe even lower your cancer risk. A Mediterranean diet includes vegetables, whole grains, fish, poultry, and healthy fats, such as olive oil. After all, past studies have found that the Mediterranean diet can decrease the risk of heart attacks and strokes.
