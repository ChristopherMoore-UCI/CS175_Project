The actress, who turns 25 on July 2, has managed to avoid more than a few days in jail despite two drunk driving convictions, a long list of probation violations and the recent theft conviction. Lohan's failed test, which the source said happened on June 13, comes while the actress is confined to her Venice Beach, California home because of a jail sentence imposed last month. Lohan entered drug rehab last year to avoid a jail sentence imposed by another judge, but Sautner made it clear in court last month that she didn't think drugs and alcohol were not the root of Lohan's legal troubles. " "It would appear that the defendant's criminal conduct is increasing in seriousness and severity," the probation report said, yet it suggested she serve her sentence on probation and not in jail. The actress will appear before Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Stephanie Sautner at 10 a.m. Thursday, the same judge who sentenced her to 120 days in jail after she pleaded guilty to stealing a necklace, a prosecution spokeswoman said Wednesday.
