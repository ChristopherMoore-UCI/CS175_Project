The commission has placed its notices in the Murfreesboro Post for the past two years, after years of posting them in Murfreesboro's larger Daily News Journal, Demosi said. Murfreesboro is home to Middle Tennessee State University, which has an enrollment of 25,188, according to the university website. -- A proposed mosque and Islamic center in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, is dividing the city about 35 miles southeast of Nashville, Tennessee. In 2000, about 5 percent of Murfreesboro's populace was foreign-born -- almost twice the average in the state of Tennessee, the Census Bureau said. A statement on the center's website said that 95 percent of the money for the project was raised locally, in middle Tennessee, in a three-month period.
