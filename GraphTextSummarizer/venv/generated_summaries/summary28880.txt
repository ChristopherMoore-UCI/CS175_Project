But by the evening, San Diego Police Chief Shelley Zimmerman estimated about 300 homes were still evacuated in select areas. "At the point that the fire is right now, we have a pretty good handle on it," San Diego Fire Chief Javier Mainar told reporters early Tuesday evening. Authorities initially said that most of the evacuations were in San Diego city limits. The National Weather Service issued a red flag warning for areas around San Diego through 8 p.m. Wednesday. "It has been, to say the least, a very challenging day for local fire agencies and law enforcement agencies," Mainar said.
