As Israeli media were reporting on the bodies' discovery Monday night, Israeli forces were blocking roads into Hebron, a city in the southern West Bank. Tensions between Israel and Hamas ratcheted up Monday after the bodies of three Israeli teenagers, kidnapped this month, were found in the West Bank. Israel, in no uncertain terms, blames the disappearances and deaths on Hamas. The spokesman urged Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas to annul his pact with Hamas. "Hamas will pay," said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri warned against escalation, saying that if Netanyahu "brings a war on Gaza, the gates of hell will open to him."
