The twice-elected Socialist government won backing for a law in 2006 that essentially allowed many bars and restaurants to choose if they would prohibit smoking. But as smoking continued across Spain, parliament followed up with the tougher one that banned such indoor smoking. -- A restaurant shut down by police last week for repeatedly violating Spain's tough new anti-smoking law will reopen next month smoke-free, the owner of the establishment said Thursday. "I have decided to accept the law," Arias told reporters at a news conference at his restaurant, hours after regional health authorities said he had written to them, agreeing to adhere to the law that prohibits smoking in all indoor bars and restaurants. Arias last week told Spanish media he would never pay the fine, and health officials sent police on February 10 to close his restaurant, located near the popular southern Mediterranean resort of Marbella.
