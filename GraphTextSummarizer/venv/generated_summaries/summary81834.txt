but we feel strongly that due to those blessings that help arrived so quickly in such mass numbers," Tol Gropp told The Idaho Statesman's Rachel Roberts. -- The video shows the beginning of what was hoped would be a perfect plane ride, with the pilot of a 1940s-era Stinson and his three passengers smiling as the plane rumbles down a dirt runway in rural Idaho. Tol Gropp, whose father, Les Gropp, was piloting, remembers losing consciousness when the plane hit the trees. The NTSB reported Les Gropp sustained serious injuries in the accident and his son told the newspaper he had a broken jaw, but has otherwise recovered. The video, which was shot through the cockpit window, shows the runway disappearing beneath the plane and the sun glinting off the glass as the aircraft gained altitude to clear some nearby trees.
