" Haiti is the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere and has a history of political violence, extreme poverty and natural disasters, a history that Duval has witnessed firsthand. Duval has been welcoming children from the slums of Haiti to his sports program, L'Athletique d'Haiti (Athletes of Haiti), since 1996. -- Just two days before the earthquake struck Haiti, 2007 CNN Hero Boby Duval was celebrating the completion of a wall he'd built to surround -- and secure -- his youth program's athletic center in Port-au-Prince. On the brink of death himself and weighing just 90 pounds, Duval's life was saved in 1977, when then-President Carter's administration intervened and demanded the release of all political prisoners in Haiti. Once released, Duval vowed to help make Haiti a better place.
