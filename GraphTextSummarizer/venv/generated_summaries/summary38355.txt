-- Forces loyal to embattled Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi launched a new attack on the rebel-held city of Misrata on Wednesday, with anti-government forces reporting intense shelling from three sides of the city. Mohamed Mokhtar, a rebel fighter wounded in Wednesday's fighting, accused government troops of infiltrating rebel lines in cars bearing rebel flags. The spokesman said attacks Tuesday and Wednesday hit state television buildings, killing two people and wounding 16. Thousands of government troops attacked around 6 a.m. (11 p.m. Tuesday ET), with 13 rebels reported dead by evening. " "I am now speaking as planes and bombs fall around me," Gadhafi said in a live audio broadcast on state television.
