The data around background checks is clear: Up to 40% of gun transfers are made without background checks, and a national survey of inmates found that nearly 80% of those who used a handgun in a crime acquired it without a background check. And 82% of U.S. gun owners -- including more than 70% of NRA members -- support criminal background checks for all gun sales. -- I served in the armed forces for 25 years, but until January 8, 2011, I didn't think about guns or gun violence that much. Ninety-one percent of background checks are completed instantaneously, and they don't lead to a government database. Ninety-two percent of all households in the country support universal background checks.
