" In a pleading filed Thursday, Cosby attorney Martin D. Singer said Huth's claims are "absolutely false" and accused her of engaging in extortion after Cosby rejected her "outrageous demand for money in order not to make her allegations public." "Through her lawyer, Plaintiff made extortionate threats to Mr. Cosby (through his counsel) about criminal penalties, coupled with ever-increasing demands for a six-figure payday to keep quiet about her long-since expired claims," Singer said. Attorney Gloria Allred challenged comedian Bill Cosby, hounded by allegations of sexual assault, to meet his accusers in court or set aside $100 million to settle their claims. "The public deserves to know if Mr. Cosby is a saint or a sexual predator," Allred said. "It could be advantageous for Mr. Cosby to give up the statute of limitations because there is a huge cloud on his reputation and legacy," Allred said on Wednesday. "We challenge Mr. Cosby to end this nightmare for both him and the alleged victims by accepting either of the options," Allred said.
