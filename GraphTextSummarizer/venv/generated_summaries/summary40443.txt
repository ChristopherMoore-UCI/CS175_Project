The byproducts of all this -- a wonderful stew of feces, unconsumed fish food and dead fish called, sweetly, "effluent" -- create a suffocating blanket that spreads across the ocean floor, resulting in a massive dead zone surrounding the farming area. And it will create a larger demand for smaller species of wild fish to be used for fish feed necessary to support these constantly feeding frankenfish. It has also been proven that escapes from fish farms into the natural population are inevitable. If escaped, the farmed -- and now free-swimming aggressive gluttons -- will compete for the food that is essential for wild stocks to survive, further threatening  this already endangered species (nearly all Atlantic salmon sold now comes from fish farms). It kills clams, oysters, eel grasses -- where young fish feed and grow -- and more.
