There is something about finding your roots that fosters and nurtures family discussions that you would not otherwise have had. But in the mid-1960s, my parents, two young college students, started a romance in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and fell in love. I didn't know when my mom fled as a 5-year-old refugee from the bloody partition in 1947, that her Hindu relatives all disguised themselves in the traditional garb of Muslims to blend in and ensure their safety. I will never forget the questions my daughters started asking -- not just the names of their ancestors, but what kind of people were they, really? It's a tale that will inspire faith even in the most cynical of people.
