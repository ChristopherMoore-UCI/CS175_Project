-- An explosive century from birthday boy Ross Taylor helped New Zealand crush Pakistan by 110 runs and go top of their group at the Cricket World Cup. Taylor was dropped twice early in his innings, with wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal at fault, but he made the most of his reprieve with some devastating hitting, taking 24 runs off a Shoaib Akhtar over and 30 off one from Abdul Razzaq. Pakistan then slumped to 23-4 in their reply and only a partnership of 66 between Abdul Razzaq (62) and Umar Gul (34 not out) added a modicum of respectability to their total of 192. Brendon McCullum, Jamie How and James Franklin went for low totals but Scott Styris steadied the ship with 28 runs. Finishing on 302-7 off their 50 overs the Kiwis shell shocked Pakistan, who contributed to their own downfall with sloppy fielding and poor bowling.
