For four years, people have been hearing how "Foxy Knoxy," an "angel-faced killer," led her rich Italian boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito and a "drifter" named Rudy Guede into a "sex game gone wrong" the night after Halloween 2007, finally stabbing British exchange student Meredith Kercher to death with a kitchen knife. Modern young women visiting Italy might not recognize those limits, though, because the stripper or girly show girl was so mainstreamed in Italy, especially during the years of Silvio Berlusconi's control of Italian television and politics. The flip side to Italian veneration of the female deity is her legendary insatiable neediness, the voracious desire and jealousy of females, embodied in the whore, who is also still very much a part of modern Italian culture. All women are assumed to be in possession of bewitching seductive powers, but proper women are assumed to know how to use control and limit those powers. One reason for the focus on "Foxy Knoxy" to the exclusion of the men is the Italian attitude toward women.
