In the course of the whirlwind tour, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge visited the 9/11 Memorial and Museum, chatted with Hillary and Chelsea Clinton at a Royal Foundation reception and even met Jay Z, Beyonce and King James -- also known as basketball star LeBron James -- at an NBA game between the Brooklyn Nets and James' Cleveland Cavaliers. His parents seized the limelight last week on a three-day trip to New York City, where they met with celebrities, business leaders and political leaders, as well as wowing crowds of onlookers. Over a long-sleeve white shirt, he wears a knitted, navy sweater vest featuring the iconic guardsmen seen outside Buckingham Palace, home to his great-grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II. The pictures, taken in late November, show Prince George in a courtyard at Kensington Palace, where his parents have their official residence in an apartment recently refurbished at a cost of millions of dollars. One of the reasons William and Catherine released the pictures was in acknowledgment of the fact that their request for Prince George to grow up without intrusion from photography has been, and continues to be, honored, Kensington Palace said.
