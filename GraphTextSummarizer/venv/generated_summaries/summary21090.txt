Parents' growing inability to impose manners and limits on their kids when the kids are in school is reflected in record dropout rates, as well as teen drug and alcohol abuse, teen sex, and unwed pregnancies. There are no perfect parents, perfect kids, perfect families -- only degrees of dysfunction. I don't remember a generation of kids ever so indulged and enabled to behave so badly. In his new book, "Now or Never," Jack Cafferty says parenting might be on the decline more than schools are. But most of the credit does to my second wife Carol; to the girls; and to God Almighty.
