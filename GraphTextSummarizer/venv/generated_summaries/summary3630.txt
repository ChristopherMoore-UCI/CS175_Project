"Ali, who suffers from Parkinson's disease, is being treated by his team of doctors and is in stable condition," Gunnell said in a statement. Famed boxer Muhammad Ali was admitted to an undisclosed hospital Saturday with pneumonia, his spokesman Bob Gunnell said. "At this time, the Muhammad Ali family respectfully requests privacy," the statement said. In 1964, he became world heavyweight champion in an upset victory against then champion Sonny Liston, according to Ali's official website. Ali was born Cassius Clay and won an Olympic gold medal as a light-heavyweight at age 18.
