'It's never too early' Business consultants and serial entrepreneurs say that it's never too early to teach kids the benefits of sound money management and smart business practices. The girls had already visited a marketplace for young business owners and opened their own bank accounts at the Young Americans Bank in Denver, which touts itself as the world's only bank designed for kids. A study of students involved in the Network for Teaching Entrepreneurship, a program that teaches business skills to low-income youth, showed just that. Some business leaders around the country started businesses as kids, including Honest Tea's CEO Seth Goldman, who sold golf balls he dug up from the course near his home, while Vosges Haut-Chocolat's CEO Katrina Markoff, who has said she offered Easy-Bake Oven treats to customers. Students involved in the program had a 32% increase in interest in attending college, while students who did not participate saw a 17% decrease, according to a Harvard Graduate School of Education study from 2002 to 2004.
