"It is a sad day for all of us who love sport and our athletic heroes," U.S. Anti-Doping Agency CEO Travis Tygart said in a statement Thursday after Armstrong announced he would no longer cooperate with the agency. Then, in June of this year, the USADA said it had filed doping charges against the cyclist -- accusations his attorney blasted as "wrong" and "baseless," much like Armstrong has vehemently denied other such claims in the past. The USADA, a quasi-government agency recognized as the official anti-doping agency for Olympic, Pan American and Paralympic sports in the United States, accused Armstrong of using, possessing, trafficking and giving to others performance-enhancing drugs, as well as covering up doping violations. But his championship legacy, as well as those prestigious wins, may now be history after Armstrong announced Thursday that he would not participate in what he called a "one-sided and unfair" process to challenge doping charges brought against him by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency. As to the public's reaction to his decision, Armstrong said that he believes they understand and accept his rationale -- including his desire to focus on other things besides fighting doping allegations.
