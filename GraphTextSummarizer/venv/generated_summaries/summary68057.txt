The eight-time French Open champion Rafael Nadal finds himself meeting old rival Andy Murray in the quarterfinals of the Rome Masters. Sharapova had been tuning up for this year's grand slam at Roland Garros in fine fettle, winning tournaments in Stuttgart and Madrid, but Ivanovic stormed to 6-1 6-4 victory to end her run in the third round of the Rome event. Australian Open champion Li Na ticked off a 6-3 6-1 win over Sam Stosur while Serena Williams beat fellow American Varvarato Lepchenko to also advance to the last eight. Murray celebrated his 27th birthday with victory over Jurgen Melzer while Nadal cruised past Mikhail Youzhny. It was the first time anyone other than world No.1 Serena Williams had beaten the Russian on the red stuff since the 2011 French Open.
