And not the Gap now, but the Gap when it was jeans and flannel shirts. Sitting in her trailer between filming scenes for "Parenthood," Lauren Graham is still in hair and makeup, but dressed in what could be considered her casual uniform: a pair of stretchy jeans tucked into boots, a tank top, and a Current/Elliott denim shirt. My boyfriend has a friend who calls me Bootsy because I wear jeans tucked into boots 9 times out of 10! It was the '80s, so it wasn't terrible, but I was wearing my dad's dress shirts over jeans from the Gap. But [in the past] I've definitely spent a lot of time worrying about work, taking jobs when I maybe could have taken some time off - really pushing myself.
