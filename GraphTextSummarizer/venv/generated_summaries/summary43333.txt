Half the approximately 60,000 residents of Rapid City were without power as of Friday evening, said Jerry Reichert, a battalion chief with the Rapid City Fire Department. At least one tree landed on the roof of a home on Friday, but Reichert said he was not aware of any fatalities or injuries as of Friday evening. Reichert said firefighters responded to reports of several people stuck in the road because of the weather. -- Wicked weather dominated much of the American Midwest and westward on Friday. A few people sustained minor injuries, but luckily no one was killed, said mayor Ken Chamberlain.
