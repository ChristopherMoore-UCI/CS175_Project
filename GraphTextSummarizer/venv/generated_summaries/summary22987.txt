President Barack Obama and John McCain are once again at odds over national security: this time, it's over the North Korean cyberattack on Sony Pictures. " A group of North Korean-backed hackers broke into Sony Pictures' servers last month and threatened to attack movie theaters screening the movie, "The Interview," a satirical comedy depicting an assassination attempt against North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Sen. John McCain rejected Obama's characterization of the North Korean hack as "an act of cybervandelism," instead calling it "a new form of warfare" on CNN's State of the Union. In his interview with CNN's Candy Crowley that aired Sunday, Obama countered critics like McCain who have said Obama has been outmaneuvered by Putin and pointed to the Russian economic collapse as evidence. " McCain also joined the fray of Republicans -- including most prominently potential 2016 presidential candidate Sen. Marco Rubio -- who have criticized Obama's decision to ease sanctions and normalize relations with Cuba, claiming that Obama is rewarding Cuba for bad behavior.
