A Quinnipiac University poll released Thursday shows Udall trailing Rep. Cory Gardner by eight points. A pair of polls released show Democratic Sen. Mark Udall falling behind his Republican opponent in the tight Colorado race for his seat. And while Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper shared a beer with Obama in Denver in July, Udall wasn't in the picture for the photo-op. The two nonpartisan polls are the first time Udall has been behind his opponent since the last Quinnipiac poll gave Gardner a 2-point lead in July. But Gardner's hefty lead in the Quinnipiac poll could also be an outlier: It's the second time this week that Quinnipiac has strayed from the pack of polls.
