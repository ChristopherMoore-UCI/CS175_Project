The 5th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals has stayed the execution of Texas death row inmate Scott Panetti, who was scheduled to be put to death at 6 p.m. Wednesday, according to the court clerk's office. "Rather than serving as a measured response to murder, the execution of Mr. Panetti would only serve to undermine the public's faith in a fair and moral justice system," their letter reads. Panetti has suffered from schizophrenia for 30 years, his lawyers say, and he was hospitalized for mental illness numerous times before the murders. More than a dozen conservative leaders -- including a Washington Times opinion editor and a Ronald Reagan biographer -- have also written to Perry, asking that Panetti's execution be halted and his sentence be commuted to life in prison. Columbia University psychiatry professor and American Psychiatric Association member Dr. Paul Appelbaum said that he's followed the case since 2007, when the U.S. Supreme Court stopped Panetti's execution and ruled that another competency review be performed.
