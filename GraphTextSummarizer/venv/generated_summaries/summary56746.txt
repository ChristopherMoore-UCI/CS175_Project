The Cuban government had previously said that it would get out of the restaurant business, and Friday's announcement is "part of the updating of the economic social model," said Deputy Minister of Domestic Trade Ada Chavez. According to the Cuban National Statistics office, Cuba hosted around 2.8 million tourists in 2012, and private restaurants are very important to the development of the tourism industry. Thousands of now-state-run restaurants in Cuba will move into the private sector and be run by citizen owners, the island nation's government announced Friday. Cuba's Domestic Trade department said that the government was seeking to expand "services with quality and safety that the Cuban people and tourists visiting the island deserve." "In order to lift the economy, the Cuban government took the decision to get out of businesses they have been running badly for the last 50 years," Philip Peters, president of the Cuban Research Center, a Washington-based analysis organization told CNN Friday .
