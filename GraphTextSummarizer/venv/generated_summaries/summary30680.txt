"When they arrived, they were able to determine that an aggravated assault had occurred against two people at the residence," Lt. David E. Price, a Pine Bluff police spokesman, said in a statement. SWAT officers slipped a camera into the room where Isadore was holed up and saw he was armed with a handgun, Price said. -- A man who police said was 107 years old was killed in a confrontation with SWAT officers Saturday night. After unsuccessful negotiations, officers slipped gas into the room through a window, he said, and Isadore fired rounds at them. Police were called to a home in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, where suspect Monroe Isadore was.
