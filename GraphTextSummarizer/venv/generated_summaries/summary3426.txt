Hagel has been criticized for being a secretary who implements White House policy rather than being a dynamic member of a tight inner Obama circle offering new ideas and options. If Obama pushed Hagel out because he is looking for a course correction on the war against ISIS in Iraq and Syria, it has not gotten to the point where Hagel or the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Martin Dempsey, have been asked for any new options. The White House has a big problem on its hands: finding someone to replace Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, who was pushed out of the administration this week. Another name now being widely circulated is former Deputy Defense Secretary Ashton Carterâ€”who is widely credited with reforming cumbersome and expensive weapons acquisition procedures and programs, but who had clashed in the past with White House staff as well. Since Michele Flournoy withdrew her name from consideration on Tuesday, there is a growing sense that many potential candidates may be shying away from the job due to the short time frame they would be in office and concerns over how independently they can function from the National Security Council, according to both current and former senior administration and congressional officials.
