A prosecutor who handled Manson's parole hearings told CNN in 2009 that Manson had a "laundry list of violations in prison." The latest photos of notorious killer Charles Manson have been released by the California Department of Corrections, one week before his next parole hearing. Prison officials said they tracked phone numbers in California, Oregon and Maine. Photos are taken of prisoners when they are transferred to other prisons or medical facilities or, in the case of Manson, when an inmate's appearance changes. At the request of CNN, the department provided two photographs of Manson taken in June at the state prison in Corcoran, California.
