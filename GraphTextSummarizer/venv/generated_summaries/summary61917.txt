The tragedy of Winehouse's passing wasn't just that the predictions came true, or that we'd lost an undeniably great talent, but also that she lost a fight so early in life. This was an artist who was blessed with the presence of someone who'd seen it all and a voice from another lifetime, a woman who could write about and then sing to life some of love's darkest sides. An inquest last fall ruled that she'd died of alcohol poisoning and a family spokesman said at the time that "Amy was battling hard to conquer her problems with alcohol, and it is a source of great pain that she could not win in time." Growing out of that decade often means growing out of bad decision-making, frustrated searching and feeling generally as though life's a pinball machine -- and you're the ball. Her massive appeal was backed by strong production on both albums, thanks to collaborations with producers Salaam Remi and Mark Ronson, and of course that voice -- rich, evocative and captivating.
