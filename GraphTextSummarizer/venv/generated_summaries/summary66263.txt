General Assembly has applied for asylum in the United States, and "he's afraid to return to Iran," his attorney said Monday. New York City-based lawyer Paul O'Dwyer, who said he is working with U.S. authorities on behalf of Hassan Golkanbhan, said his client is afraid of persecution because of his perceived political beliefs. " When Golkanbhan's part of the Iranian delegation returned home last Thursday after Ahmadinejad's addressed the General Assembly on Wednesday, the cameraman stayed behind, O'Dwyer said. Calls to the Iranian mission at the United Nations have not been returned, and the whereabouts of Golkanbhan are not clear.
