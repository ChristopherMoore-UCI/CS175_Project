There is no reason to doubt that Pistorius believed there was an intruder in the bathroom who posed a threat to him and to Steenkamp when he fired the fatal shots through the toilet door, Roux said. He sold his last asset, his car, not to try to get a better sentence but to try to make good by helping the Steenkamp family, Roux said, also citing Pistorius' past charitable work. Pistorius did not have railings in his shower at home, Nel said, as he rejected defense arguments that the accused could not be accommodated properly in prison. -- Lawyers painted opposing pictures of South African athlete Oscar Pistorius in their final arguments Friday before his sentencing -- one side depicting him as a broken man who's suffered enough, while the other said he must pay for taking his girlfriend's life. The evidence presented in court demonstrated that as a double amputee, Pistorius' negligent actions in the shooting could not be seen outside the context of his disability, he said.
