Obama mentioned this time and time again: taxes, deficit reduction, entitlements, regulations to Wall Street and health care. Romney stuck to his theme of too much government overstretch during the Obama administration, whether on energy subsidies, health care, taxes or increasing the deficit. Romney can lose more votes than he can gain in future debates if he comes across as rude or mean, an impression many had of McCain four years ago. Reasoning is another strength Obama has shown in previous debates, but he was unable to use it in any significant way. But both have a track record of debates showcasing their strengths and weaknesses, and they are both good debaters.
