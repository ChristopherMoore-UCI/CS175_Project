-- A federal judge in New Orleans ruled Thursday that Transocean is not liable for Deepwater Horizon compensatory damages sought by third parties in the worst oil spill in U.S. history. A spokesman for Transocean said the ruling confirms "that BP is responsible for all economic damages caused by the oil that leaked from its Macondo well, and discredits BP's ongoing attempts to evade both its contractual and financial obligations. As we have said from the beginning, Transocean cannot avoid its responsibility for this accident," a BP statement said. While all official investigations have concluded that Transocean played a causal role in the accident, the contractor has long contended it is fully indemnified by BP for the liabilities resulting from the oil spill. "Transocean is pleased to see its position affirmed, consistent with the law and the long-established model for allocating risks in the offshore-oil and gas industry," spokesman Lou Colasuonno said.
