Serena Williams also made untroubled progress into the second round coasting past compatriot Anna Tatishvili in straight sets 6-1 6-2. Radwanska's younger sister Urszula won't be taking any further part though after going down in straight sets 6-2 6-4 to ninth seed Angelique Kerber from Germany. Fifth seed Stanislas Wawrinka booked his spot in the second round with a victory over Joao Sousa. The 10th seed was made to work, however, and had to edge a tiebreak 7-5 in the second set en route to a 6-4 7-6 7-5 win. The Australian Open champion looked comfortable as he saw off his Portuguese opponent in straight sets with a 6-3 6-4 6-3 win and will next face Yen-Hsun Lu.
