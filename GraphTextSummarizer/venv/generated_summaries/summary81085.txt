"It's going to be a long dialogue on gun control and gun rights, and it will be hard to strike a balance between those two positions," he said. " Templeton told CNN affiliate KGUN the massacre had nothing to do with lawful gun ownership. "We had a moment of silence here at the show," Templeton said, referring to the deaths of six people and the wounding of 13 others, including U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, after last Saturday's shooting. Templeton knows there will be a renewed debate on gun control. "Responsible firearm ownership means if you are going to have a gun, you should be trained to use it in a responsible way." Bill Schaeffler of Tucson, among those at the show Saturday, said he knows gun control and high-capacity ammunition magazines will be hot topics.
