The Strait Times newspaper reported that Yee's bail was set at $14,500 and that Yee's father apologized to Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, who is the son of Lee Kuan Yew. On the day of Lee's funeral, Yee was arrested after Singapore police said it received more than 20 reports regarding his video, which police said contained "disparaging remarks against Christians." A 16-year-old teenager has been charged for a tirade he posted on YouTube regarding the death of the late Singapore leader, Lee Kuan Yew. While admired for his role turning the former British colony into a financial power house, Lee was also criticized for tamping down on free speech in Singapore. Critics say Yee's arrest highlights the restrictions on free speech in Singapore.
