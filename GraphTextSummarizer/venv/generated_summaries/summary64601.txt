We learned a lot about what really works in our Katrina recovery efforts -- but New York and New Jersey seem to be ignoring those lessons. First, I would like to praise the search and rescue operations in New York and New Jersey. This has not happened in New York or New Jersey. New York and New Jersey need to establish what is called an "enabler" model for recovery, which we developed during Katrina. Why did New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo only call in half the New York Guard, especially when relief is still not reaching the severely affected communities?
