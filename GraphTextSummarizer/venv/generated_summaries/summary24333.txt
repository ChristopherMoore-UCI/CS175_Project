It also remains to be seen how Russia -- Yanukovych's ally -- will respond with the Winter Olympics in Sochi closing on Sunday. They wondered where President Viktor Yanukovych, who reportedly tried to leave the country Saturday night, had gone. Last we heard, Yanukovych was in Kharkiv, a pro-Russian stronghold near Ukraine's border with that nation. "Either they don't understand the consequences of what they're doing, or they're engaged in a very provocative game of destabilizing Ukraine and therefore Eastern Europe," Churkin said in a post on his official Twitter account. She served as prime minister from 2007 until she was forced out of office in 2010 after losing the election to Yanukovych.
