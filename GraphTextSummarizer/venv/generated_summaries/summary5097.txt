Drug cartels pressure journalists and editors in Mexico to avoid reporting on them and to print unflattering stories about rival drug cartels. The Chihuahua attorney general's office said Friday it is investigating whether the car in which two photojournalists were shot Thursday in northern Mexico belonged to a human-rights activist who may have been the intended target. Much of the violence stems from turf wars between rival cartels and battles between the cartels and the Mexican authorities. Ciudad Juarez is one of the deadliest cities in Mexico, with 2,185 killings since January 1 and the country is one of the most dangerous for journalists. Press freedom organizations say Mexico does not do enough to investigate the killing of journalists.
