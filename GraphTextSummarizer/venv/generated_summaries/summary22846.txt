The January 5 sale helped Kraft boost the cash element of its offer, which would give Cadbury shareholders cash in addition to Kraft shares. "We believe the offer represents good value for Cadbury shareholders and are pleased with the commitment that Kraft Foods has made to our heritage, values, and people throughout the world," Cadbury Chairman Roger Carr said in a statement. In addition, Cadbury shareholders will be entitled to receive 10 pence (16 cents) per Cadbury share. -- The board of British chocolate maker Cadbury accepted a buyout offer from American food giant Kraft Tuesday, a deal that would end the nearly 200-year-old independence of the beloved British brand. The board has agreed to recommend the offer to Cadbury shareholders, who have until February 2 to decide -- but they are expected to approve it.
