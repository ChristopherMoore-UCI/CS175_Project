"Losing Lt. Schulte has been a tragedy felt by everyone here and across the Air Force," said Col. Terrence O'Shaughnessy, 613th AOC commander. The U.S. Air Force Academy is mourning its first female graduate to be killed by enemy forces in Afghanistan or Iraq. Her father told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that his daughter was a natural leader who was teaching Afghan forces how to handle military intelligence. She is the 10th graduate to die in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the academy said. Roslyn L. Schulte, 25, died Wednesday near Kabul, Afghanistan, of wounds suffered in a roadside bomb attack.
