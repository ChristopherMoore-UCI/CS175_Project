And we can also get some early revenue from one-time gimmicks like drilling a million gas wells, selling non-core assets (Guam?), sale-and-lease-backs on real estate (the Capitol?) and more aggressive corporate partnerships (Exxon-Yellowstone National Park?) (And there's no guarantee that the guys running your blind trust will have had time to bet against America before things start to unravel.) We also found big potential cost savings from outsourcing not just jobs but entire government departments to India. In fact, the bottom line is that even after we take control, there will be real limits on what we can do without the support of some really crazy people. Even better, our modeling shows that if we only break promises for younger people (say, under 54) they won't feel any real pain until after 2016 or 2020 when we'll already have exited the deal and been long gone.
