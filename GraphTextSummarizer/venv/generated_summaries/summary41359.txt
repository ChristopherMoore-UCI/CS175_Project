-- Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson was left raging after claiming Robin van Persie "could have been killed" following an altercation with Swansea's Ashley Williams. " Patrice Evra's 16th-minute header from a Van Persie corner had given United the lead before Michu equalized with his 13th Premier League goal of the season -- which put the Spaniard one clear of Van Persie as the leading scorer. That strike established him as the club's leading goalscorer in the top flight as he marked his 500th Premier League start with his 130th goal. Ferguson, whose side moved four points clear at the top of the English Premier League table following Sunday's 1-1 draw, accused Williams of deliberately kicking the ball at the striker's head while he lay on the ground. Van Persie and Williams squared up to each other following the incident as both sets of players tried to break up the confrontation.
