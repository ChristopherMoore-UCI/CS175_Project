-- Ugandan police announced Thursday the arrest of a 22-year-old man who they say confessed to killing gay rights activist David Kato. An angered Nsubuga told police that he then took a hammer from the bathroom and fatally beat Kato. In a news conference at which suspect Enock Nsubuga was presented to the media, authorities said he admitted using a hammer to bludgeon Kato to death. According to Kato's lawyer, the activist had feared for his safety prior to his death, even alerting police about his concerns. Nsubuga was taken into custody Wednesday afternoon, though police said they'd been tracking him for several days.
