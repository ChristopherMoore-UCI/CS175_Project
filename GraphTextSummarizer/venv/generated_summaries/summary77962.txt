In a short statement provided to CNN by Schibbye's mother, Karin, the two journalists said: "There is a tradition of mercy and forgiveness in Ethiopia and we choose to rely on this tradition." The Swedish Union of Journalists reiterated that Persson and Schibbye were in Ethiopia working as journalists. " Schibbye and Persson are being held under harsh circumstances at the Kality prison, Karin Schibbye told CNN. So if anyone wants to help out and send down English books to their new library that would be great," Karin Schibbye told CNN. Martin Schibbye and Johan Persson were convicted in December by a court in Addis Ababa after being accused of helping the Ogaden National Liberation Front, which Ethiopia has labeled a terrorist organization, and for entering Ethiopia illegally.
