David Zweig, political science professor at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, says opposition from Party conservatives and vested interests may still be too strong. But on occasion, plenums have been witness to robust debates and sweeping decisions on Party and government policies. Still, China's leaders will unveil some economic reforms even if there is no sweeping policy package, said Cai Hongbin, Dean of the Guanghua School of Management at Peking University - sometimes called the Harvard Business School of China. China watchers will be looking closely to see if this plenum becomes a launchpad for major new reforms, as the meetings have in the past. It serves as a kind of parliament of the Party.
