Hadi and Prime Minister Khaled Bahah resigned in January under Houthi pressure, a few months after the rebels entered the capital with guns blazing, demanding greater political influence. Hadi, who had been under house arrest since he resigned under pressure from Houthi rebels in the capital, Sanaa, last month, fled with the help of forces loyal to him at about 4 a.m., one of his advisers said on condition of anonymity. "President Hadi escaped from his residence after the Houthis arrested him and oppressed him and his family," one of the advisers said on condition of anonymity. Houthis then pressured Hadi and Bahah to step down last month after the pair refused to agree to certain political demands. Details about how Hadi slipped away from house arrest -- he had been under guard by Houthi security personnel -- were not immediately available.
