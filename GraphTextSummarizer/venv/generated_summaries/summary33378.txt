Older high school students often help tutor or run activities for the younger children, and several members have come back to work for the organization after completing high school and college. But Madondo washed cars and worked as a stock boy to earn money to stay in school, and he became the first member of his family to graduate from high school. The deal is simple: Students must agree to stay in school and attend mandatory tutoring sessions twice a week; in exchange, KYP agrees to provide uniforms, books and school fees for any student who cannot afford them. Primary school students are tutored by the program's staff twice a week; on alternate days, professional teachers work with the high school students to prepare them for the matriculation exams required at the end of 12th grade. The organization opens the doors to its headquarters every weekday at 7 a.m. to hand out sandwiches for students to take to school.
