Dr. Brooke Lundbohm told the Waukesha County, Wisconsin, court that Morgan believes she has mind-control capabilities and can talk to Harry Potter villain Lord Voldemort, according to CNN affiliate WITI. Another expert, Dr. Kenneth Robbins, said Morgan wasn't concerned about a potential long prison sentence, and she said she uses Vulcan mind control, of "Star Trek" fame, to feel or believe whatever she wants, WITI reported. -- One of the 12-year-olds charged with stabbing a friend to impress the fictional Internet bogeyman Slenderman was deemed incompetent to stand trial Friday -- at least for now -- according to court documents. "Court finds the defendant is standing mute," court documents show. The judge in the case set a November 12 hearing to discuss the competency report and found "that the defendant is incompetent to proceed at this time but likely to become competent," court documents say.
