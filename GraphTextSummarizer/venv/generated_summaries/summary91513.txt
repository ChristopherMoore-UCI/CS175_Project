Both groups are "deeply disappointed" by Monday's ruling, which Palestinian Authority spokesman Mahmoud Khalifa said stemmed from "baseless" charges and "ignored the legal precedent set time and again by other U.S. courts ... that established U.S. courts are not the proper jurisdiction for such a hearing. A U.S. court has ruled that the Palestinian Authority and Palestinian Liberation Organization must pay more than $650 million to American citizens and their loved ones  for attacks in Israel in the early 2000s. According to figures from Israel's internal security agency, known as the Shin Bet, some 488 Israelis died in suicide attacks between 2001 and 2004. The U.S. case dates back to the Second Intifada, or armed uprising, in which Palestinians staged a series of deadly attacks inside Israel. " Khalifa expressed confidence that the PLO and Palestinian Authority will prevail in American courts during its coming appeal.
