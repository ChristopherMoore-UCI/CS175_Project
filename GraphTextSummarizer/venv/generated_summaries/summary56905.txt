Pentagon spokesman Col. Steve Warren said the plane suffered maintenance problems after takeoff and then crashed as it attempted to return. The crash happened at about 11 p.m. ET Sunday, U.S. Central Command said in a statement Monday. A U.S. Air Force pilot was killed when the F-16 Fighting Falcon he was flying crashed in an noncombat incident in Jordan, officials said. It did not give a location, other than to say the crash was not in Syria or Iraq. A U.S. official told CNN the crash happened in Jordan.
