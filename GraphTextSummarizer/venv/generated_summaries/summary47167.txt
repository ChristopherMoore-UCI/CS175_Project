Mickey Rooney, whose roller-coaster, nine-decade career in show business included vaudeville, silent films, movies, television and Broadway, died Sunday. After another 15 years of minor movie parts and TV roles, Rooney's up-and-down career once again hit the heights. "If Mr. Rooney were to not work, I think we would be attending Mr. Rooney's funeral in very short order. " Rooney made his audience laugh and cry when he implored senators to stop what experts call chronic emotional, physical, sexual and financial abuse of elderly Americans by family members and other caregivers. The films were hugely popular, even more so when Rooney's character became the centerpiece starting with 1938's "Love Finds Andy Hardy."
