-- If anything were to go seriously wrong at Tuesday's inauguration of Barack Obama, Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff is the man who would manage the crisis response. " Critics have accused inauguration organizers of engaging in security overkill, but Chertoff said he has tried to strike a balance. Chertoff's first stop was the multi-agency command center from which he will monitor inaugural events. "I am still focused on the kind of event we had at Virginia Tech: one disturbed person kills a bunch of people. This is the security nerve center for the inauguration, with representatives of federal, state and local agencies that will help secure the swearing-in, the parade, the balls and other special events.
