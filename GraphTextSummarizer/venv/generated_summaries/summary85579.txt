Phillipos is charged with lying to federal agents investigating the bombing, concealing the fact that he, Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov had gone into Tsarnaev's room and removed the backpack, the indictment says. Authorities allege on April 18, three days before the FBI searched Tsarnaev's dorm room, Kadyrbayev showed Tazhayakov a text message from Tsarnaev that read, in part, "If yu want yu can go to my room and take what's there" followed by a smiley face emoticon. Two friends of Boston Marathon bombings suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev pleaded not guilty in Friday to a superseding federal indictment charging them with conspiracy to obstruct justice and obstructing justice with intent to impede authorities. That day, the trio allegedly went into the dorm, took Tsarnaev's laptop, as well as a backpack containing Vaseline, a thumb drive, fireworks and a "homework assignment sheet" and took and took them back to Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov's New Bedford apartment, the federal indictment against them states. Authorities accuse the trio of helping Tsarnaev after the deadly April 15 bombing by taking items from his dorm room and keeping them from authorities.
