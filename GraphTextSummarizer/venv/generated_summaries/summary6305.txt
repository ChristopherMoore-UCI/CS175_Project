Acting U.S. Assistant Attorney General Sam Hirsch, who will attend Friday's ceremony, said President Obama has long worked to strengthen ties between the United States and the Navajo Nation, adding that "it reflects my personal commitment to resolving long-standing lawsuits rather than wasting the time and resources of both the United States and Indian tribes in contentious litigation." It has the largest reservation in the United States, spreading 27,000 square miles over Arizona, New Mexico and Utah, with an additional 14 million acres of trust land leased out to various agricultural endeavors. The Navajo Nation will mark history Friday when it officially announces a $554 million settlement from the U.S. government, putting an end to years of litigation. In May, an agreement was reached between members of the Navajo Nation, the U.S. Interior and Justice departments and the Bureau of Indian Affairs and will be sealed with a signing ceremony Friday at Window Rock Tribal Park in Arizona. This is the largest trust responsibility award from the United States in the history of Indian country.
