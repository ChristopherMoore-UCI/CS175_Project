West Hollywood also regulates chicken cages and passed what the city says was the first ordinance banning the declawing of cats. Pawn shops still can deal in fur, and individuals can wear fur and bring back fur products they bought elsewhere. As of Saturday, it's against the law in West Hollywood to sell fur apparel. Violators of the ban on fur sale are subject to fines starting at $250. Some residents planned to celebrate the new ordinance with a rally and vegan pizza party, CNN affiliate KCAL-TV reported.
