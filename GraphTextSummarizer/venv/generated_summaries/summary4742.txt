After watching the other nine celebrities and their pro dancing partners run through sambas, rumbas and jives, Ribeiro and pro dancer Witney Carson took the floor with a jazz routine set to Tom Jones' "It's Not Unusual" -- a.k.a. the song that Ribeiro's "Fresh Prince" character, Carlton Banks, couldn't help but dance to. Dressed in a costume straight out of his "Fresh Prince's" character's closet -- a v-neck sweater and a bow tie -- Ribeiro looked like he was having a blast re-creating those exuberant dance steps along with Carson. On Monday night, the former "Fresh Prince of Bel Air" star dusted off his old familiar moves in week four of the competition. The theme of the week was "Most Memorable Year," and "Dancing" saved the best for last.
