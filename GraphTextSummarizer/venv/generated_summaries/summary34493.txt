In the past, transportation security officers had to rely on TSA explosive specialists or local law enforcement to check out powders that required additional screening. During pilot tests late last year, a "very small percentage" of the baggage stream required additional tests, said Lee, who declined to give specific numbers, citing security concerns. "The majority of passengers won't notice any difference in checkpoint procedures," said TSA spokeswoman Kristin Lee. The vast majority of common powders -- infant formula, medication and makeup -- did not need additional screening, she said. If powder does need another level of screening, it will be done in a way that avoids contamination of the product, and passengers will be made aware of the test, she said.
