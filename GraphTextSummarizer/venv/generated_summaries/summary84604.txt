"The way that the outbreak developed and the appearance of other similar cases in the region, we realized this was a problem of a different magnitude," said Dr. Manuel Santin PeÃ±a, Cuba's national director of epidemiology. Illness kills three in eastern Cuba This summer had already been particularly hot with heavy rains that caused outhouses to flood into several drinking wells. He said doctors were waiting on test results for tens of other possible cases but said so far fewer than 30% percent of suspected cases had been shown to be cholera. To combat the outbreak, the local government has closed 12 contaminated wells around Manzanillo, Santin said. Cholera kills nearly 500 in Cameroon Kiosks throughout Manzanillo that sell milkshakes, iced drinks or other foods that come into contact with water have been shuttered.
