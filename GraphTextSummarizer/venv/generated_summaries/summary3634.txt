It's the first in a new series featuring Iraq war veteran and private investigator Spero Lucas. Pelecanos: Last week, I watched three extraordinary genre movies from, respectively, Japan, South Korea and Hong Kong: "13 Assassins," also "The Man from Nowhere" and "Ip Man." I imagined Spero Lucas to be the same way. Pelecanos: I'll get started on a new Spero Lucas book soon. When he's not working for a Washington defense attorney, Lucas recovers stolen property for a 40% cut.
