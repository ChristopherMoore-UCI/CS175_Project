My wife and I decided to start a project to digitally preserve world heritage sites. This devastated me, and I couldn't help but wonder about the fate of my old friends, the winged bulls, and the fate of heritage sites all over the world. With the help of a global network of partners, we've completed more than 50 projects to date, including Chichen Itza, Rapa Nui, Babylon, Rosslyn Chapel, Pompeii and Mount Rushmore. Two years ago, we were approached by a partner of ours to digitally preserve an important heritage site, a UNESCO heritage site in Uganda, the Royal Kasubi Tombs. Through them and the site, I learned the stories of the civilization that lived along the Tigris River in what was now Northern Iraq.
