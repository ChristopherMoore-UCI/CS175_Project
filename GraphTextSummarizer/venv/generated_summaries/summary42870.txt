"I've been watching the NFL for years, and I don't remember a more automatic, sure thing." Which leads to the "Suck for Luck" movement. Viking fans have been waiting years for a great quarterback in his prime, and have to be salivating at the prospects of having Luck and All-Pro running back Adrian Peterson in the same huddle. From Miami to Indianapolis, from Minnesota to St. Louis, some fans want their team to lose as many games as possible to get the No. 1 pick in the next NFL draft, which would give them an opportunity to draft the player who is widely regarded as the most polished prospect at quarterback in years to enter the league. "We don't really pay much attention to it, to be honest with you," Denver coach John Fox said this week when asked about the Luck sweepstakes. The Vikings (1-5) rolled the dice in the offseason, acquiring veteran quarterback Donovan McNabb, but he has struggled mightily and will be replaced this week by untested Christian Ponder.
