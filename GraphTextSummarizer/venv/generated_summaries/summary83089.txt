The University of Pennsylvania is offering a class next semester titled "Wasting time on the Internet," in which students will "focus on the alchemical recuperation of aimless surfing into substantial works of literature. "Eventually, however, they'll have to take the detritus from that time wasted -- tweets, posts, photos, browser history, a painkiller prescription for their carpal tunnel -- and turn it into 'substantial works of literature.' " Goldsmith told Motherboard's Jason Koebler that he wants his students to be distracted, dividing their time between multiple devices including phones, tablets and laptops. "In practice, the course will play out a little like this: Students will spend a lot of time chatting with friends, watching YouTube videos, surfing Facebook, exploring Reddit, and, who are we kidding, skimming UPenn-specific BuzzFeed lists," Bereznak writes. Yahoo tech columnist Alyssa Bereznak notes that the course is taught at the Ivy League school by poet and professor Kenneth Goldsmith.
