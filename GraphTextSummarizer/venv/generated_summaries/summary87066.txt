Among those caught up in the finger-pointing after the building's collapse are Western retailers and clothing brands that Bangladeshi suppliers say put heavy pressure on prices, resulting in bad pay and conditions for workers. The building, which housed five factories full of garment workers, caved in, burying hundreds of people in a heap of concrete. Authorities pulled more bodies from the rubble, bringing the number of people killed to 931, Bangladesh's national news agency BSS reported Thursday. Rescue workers saved more than 2,400 people in the aftermath of the collapse, but have focused on using heavy machinery to uncover bodies buried beneath the ruins. The owners of the building and the factories are under investigation over accusations they ordered workers to enter the premises on the day of the collapse despite cracks in the structure the day before.
