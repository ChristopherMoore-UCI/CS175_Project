"The Egyptian parliament should make sure that this state of emergency, a hallmark of Hosni Mubarak's abusive police state, has no future," Joe Stork, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch, said in an online statement. Human Rights Watch urged Egypt's new parliament to act Wednesday, saying it had "an opportunity to close an abusive chapter in Egypt's history" by ending all measures related to the law when its current extension expired Thursday. -- Egypt's emergency law -- which was in place for more than 30 years -- has been lifted, a spokesman for the ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces said Thursday. The emergency law gave authorities broad leeway to arrest citizens and hold them indefinitely without charges, according to Human Rights Watch. The unpopular and wide-ranging law became a focal point for demonstrations demanding the ouster of President Hosni Mubarak more than a year ago.
