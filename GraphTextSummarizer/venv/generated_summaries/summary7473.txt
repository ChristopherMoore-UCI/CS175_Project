David Brown Jr., the son of Dallas Police Chief David Brown, was also killed during an exchange of gunfire with responding officers, Dallas County Sheriff Lupe Valdez said. Charles Cato, the Dallas Police Department's first assistant chief, said, "Chief Brown asks that the Dallas community keep his family in their prayers this evening -- and in the days to come -- as his family tries to comprehend the circumstances surrounding this tragic incident." But Chief Brown also wanted to make that sure our officers were OK, and especially the family of Officer Shaw." "According to our investigation, Lancaster officers were called out to a scene and shots were exchanged where two people were killed including Officer Shaw and the suspect," Valdez told reporters Monday. "I just heard lots of quick shots, you know, like, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom," she told CNN affiliate WFAA.
