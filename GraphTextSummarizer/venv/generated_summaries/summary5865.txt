-- Pollsters in Peru said Sunday that left-leaning Ollanta Humala looks poised to win the presidency, defeating rival Keiko Fujimori in a polarizing runoff election that pits the county's left and right against each other. She is the daughter of former Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori, who is currently in prison on a 25-year sentence for human rights crimes. Early exit polls released as voting closed at 5 p.m. ET gave Humala as much as a 5-percentage-point lead over Fujimori, the daughter of a former president who's serving a 25-year sentence for human rights abuses. Centrist candidates, including former President Alejandro Toledo, former Lima Mayor Luis Castaneda and former Finance Minister Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, cannibalized each others' votes during the first round of voting in April. Pollster CPI showed Humala with 52.5% of the vote and Fujimori with 47.5%.
