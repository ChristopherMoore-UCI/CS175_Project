-- President Obama is facing great challenges as he takes office and may have made a hasty decision to close Guantanamo Bay without addressing all of the repercussions, Sen. John McCain told CNN's Larry King Thursday night. Obama got to work from day one by ordering a halt to prosecutions of Guantanamo Bay prisoners, followed by an order to close the detention facility within a year and ban torture. Sen. John McCain says he thinks President Obama should have considered where Guantamao prisoners will go. Watch McCain talk about the problem with closing Guantanamo Bay Â» McCain said instead of closing Guantanamo Bay outright, he would have first continued the military commissions, which "after years of delay and obfuscation" were finally moving toward trials. "I think that it's a wise move," McCain said about closing Guantanamo Bay.
