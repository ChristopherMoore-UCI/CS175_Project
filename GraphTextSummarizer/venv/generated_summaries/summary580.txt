Early access to books is yet another perk added to the Amazon Prime membership program, joining streaming shows and movies, thousands of free Kindle titles, and free two-day shipping. Amazon is launching a program that releases select books to Kindle readers a month before they go on sale to everyone else. Kindle First is free to Amazon Prime members, while other people will pay $1.99 a month for their book. Called Kindle First, the program lets readers pick one of four books a month, chosen by Amazon editors from a variety of categories. Amazon Prime is designed to lure customers into Amazon's vast ecosystem of content and physical goods.
