More than 30,000 migrants and refugees from Tunisia and Libya have risked this dangerous journey to Lampedusa since last February. -- As many as 270 Libyan refugees were missing in the sea after the overcrowded boat they were in encountered bad weather, the Tunisian state-run TAP news agency reported.
