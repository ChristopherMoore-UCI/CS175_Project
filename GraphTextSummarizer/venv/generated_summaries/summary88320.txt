Amid growing unrest in Panama, then-U.S. President George H.W. Bush ordered the invasion of Panama in December 1989, saying Noriega's rule posed a threat to U.S. lives and property. Noriega returned to Panama late last year, nearly 22 years after U.S. forces forcibly removed him from office. Noriega was indicted in the United States on charges of racketeering, laundering drug money and drug trafficking. Noriega fled his offices and tried to seek sanctuary in the Vatican Embassy in Panama City. He was moved to the Panama City hospital because of hypertension and a possible stroke, they said, citing his medical team.
