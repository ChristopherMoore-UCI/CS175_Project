Last day playing partner Keegan Bradley suffered a nightmare final round on the greens, lipping out several short putts to see his challenge fade with a 75. That left him two shots clear of Andrew Svoboda and Robert Streb, with U.S. Ryder Cup player Jeff Overton a further shot back. The 22-year-old Noh carded his first bogeys on the TPC Louisiana course during the final round as he carded a one-under-par 71 for a total of 19-under 269. England's Justin Rose showed encouraging form ahead of his defense of the U.S. Open title in June with a final round 68 to finish in a tie for sixth on 13-under, the same mark as Bradley. -- South Korea's Seung-Yul Noh recorded his maiden PGA Tour victory despite a sustained challenge from a clutch of Americans at the Zurich Classic in New Orleans.
