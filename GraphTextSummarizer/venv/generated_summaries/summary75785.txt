The new rules authorize access to Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and other social media Web sites from nonclassified government computers -- as long as such activity doesn't compromise operational security or involve prohibited activities or Web sites. Until now, the military's various branches and departments had differing policies regarding social media use. The Pentagon announced the policy Friday via social media such as Facebook and Twitter, in addition to using the Department of Defense's Web site, said spokesman Bryan Whitman. The Marine Corps, for instance, prohibited use of social media sites from its computers in 2007, according to the Pentagon. The new policy denies military personnel access to sites promoting gambling, pornography or hate crimes from government computers.
