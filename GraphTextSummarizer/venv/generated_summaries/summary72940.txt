-- An Arizona civil rights activist says he accepts Katt Williams' apology for an anti-Mexican rant during a comedy show in Phoenix last weekend, but he's calling on the comedian to return to the city to "show his commitment to the Latino community." "What he said was borderline hate speech and racially offensive," said Rev. Jarrett Maupin, who is organizing a boycott of Williams' stand-up act. Several times during the outburst, Williams sang parts of the U.S. national anthem and chanted "USA, USA, USA." " Williams' often raunchy style has drawn comparisons to comedy legend Richard Pryor, but Maupin said there is a "noticeable difference" in Pryor's joking about race and what Williams said in Phoenix. Maupin said he was surprised by Williams' rant because his previous dealings with the comedian were positive. He suggested that comedian Tracey Morgan's return to Nashville, Tennessee, this summer to personally apologize for anti-gay remarks in a stand-up show there is an example of how Williams can make amends.
