Mrs. Poplawski reported that her son only liked police when they were not curtailing his constitutional rights, which he was determined to protect," the complaint said. Authorities believe Poplawski, wearing a bullet-proof vest, aimed more than 100 rounds at police, using an AK-47, Harper said Saturday. The two had an argument, and Margaret Poplawski told her son she was calling police to remove him from her home, according to the complaint. Margaret Poplawski told police her son had enlisted in the Marine Corps a few years ago, but was discharged for assaulting his drill sergeant in basic training, according to the complaint. McManaway told police he responded to the scene after a report that officers were being fired upon, according to the complaint.
