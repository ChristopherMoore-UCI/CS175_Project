While Wallack's parents were open with him when they explained Alzheimer's, others tiptoe around the topic to avoid scaring children, he says. The title is meant to be funny, but Wallack says children who have loved ones with Alzheimer's will relate to the serious side as well. The book is filled with stories and ways to help children learn about Alzheimer's -- some from Wallack's childhood as well as others from children he has met. Families from all over have reached out to thank Wallack for sharing this story, praising it for quelling children's fears about Alzheimer's. The book aims to teach children about Alzheimer's.
