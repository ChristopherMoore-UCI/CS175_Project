Prosecutors said Glossip hired maintenance worker Justin Sneed to take a baseball bat and bludgeon their boss Van Treese to death because Glossip thought he would be fired. "Twice a jury has heard the evidence against Richard Glossip and twice a jury has convicted him and sentenced him to death for his role in the murder of Barry Van Treese," says Aaron Cooper, a spokesman for the Oklahoma attorney general. It's difficult for many people to feel any sympathy for a man who was convicted in a hire-for-murder scheme that resulted in the 1997 death of Barry Alan Van Treese, owner of a Best Budget Inn in Oklahoma City. But attorneys for death row inmates say Oklahoma's execution protocol remains unconstitutional. "I've seen it on TV," says Glossip, 51, in a telephone call from death row.
