'Much better shape' than expected Alvarenga was found on sparsely populated Ebon Atoll, a 22-hour boat ride from the Marshall Islands capital of Majuro, on Thursday. Jose Salvador Alvarenga washed up on a remote coral atoll in the Marshall Islands last week in a heavily damaged boat. A Mexican newspaper visited the nearby hamlet where Alvarenga lived near Mexico's Pacific Coast. If Alvarenga's story proves true, the trip across the Pacific would have taken him across roughly 6,600 miles (10,800 kilometers) of open ocean before ending in the Marshall Islands, about halfway between Hawaii and Australia, in the northern Pacific. He's a wonderful human being and I'm glad he made it,"  Bellarmino Rodriguez Beyz, owner of Alvarenga's boat, told CNN.
