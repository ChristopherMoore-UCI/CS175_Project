-- Former French justice minister Rachida Dati is launching a paternity suit Tuesday against a French businessman she claims is the father of her daughter, an attorney for the businessman confirmed. In Le Monde's article, a friend of Desseigne explained that the businessman did not want a child with Dati and broke off the relationship in 2008, after which Dati allegedly sent him threatening letters and demanded money from him. In the case filed at a Versailles court, Dati formally identifies Dominique Desseigne as the biological father of Zohra, who was born in 2009. Last month, a French newspaper revealed that Dati would file a paternity case against Desseigne. In a weekend interview with the French newspaper Le Monde, Desseigne's lawyer, MichÃ¨le Cahen, alleges that Dati had up to eight lovers in the year Zohra was conceived.
