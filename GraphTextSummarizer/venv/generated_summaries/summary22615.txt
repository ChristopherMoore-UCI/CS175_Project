But disunity set in quickly after a series of bad decisions, policy flip flops, poor polling and as they say in Australia, a "zinger" -- the knighting of Prince Philip, the Queen's husband, on Australia's national day. While lawmakers remain angry by his failure to sell the government's first budget, which has stalled in the country's upper house, Abbott has been accused of not consulting his colleagues on big decisions, among them a botched paid maternity leave scheme, widely seen as favoring the wealthy, and the bizarre knighting of Prince Philip. Elected just 17 months ago promising "adult government" after three years of backbiting, infighting and two leadership coups in the previous Labor Party government, unity wasn't expected to be a problem Abbott would face. But when he emerged from a 30-minute meeting with his Liberal Party colleagues, called to discuss his possible removal as leader, Tony Abbott was still the Australian premier, if irretrievably damaged. There is broad agreement that frequent leadership changes are not good for Australia.
