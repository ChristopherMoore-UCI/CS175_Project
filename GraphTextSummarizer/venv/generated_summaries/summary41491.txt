-- Spain have drawn level with Brazil's record by going 35 matches unbeaten, after second-half goals from David Villa and Fernando Llorente gave them a 2-0 Confederations Cup victory over host nation South Africa in Bloemfontein. The result ensures the European champions comfortably reach the semifinals of the competition as group winners, while South Africa also progress to the last four after New Zealand and Iraq draw 0-0 in Saturday's other Group A match in Johannesburg. In-demand Valencia striker David Villa stepped up to take it, but his spot-kick was superbly pushed away by goalkeeper Itumeleng Khune, diving to his right. After a goalless first half, the match exploded into life five minutes after the interval when Spain's Cesc Fabregas was crudely fouled in the area by Aaron Mokoena, who has just signed a contract with Portsmouth and has regularly faced the Arsenal midfielder in the English Premier League. Spain, who look a class apart in this tournament and have qualified after winning all their three games without conceding a goal, secured the three points in the 71st minute when substitute Fernando Llorente turned the ball home in a crowded goalmouth, after Xavi's low free-kick from the right had been helped on by a Fabregas mis-kick.
