Under the U.N. agreement, Iraq will relocate the residents of Camp Ashraf, also known as New Camp Iraq -- the home of the opposition group Mujahedin-e Khalq, or MEK -- to a temporary camp. A memorandum of understanding between the U.N. and Iraq was signed Sunday, the same day that the Iranian exiles claimed in a statement that two rockets struck their camp in northeastern Iraq. The agreement includes "a clear commitment from the Government of Iraq to ensure the safety and security of the residents at the new location," according to the U.N. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton welcomed the agreement, calling it a viable solution and urged the Iranian group to accept it. "To be successful, this resettlement must also have the full support of the camp's residents, and we urge them to work with the U.N. to implement this relocation," Clinton said in a statement released late Sunday. -- Iraq agreed to temporarily relocate members of an Iranian opposition group, considered a terrorist organization by the United States, while a U.N. refugee agency begins efforts to resettle the exiles, the United Nations announced on its website Monday. Camp Ashraf was established in 1986 after Saddam Hussein invited members of the MEK to relocate to Iraq in an effort to undermine the Iranian government, which was at war with Iraq.
