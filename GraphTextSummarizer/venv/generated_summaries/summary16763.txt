" In order to start the process of Title III to become law, the House passed the entire farm bill again Thursday by a vote of 306-110. Another $40 billion would go toward farm subsidies, and $30 billion is allocated for payments to farms to keep land idle and other environmental programs. The discovery of the missing section, "Title III," prompted concerns from House Republicans that the override vote was improper. " However, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Thursday that the override votes in both chambers of Congress would allow the sections of the bill that were sent to the president to become law. Two-thirds of the $300 billion in spending for the farm bill would go for nutrition programs such as food stamps.
