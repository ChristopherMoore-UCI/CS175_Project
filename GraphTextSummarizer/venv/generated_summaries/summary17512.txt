"The cargo plane ... shot the runway, broke through a wall and (that) resulted in the death of 10 people who were traveling on a commercial vehicle," Deputy Transport Minister Dzifa Attivor said. The Boeing 727 cargo plane -- operated by the Nigerian-based Allied Air company -- touched down around 7 p.m. Saturday on a runway at Accra's Kotoka International Airport but was not able to stop, officials said. Ghana Aviation Authority sources said that they suspect a brake failure in the plane may have been a contributing factor. As to the crew of the cargo plane, which took off earlier in the day from Lagos, they were transported to a local hospital for treatment, said Attivor. -- Ten people were killed Saturday after a cargo plane crashed through a fence surrounding an airport in Accra, Ghana, and slammed into a bus, municipal and national officials said.
