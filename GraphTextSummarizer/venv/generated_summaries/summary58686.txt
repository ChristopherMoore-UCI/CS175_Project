The court held that the state could properly regulate the time, place and manner of religious exercise -- such as passing snakes around at church -- where the regulation is necessary for the safeguarding of the health, good order and comfort of the community. The issue here is whether a state has the power to regulate religious activity; so the two constitutional authorities meet head-to-head. For the faithful, those two verses are the authority for dancing with or passing around poisonous snakes during church services. People handle snakes at church for the same reason that people do lots of things: the Bible tells them so. Handling poisonous snakes is potentially more dangerous than other regularly prosecuted activities, such as drug use.
