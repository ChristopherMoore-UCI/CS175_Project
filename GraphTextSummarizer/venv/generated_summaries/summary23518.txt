The whale could not be moved on Thursday because the National Park equipment that would ordinarily be used was "destroyed by Hurricane Sandy," said NOAA spokeswoman Allison McHale. -- A 60-foot-long finback whale that washed ashore in the Breezy Point neighborhood of Queens and that was determined dead Thursday morning will be buried in the sand dunes, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The whale was first discovered Wednesday morning on a beach in Breezy Point, a community still reeling from Superstorm Sandy, and biologists had been closely monitoring the status of the whale since its discovery. Both agencies have reached out to the Army Corps of Engineers, which has the type of heavy equipment that needed, according to McHale. The National Park Service has agreed to let the whale be buried on the beach where it is currently located, up in the sand dunes where the high water line will prevent erosion, McHale said.
