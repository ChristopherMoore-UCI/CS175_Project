-- Sasheer Zamata will join "Saturday Night Live" this month, making her the first African-American female in the show's cast in six years, a show rep said Monday. Zamata will make her debut on the late-night sketch comedy show on January 18, when hip-hop star Drake is scheduled to host, the rep said. In October, "SNL" cast member Kenan Thompson told TV Guide the show had difficulty finding qualified black female comedians to hire. Executive Producer Lorne Michaels told The New York Times last month he was holding audition and that a black woman would be added to the cast in January. Producers of the NBC show have been criticized for the lack of diversity since Maya Rudolph left the cast six years ago.
