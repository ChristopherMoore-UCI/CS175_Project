"The Cruisers' Choice Awards are a fantastic honor for cruise lines to receive as they're based on personal experiences shared by cruisers themselves," said Carolyn Spencer Brown, editor-in-chief of Cruise Critic. Awards are calculated using Cruise Critic member ratings. Disney's cruise ships seem to make many of those cruisers especially happy, as seen from their big wins at the 2014 Cruise Critic Cruisers' Choice Awards, the Cruise Critic website announced Wednesday. -- Never mind those pesky norovirus outbreaks on cruise ships earlier this year. Large ships carry 2,000 or more passengers.
