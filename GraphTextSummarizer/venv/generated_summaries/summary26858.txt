Police became aware of the case Tuesday, when they received a call from Toyota company officials, Spencer said. Rachel Fait, 37, Legacy's comptroller, was arrested in Tooele County on Wednesday, and Legacy general manager Rick Covello, 53, turned himself in to Scottsbluff officials Thursday, Spencer said. Toyota told police they had received a call that all of Legacy's new Toyotas were gone from its lot. What a dealer can do with cars depends on a dealership's agreement with the manufacturer, Spencer said. Others were found in Las Vegas, Nevada, Spencer said, but police do not have an accurate tally of how many remain missing.
