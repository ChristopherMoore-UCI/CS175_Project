The speaker is identified as Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri, Iraq's former military commander and vice president who has eluded capture since the fall of the Hussein regime more than seven years ago. The U.S. military says he has helped finance the insurgency against U.S. troops in Iraq with Iraqi funds he transferred to Syria before Hussein's government collapsed in April 2003. -- An audio message purportedly from the highest-ranking at-large member of Iraq's Saddam Hussein regime has been released. CNN has not been able to independently verify the authenticity of the voice on the tape, posted Friday on a website devoted to national resistance in Iraq. U.S. officials say al-Douri played key roles in the chemical attack on the Kurdish town of Halabja in 1988 and in putting down Kurdish and Shiite revolts after the 1991 Persian Gulf War.
