After smoking marijuana at the restaurant where he works as a cook, Larry Long, 33, returned home to share a fifth of whiskey with the baby's mother, Brandy Hatton, McCracken County Sheriff Jon Hayden said in a statement. -- A Kentucky man high on marijuana and drunk on whiskey put his 5-week-old son in the oven Sunday and left him there overnight, police said. The incident was reported to authorities by a psychiatric facility that Long turned to when he learned what he had done, officials said. Long blamed his actions on the marijuana, which he believes was laced with a hallucinatory agent, officials said. Hatton had four or five shots and went to bed while Long finished the bottle, Hayden said.
