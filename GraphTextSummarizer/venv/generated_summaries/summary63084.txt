Indeed the White House website attempts to justify MBK's exclusion of females by stating that "boys of color are too often born into poverty and live with a single parent." Unless the initiative expands to include women, these groups are likely to orient their programs to where the money is by, for example, restricting job training, college preparation and mentoring to boys only. " There's a myth that girls of color are doing better than boys. Now the President has the ability to help more women of color have the opportunities -- to grow up healthy and safe, to go to college, to live their dreams -- that his wife had. Compare that to $100 for black women, and $120 for Latinas.
