-- Some 100,000 ultra-Orthodox Jews protested Thursday an Israeli Supreme Court decision banning segregation based on ethnic background in a girls' religious elementary school. Girls of Sephardic origin were being denied permission to share classrooms with the largely Ashkenazi school and were forced into segregated classes. But 43 sets of parents who refuse the court order were to be incarcerated for two weeks on charges of contempt of court on Thursday. Large demonstrations were held in Jerusalem and Bnei Brak near Tel Aviv. Sephardic Jews are of North African and Middle East origin, Ashkenazim are Jews of European background.
