The creators, episode director and producer Pam Fryman and cast members Radnor, Neil Patrick Harris (Barney Stinson), Cobie Smulders (Robin Scherbatsky), Alyson Hannigan (Lily Aldrin) and Jason Segel (Marshall Eriksen) teased the upcoming 24-episode season recently at the San Diego Comic-Con. As the characters gather for the wedding, the on-again, off-again nature of Ted and Robin's relationship will also be addressed, something at which the season premiere's title, "The Locket," may hint. Last season left the door open for the resolution of several storylines. As for the revelation of Milioti in the role of the mother last season, the creators said keeping that secret was the hardest thing they've done on the show. Literally the words they used to me in season one: 'Well, I just feel like it's really exotic.'
