The defense request for a 10-year sentence was based, among other things, on the idea that Arbabsiar's crime was a result of untreated bipolar disorder, as argued by the defense's psychiatrist, Dr. Michael B. First, a Columbia University professor of clinical psychiatry. But Keenan said he thought the state's psychiatrist, Dr. Gregory B. Saathoff, made the point that Arbabsiar did not have serious mental illness, and his mental state should have no effect on sentencing. Attorneys for Manssor Arbabsiar, 58, wanted a 10-year sentence, but U.S. District Judge John F. Keenan agreed with the prosecution's recommendation of 25 years. Arrested in September 2011, Arbabsiar pleaded guilty in federal court in Manhattan in October and admitted to conspiring with members of the Iranian military in the formulation of the plot. But the scheme unraveled when Arbabsiar's cartel contact turned out to be an undercover agent.
