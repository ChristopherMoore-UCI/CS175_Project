A federal appeals court ruled for Summum, concluding parks are a "public forum" to which private groups have access under free speech protections. By allowing Ten Commandments displays for decades, the judges concluded, various cities have historically been treating permanent displays on public property as private speech. The Eagles have erected similar monuments in hundreds of other communities since the 1950s. The justices appeared uneasy with arguments from both sides, posing a range of hypotheticals to explore the free speech limits cities and private groups should enjoy. The Supreme Court has refused to offer a broad rule on religious monuments, taking a more case-specific approach.
