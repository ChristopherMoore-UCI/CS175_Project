It will remain on display for a month as crew members hold special events aimed at raising awareness of plastic waste in the ocean. "I was inspired to go out and really build Plastiki to showcase waste as a resource," said de Rothschild. "I really feel the Plastiki is entering its next chapter," said de Rothschild, outlining hopes to put the boat on display around the world. De Rothschild said that a 2006 United Nations report on plastic littering the world's oceans was his personal catalyst for action. But de Rothschild said that although the boat is made of recyclable material, he's not planning to toss it in the chipper just yet.
