The case centers on Perry's veto in June 2013 of $7.5 million approved by the Legislature to fund a  public integrity unit run by Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, a Democrat. The charges allege Perry misused his office by improperly threatening to and then withholding state funds for a program run by a county prosecutor unless she resigned. It's an open secret he's laying groundwork for a second White House campaign after his disastrous 2012 effort and is due to visit key states in coming weeks. Perry, a Republican, was indicted last week on counts alleging coercion of a public servant and abuse of his official capacity. Even Texas gubernatorial candidate Wendy Davis, a Democrat, wasn't as strident in her reaction as her party's state committee, which called on Perry to step down.
