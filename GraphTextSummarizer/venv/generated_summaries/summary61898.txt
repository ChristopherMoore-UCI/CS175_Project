Carolina Panthers star defensive end Greg Hardy, who has been granted a new trial this fall after a domestic violence conviction in July, has taken a voluntary leave with pay until his legal matters are resolved, the team announced Wednesday. " Gettleman said that Hardy will be placed on the NFL's exempt/commissioner's permission list, which allows in special circumstances for players to be paid while on leave. The 6-foot-4, 275 pound defensive end says he is innocent and has appealed a guilty verdict rendered by a Mecklenburg County judge in North Carolina. Peterson won't play until legal matters resolved Hardy, who led the team last season with 15 sacks and was a Pro Bowl selection, missed Sunday's game against the Detroit Lions after the team placed on the inactive list.
