Male tooth fairies leave more than female, and in 36% of households, tooth fairies left less than a dollar. The fairy was most generous to children in the Northeast, who earned an average of $4.10 per tooth. In the Midwest, children received $3.30 per tooth; and the South and West fell in the middle, at $3.60 and $3.70, respectively. American children are receiving an average of $3.70 per lost tooth this year -- up 23% from last year's $3, an annual survey said. Alderman said he's always given his kids a dollar for their lost teeth, which seemed to be the standard in the neighborhood (minus the typewriter, of course).
