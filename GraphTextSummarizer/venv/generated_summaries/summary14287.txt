-- The king of Bahrain has decreed that the country's state of emergency will end June 1, state media reported Sunday. Human rights groups said forces have raided hospitals, targeting doctors and patients, during the state of emergency. Massive anti-government protests prompted King Hamad al-Khalifa's March 15 declaration of a three-month state of emergency in Bahrain, a strategically important kingdom and U.S. ally. Bahrain is home to the headquarters of the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet, the naval arm of American power in the region. Meanwhile, a trial has started for 21 suspects accused of fostering the unrest, the official Bahrain News Agency reported Sunday.
