Nancy Scheper-Hughes, a professor of medical anthropology at the University of California, Berkeley, and director of Organs Watch, a program that researches human organ trafficking around the world, said the sale of the organs of deceased people was uncommon compared to a thriving, worldwide trade in illegal organ sales of living people. The specimens he bought were stolen from a warehouse space on the museum campus, where thousands of jars of brain and other human tissue from autopsies performed on patients at the now-defunct Central Indiana Hospital for the Insane in the 1890s were stored. Charles is to appear an Indianapolis court later this month in connection with the alleged theft of dozens of jars of preserved human brain tissue valued at about $4,800. The man, identified as David Charles, allegedly stole more than 60 jars of brain and other human tissues in early October from a warehouse space at the Indiana Medical History Museum, the Marion County prosecutor's office said in court papers Thursday. In the universe of bizarre items that Internet users sell on eBay -- host to millions of auctions each day -- human organs are forbidden.
