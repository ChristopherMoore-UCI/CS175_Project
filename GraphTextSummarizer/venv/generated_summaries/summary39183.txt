In the Republic of Ireland, the speed limit is in kilometers per hour, road signs are usually bilingual (but not always -- "geill sli" means yield), and roads are more likely to be bumpy and poorly maintained. Sometimes both directions of traffic can pass parked cars simultaneously, but frequently you'll have to take turns -- follow the locals' lead and drive defensively. In towns, you may have to cross over the center line just to get past parked cars. Not only will you be driving on the left, but you'll also be using roundabouts, where traffic continually flows in a circle around a center island. These work well if you follow the golden rule: Traffic in roundabouts always has the right-of-way, while entering vehicles yield.
