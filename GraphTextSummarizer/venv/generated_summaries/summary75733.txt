First, rain led race officials to pull the plug Sunday -- the first time in Daytona 500's history. Montoya said he had returned to the race track from pit row before the accident, after having the crew check out a vibration he was feeling in his car. Officials shut down the race for nearly two hours after Juan Pablo Montoya careened into the back of a jet dryer that was being used to blow debris off the track during a caution flag. The Daytona 500 victory was the second for the driver, who edged out Dale Earnhardt Jr. and teammate Greg Biffle to take the checkered flag. Those who made it to the end survived multiple accidents, including one on the second lap, and 10 caution flags.
