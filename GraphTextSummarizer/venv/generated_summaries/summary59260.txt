The domestic violence incident began when Oceanside police were called to Seau's residence to investigate a report of an assault late Sunday night, police said. Off the gridiron, Seau was the star of "Sports Jobs with Junior Seau," a reality show on the Versus network that followed him as he took on various occupations, from baseball batboy to bullfighter to pro hockey equipment manager. Seau was conscious and talking to paramedics when he was transported to nearby Scripps La Jolla Hospital for treatment, authorities said. The girlfriend told police that Seau assaulted her during a verbal argument, authorities said. Born Tiaina Baul Seau Jr. in San Diego, he was a Parade magazine football All-American out of Oceanside High School.
