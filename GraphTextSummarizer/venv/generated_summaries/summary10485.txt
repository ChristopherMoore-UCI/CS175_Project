At issue are divergent views on the concept of diplomatic asylum -- a nation's granting of asylum to someone not inside its territory. One last tidbit of academic dryness before considering the Assange case: The prevailing view that diplomatic asylum is not part of accepted international law was settled in a case between Peru and Colombia before the International Court of Justice in 1950. The concept of diplomatic asylum is as old as the practice of having permanent embassies in foreign countries. But controversies over countries using diplomatic asylum to protect people wanted for crimes led to the practice falling out of favor, according to a United Nations report devoted to the subject in 1975. The court ruled that diplomatic asylum is not recognized unless treaties or other agreements are in place between countries.
