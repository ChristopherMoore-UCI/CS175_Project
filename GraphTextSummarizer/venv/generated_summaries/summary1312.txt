" Van Heerden says that he's not worried about Marmite fans defecting to rival Vegemite, from Kraft Foods in Australia. Sanitarium general manager Pierre van Heerden said people should face the hard fact that they'll need to conserve their Marmite and could try spreading it on toast rather than slices of bread out of the bag to make it last. The island nation is facing a dwindling stock of the beloved Marmite spread after recent earthquakes in Christchurch forced the manufacturer to shut down the only factory producing the stuff. That's caused a run on Marmite at markets all around New Zealand -- and reports of panic among customers who love the spread. "We haven't seen any noticeable bulk-buying of Marmite as yet, but will not be enforcing a purchase limit," Murray Johnston, general manager for merchandise for Countdown's parent Progressive Enterprises, told CNN.
