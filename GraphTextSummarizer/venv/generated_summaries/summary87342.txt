Buckingham Palace announced Tuesday that a century-old gold-trimmed royal carriage will carry the new princess and her prince, William, from Westminster Abbey through central London to the palace. In fact, she plans to travel in the same Rolls-Royce used by Prince Charles and Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, when they were attacked by protesters in London in December, Buckingham Palace said. In December, students protesting increases in university costs hit the car with paint and cracked a window, as Charles and Camilla rode through a crowd en route to a show in central London. As beautiful as they are, state carriages aren't always an easy way for passengers to travel. William's mother, Lady Diana Spencer, rode in it in 1981 after her marriage to Prince Charles, and Sarah Ferguson traveled in it five years later after she wed Prince Andrew.
