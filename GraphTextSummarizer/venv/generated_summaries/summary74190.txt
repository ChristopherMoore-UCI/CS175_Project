The Department of Justice is investigating the death of Alfred Wright, a physical therapist who disappeared and died under mysterious circumstances in an isolated section of Texas, U.S. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee said Monday. The coroner's toxicology report described Wright's body as filled with drugs -- cocaine, methamphetamine -- and his death was ruled accidental due to a "combined drug intoxication." Family members said they never saw Wright do drugs. When found, Wright was wearing only boxer shorts, tennis shoes and a single sock, inside of which was his cell phone. Family members said Wright, married and the father of two young sons, called from the CL&M Grocery on Route 87, asking someone to pick him up because of problems with his truck. Family members say the sheriff told them "there was no foul play" and that Wright's disappearance was probably drug-related.
