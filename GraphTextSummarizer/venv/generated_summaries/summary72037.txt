Minutes 26, 27 and 29 saw Hearts Dutch striker Genero Zeefuik grab a quickfire hat-trick, the third after a penalty and red-card to Cowdenbeath defender Lewis Toshney. The game was 25 minutes old and the relegation threatened-side, ironically and lovingly nicknamed the Blue Brazil by Scottish football fans, had managed to shut-out their hosts and in-form opponents. It might be little consolation to Cowdenbeath tonight, but at least they were along way off Bon Accord levels of ineptitude. Everything was going to plan for Cowdenbeath during its Scottish Championship clash with table-topping Heart of Midlothian Saturday. But that's still nowhere near the record of the biggest defeat ever recorded in senior Scottish football.
