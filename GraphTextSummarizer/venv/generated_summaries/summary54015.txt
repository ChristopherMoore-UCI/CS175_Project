"The main purpose of EXIT in 2000 was to unite and motivate young people to take part in the democratic processes that were going on, and to basically overthrow the Milosevic regime," says Dusan Kovacevic, EXIT's co-founder and general manager. As for next year's edition, which will take place from July 9 to July 12 (with tickets going on sale Friday), EXIT organizers are planning a return to the festival's roots: "We want to evolve from a music festival to festival of creativity -- invite people from different creative industries to come because we feel that the experience of the festival is supposed to be bigger than just music," says Kovacevic. Last month, EXIT made more headlines after being named again as one of the nominees for this year's Best Major European Festival Award -- more than 1.2 million people voted from over 30 countries, and the winner will be announced at a ceremony on January 14. "Basically, young people communicate mostly through music and culture," says Kovacevic, "and if you want to spread a very important social message, you need to communicate through that language. After his government was overthrown, Kovacevic and his colleagues started approaching international artists to try to revive the country's cosmopolitan spirit.
