The Kenyan government thanks the French government and the people of France for their continued support even during this moment of loss." Dedieu's abduction was the second in the area in a month, a major blow to Kenya, which relies on tourism dollars. -- A Frenchwoman kidnapped from her holiday home in northern Kenya and taken to Somalia has died, the French Foreign Ministry said Wednesday. British government officials have asked journalists not to reveal her exact location to avoid abduction attempts from rival gangs. A gang of 10 armed men seized Marie Dedieu this month from her home on Manda Island, prompting a sea battle between Kenyan forces and her abductors. "The kidnapping and detention of Marie Dedieu was a terror act not only against her, but also against Kenya, her home country France and the entire world," the statement said.
