Donna Scrivo was arraigned in St. Clair Shores, Michigan, on charges of disinterment and mutilation of a body, St. Clair County Sheriff Tim Donnellon said at a news conference. An autopsy is not complete and a cause of death has not yet been determined, Detective Sergeant Jay Cohoe said at the news conference. Officials at the press conference said they expect more charges to follow. Body parts identified as those of Ramsay Scrivo, the suspect's son, were found in garbage bags dumped along Michigan roads, according to law enforcement officials. The body parts were found Thursday and Friday at five different locations in St. Clair County, a few miles from the Canadian border.
