" John Doe #1, who said that Travolta sexually harassed him at the Beverly Hills Hotel, hired Allred on Tuesday, just hours after he withdrew from Okorocha's lawsuit. Allred said Tuesday that she and John Doe #1 would discuss if a new lawsuit would be filed against Travolta. Gloria Allred confirmed Thursday that the plaintiff known as John Doe #2 has hired her to represent him and possibly file a new legal action against the actor. John Doe #1 withdrew from the lawsuit after it was learned Travolta was in New York, not Los Angeles, on January 16, the day he had alleged the massage incident took place. Okorocha told CNN the date should have been January 15, but the mistake would have hampered the chances of John Doe #2 in court.
