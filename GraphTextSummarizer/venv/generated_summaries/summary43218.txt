When Burger met King, it was love Joel Burger is set to marry Ashley King in July, and when fast food giant Burger King got wind of the nuptials, the couple scored a free wedding. The cast of the movie "Suicide Squad," including Will Smith and Margot Robbie, assembled for the first time this week in a Twitter photo from director David Ayer. "Star Wars" is once again back in our lives, the Burger-King couple helped us believe love can be found in fast food, and Mindy Kaling's brother had a shocking announcement. Others who passed on: "L.A. Law" actor Richard Dysart and frequent Clint Eastwood co-star Geoffrey Lewis. Star Wars' streaming The Force is with the streaming device of your choice, thanks to this week's surprise announcement that the entire "Star Wars" saga (so far, anyway) would be released on digital HD at the end of the week.
