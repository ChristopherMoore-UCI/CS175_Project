Rihanna recorded a special version of "Run This Town" for CBS' fall telecasts of "Thursday Night Football." -- After a dust-up last week, Rihanna says she doesn't want her performance of the song "Run This Town" to air on "Thursday Night Football" this week. "Beginning this Thursday, we will be moving in a different direction with some elements of our 'Thursday Night Football' open," CBS said in a statement. But CBS scrapped the opening video last week in light of its news coverage of the Ray Rice scandal that has engulfed the NFL. Holding off on the video gave CBS more time for somber discussion of domestic violence and the league's treatment of it.
