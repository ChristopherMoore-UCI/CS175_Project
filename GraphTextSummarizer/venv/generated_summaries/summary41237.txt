-- New Orleans architect Mark Ripple only plays the occasional game of poker, but he's willing to put all his chips on the table and risk at least $150,000 on somebody else's dream. Brian Bordainick, a 24-year-old athletic director at Carver High School in the 9th Ward, made his pitch to Ripple and his partners: Help build a new stadium for the neighborhood, and make a powerful statement about New Orleans' ability to overcome Katrina by working together as a community. Actor Brad Pitt's New Orleans recovery group, Make It Right, has some experience with drainage issues, Ripple said, and Pitt's organization is consulting on the project with partner Steve Dumez. Describing the emotional pull that drew Ripple to make such a total commitment to Bordainick's dream, the architect said, "There's a deeper meaning that projects take on when you feel like you're serving a larger purpose." In late 2008, Bordainick went to work -- online and in New Orleans executive offices -- rallying support for a new neighborhood track and field facility paid for with thousands of individual and corporate donations of time, services, materials and cash.
