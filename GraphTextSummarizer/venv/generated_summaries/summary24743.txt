House Republicans initially passed a series of measures tying government funding to defunding or dismantling Obamacare, the president's signature health care reform. House Republicans offered a plan to temporarily stave off the threat of a first-ever U.S. debt default. Now a plan from House Republicans to temporarily boost the nation's borrowing limit and start talks about reopening the government shifted the dynamic. " Obama made clear, during his session with House Republicans, that he won't give concessions to reopen the government, according to a Democratic source familiar with the meeting. " On Obama's signature health care reform and what's happening in Washington generally, Cruz said that it's House Republicans who "are listening to the millions of Americans" to do what's best for them.
