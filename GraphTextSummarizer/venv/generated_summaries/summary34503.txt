-- New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie signed a law Thursday that encourages people to report drug overdoses without fear of being arrested, a measure he says will help save lives. According to Drug Policy Alliance, New Jersey joins 11 states and the District of Columbia with similar protection laws. Singer Jon Bon Jovi joined Christie for the law's signing at a drug rehabilitation center in Paterson, New Jersey. Drug prevention advocates and family members of those who lost their lives to drug overdoses also attended. "On behalf of those individuals and their families whose lives will be saved by this important legislation, I want to thank Gov. Christie and the New Jersey Legislature for passing the Good Samaritan bill," Bon Jovi said.
