Wegel also said no decisions have been made on initial routes, but that the airline plans to restart as a provider of charter services initially and then build into scheduled service at a yet-to-be-determined date. That date is a few months delayed from the original hopes of CEO Ed Wegel, who said in January that the airline would start flights this month. Eastern Air Lines, which used that slogan in the 1980s, flew its first of 20 new planes into Miami International Airport on Friday afternoon. Wegel said there were years in the 1980s when Eastern had the most passengers of any U.S. airline, because of the shuttle and its extensive Latin American route system. "When you look at history since '78, how many airlines started, how many didn't make it, it's not a business for the faint of heart," Wegel said in January.
