Servers hosting Web sites of the House of Representatives have been flooded with millions of e-mails in recent days. The office of the chief administrative officer of the House of Representatives issued a statement Tuesday saying: "This measure has become temporarily necessary to ensure that congressional Web sites are not completely disabled by the millions of e-mails flowing into the system. "We know it's in the millions," he said of the number of e-mails that lawmakers in the House have been receiving. After the House failed to pass the proposed deal Monday by a vote of 228-205, the e-mail volume surged again, Ventura said. The servers hosting the Web sites of the House of Representatives and its members have been overwhelmed with millions of e-mails in the past few days, forcing administrators to implement the "digital version of a traffic cop" to handle the overload.
