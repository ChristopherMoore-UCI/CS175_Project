And firing Rutgers basketball coach Mike Rice will not take the brutality out of college sports. Watching the video of Rice batter and berate his players, I recalled the dozens of other times I'd witnessed similar scenes, at my son's Amateur Athletic Union games, at playground pick-up games.

We just understood him," Mike Coburn, who played for Rice from 2010-11, told New Jersey's Star Ledger. It took the threat of a wrongful termination lawsuit by Eric Murdock, an ex-NBA player and a former director of player development for the Scarlet Knights, who complained to Pernetti about Rice's outrageous behavior.
