I went back to Taverna dozens of times after that visit, always catching a smile and laugh from Kamal -- with a hunk of chocolate cake. "Any word on Kamal, the owner of Taverna, or his staff?" development worker Una Moore wrote in a Twitter post. Once security officials confirmed his death, photos popped on Facebook as people who knew Kamal and his restaurant shared their memories. Kamal's restaurant allowed for quiet dinners or raucous get-togethers after long work days. Albums with titles like "Taverna" were filled with pictures of groups of smiling people gathered around long, wooden tables.
