The tobacco companies in their complaint noted the panel's mission to probe menthol cigarettes, including their use among young people, African-Americans, Hispanics and other minorities, as well as smokeless tobacco products. -- Two leading tobacco companies fired a pre-emptive legal strike against federal authorities Friday, challenging the objectivity and thus validity of a 12-member advisory panel charged with making recommendations on the safety of menthol cigarettes and other matters. " That group, which includes three non-voting members representing the tobacco industry, is charged per federal statute with providing "advice, information, and recommendations" to Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius on health, dependence and other issues related to tobacco. R.J. Reynolds, the nation's second-largest tobacco company, is based in North Carolina and sells Camel, Winston, Kool, Pall Mall and other cigarettes. Theoretically relying on these recommendations, the secretary has the authority to mandate "good manufacturing practices for tobacco products."
