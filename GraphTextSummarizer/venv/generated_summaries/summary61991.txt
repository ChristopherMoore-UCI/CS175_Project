Look no further than reality television, populated by macho slimeballs, back-biting boyfriend stealers and assorted high achievers in the low art of interpersonal nastiness. It's a question that applies across demographics -- from the prized millennials, who have grown up on the discord of reality television; to the baby boomers, who are decades into acerbic late night as we know it -- and will have to adjust to bits like slow rolling the news. One of Fallon's established competitors, David Letterman, in a recent monologue said that Rosie O'Donnell met her fiancÃ©e when her car broke down and Rosie "pulls up behind her in her tow truck." -- A lot of us were rooting for Jimmy Fallon on Monday night. Or, as Stephen Colbert jokingly (but not inaccurately) said on Monday night: "Welcome to 11:30, bitch."
