The rally, organized by the far-right Buddhist group Bodu Bala Sena (Buddhist Power Force), was called in response to an alleged altercation in the area between a group of young Muslims and a Buddhist monk and his driver on an important Buddhist religious holiday days earlier. But a wave of deadly communal violence that followed a rally Sunday by hardline Buddhist nationalist monks has changed that. Buddhist radicalism has been on the rise in Sri Lanka, much as in Myanmar, where a monk-led Buddhist nationalist movement has been blamed for drumming up deadly mob violence against minority Muslim groups. After the rally, Buddhist mobs marched through Muslim neighborhoods, torching and destroying dozens of homes and shops, witnesses told CNN. He also blamed BBS for inciting the "orgy of attacks against Muslims," and told CNN he was weighing his party's future in the government -- made up of an alliance of parties -- pending the official response to the violence.
