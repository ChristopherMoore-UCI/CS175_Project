I've found that people who stay clean and sober the longest have some kind of spiritual belief, whether it's God, life force, universal energy or a sense of oneness with the world. Of course, there are famous people who benefit greatly from a stay in treatment, who do it privately and with sincere purpose. This "rehab-abuse" (used maybe to wait out a public relations storm after bad behavior, or draw attention to a stalled career?) devalues and trivializes the very real, very unglamorous struggle of pulling free of addiction and making amends for harmful behavior. Entering treatment for addiction means you get treatment for your addiction. Like other recovering substance abusers, I know I'm not the center of the world and life doesn't start and end with me.
