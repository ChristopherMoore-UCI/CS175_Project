Scientists are discovering a different kind of answer which has to do with the types of abnormalities in the brain and body that are characteristic of people with depression. Psychological stress and medical illness are the two royal roads to depression. The classic symptom of depression is feeling emotionally down or blue, but when humans start feeling this way a whole bunch of other symptoms usually tag along. In addition to medications and therapy, recent studies suggest that vigorous exercise is also an effective treatment for depression. The World Health Organization now places depression as the fourth most disabling medical condition worldwide and estimates it will rise to number two by 2020.
