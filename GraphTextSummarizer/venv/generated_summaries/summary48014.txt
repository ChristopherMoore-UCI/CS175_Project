But NYU has forgiven portions of mortgages they have extended to President John Sexton, other university executives or star faculty -- money that has been used to buy properties in Manhattan or vacation homes in the Hamptons. But NYU is in the media spotlight because giving loans to university executives and stars to purchase vacation homes is nearly unheard of, according to some experts. Sure, other universities have found ways to woo high-level executives, faculty and coaches with big salaries, severance pay, cars and real estate. The investigation into NYU should pry open the door to a world of accumulation and mismanagement in universities. In January 2012, Vice President Joseph Biden carelessly -- and incorrectly -- remarked that high faculty salaries were driving escalating college tuition.
