In his last stand at a special court for Sierra Leone, his last chance to address the world before he is locked behind bars, former Liberian President Charles Taylor made a plea for why he should be spared the harshest sentence for his conviction on aiding and abetting war crimes. -- He stood before judges Wednesday not as the first former head of state convicted of war crimes since World War II but as a leader convinced he was wronged by corruption and a hypocritical hand of justice. Taylor, 64, was found guilty of all 11 counts of aiding and abetting rebel forces in Sierra Leone in a campaign of terror that involved murder, rape, sexual slavery, conscripting children younger than 15 and mining diamonds to pay for guns. "Only time will tell how many other African heads of state will be destroyed." Last month's landmark ruling by the international tribunal against Taylor was the first war crimes conviction of a former head of state by an international court since the Nuremberg trials after World War II that convicted Adm. Karl Doenitz, who became president of Germany briefly after Adolf Hitler's suicide. "What I did to bring peace to Sierra Leone was done with honor," said Taylor, standing before the tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands, dressed immaculately in suit and tie as he has been all throughout his trial.
