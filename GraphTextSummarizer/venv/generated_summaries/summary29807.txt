But for hundreds of children in the rural villages of Colombia, Luis Soriano is far from a clown. At each village, some 40-50 youngsters await their chance to get homework help, learn to read or listen to any variety of tall tales, adventure stories and geography lessons Soriano has prepared. To help bridge the learning gap, Soriano decided to personally bring books to the children. " More than 4,000 youngsters have benefited from Soriano's program since it began in 1990. "I saw two unemployed donkeys at home and had the idea [to use] them in my biblioburro project because they can carry a heavy load," Soriano said.
