TS:  I just want to spearhead and lead a new style of New Orleans music. A lot of people have been doing the same thing for years, and I just want to be one of the people who create the next 50 years of New Orleans. I had the chance to catch up with him at the 40th annual New Orleans Jazz Festival this week. Sometimes we go places, and people don't really know who we are, but they know New Orleans, and once we say we are from New Orleans, we have a lot of supporters. To be here on a wonderful day and to have a big crowd of people coming out to help New Orleans is a wonderful thing.
