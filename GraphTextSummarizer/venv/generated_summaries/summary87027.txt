The grim reality of child sex trafficking in the United States is this: Human traffickers are selling sex with children in big cities and small towns throughout America. Human trafficking happens everywhere, and sex trafficking cases involving children have been found in all regions of the country. Children who are selling sex in the United States are then, by definition, victims of human trafficking. Change the conversation: Children who by law are too young to consent to having sex obviously cannot consent to selling sex, so: â€¢ Victims should not be described as entering into prostitution; they are being exploited and should be described as victims of human trafficking. Despite this, child victims of sex trafficking are frequently viewed as criminals rather than as victims.
