"It spans not just Asia, not just Northeast Asia but Southeast Asia and, increasingly, the Pacific," the official said. -- U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was heading to Asia on Thursday for a wide-ranging trip that will take her from the Cook Islands in the Pacific Ocean to China and Russia farther north. In particular, Clinton plans to discuss intellectual property issues and hold meetings on a new Trans-Pacific Partnership, a regional trade group that came up during last year's APEC summit in Hawaii, the official said. She plans to talk with leaders there about regional challenges with health issues and climate change, as well as commercial interests and problems like illegal fishing. "It is a very long, very diverse trip, but the concurrent themes that run through this is a strong, determined effort on the part of the United States to underscore our rebalancing towards the Asia-Pacific region, to make clear that we're here to stay, that we are engaged on an array of issues -- strategic, political, commercial," a senior State Department official told reporters ahead of the trip.
