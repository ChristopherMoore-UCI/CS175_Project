CNN tried repeatedly to contact Panio, both directly and through his lawyers, to ask about the allegations of abuse at AFIC and about his credentials, but he avoided our cameras and never returned phone calls. In their civil suit, the Palmers claim Jessica "was repeatedly told by AFIC staff that she was a 'bitch,' 'dumb,' and a [expletive]. "It did the most incredible damage to our family," said Rick Palmer, who's filed a civil suit against AFIC, Panio and other staff members. Panio's attorney Katherine Fritz told CNN Panio cannot talk due to settlement terms in a number of civil suits, including the Palmers' and Donabedians'. Colorado public records obtained by CNN detail similar complaints and other alleged abuses that date back to the mid-1980s.
