However, India's commerce ministry, which enforced the ban, said domestic textile companies had been complaining that they were finding it hard to compete with rivals in Bangladesh and Pakistan because of rising cotton prices in India. India's move came after China had aggressively bought bales over the past year for a government reserve as a way of supporting domestic farm prices and buffering against price volatility. China, the biggest consumer of cotton, has lodged a formal protest against India's ban on cotton exports amid signs that India is rethinking the ban that was implemented a few days ago. India, the second-largest producer of cotton, instituted the ban with immediate effect on March 5, in a move aimed at ensuring sufficient supply of cotton for domestic textile companies. Cotton rose to an all-time high of more than $2 a pound last year amid a shortage in part created by an export ban by India, only to fall afterwards to less than $1 after cotton mills defaulted on contracts.
