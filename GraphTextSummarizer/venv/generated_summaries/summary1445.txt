The good news for McCain and Obama is that in this election, their health isn't nearly as important to voters as their plans for health care, the economy and the war in Iraq. Results: How important is health, age of candidates? Nearly half of the Americans surveyed, 47 percent, are concerned that McCain would not finish a four-year term as president in good health. This spring, McCain's personal physician, Dr. John Eckstein, released a letter saying there is no medical reason "that would preclude McCain from fulfilling all the duties and obligations of the president of the United States." Still, the issue hasn't gone away in the minds of voters. Republican Sen. John McCain is 72, a skin cancer survivor, and would be the oldest man sworn in for a first term as president.
