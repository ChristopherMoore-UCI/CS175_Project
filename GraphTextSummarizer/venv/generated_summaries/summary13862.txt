In a statement Wednesday, RSF condemned what it described at "the steadily mounting violence against media personnel in Libya. The security situation has been deteriorating in the North African country, with Libya's weak central government unable to rein in militia groups with different regional, tribal, ideological and political loyalties. The channel is viewed as critical of Islamist parties in Libya especially now, during a time of heightened political polarization in the country. Al-Asema TV is a privately owned channel affiliated with Mahmoud Jibril, the country's interim Prime Minister during the 2011 revolution, and his National Front Alliance (NFA), the liberal political bloc in the General National Congress, Libya's parliament. According to RSF's 2014 Press Freedom Index, Libya dropped six places and is now ranked 137th out of 180 countries.
