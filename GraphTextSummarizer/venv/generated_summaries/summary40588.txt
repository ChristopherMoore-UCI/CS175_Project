"Most of the people who travel by rail, to big cities, aren't at home during the day," Tim Robinson, CEO of Doddle told me. In a joint venture with National Rail, Doddle is using the rail stations' extra space as delivery shops, which will be open between 6:00am and 9:00pm seven days a week. The Post Office also plans to deliver to small independent stores, some of whom have joined the delivery networks CollectPlus or MyHermes. Companies including Argos, CollectPlus, MyHermes and The Post Office are capturing this trend, as are newcomers such as Doddle. Ebay will soon allow its online shops to deliver goods through the thousands of Argos outlets.
