Victims, clockwise: Laconia Brown, 23, Whitnei Dubois, 26, Brittney Gary, 17 and Necole Guillory, 26. In the most recent case, the body of Necole Guillory, 26, was found in Acadia Parish, off Interstate 10, in August. Investigators think the offender has significant ties to Jefferson Davis Parish and is known to its residents, because he has demonstrated a strong familiarity with the area, Edwards said. But Edwards said his department and investigators from the neighboring parishes of Acadia and Calcasieu, the state attorney general's office, the Louisiana State Police and the FBI are doing everything they can. In 2008, the bodies of three women were found: Laconia "Muggy" Brown, 23; Brittney Gary, the youngest victim at age 17; and Crystal Shay Zeno, 24.
