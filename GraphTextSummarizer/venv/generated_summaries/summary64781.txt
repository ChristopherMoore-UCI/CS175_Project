Helt was initially arrested in October 2010 on burglary, criminal mischief and criminal trespass charges. "I know this because I am one of these people." Shortly after his appearance, Oregon authorities said he had an arrest warrant that was issued in November 2011 after he allegedly violated his parole following a criminal trespass conviction. Helt grew up in northwest Oregon, where his mother still lives. He turned himself in Thursday night, posted $2,500 in bail and left, according to Martin Silbernagel, the community corrections director for Polk County, Oregon. -- A homeless man who attended the MTV Video Music Awards with Miley Cyrus has turned himself in to police, authorities said.
