The U.S.-based Carter Center echoed those comments, but noted, "notwithstanding these generally positive features, Carter Center observers noted important flaws." It noted that preliminary lists were not posted for public review, especially in southern Sudan, and "the status of the final voter registry and list of polling stations remained uncertain. Arman withdrew from the presidential race last month, and the party decided to boycott elections in northern Sudan. In a statement Saturday, the party said that despite his withdrawal, SPLM presidential candidate Yasir Saeed Arman held a healthy lead in southern Sudan. " In addition, "on election day, voters faced a range of operational and logistical problems: late delivery of and/or inadequate materials, incomplete or inaccurate voters' lists, incorrect or insufficient ballots, ballots with inappropriate languages and a lack of consistency in procedures," the Carter Center said.
