Frankel wrapped up his stellar career in the Champion Stakes at Ascot on Saturday with an unblemished 14-win record, while Australian mare Black Caviar also remains unbeaten in 22 races. "As a yearling (a race horse between one and two-years-old), it could be worth $3 million to $10 million -- depending on a potential bidding war between Ireland's Coolmore Stud Farm and Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum's Darley Stud Farm." -- After conquering the race track, superstar colt Frankel is set to become one of the most sought-after gigolos on the planet -- and his rival's mum could be the perfect love match. In a plot reminiscent of a daytime soap opera, champion race horse Frankel would be an ideal mate to rival Black Caviar's mum, experts say. Should he fail to rise to the occasion, Frankel may well return to the race course, as other champion thoroughbreds have done in the past.
