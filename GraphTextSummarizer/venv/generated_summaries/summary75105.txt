Turner was convicted of murder for the 1995 death of her husband, police officer Glenn Turner, and for the 2001 death of her boyfriend, firefighter Randy Thompson, both of whom were poisoned with antifreeze. -- Julia Lynn Womack Turner, who was convicted in 2007 of murder for the deaths by antifreeze poisoning of her boyfriend and husband, died Monday in prison in Georgia, prison officials said. Turner "was found unresponsive in her cell at 6:55 a.m., at which time prison medical staff and EMS responded but were unable to revive her," the Georgia Department of Corrections said in a statement. A week later, Turner moved in with Thompson, with whom she had begun an affair several months prior. Turner was serving life without parole in the Metro State Prison for women in Atlanta.
