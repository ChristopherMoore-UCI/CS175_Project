-- U.S.-Russian ties may be at their frostiest since the height of the Cold War, but at least there's some warmth to the relationship between U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. While Kerry sometimes appears to go beyond the White House's script during crisis talks, Lavrov consistently offers a faithful translation of Putin's foreign policy, according to observers -- one that the West can sometimes find difficult to interpret. " Ukraine is arguably an even tougher diplomatic challenge, pitching the U.S. and Russia against each other first in Kiev, then Crimea and now in the country's restive east, where pro-Russian protesters have seized government buildings in several cities in the past several weeks. Kerry played varsity soccer at Yale University, while Lavrov is a die-hard fan of Moscow club FC Spartak. Lavrov often joins Kerry to talk policy on his frequent garden strolls during face-to-face meetings, and last month the pair were photographed kicking a soccer ball around the grounds of the U.S. ambassador's house in London.
