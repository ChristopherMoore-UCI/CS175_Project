Duolingo, the successful language-learning app, has announced the launch of an "incubator" that will allow any user to create new courses for different languages. " There are also organizations interested in this new Duolingo tool, among them a foundation in the south of Mexico that wants to develop courses of indigenous languages in the area. The task of creating a language course seems to only be within the reach of expert linguists, but the method that Duolingo has developed is "pretty restricted, with a concrete lists of words and the order in which they must be used, with easy phrases," says von Ahn. Several schools and universities in the world are already using Duolingo to teach languages, and according to estimates from the company, there are close to 30,000 students that follow its method. In a short time, Duolingo has become one of the most popular methods for learning languages because it requires only an Internet connection and a smartphone to be immersed in the learning experience.
