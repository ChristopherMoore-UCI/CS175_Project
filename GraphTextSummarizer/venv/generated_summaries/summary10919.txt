Court records said the operation used code words to disguise the money transfers to Somalia and Kenya. The United States designated Al-Shabaab, an al Qaeda-linked militant group, as a foreign terrorist organization in March 2008. The three arrested were charged with one count of conspiracy to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization and 20 counts of providing material support to a foreign terrorist organization. "The money transfers often were broken down into small amounts as low as $50 or $100, and the funds were intended for use by al-Shabaab insurgents operating in Somalia," according to the court records. They sent money overseas for "orphans" and "brothers in the mountains," or for "camels," according to court records.
