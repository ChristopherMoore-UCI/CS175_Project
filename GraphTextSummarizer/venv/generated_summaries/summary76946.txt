More than a month after announcing that Apple would be giving a digital copy of U2's new album, "Songs of Innocence," to all 500 million iTunes customers, the group's frontman apologized to those who considered the gift an inconvenience. Instead of simply making it available, Apple automatically sent it to active iTunes accounts, and for those whose settings allowed it, the album was automatically downloaded. The free download was announced at the September 9 Apple event at which the iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus and Apple Watch were unveiled, and at which U2 performed. Apple said last week that the album had been fully downloaded 26 million times and that 81 million people had listened to at least one song. A drop of megalomania, a touch of generosity, a dash of self-promotion and deep fear that these songs, that we poured our life into over the last few years, mightn't be heard.
