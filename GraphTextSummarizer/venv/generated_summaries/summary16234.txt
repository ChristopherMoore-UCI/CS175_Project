-- Trick-or-treating and dressing in costume have been Halloween traditions for a good long time now, but it seems we're still struggling to get it right. "Should Halloween be a neighborhood activity, or is it legitimately a free-for-all in which people hunt down the best candy grounds for their kids?" The rules on this are pretty obvious, as Yoffe pointed out: "Stop being callous and miserly and go to Costco, you cheapskate, and get enough candy to fill the bags of the kids who come one day a year to marvel at how the 1% live. Give goodies to any child who shows up at the door Halloween night is not the time to quibble over the quality of trick-or-treaters' costumes or whether some kids are too old to ask for free candy. It's not any prettier when it happens at your neighborhood Halloween bash, your lighthearted college kegger or in your kids' class party. It's a very simple bit of Halloween communication, more powerful than all the trick-or-treating apps and maps out there: the porch light.
