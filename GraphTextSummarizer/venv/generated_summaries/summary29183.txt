The reasons the progressive agenda promotes happiness are complex, but stated simply, the more we supplement the cold efficiency of the market with interventions that reduce poverty, insecurity, and inequality, the more we improve quality of life for everyone. It turns out that having a "nanny" makes life better for people. Across the Western world, the quality of human life increases as the size of the state increases. The answer is simple and unequivocal: Happier people live in countries with a generous social safety net, or, more generally, countries whose governments  "tax and spend" at higher rates, reflecting the greater range of services and protections offered by the state. People who live in states with higher welfare spending, more organized labor, more liberal state governments, more regulation of business, and a greater recent history of control by the Democratic Party, are all more satisfied with their lives, regardless of income, and again when controlling for other factors that are likely to affect well-being.
