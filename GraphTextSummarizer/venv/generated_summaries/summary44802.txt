A green economy relies on renewable energy and the creation of green jobs to prevent further pollution and resource depletion and sustain economic growth. Economic growth, quality jobs and energy independence are not mutually exclusive. How countries like India and China solve their future energy needs has an impact on people everywhere -- many developing countries are now pulling ahead of the United States on renewable energy -- and how the United States addresses its key issues will have an equal impact. But not everyone sees the bigger picture -- that the global economy will improve by moving away from dependence on fossil fuel, that investments in renewable energy can create jobs and that a new revolution is needed to replace the outdated Industrial Revolution. All these organizations have a stake in climate change, development and growth, national security and energy policy -- geopolitical issues that must be addressed.
