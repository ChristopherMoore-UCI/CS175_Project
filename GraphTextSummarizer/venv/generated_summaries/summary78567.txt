Whole Foods, for example, responded to a Change.org petition on Eden Foods with a statement, saying, "Our primary consideration is whether the product's ingredients meet our Quality Standards." I am not saying that the Eden Foods case is analogous to slave labor, but only that is reasonable to demand your grocery store respond to ethical complaints. Instead, Eden officials claim that their position emerges out of their principles, their religious convictions, and that they are just trying to do the right thing. -- Eden Foods has become the new front line in the contest over religion, health care and the workplace. Eden Foods is a closely held, for-profit corporation that objects to covering contraception on religious grounds.
