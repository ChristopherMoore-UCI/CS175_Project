In traditional Chinese architecture they use wood and not very good wood -- simple, cheap wood. We use the courtyard house in many different places: In homes, shops, factories, office buildings, schools, jails, everything. For example, if you look at Chinese traditional buildings, you will find they are not just about the solid structure. So that is why I like Chinese traditional architecture. If you really want to understand traditional Chinese architecture you should really know the craftsman's work because in China for a long time we did not have architecture theory or history, we did not have architects -- we only had craftsmen so the secret was just in the craftsman's hands.
