I've been trying for a long while to come up with an adequate way to describe how devastating Bob's loss is to those of us who knew him, to CBS News and to quality journalism. There is an old saying among soldiers and correspondents who cover them that when two people drink from the same canteen in some desert, jungle or other war zone they have a bond for life. Once, in South Africa I think it was, we were talking over an adult beverage or two in the shank of an evening about dangerous assignments, a subject about which Bob was experienced and expert. Bob and I had drunk from the same canteen more than once during the 48 years we had known each other, 38 of those working together at CBS News. With a piercing look and a hint of that slightly off-center smile he sometimes had, he said something along the lines of, "More correspondents are injured getting out of the shower and more are killed in automobile accidents than probably anywhere else."
