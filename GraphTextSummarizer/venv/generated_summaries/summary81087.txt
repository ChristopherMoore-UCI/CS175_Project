The actor was credited as assistant director on Green's first feature, "George Washington," and played a supporting role in his second, "All the Real Girls," opposite Zooey Deschanel 足who plays the virgin Belladonna here. The brothers are forced on a quest to vanquish an evil warlock (Justin Theroux, not so bad) and save Belladonna from a fate worse than death. Insert a modern expletive or three in an affected English accent and that line gives you the gist of the film "Your Highness" and its one and only comic idea, which is to recreate the rollicking sword and sorcery adventures of yore, and punch them up with anachronistic vulgarities and stoner jokes. The old school special effects work is artful and amusing, with several affectionate nods to the influence of veteran stop-motion maestro Ray Harryhausen. This misbegotten enterprise 足足-- a collaboration too far between actor/screenwriter Danny McBride ("Eastbound and Down") and "Pineapple Express" director David Gordon Green 足-- is such an egregious waste of talent it might send unsuspecting audiences rushing out to give "Sucker Punch" a second chance.
