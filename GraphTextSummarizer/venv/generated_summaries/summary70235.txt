Nearly 200 million Chinese will enter child-bearing age in the next 10 years, Minister Zhang Weiqing told the China Daily newspaper. While the policy has helped curb population growth, it has also led to forced sterilizations in some parts of the country, the State Department said. He said abandoning the policy during this period would cause "serious problems and add extra pressure on social and economic development." "After the new birth peak ends, we may adjust the policy if there is a need," he said. -- China will maintain its one-child policy for at least another decade, the country's family planning minister said in an interview published Monday. Enforcement varies but usually takes the form of fines to discourage extra births.
