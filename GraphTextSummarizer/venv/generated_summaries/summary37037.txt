-- Israel reached the Davis Cup quarterfinals for the first time since 1987 after a dramatic 3-2 victory over Sweden staged behind closed doors and against a background of violent demonstrations in Malmo. Earlier Dudi Sela also needed five sets to fire Israel onto the comeback trail with a 3-6 6-1 4-6 6-4 6-2 success over Thomas Johansson against an eerie background after Malmo city council refused to allow spectators because of security fears. Croatia whitewashed Chile 5-0 at Porec with Mario Ancic and Marin Cilic doing the damage, Radek Stepanek sent the Czech Republic into a last eight meeting with Argentina, beating top ten player Gilles Simon 7-6 6-3 7-6 as France suffered their first opening round defeat for nine years. Israel's next tie is at home to Russia in July after Harel Levy held his nerve to defeat Andreas Vinciguerra 6-4 4-6 6-4 3-6 8-6 in just over three and a half hours after Israel began the final day of the World Group first round tie 2-1 down. With the U.S. taking a 2-1 lead into the final day of action, Roddick hammered out a 6-4 6-4 6-2 victory over Stanislas Wawrinka in Sunday's first reverse singles.
