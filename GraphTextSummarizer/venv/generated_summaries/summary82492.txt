-- Security forces rescued two tourists Saturday, just one day after they were kidnapped in a remote region of northeast Ecuador, the Interior Ministry said. The attack occurred either inside or near the Cuyabeno Wildlife Reserve, which is located in the northeast province of Sucumbios near the border with Colombia. Including the two who were kidnapped, the tourist group totaled seven people, according to the Interior Ministry. The Environment Ministry identified those kidnapped as an Australian woman, 32, and a 23-year-old woman from England. According to both, the tourists were part of a group that was attacked Friday.
