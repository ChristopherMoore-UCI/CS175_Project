When his SUV was surrounded by several bikers, Lien called 9-1-1, told police he feared for his life and drove off, running over bikers and critically injuring one. Bonanno says the officer belongs to a motorcycle club and was riding with hundreds of bikers who participated in the September 29th rally, but insists he didn't witness the assault on Lien. Authorities say Alexander Lien was chased by bikers after he initially bumped one during a biker rally on September 29. A law enforcement source, with knowledge of the case, told CNN the Internal Affairs officer didn't report he was at the rally for at least a week. The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, tells CNN authorities are investigating his account.
