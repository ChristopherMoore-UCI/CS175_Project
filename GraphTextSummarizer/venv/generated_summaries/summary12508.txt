More than 100 uncontacted tribes remain worldwide, and about half live in the remote reaches of the Amazonian rainforest in Peru or Brazil, says Survival International, which advocates for tribal peoples. Loggers in Peru are pushing isolated Indians from Peru into Brazil, where, according to Survival International, "the two groups are likely to come into conflict. It refers to such tribes as "peoples who have no peaceful contact with anyone in the mainstream or dominant society." Brazil and Survival International have warned of the dangers posed by logging and disease. Aid group Survival International first reported this week that suspected traffickers had destroyed a Brazilian guard post built near the tribe's location to protect them from outsiders. The incursion was first reported by Indians from the Ashaninka people, who at the end of July reported to Funai that a group of armed men from Peru ransacked their village.
