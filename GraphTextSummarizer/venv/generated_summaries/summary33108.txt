More than 6,500 people remained isolated Wednesday in Lonquimay, a town with many living in outlying, rural areas, CNN Chile affiliate Universidad Autonoma Television reported. Authorities said they were sending trucks filled with food to the region, along with military helicopters to reach people in remote areas. There are areas with more than 2.3 meters of snow and we have gone many days without being able to communicate with many of them," Lonquimay Mayor Guillermo Vasquez said in a statement Monday. " "It has snowed more than ever," Curacautin Mayor Jorge Saquel told CNN Chile Tuesday. Touching the snow, it is like glass," Saquel told CNN Chile.
