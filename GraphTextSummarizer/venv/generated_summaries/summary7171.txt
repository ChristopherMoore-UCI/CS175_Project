-- Iranian authorities have moved imprisoned American Saeed Abedini to a more dangerous prison and are now prohibiting visits from the family of the Christian pastor, according to the public interest law firm representing Abedini's family in the United States. Regarding Saeed's case Sanei said, "Saeed Abedini is among the dozens of Iranian Christians who have been subjected to surveillance, harassment, arbitrary arrests and detentions, and unlawful convictions during the past few years because of the Iranian government's crackdown on Christian converts and the home church movement. In a news release, the American Center for Law and Justice (ACLJ) said that one of Abedini's Iranian family members went to visit him at Evin Prison in Tehran on Sunday and was told that Abedini had been moved the previous day to Rajai Shahr Prison near Karaj. Amir Hekmati is a former U.S. Marine who was jailed in Iran in 2011, with the Iranian government accusing him of espionage Faraz Sanei, Iran researcher with Human Rights Watch, said that "prisoners of conscience" incarcerated at Rajai Shahr Prison are comingled with violent offenders, such as those serving time for murder convictions. "Iran's judiciary should immediately free Abedini and others like him, and allow Iran's Christian community, and particularly members of the country's besieged home church movement, to practice their faith free from government interference."
