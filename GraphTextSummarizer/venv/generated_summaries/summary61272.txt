An animated crowd quickly gathered late Wednesday near the site close to the Missouri Botanical Garden, chanting slogans as St. Louis police officers stood by. In this case, the 18-year-old was armed, and he fired on the officer first, St. Louis Police Chief Sam Dotson said. Protesters are planning a series of demonstrations, rallies and events in Ferguson and St. Louis this weekend to call for an end to racial profiling and what they call police violence. The death comes on the heels of the Brown shooting two months ago in the suburb of Ferguson, and just ahead of a "Weekend of Resistance" in St. Louis, where activists will push for movement in the investigation into that case. And it all unfolded in the St. Louis metro area.
