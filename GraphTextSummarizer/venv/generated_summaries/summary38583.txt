Foxes are a common sight throughout London, especially in Hackney which backs onto the green spaces of Hackney Marshes, the Lea Valley Regional Park and the new Olympic site. The two girls were attacked in their upstairs bedroom at a house in Hackney, east London, after the fox apparently entered the house through a door left open because of the heat while the twins' parents watched television downstairs, police said. A Hackney Council spokesman said the council didn't have dedicated environmental officers to deal with foxes but had called in a private contractor over the incident. Of the twin girls, she said: "They're beautiful little babies, really beautiful." Michael Parra, another neighbor, said police had warned residents not to leave doors open in the summer weather. "We have never had reports in the past of foxes attacking residents," the spokesman told CNN.
