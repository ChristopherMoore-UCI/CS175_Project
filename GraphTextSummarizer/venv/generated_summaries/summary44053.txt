Robert Downey Jr.: Hollywood's highest-paid actor (again) "It's down to Kevin (Feige, Marvel Studios president) and Ike (Perlmutter, CEO of Marvel Entertainment) and Disney to come to us with what the proposal is, and that's on us to agree or disagree," Downey said. Hollywood's highest-paid actor told Entertainment Weekly that he would have no problem putting on the big red suit if Marvel will have him back. But he added, "Right now, this has just been swell, hasn't it?" Downey is currently filming the new "Avengers" movie. And the third film, "Iron Man 3" (2013), made more than $400 million domestically and -- including international grosses -- topped out at more than $1.2 billion. Robert Downey Jr. would welcome the opportunity.
