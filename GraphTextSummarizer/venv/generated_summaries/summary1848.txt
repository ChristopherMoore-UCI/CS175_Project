There is no scientifically established link between smokeless tobacco and salivary gland cancer, according to the American Council on Science and Health. Players cannot have tobacco tins in their uniforms or do interviews while using chewing tobacco. "The kind of chewing tobacco Gwynn used does have some risk of oral cancer, but not parotid (salivary) gland cancer, which is the kind that took his life at such a young age," said Dr. Gilbert Ross, the council's medical director. What they probably don't remember is Gwynn using smokeless tobacco throughout his career -- a habit, Gwynn told ESPN in 2010, that he believed gave him cancer. Smokeless tobacco contains 28 carcinogens, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and is a known cause of oral cancer.
