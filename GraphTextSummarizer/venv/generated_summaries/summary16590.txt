"If You Want Me to Stay," "Dance to the Music" and "Family Affair." On Tuesday, a Los Angeles Superior Court civil jury found for Stone in his breach-of-contract lawsuit against Even St. Productions, manager Jerry Goldstein and attorney Glenn Stone, awarding him $5 million in royalties and damages. In his lawsuit, Stone (whose legal name is Sylvester Stewart) alleged that Goldstein and Glenn Stone "without the permission of Sly Stone, have received, borrowed, and continue to receive millions of dollars in royalties or derived from royalties," according to the Los Angeles Times. He said he expects the court to rule on future royalties and other matters within a month or two. Attorney Gregory Bodell, who represents Goldstein and Glenn Stone, said his clients plan to appeal. If you want him to stay, you're going to have to pay Sly Stone.
