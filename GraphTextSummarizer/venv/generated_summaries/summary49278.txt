Ed Manzke, an attorney who represents the student, Marshawn Pitts, 15, told CNN Wednesday the officer beat Pitts for not adhering to the school's dress code. In a written statement, Guy Lindsay, internal information officer for Dolton police, said the department was made aware of the incident and the tape on May 20. Videotape allegedly shows an unidentified police officer assaulting student Marshawn Pitts, 15. The police officer, who has not been identified, reprimanded Pitts for not tucking in his shirt as school dress code and policy requires. Pitts was admitted to the school in May after moving from Iowa, Manzke said.
