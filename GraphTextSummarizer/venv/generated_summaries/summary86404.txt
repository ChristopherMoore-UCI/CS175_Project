-- Thousands of protesters clogged the tiny town of Jena, Louisiana, Thursday to show their indignation over what they consider unjust, unequal punishments meted out in two racially charged incidents. Officers lead Al Sharpton, center, through Jena, Louisiana, during Thursday's protest. "There's a Jena in every state," Jackson told the crowd in Jena on Thursday morning. Jena's racial tensions were aggravated in August 2006, when three white teens hung the nooses the day after a group of black students received permission from school administrators to sit under the tree -- a place where white students normally congregated. The estimated 15000 to 20,000 demonstrators shut down the town of 3,000 in central Louisiana.
