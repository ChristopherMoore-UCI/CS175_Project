" "Broadly worded anti-terror and penal code statutes have allowed Turkish authorities to conflate the coverage of banned groups and the investigation of sensitive topics with outright terrorism or other anti-state activity," the committee said. Dozens of Kurdish reporters and editors have been jailed on terrorism-related charges, it said, and several other journalists "on charges of involvement in anti-government plots. On a more positive note, the committee noted that for the first time since 1996, Myanmar is not on its list of countries jailing journalists. -- The number of journalists jailed around the world reached a record high in 2012, with Turkey the worst offender, the Committee to Protect Journalists said in a report published Tuesday. At the start of this month, 232 reporters, photographers and editors were in prisons in 27 countries on charges of "terrorism" and crimes against the state intended to "silence critical voices," the New-York based group said.
