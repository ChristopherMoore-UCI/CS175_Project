Flights were rerouted to airports in Mombasa and Eldoret, and also to neighboring nations. The fire also came days after the United States issued a worldwide travel alert and closed embassies and consulates in large areas of the Middle East and Africa, though Kenya and Tanzania were not among them. A day after the fire started, airport officials said they have set up tents to temporarily service the international area. Other international flights took off from the airport, including to South Sudan and South Africa, the Kenya Airports Authority tweeted. Some witnesses said the fire began in the customs section, while others said it started in the duty-free area, parts of which had been demolished as part of airport construction last week.
