The flipside is that some Democrats look as if they don't want to address welfare fraud while they fight welfare cuts, which, if you think about it, looks a lot worse. After all, how can the opponents genuinely criticize Republicans for trying to make cuts in aid while resisting a seemingly innocuous effort to avoid welfare fraud, a big concern for taxpayers? Any Democrat who might want to challenge a Republican-led effort to ban welfare recipients from spending federal aid in strip clubs and casinos needs to fold 'em. Again: Welfare checks, strip clubs, casinos ... seems like a no-brainer, right? The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families -- or welfare -- supplies cash to working poor families using what amounts to a debit card.
