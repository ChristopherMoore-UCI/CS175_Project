Where Ukraine and the West directed their demands at Russian-backed separatists in Eastern Ukraine, Russia was quick to point out that pro-European protesters were to surrender, too, including the EuroMaidan. With this narrative, Russia lays the same claim to vast parts of mainland Ukraine as it did to Crimea. The massive concentration of Russian troops across Ukraine's eastern borders was not addressed, which perpetuates Moscow's military intimidation of Kiev and the threat of war. For Putin, the East and South of Ukraine are clearly Novorossiya, or New Russia, the Tsarist term for these territories. The financial stabilization of Ukraine, although unspecified, was clearly included to pre-empt the country's political implosion, while Russia insisted that aid be conditional on the implementation of the de-escalation plan, and on the fulfillment of its own demands.
