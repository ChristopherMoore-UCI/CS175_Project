The Costa Concordia struck rocks in shallow water off Italy's western coast on Friday, killing at least three people, injuring 20 and leaving dozens unaccounted for. CNN affiliate America Noticias, in Peru, said a group of 32 Peruvians were also onboard. It was christened in 2006, at which point the ship was believed to be the largest cruise ship flying the Italian flag. Its name -- Concordia -- is Italian for concord, or harmony. Brazil's state-run Agencia Brasil said 53 Brazilians were on the cruise ship.
