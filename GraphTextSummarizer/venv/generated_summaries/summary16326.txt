Prime Minister Vladimir Putin dispatched two planes from Moscow equipped to carry people with extensive burns. But this latest nightclub accident, in the Russian heartland around 900 miles east of Moscow, is believed to have been caused by what one Russian official says was the "unsanctioned use of pyrotechnical devices. We give them the information about people who are in hospitals and those who were found dead and recognized by the forensic bureau," Goncharov said. Shocked residents placed flowers outside the burned club in memory of the victims, a scene that brought back memories of two other Russian deadly club fires -- one in Moscow in 2007 and the other in Omsk in 2008.
