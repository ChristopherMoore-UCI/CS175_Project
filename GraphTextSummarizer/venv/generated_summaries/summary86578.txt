Specifically created with mobile users in mind, it sorts and turns emails into reminders, highlights the important bits and adds outside information it thinks is helpful. Messages can be turned into reminders, reminders can be snoozed, and important emails "pinned" while the rest are whisked away. Even as people are turning to other tools to quickly communicate from their phones -- messaging apps, social networks, text -- email remains an invaluable if sometimes infuriating way of communicating from mobile devices. Gmail recently started categorizing emails automatically and putting them in different tabs in your inbox, like social, promotions and updates. Inbox will highlight what it thinks are the key parts of an email, like contact information, confirmation numbers or photos.
