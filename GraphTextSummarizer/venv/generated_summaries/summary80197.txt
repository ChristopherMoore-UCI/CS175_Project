Wyoming officials have not indicated whether they will appeal the ruling from federal Judge Scott Skavdahl. In Alaska, a federal judge in the state in recent days had ordered gays and lesbians be allowed to apply for marriage licenses and to wed after a normal three-day waiting period.

Some couples had begun applying for marriage licenses as early as Monday and in at least some cases, couples were married when they were granted expedited waivers. That appeals court's legal jurisdiction also includes Alaska and other Western states.
