Former cycling champ Lance Armstrong struck two parked vehicles as he drove home from a night of partying but wasn't charged until his longtime girlfriend said she wasn't behind the wheel, according to police in Aspen, Colorado. Police served a summons on Armstrong through his lawyer so Armstrong was not questioned by police or quoted in the police report. When asked if Armstrong persuaded her to take the blame, Hansen said, according to the police report: "No, that was a joint decision and um, you know we've had our family name smeared over every paper in the world in the last couple of years and ... On December 31, Hansen talked to police again, this time with her lawyer, and changed her story to say Armstrong was the driver. Armstrong recovered from a near-fatal bout of testicular cancer and went on to win seven Tour de Frances, raising millions for cancer research and making millions for himself.
