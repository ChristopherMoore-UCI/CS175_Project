-- Every working night for the past 34 years, Sergey Matveev has watched from his control room as tankers, ships and barges glide across the crisp waters of St. Petersburg's River Neva. Any lapses of communication between bridges -- which must rise one after the other -- can mean ships stranded in dangerous waters. As custodian of the iconic Palace Bridge, Matveev is responsible for maritime access into and out of the city's myriad canals and waterways -- but he's not alone in this endeavor. "The bridges are the symbol of St. Petersburg," Matveev said. According to local industry website, Port News, more than 9 million tons of freight moves along the River Neva between May and November alone (before the water freezes over during Russia's bitter winter months).
