-- Rwanda will not be screening U.S. visitors for Ebola after all. Mali reported its first Ebola case Thursday, sparking fears the deadly virus is spreading to more countries. Visitors from the United States or Spain were required to report their medical condition -- regardless of whether they had Ebola symptoms -- for the duration of their visit to Rwanda, the U.S. Embassy said in a statement. Rwanda sent tongues wagging last week when it said visitors from the two western nations will be screened for Ebola. Both countries have had a handful of Ebola cases -- Rwanda has had none.
