10 tips for Thanksgiving travel "The average distance traveled this Thanksgiving will be 549 miles roundtrip and Americans will spend an average of $573 during the holiday weekend," AAA predicted.

But conditions were much better Sunday in many areas, with "warmer and more tranquil conditions" in parts of the country including the East Coast, CNN meteorologist Todd Borek said. While a lot of attention goes to the airports -- where the interconnected flight travel system can have a domino effect -- the vast majority of Thanksgiving travelers hit the road.
