iReport.com: Bermuda's preparations The storm also was beginning to affect the U.S. East Coast, where dangerous rip currents and battering waves were developing, said CNN meteorologist Jacqui Jeras. There were reports of waves at the center of the storm as high as 54 feet, Jeras said. Rip currents form as wind and waves push water against the shore, where it is caught behind an obstacle such as a sandbar until it breaks free, sending a strong channel of water flowing away from the shoreline. Hurricane Bill is expected to pass between Bermuda and the U.S. East Coast over the weekend. As of 11 p.m. Friday, Bill's center was about 180 miles west-southwest of Bermuda, and about 545 miles east-southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina.
