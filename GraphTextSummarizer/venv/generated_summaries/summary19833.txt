We will have to fight hard to get the three points." Appiah said Ghana had benefited from the support of the South African fans and said there was "unity" between all the African sides at the first World Cup to be held on the continent. Ghana captain Stephen Appiah says the west African side will be ready for "war" when they face Australia at the World Cup in Rustenburg on Saturday. "We are all excited to be in Africa to participate in this World Cup and we all hope to support African teams who are still playing," said Mensah. Australia were beaten 4-0 by Germany in their first game but Appiah and teammate John Mensah said they would not be taking the Socceroos lightly. Ghana are without their best player and regular captain Michael Essien but Appiah said the Chelsea star was in touch with the squad every day.
