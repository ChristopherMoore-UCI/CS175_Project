Britain's world record holder Paula Radcliffe finished third on her comeback to marathon after giving birth to her second child and a series of injuries. Kenya's Florence Kiplagat won the women's race in two hours 19 minutes and 43 seconds with Germany's Irina Mikitenko in second place. -- Kenya's Patrick Makau set a new world record for the marathon in Berlin Sunday as previous record holder Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia failed to finish. Gebrselassie, 38, was prominent until the 35km mark before dropping out, just as he had done in the New York marathon last November. Stephen Kwelio Chemlany took second with Edwin Kimaiyo placing third.
