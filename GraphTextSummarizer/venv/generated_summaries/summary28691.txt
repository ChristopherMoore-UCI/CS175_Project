We would like to take this chance to respond to them: Allegation 1: CNN intentionally cropped an image in order to remove Tibetan protesters throwing stones at Chinese trucks. Additionally, we have published video from the Chinese media apparently showing Tibetans attacking Chinese interests in Lhasa. A March 18 story shows Tibetan youths attacking a Chinese man. The picture gallery included in Tibet stories includes the image. We have provided comprehensive coverage of all sides of this story, but two specific allegations relate to pro-Tibetan bias.
