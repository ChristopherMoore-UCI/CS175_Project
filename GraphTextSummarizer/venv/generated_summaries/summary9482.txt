There are few major league professional sports where men and women compete directly, and stock car racing is expensive, competitive and potentially lethal. " Duno has driven a variety of cars during her career and has constantly had to master new skills -- but her love of learning is abundant. When you put the helmet on, it doesn't matter if you are woman or man: your mission is to compete to win. Duno has already cracked a rib and a tooth this season, after a broadside hit from another car at full speed in an ARCA stock-car series race at Salem Speedway in Indiana. There are 42 other cars that want to win the race, too, and they have more experience than me, but it doesn't matter.
