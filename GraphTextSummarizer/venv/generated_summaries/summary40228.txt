More disturbances followed on Wednesday, when ethnic Russians and internal migrants met for a confrontation in Moscow, and other riots have also taken place in St. Petersburg and other Russian cities, RIA Novosti said. The confrontations took place in Manezh Square, outside the Kremlin, and led to the arrests of 65 Spartak Moscow fans for "disobedience," Moscow police spokesman Viktor Biryukov said last weekend, according to the official Russian news agency Itar-Tass. The head of the Spartak Moscow fan club has told RIA Novosti that the showdown had nothing to do with sports but instead was rooted in problems in Russian society. Ilya Kubrakov and three other rioters were arrested on Friday, a Moscow court announced, according to the Russian state-run news agency RIA Novosti. Kubrakov could face life in prison for the stabbing death of the Kyrgyz migrant in southern Moscow, whose body was found on Sunday, RIA Novosti said.
