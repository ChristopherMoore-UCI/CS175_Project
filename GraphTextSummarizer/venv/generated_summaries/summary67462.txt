According to Melendez, the likelihood that Miranda will return to Puerto Rico is slim, because so many Puerto Ricans who migrate to the mainland settle down and stay. So many residents have left the island over the years that there are a million more Puerto Ricans living in the mainland United States (4.9 million as of 2011) than in Puerto Rico (3.7 million). Puerto Ricans favor statehood for first time For Miranda, getting a job wasn't the only factor in her decision to leave Puerto Rico. Also, the electric supply isn't as reliable in Puerto Rico as it is in the United States, so Puerto Ricans have to pay more to protect their televisions and computers. Last week, in an attempt to avoid financial ruin, Puerto Rico Gov. Alejandro Garc√≠a Padilla signed a bill authorizing the sale of $3.5 million in tax-free general obligation bonds.
