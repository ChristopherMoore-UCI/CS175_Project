But Microsoft, hoping a bevy of new apps will up the ante, is adding content from 40 new partners while making existing content easier to view. One of the free update's key new features will be a voice-control interface that will let users retrieve videos, television channels, games or other content simply by asking for it. " "The update is another huge step toward realizing our vision of bringing you all your entertainment, shared with the people you care about, in an easy way," Marc Whitten, Microsoft's corporate vice president for Xbox Live, wrote on the official Microsoft blog. -- An update rolling out Tuesday for the Xbox Live network aims to do what Microsoft has been teasing for a while -- turn a platform designed primarily for video games into one that will be the major hub for all television viewing. "Microsoft has just built and delivered it: A single box that ties together all the content you want, made easily accessible through a universal, natural, voice-directed search," wrote James McQuivey of Forrester Research.
