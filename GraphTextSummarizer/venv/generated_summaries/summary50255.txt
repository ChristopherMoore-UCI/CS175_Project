-- A U.S. default on its debt would be "devastating" for the global economy and would hit the poor particularly hard, World Bank president Jim Yong Kim told CNN's Richard Quest Wednesday. Quest spoke to Kim in Washington D.C., where the world's economic and political world leaders have gathered for the annual meetings of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. Meanwhile, the World Bank is focused on halving poverty from 18% to 9% by 2020, Kim told Quest. The World Bank had prepared contingency plans to support countries if the U.S. debt crisis further roiled global markets, Kim said. " WATCH MORE: IMF: Debt default could damage economy
