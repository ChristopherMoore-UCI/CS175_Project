Senate aides from both parties and outside congressional observers agree that political positioning for the upcoming 2016 presidential and congressional elections will likely dominate the day-to-day workings of the Senate, While Republican leaders believe it is important they show the country they can pass legislation and govern effectively, Democrats will likely do everything they can to block GOP achievements because they think they have a good chance of winning back the chamber in 2016. Complicating matters for Republicans is an expected tug of war within their party, with potential 2016 presidential contenders trying to assert their conservative credentials while other GOP Senators in competitive states try to appeal to moderate voters. "Look, the Democrats see an opportunity to keep the White House in 2016 and pick up seats and get the majority back," said a GOP Senate aide predicting Democrats will refuse to work with them. After complaining for years that the Democrats put politics ahead of a well-functioning Senate, McConnell has vowed to return to "regular order" so that budgets, spending bills, and other items are approved months before the threat of a government shutdown or fiscal cliff looms.
