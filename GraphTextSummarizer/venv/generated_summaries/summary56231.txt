Unlike previous models, which blocked large parts of the ear with big plastic shells, the so-called Invisible In-Canal (IIC) hearing aids allow for more sound to be collected naturally by the shape of the ear, and to flow down the ear canal as it would with unassisted hearing, improving the fidelity and range of sound. Westermann recalls that when he was born, hearing aids had been hulking, impractical devices "that you wore on your back." "The sound will leak from near the ear drum and out between the ear piece and the ear canal. But the energy efficiency and relatively small size of the transistor -- which is used to amplify electronic signals -- paved the way for the now familiar "behind the ear" style of hearing aid. According to Westermann, this was the cause of irritating "whistling" in previous models.
