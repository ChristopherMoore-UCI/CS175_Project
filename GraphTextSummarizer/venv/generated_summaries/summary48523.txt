According to child advocacy group KidsAndCars.org, 44 children died of heatstroke in cars in 2013, and more than 500 have died in hot cars since 2000. About 50% of cases involving deaths of infants abandoned in automobiles result in criminal charges, Callan said, adding that each case is "highly individual." "The criminal law generally does not punish for accidental events absent evidence of gross negligence, recklessness or a depraved indifference to the value of human life," Callan said. "The use of the word 'homicide' in an autopsy report, though often seen in connection with criminal cases, does not necessarily mean that criminal charges will be lodged against the father," Callan said. Despite the medical examiner's ruling, the decision about whether to press criminal charges is made by the state's attorney, said CNN Legal Analyst Paul Callan. In the wake of his death, Rogers-Seitz created a blog called "The Gift of Ben," which she has said she is using to bring attention to the number of children who die of heatstroke in cars and to press for action to save lives.
