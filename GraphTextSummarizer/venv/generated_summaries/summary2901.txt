While New York City and its surrounding suburbs, the Albany area, and Ithaca are all growing, much of upstate New York is experiencing declines in population, Beveridge said. Stan Smith, population program director at the University of Florida's Bureau of Economic and Business Research (BEBR), agreed with Boswell that Florida likely will overtake New York at some point in 2014 or 2015. If Florida surpasses New York in population, it likely will end up with more seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. Manufacturing jobs have diminished in northern New York cities like Rochester, Buffalo and Syracuse. If predictions hold true, Florida may soon overtake New York as the nation's third-most populous state.
