Dr. Jennifer Holter, who has been treating Billy at Oklahoma University Medical Center since the fall of 2008, says several immunologists have reviewed his case but  the underlying reason for his immunodeficiency is still unclear. Instead, Nikki Peterson remembers December 30, 2007 as the day her husband Billy got sick. Nikki says she knew there was something wrong when Billy was no longer able to walk around the house. On their third visit, Nikki refused to go home until doctors agreed to keep Billy in the hospital for further evaluation. Billy, a father of two who dreams of opening up his own restaurant one day, appears to have some type of problem with B-cells, according to Nikki.
