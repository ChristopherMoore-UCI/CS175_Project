"With today's announcement, we are taking a major step in bringing a 19th century icon into the 21st century. -- The Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island will undergo renovations totaling more than $27 million beginning in late October, according to Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar. Liberty Island, where the iconic statue is located, will remain open during the yearlong project and views of Lady Liberty will remain largely unobstructed. "Two years ago, when we reopened Lady Liberty's crown to visitors for the first time since the September 11 attacks, I promised that we would continue to upgrade the interior to make it safer and more accessible for all," Salazar said Wednesday. National Park Rangers will remain on site to provide tours of the grounds and history of the statue to visitors, said Jane Ahern, spokeswoman of the Statue of Liberty National Monument.
