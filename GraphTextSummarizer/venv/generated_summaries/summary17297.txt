Warner Bros. has just announced that "The Hobbit" earned an estimated $13 million from midnight showings at 3,100 locations last night, giving it a per-theater average of $4,193 from midnight shows alone. Encouragingly, "The Hobbit" played substantially better than other effects-driven December releases like "Avatar," which started with $3.5 million at midnight on the way to a $77 million weekend in 2009, and "I Am Legend," which started with $1.7 million on the way to $77.2 million in 2007 â€” the current December opening weekend record. For reference, here's how each of those films did at midnight: "The Avengers" -- $18.7 million "The Hunger Games" -- $19.7 million "The Dark Knight Rises" -- $30.6 million "Breaking Dawn -- Part 2" -- $30.4 million EW.com: 'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey' movie review Despite the comparatively low midnight gross, I'm expecting "The Hobbit" to hold up substantially better than all those films over the full weekend thanks to its increased family appeal (parents aren't taking youngsters to see a three-hour movie at midnight). Granted, midnight showings weren't nearly as popular even three years ago as they are now, but "The Hobbit" will still easily crush those grosses. Included in "The Hobbit's" midnight figure is $1.6 million earned from 326 IMAX theaters.
