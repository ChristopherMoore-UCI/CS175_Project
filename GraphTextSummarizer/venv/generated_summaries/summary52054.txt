-- Eleven pilot whales were found dead Sunday in the lower Florida Keys, doubling the number of dead whales found in the past week. Mass strandings by pilot whales are not altogether uncommon in Florida. "Given our knowledge of past mass pilot whales strandings, the outlook for finding the remaining whales alive is bleak. Pilot whales are protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, but they are not endangered. "This totals 22 dead whales and 29 still missing," NOAA said in a statement.
