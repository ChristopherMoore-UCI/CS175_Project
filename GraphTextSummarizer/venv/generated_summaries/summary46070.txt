IRS screeners used conservative-themed criteria such as "tea party" on "Be on the Lookout" or BOLO lists to determine if groups underwent further review for political activity that would make them ineligible, according to Werfel and the inspector general who first revealed the targeting. Werfel noted that the FBI and inspector general were handling interview of IRS officials involved in the targeting, adding that the investigations could involve criminal behavior. Republican leaders contend the targeting uncovered by the inspector general's audit indicated political villainy by the Obama administration to try to stifle opponents, such as groups with "tea party" in their names that were flagged for additional IRS scrutiny. Regulations limit such status to groups primarily involved in social welfare activities, while political groups are considered ineligible. As part of his review, Werfel said 80 groups awaiting IRS action on their applications for tax-exempt status for more than 120 days could self-register with the agency as long as they certified under penalty of perjury that they would comply with applicable laws and regulations.
