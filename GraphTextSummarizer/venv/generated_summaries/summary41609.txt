Well, the president broke that promise barely a week after taking office when he signed the Lilly Ledbetter Bill dealing with equal pay for men and women. Whether by omission or commission, both the White House and Congress get a dose of blame for not living up to the new era of transparency promised by President Obama. So, the House tried to clean up the mess last week by rushing through another bill -- a tax on AIG bonuses. CNN's Campbell Brown says nonemergency legislation needs time to be read by the public and Congress. The president's old campaign Web site still has this commitment there for all to see: "As president, Obama will not sign any nonemergency bill without giving the American public an opportunity to review and comment on the White House Web site for five days."
