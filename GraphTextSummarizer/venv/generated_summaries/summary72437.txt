United Nations officials have warned that the violence between the Christian majority and Muslim minority now in power could lead to genocide. Rights groups accuse security forces and militia gangs of torturing civilians as world leaders warn that the nation is on the verge of genocide. The United States sent special forces to the region last year to help hunt down Kony, the brutal leader of the Lord Resistance Army. Left uncontrolled, militia groups are uniting along religious lines. Seleka is a predominantly Muslim coalition, and as history has shown over and over, religious loyalties can breed contempt and escalate conflicts.
