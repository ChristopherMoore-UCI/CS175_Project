Even before World Cup ball starts rolling, Rio de Janeiro's Olympics under scrutiny Pele: Brazil to put 'problems' behind them and stage 'fantastic' World Cup CNN's Pierre Meilhan contributed to this report. -- At least one person was killed when an overpass bridge under construction collapsed in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, one of the host cities for the ongoing World Cup, firefighters said Thursday on Twitter. Also, many of the country's 12 venues struggled to meet construction schedules in time for the games, and several workers died on World Cup stadium construction sites. The city has so far hosted five World Cup games since June 14, when Colombia beat Greece 3-0. The overpass traverses a major thoroughfare and is almost four miles from the 58,170-seat Estadio Mineirao where the World Cup games are being played in Belo Horizonte.
