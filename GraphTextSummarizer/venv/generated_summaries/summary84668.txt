Going up against Embraer and Bombardier in the narrow-bodied-jet sector, Mitsubishi says six airlines have more than 400 MRJ planes on order or with options to purchase: ANA, JAL, Air Mandalay, Sky West, Trans States, and a relaunched Eastern Air Lines. Since Japan's last commercial passenger plane was flying routes across the nation, the country has led the world in high-speed rail and established a significant aerospace industry -- but it's taken a back seat when it comes to original aircraft development. " Composites are used in the construction of the MRJ, which will be powered by two Pratt & Whitney PW1200G engines. It was rolled out at Saturday's launch event, complete with a stirring taiko drum performance at the Komaki Minami plant in Nagoya, where one of Mitsubishi's most famous aircraft was developed: the A6M "Zero" World War II fighter plane. The last commercial Japanese plane to operate was Mitsubishi's YS-11, a turboprop aircraft built between 1962 and 1972.
