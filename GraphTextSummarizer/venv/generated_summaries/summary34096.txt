Five years after the regional government announced its intention to redevelop Dharavi, the vast Mumbai slum where parts of "Slumdog Millionaire" were filmed, developers are finally submitting their blueprints for the project. "Developing countries in Asia and Africa have invited me to have similar projects in their country. In June 2007, some 15,000 Dharavi residents marched against the proposals, which they felt benefited developers at their expense. The plan is for developers to demolish the slum and build apartments on the site, which will be given free of charge to 57,000 families currently living in Dharavi. With over a billion people living in slums globally, Mehta sees this involvement of private money as essential for slum regeneration around the world.
