Portugal's earlier last-gasp win over Denmark means that nothing is yet decided in Group B. However, Germany need only a point against Denmark to reach the quarterfinals, while the Netherlands need something of a miracle to progress. It was a remarkable finish to a remarkable game and it left Portugal and Denmark locked together on three points each after two Group B games. Cristiano Ronaldo missed a glorious chance to restore Portugal's advantage but substitute Varela had the final say with a remarkable winner. Those are the sort of statistics more usually associated with Ronaldo, but the Portugal captain had an off-day, missing two clear chances before substitute Varela spared his blushes. But a game between the two highest scoring teams in the qualifying campaign was always set to see goals and Van Persie's brilliant strike 17 minutes from time breathed life into an ailing game.
