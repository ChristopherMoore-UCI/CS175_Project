The most important tool that law enforcement officers have at their disposal is common sense. The framers of the Constitution could never have imagined automobiles or cell phones. For instance, if the idea is to stop drivers from being distracted, then why stop at banning handheld cell phones? For now though, this is a major victory -- not just for one California motorist but for common sense. There is no argument that distracted driving can be just as dangerous as drunken driving, and so states have the right to pass laws that ban the practice of talking on the phone while driving.
