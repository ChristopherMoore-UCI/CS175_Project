A federal appeals court ruling that upholds a key portion of a Texas law will effectively close the doors on all but a handful of abortion clinics in the state, abortion rights groups say. The Center for Reproductive Rights sued Texas in April on behalf of a coalition of abortion clinics. Lauren Bean, spokeswoman for the Texas Attorney General's Office, said in a statement after the ruling, "This decision is a vindication of the careful deliberation by the Texas Legislature to craft a law to protect the health and safety of Texas women. "It is gravely disappointing that the 5th Circuit has put ideology above the law," said Heather Busby, Pro-Choice Texas Executive Director in a statement. Critics contend the law, in addition to eliminating abortion across huge swaths of the state, will further deny access to many women in rural communities and will force women to seek dangerous "back-alley" abortions.
