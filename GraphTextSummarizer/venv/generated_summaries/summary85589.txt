"We need to fight the organizations that are trafficking and smuggling people, so that we can prevent desperate people from leaving in desperate conditions," Mogherini said. "Faced with thousands of desperate people fleeing wars and crises, Europe has closed borders, forcing people in search of protection to risk their lives and die at sea," he said. Frontex has no vessels or surveillance equipment of its own, so has to rely on European member states to lend it ships. "We can't act as if each tragedy is the last while crossing our fingers that another one doesn't happen," Gozi told Le Monde, lamenting "a total absence" of European Union policy on how to deal with refugees arriving in Europe. On Monday, European Union ministers met in Luxembourg and proposed a 10-point plan to help address the crisis.
