Long said in a website statement that Murrieta "continues to object to the transfer of illegal immigrants to the local border patrol office," and he blamed the nation's immigration woes on "a failure to enforce federal law at the federal level." The first protests occurred Tuesday after the city and Mayor Alan Long posted on the city's website a notice stating that "Murrieta Opposes Illegal Immigrant Arrival." The migrants rejected by Murrieta protesters initially had been held in Texas, where U.S. facilities are overflowing, forcing detainees to be sent to other states for processing. For that, six protesters and counterprotesters got themselves arrested, Murrieta police said. The migrants had been expected to be processed at Murrieta's U.S. Border Patrol station, 75 miles north of the Mexican border, but federal officials declined Saturday to say where the buses took the migrants.
