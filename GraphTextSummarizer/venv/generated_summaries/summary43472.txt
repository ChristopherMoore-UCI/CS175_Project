A hotel worker is also seen in the video speaking to van der Sloot as he is leaving the hotel, Peru Interior Ministry spokesman Carlos Gonzalo said. -- -- A judge has extended the investigation into murder suspect Joran van der Sloot, accused of killing a Peruvian woman, for another week, a spokeswoman for Peru's Interior Ministry said Sunday. When investigators questioned the worker, he told them that van der Sloot told him "don't bother my girl," according to Gonzalo. The Embassy has told Peruvian authorities that it is not comfortable with the way van der Sloot has been presented to the media, Neyra said. Chilean authorities delivered van der Sloot to their Peruvian counterparts on Friday in the border town of Santa Rosa, where he was greeted by hecklers and dozens of media personnel jostling for position to get a better picture of him.
