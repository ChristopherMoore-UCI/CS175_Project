It's good for Romney that this wasn't the first debate, because Obama's performance was much stronger Tuesday night. Here are some examples of Obama quoting Romney. Obama used Romney's language against him time and time again, and it was effective. Early on he said Romney didn't have a five-point economic plan, but "a one-point plan" -- that "folks at the top play by a different set of rules." It was Romney's best moment of the debate.
