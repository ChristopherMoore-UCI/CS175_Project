Nearly two years ago, John Brennan worked hard to convince the Senate that he was no believer in torture -- and that if he was confirmed as CIA director, he wouldn't represent a return to George W. Bush-era tactics. Once Obama won, Brennan was considered a shoo-in for CIA director, but he withdrew his name amid criticism of his support for the use of torture in George W. Bush's administration. When the job of CIA director opened again in early 2013, Brennan was Obama's choice -- despite the concerns of left-leaning groups like the American Civil Liberties Union. I do not know what the truth is." He added: "There clearly were a number of things, many things, that I read in that report that were very concerning and disturbing to me, and ones that I would want to look into immediately, if I were to be confirmed as CIA director. The early portion of Brennan's evolution -- from a top CIA official in the Bush administration to a torture skeptic as he sought confirmation as the agency's director under Obama -- was on display at his confirmation hearing in 2013.
