On the other hand, public opinion in support of protecting gun rights has grown in recent decades, and in red states there has been a highly successful effort to deregulate guns. It seems ironic that the effort to block the introduction of such guns in the United States, so far successful, is led by organizations that advocate gun rights. There's no doubt Americans are worried about gun violence and support some proposals to keep guns away from potentially dangerous people. California, New York, and a handful of other states, altogether constituting one-quarter of the U.S. population, have regulations on gun design, transactions, possession or use that go well beyond federal requirements. Recent mass shootings have brought mental health experts and gun violence prevention advocates together to forge sensible approaches.
