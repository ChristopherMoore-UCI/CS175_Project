By car, the 600-mile journey along the coast between Tripoli and Libya's second city, Benghazi, takes around 12 hours. For first-time visitors, an itinerary based on Tripoli and Benghazi, with day excursions from each city and a connecting domestic flight, makes most sense. Leptis Magna and Sabratha are easy day trips from Tripoli; Cyrene is reached from Benghazi and with an early start can also be visited in a day. As well as recalcitrant camels, encroaching dunes, sand storms and wildly unpredictable driving conditions and drivers, the insecurity of postrevolutionary Libya demands travelers' full attention before any overland journey. More than half of that is concentrated in the just three cities -- Tripoli, Benghazi and Misrata.
