Both eastbound and westbound lanes were closed following the crashes, which began about 4 a.m. local time (5 a.m. ET), said Garry Flot, New Orleans police spokesman. -- Two people were killed and more than 50 others injured Thursday in a 40-car pileup that shut down Interstate 10 in eastern New Orleans, authorities said. Another 37 complained of minor injuries at the scene but refused medical care, Flot said. One firefighter suffered a cut on his face while performing his duties at the scene, Flot said. The area was experiencing heavy fog at the time the crashes occurred, according to CNN meteorologists.
