Bayern need 15 points to overhaul last year's record haul of 91 league points and win five of their last seven matches to better the mark of most wins (29, set last year) in a season. The Spanish manager, who steered Barcelona to three consecutive La Liga titles, has built on the foundations laid by former coach Jupp Heynckes who guided Bayern to the treble (Bundesliga, DFB Cup and Champions League) last season. " Guardiola's team still have plenty to play for with not just a Champions League title to defend -- they play Manchester United in the first leg of the quarterfinals on April 1 -- but more league records to try and break before the season finishes. Bayern Munich wrapped up the Bundesliga title in record time on Tuesday night with a 3-1 win over Hertha Berlin at the Olympic Stadium. Tuesday's win also sees Bayern extend their unbeaten run of league matches to 52 -- their last loss was against Bayer Leverkusen on October 28th 2012.
