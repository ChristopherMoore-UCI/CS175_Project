In his first public appearance since the "Beer Summit" at the White House, Harvard University professor Henry Louis Gates joked about his controversial arrest last month in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and said he likes police Sgt. James Crowley and professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. sit for beers with the president and vice president Thursday. Why not?" Gates had a face-to-face meeting and a beer with Crowley at the White House last week, a move orchestrated by President Obama in an attempt to defuse racial tensions that had erupted following Gates' arrest. Crowley arrested Gates on July 16 when the officer responded to a call of a possible home break-in at the Cambridge residence. But Gates, who is black, claimed he never raised his voice and accused Crowley of racial profiling.
