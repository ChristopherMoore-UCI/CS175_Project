While authorities have found her bike, authorities continued to search Monday for her body, Dunklin County Prosecuting Attorney Stephen Sokoloff said. The FBI, which earlier had a major role in the case, has passed off control of the investigation to local authorities following Morgan's arrest, FBI spokeswoman Rebecca Wu said. It says Morgan told police he put the girl's body into the same trash bag, and then drove to Missouri's Highway 164 and got rid of the body by throwing it over a railing into a floodway ditch. Shawn Morgan of Senath has been charged with first-degree murder in the death of Breeann Rodriguez. Sokoloff added -- and the Dunklin County court clerk's office confirmed -- that Morgan does not yet have an attorney.
