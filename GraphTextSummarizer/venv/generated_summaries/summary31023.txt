Polls earlier this year showed Sen. John McCain, the Republican presidential nominee, leading Obama, his Democratic rival, in Virginia by a healthy margin. " Virginia Democrats have been able to exploit the changes in the electorate into statewide electoral success after years in which the Republicans had a virtual lock on the state. The trend favoring the Democrats is expected to continue this year, which is expected to help drive Virginia Democrats to the polls. In fact, Virginia Republicans have not won a statewide race since Mark Warner, a former mobile phone company executive, captured the governorship for the Democrats in 2001 by emphasizing economic growth. Beside an advantage on the economy, Obama is also benefiting from a demographic shift that has reshaped Virginia politics.
