'Mother China' In Hong Kong, whenever the Chinese flag and the Hong Kong flag are flown side by side, the Chinese flag is always placed a little higher. But this should not deny a Hong Kong person the right to explain the difference between their city and other Chinese cities. It is a fact that Hong Kong is culturally and politically distinct from other Chinese cities. I believe the majority of Hong Kong people recognizes that Hong Kong cannot exist as an independent country. Under appropriate circumstances, Hong Kong people should be able to wear all our different hats with confidence and pride.
