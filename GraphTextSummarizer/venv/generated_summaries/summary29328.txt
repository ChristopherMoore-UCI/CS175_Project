In April this year in London, a group of prominent NGOs will launch a large civil society campaign to "Stop Killer Robots." Some have argued that robots could be more accurate on the battlefield than human soldiers and save more civilian lives. Yet a recent U.S. DoD directive (November 2012) gives a green light to research and development of autonomous weapons systems while presenting a cautious route to their deployment. Over the last few months there has been an increasing debate about the use of fully autonomous robot weapons: armed robots that once launched can select their own targets and kill them without further human intervention. Do you think autonomous robot weapons should be outlawed?
