His reputation might be that of Formula One's ruthless wheeler dealer, but come the season of goodwill Bernie Ecclestone likes to show a different side to his character. "This is not a robbery, I am collecting for the Bavarian state," says the man on horseback while a cartoon figure of Ecclestone is seen clutching the sack of money. Money has often been a theme of previous Ecclestone's Christmas cards. The card showed Hamilton jumping into a Mercedes car driven by Niki Lauda, with the passenger seat containing a large bag marked with a dollar sign. Reigning world champion Lewis Hamilton was the butt of the F1 chief's humor in 2012 after the driver's surprise switch from McLaren to Mercedes.
