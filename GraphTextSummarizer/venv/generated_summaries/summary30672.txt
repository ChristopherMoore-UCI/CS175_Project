He urges men with sexual dysfunction to avoid sexual health supplements altogether. While it's true that men may seek out natural remedies for sexual dysfunction because they believe they are safer and gentler than their conventional counterparts, it's my experience that some men may be using these supplements as way to avoid discussing sexual issues with their physicians or because they are too embarrassed to fill the prescription at their local pharmacy. Even more disturbing, such supplements may contain analogues, or chemical variants, of prescription drugs like Viagra. According to a recent article in the New York Times, a 2011 survey by Pfizer found that 80% of pills sold online as "Viagra" were counterfeit drugs that only contained about 30% to 50% of the active ingredient sildenafil. Unfortunately, when you take a sexual enhancement supplement, you have no real way of knowing whether that product is adulterated with PDE-5 inhibitors or other drugs that could have harmful effects when used without supervision.
