Lance Bass, J.C. Chasez, Joey Fatone and Chris Kirkpatrick came together for a brief walk down memory lane to sing "Girlfriend" and "Bye Bye Bye." Timberlake might have tied with Macklemore and Lewis for most Video Music Awards with three Moonmen each, but only one of them had a 20 minute chunk of the show devoted to him. The hip-hop duo took home three Moonmen, including one for "Best Video with a Social Message" for "Same Love." When One Direction presented Selena Gomez with "Best Pop Video" for "Come and Get It," cameras caught a glimpse of Swift allegedly mouthing the words, "Shut the f--- up" . After vowing to keep a stronger grip on the mic this time, Swift proudly claimed her award for Best Female Video for "I Knew You Were Trouble." The multi-hyphenate earned a standing ovation as he sang and danced his way through his hits starting with the new "Take Back the Night" and working backward to the worst-kept secret in Hollywood: Timberlake and his former boy band brethren 'N SYNC reunited on stage.
