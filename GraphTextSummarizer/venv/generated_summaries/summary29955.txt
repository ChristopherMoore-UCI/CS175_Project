Supermarkets and non-specialist stores are expected to make up some of the 10% of sales Conlumino predicts will still be made in store by 2014. HMV has invested in the online market, selling music from HMV.com and in 2009 buying a 50% stake in smaller digital company 7Digital -- but analysts believe the company left its run too late. In a 2012 report, the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) said CD and other physical recorded music sales had dropped from 145.8 million units in 2007 to 92.1 million in 2011 -- a slump of more than 20%. Matt Piner -- retail research director for research agency Conlumino -- says HMV "failed to keep up" and that by the time the company focused on online sales the key players had already been established. Similarly, France is looking at why multinationals are able to avoid paying sales tax when selling to French consumers.
