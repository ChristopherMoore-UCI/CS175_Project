Stevie Wonder says he'll boycott 'stand your ground' states The Florida version of the law states, "A person who is not engaged in an unlawful activity and who is attacked in any other place where he or she has a right to be has no duty to retreat and has the right to stand his or her ground and meet force with force, including deadly force if he or she reasonably believes it is necessary to do so to prevent death or great bodily harm to himself or herself or another or to prevent the commission of a forcible felony." Eight other states have laws worded similarly, while 22 total states, including Florida, have laws stating that residents have no "duty" to retreat from a would-be attacker, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Overturning laws isn't incredibly common already, and with "stand your ground," there are complicating factors. A call for reforms On Thursday, Florida officials joined state House Democratic Leader Perry Thurston in urging that reforms be made to the controversial law. The study cited concerns from law enforcement officials, including doubts that it would deter criminals. The protesters will call for federal civil rights charges against Zimmerman.
