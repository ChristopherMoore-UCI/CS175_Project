"This does not mean forgoing our right to peaceful use of nuclear power and production of nuclear fuel," he said. "A bitter irony of our era is that the U.S. government, which possesses the largest and deadliest stockpiles of nuclear arms and other weapons of mass destruction and the only country guilty of its use, is today eager to carry the banner of opposition to nuclear proliferation," he said. "On the basis of international laws, peaceful use of nuclear energy is a right of every country." Earlier at the summit, Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei defended his country's right to produce nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. Speaking at the Non-Aligned Summit in Tehran, the U.N. leader didn't mention the Iranian regime, but Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has made a string of incendiary remarks in recent years about Israel's existence and the Nazi Germany extermination of Jews last century.
