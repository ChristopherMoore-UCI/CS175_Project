For my first dinner, I went to the Berghoff (17 W. Adams St.), a German restaurant near Millennium Park downtown. Chicago locals seem extremely proud of the presence of their city in last summer's Batman hit, "The Dark Knight." Museum: The famous Art Institute of Chicago (111 S. Michigan Ave.) has enough rooms of artwork to keep a person exploring for days; unfortunately, I got there just before it closed at 5 p.m. Still, it was worth a peek. Lincoln Park, a trendy area north of downtown, has a slew of bars that cater to the young and the young at heart. In 15 minutes, you can see the impressive gallery of Impressionists, including Renoir and Monet, and dash through to some of the nearby rooms to glimpse medieval religious art.
