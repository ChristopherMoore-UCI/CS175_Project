Harding has served as CEO of Harding Security Associates, a defense and intelligence government contracting firm he founded in 2003 and sold in July 2009. In September, Obama nominated Erroll Southers, a Los Angeles airport police department official, to the head the agency. But Republican Sen. Jim DeMint, R-South Carolina, spearheaded GOP efforts to block the nomination based on concerns Southers would unionize airport screeners. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano announced the nomination with Harding by her side. The TSA was created in the months after the September 11, 2001, attacks and soon took over security at the nation's airports, including screening commercial airline passengers and luggage.
