Lattanzi, who said the museum has a collection of more than 20 similar arrowheads -- more technically termed projectile points -- called Noah's find "rare." He said that most similar arrowheads have been excavated from archaeological sites in the northeastern United States rather than washing ashore. Andrea and her husband, Brian Cordle, turned to Greg Lattanzi, the assistant curator at the Bureau of Archaeology and Ethnography at the New Jersey State Museum. "A couple of people told us they didn't think it was real," Noah's mother, Andrea Cordle, said of the find, which she described as being about 2Â½ inches long and black with a small fleck of orange along a ridge on its side. "It felt like a crab, so I jumped backward," said Cordle, who was vacationing with his family in Beach Haven. -- Ten-year-old Noah Cordle kicked off his summer vacation by dipping his toes into the Atlantic Ocean, only to make an ancient discovery when a sharp object hit his foot.
