Having waited 18 years to get their hands on the Copa del Rey -- or King's Cup -- trophy, defender Sergio Ramos made worldwide headlines by dropping it under the open-top bus carrying his teammates on a victory parade through the Spanish capital. After the mishap, Spanish World Cup winner Ramos used social media website Twitter to reassure fans and say the trophy was undamaged. -- As far as celebrations go, it was hardly the most fitting end to a night of joy for Real Madrid football fans. "When (the federation in charge of Spanish football) organizes an event as important as this one, there is always a Plan B," he told Spanish radio station CadenaSER. The triumphant players had returned home immediately from Valencia after beating arch-rivals Barcelona 1-0 in extra time in the final of the country's knockout competition on Wednesday night.
