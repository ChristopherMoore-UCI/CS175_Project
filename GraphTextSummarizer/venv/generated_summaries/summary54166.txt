Perhaps the most honest assessment of the whole Cindy Crawford uproar came from a co-worker who shall remain nameless. I must admit it was refreshing, though, to read the many, many comments from women around the world taking comfort in the imperfect Cindy. Shortly after that unaltered picture of Crawford hit the Internet, Rande Gerber shared a picture of his bikini-clad wife lounging by the pool. We all know you don't actually believe real women sell magazines. Everybody keeps telling me Cindy Crawford -- who always looked unreal -- is suddenly "real" because an unretouched photo of her leaked on Twitter.
