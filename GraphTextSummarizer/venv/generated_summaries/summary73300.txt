Last fall TV season a plethora of shows burst onto the small screen with leading gay characters in everything from comedies to musical dramas. He said diversity of characters goes beyond race and gender and means having gay characters of various ages and socioeconomic backgrounds. But Hayes will not be among as big a crowd of gay leading characters on broadcast television as he would have been had his show premiered last year. Kane said there are some bright spots in the upcoming broadcast TV season, including returning LGBT characters on shows like "Glee," the aforementioned "Modern Family" and "Grey's Anatomy." "So it's a real opportunity for people to meet LGBT people in the comfort of their homes or the darkness of a theater to have an emotional experience and really understand the lives of LGBT people."
