Graham spent time reading the Bible and praying with his daughter, Gigi, Wednesday night, spokesman A. Larry Ross said on Twitter. "It was a blessing to Mr. Graham to realize his preaching still reaches around the world," said Ross, "and even into hospital rooms like his." " "Given the outpouring of love and well-wishes Mr. Graham has received from people around the world, the verse seemed to have special meaning to him," Ross said. "While no date has been set for discharge, Mr. Graham is looking forward to returning home to spend the upcoming Christmas holidays with his family." Ross said Graham was visited Thursday by his pastor, the Rev. Don Wilton, who shared a passage from the book of Ephesians: "For this reason, ever since I heard about your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all God's people, I have not stopped giving thanks for you, remembering you in my prayers. When Graham was admitted Wednesday for evaluation of his lungs, "he was alert, smiling and waving at hospital staff," the hospital said.
