Investigators say 45 men, women and children were killed in Acteal by people who suspected they had links to the Zapatista Army of National Liberation, a group that launched a rebellion against the Mexican state in January 1994. The 20 were convicted for taking part in a massacre in the community of Acteal, in the southern state of Chiapas. Mexican Mayan Indian massacre survivors reenact the killings of 45 people in Acteal village in this 2003 photo. "It's obvious that the evidence was obtained illegally," said Judge Jose de Jesus Gudino. It was nearly four years after that rebellion, on December 22, 1997, that the 45 unarmed indigenous peasants were massacred in Acteal.
