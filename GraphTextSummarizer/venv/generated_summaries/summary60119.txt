An independent water test conducted at CNN's request found trace levels of MCHM earlier this week, both in untreated river water and in tap water from two homes in Charleston. The lingering smell of licorice closed several schools around Charleston, West Virginia, on Thursday, nearly a month after a chemical spill that left more than a quarter million people without water. The complaints came as the schools were trying to flush their water lines to get rid of discolored water after a main broke nearby, she said. Jordan said some smell and discoloration can be expected as water lines are flushed out. The chemical, used to clean coal to reduce ash, leaked into the Elk River and from there into Charleston's water supply on January 9.
