In addition to the AMIA attack, a similar deadly anti-Semitic terrorist attack took place on March 17, 1992, when 29 people died and more than 250 were injured in a bombing at the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires. Lifschitz, who has also worked as a lawyer for Argentine Federal Police, is the former legal secretary for Judge Juan Jose Galeano, who headed the investigation into local connections to the AMIA bombing until he was removed from the case. "We trust Argentine authorities will quickly find those who carried out this brutal attack on Mr. Lifschitz," said David Harris, executive director of the American Jewish Committee. "They started to ask about information about the SIDE (State Intelligence Secretariat) related to the AMIA attack," Lifschitz told CNN. Eighty-five people died and more than 200 were injured in one of the bloodiest anti-Semitic attacks in the world since World War II.
