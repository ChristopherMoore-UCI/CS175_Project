It can be counterintuitive -- and frightening -- to add chemical dispersants to fight oil spills. Based on our experience studying oil spills in the Gulf of Mexico and elsewhere, that's a biased and incomplete understanding that may unduly influence decision-makers responsible for responding to future spills. -- A rash of recent oil spills around the globe -- Bangladesh, Israel, Peru and New Zealand -- serve as reminders of the damage such spills can cause and of the important role responders can play in limiting such damage. Spill responders have several tools at their disposal, including chemical dispersants. What is lost on many people is that spill responders must decide quickly on whether to apply dispersants.
