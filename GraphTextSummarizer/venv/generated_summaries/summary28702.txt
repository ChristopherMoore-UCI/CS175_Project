" Ronaldo has this season has helped take United to within touching distance of a second successive Premier League title with two matches to play, and into a Champions League final against Chelsea in Moscow on May 21. He topped the writers' poll ahead of Liverpool striker Fernando Torres and Portsmouth goalkeeper David James. "Ronaldo's award is no surprise after his brilliant form this season and incredible goal-scoring record -- 38 at the moment -- and he is, of course, essentially a winger," said chairman of the FWA, Paul Hetherington. He will receive his award at the FWA's gala dinner at the Royal Lancaster Hotel in London on May 15. The Portugal winger followed up his second successive victory in the Professional Footballers' Association awards, where he was voted Player of the Year by his peers on April 27.
