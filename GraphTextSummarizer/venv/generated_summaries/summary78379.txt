Garland's daughter Liza Minelli, then 17, was a guest, along with many other entertainment legends: Tony Bennett, Lena Horne, Peggy Lee, Count Basie, Mickey Rooney, Ethel Merman, Bob Newhart, Donald O'Connor, Steve Allen, Jane Powell, Peter Lawford, Vic Damone and Jack Jones. "This would be a great Christmas gift for somebody," said Darryl Payne, a music producer who bought the rights in 1998 from Sam Luft, Garland's former husband. "You get Judy Garland," Payne said. While clips of the series have been licensed over the years, the episodes have not been shown on television since the series was canceled in March 1964, Payne said. The new owner could also license the series for streaming online or downloading, Payne said.
