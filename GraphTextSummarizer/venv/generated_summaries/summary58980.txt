It was the latter that showed up when Perry addressed the National Right to Life conference in Grapevine, Texas, near Dallas, a few days after Davis' filibuster. Obviously still smarting from the setback, Perry fired off these condescending remarks: "Who are we to say that children born in the worst of circumstances can't grow to live successful lives? The Democrats' victory in the legislature is credited to Sen. Wendy Davis, who staged an 11-hour filibuster to push the debate past the stroke of midnight and the end of a special session. What this is about is making sure that women across the state of Texas have the same opportunity to make those choices and have the same chances that I had." Davis got it right. The campaign ad writes itself: "Davis bravely stood up to the Republican majority, and backed them down."
