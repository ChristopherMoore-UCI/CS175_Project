The three individuals Kluwe referred to are Mike Priefer, the Vikings special teams coach; former head coach Leslie Frazier and Vikings General Manager Rick Spielman. Kluwe said that after the Vikings drafted Locke in April he knew he was done with the team so he kept notes of his interactions with team officials. The Vikings said in a statement Thursday: "Any notion that Chris was released from our football team due to his stance on marriage equality is entirely inaccurate and inconsistent with team policy. Chris Kluwe said Monday he is encouraged the NFL team is looking into his claims that he was released in May because he is an LGBT activist. He said speaking publicly about team matters was, in this case, like throwing a stick of dynamite on a bridge -- one that can never be crossed again.
