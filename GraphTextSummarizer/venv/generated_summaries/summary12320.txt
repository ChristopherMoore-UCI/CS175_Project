Even though Jamaicans Usain Bolt and Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce were named male and female athletes of the year, respectively, by track and field's governing body last week, ex world-record holder Asafa Powell and Sherone Simpson made the wrong type of headlines when they admitted to testing positive for banned substances in July. Members of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) examined JADCO's operations last month and Headley said Jamaica would give its "full support" to stiffer revisions to the WADA code expected to come into play in 2015. -- The board of Jamaica's Anti-Doping Commission (JADCO) resigned after several of the Caribbean nation's sprinters were caught cheating earlier this year and a former head of the body highlighted a lack of testing. Jamaica's minister responsible for sport, Natalie Neita Headley, announced the news while also saying her country vowed to step up the fight against drug cheats. "At no time has WADA ever deemed Jamaica or JADCO to be non-compliant," Headley said.
