In the Ecuadorian city of Guayaquil, the organization had a cell comprised of members from Colombia, Ecuador and Mexico, who used various houses to gather and store drugs before shipping them to Mexico and the United States, the federal police said. Federal police captured Victor Manuel Felix, alias "El Senor," who worked for the Sinaloa cartel and was the leader of one of its financial networks, anti-drug police chief Ramon Eduardo Pequeno said. Police from Mexico, Ecuador and Colombia worked jointly in the investigation that led to the arrests, Pequeno said. The Mexican federal police investigation revealed those arrested participated in international drug trafficking and organized crime, police said. The agency conducted undercover operations that led to the discovery of the details of the illegal activities in Ecuador and Mexico.
