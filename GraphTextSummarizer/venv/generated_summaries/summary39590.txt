"We are preparing to make this as smooth a transition as we can," Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said this week. "The initial contact point for the Obama transition team will be through the White House, and there will be a discussion on the way forward on the transition, and what will happen out of that will be a memorandum of understanding that says, 'these people will be working with the Defense Department,' so we know who has been sanctioned and designated by the president-elect," Whitman said. -- Pentagon officials have begun preparing for the first transfer of power during war since Vietnam. " Teams in Gates' office and that of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Mike Mullen, have been working on the transition for months, according to Pentagon officials. The Pentagon has opened offices for Obama's transition staff.
