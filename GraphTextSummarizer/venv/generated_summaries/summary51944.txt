The only other justice who has even a modicum of criminal justice experience is Justice Breyer, whose exposure to criminal law as an architect of the federal sentencing guidelines was not to victims and criminals but to data and number crunchers. Editor's note: Anthony S. Barkow prosecuted federal and local crime for 12 years in the U.S. attorney's offices for the Southern District of New York and for the District of Columbia and is now the executive director of the Center on the Administration of Criminal Law at New York University School of Law. But Alito was never a local prosecutor and has deep exposure only to federal criminal law. Federal criminal cases make up only about 6 percent of all criminal cases, and they typically involve complex white-collar crimes and large-scale narcotics trafficking. For that matter, no one on the Supreme Court served on a federal district court, the trial courts in the federal system that see federal criminal cases up close.
