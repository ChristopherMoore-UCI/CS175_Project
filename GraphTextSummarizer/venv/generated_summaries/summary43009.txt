The same posters adorn storefronts and bulletin boards in banks, restaurants and post offices throughout Okfuskee County, a sparsely populated manufacturing region best known as the birthplace of songwriter Woody Guthrie. Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation spokesperson Jessica Brown said during a press conference Monday that authorities have "good evidence" in the case but lack the final piece to make an arrest. "If we could get this one piece of evidence that would help solve this case, that's what we need," Brown said Monday. She stressed Monday that a $36,000 reward is being offered for information that leads to a conviction. The incident stripped the small, close-knit community of its innocence as people came to realize that they weren't safe, Rice said.
