" 4 options for the U.S. to get Snowden back The documents Snowden has revealed so far -- he claims to have thousands more -- revealed classified details of U.S. programs to monitor domestic telephone traffic, as well as the activities of Internet users overseas. Edward Snowden took a job with a firm that provides contractors to the National Security Agency solely to gather evidence about U.S. surveillance programs, the self-avowed leaker told the South China Morning Post Newspaper. He has also said the National Security Agency hacks into major Internet pipelines to intercept millions of communications flowing through them each day. The anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks, which is aiding his efforts to find a haven from U.S. espionage charges, said he had traveled to Moscow, but he has not been publicly sighted there, except for an airline passenger who identified a picture of him. Read Snowden's interview "If I have time to go through this information, I would like to make it available to journalists in each country to make their own assessment, independent of my bias, as to whether or not the knowledge of US network operations against their people should be published," the newspaper quoted him as saying.
