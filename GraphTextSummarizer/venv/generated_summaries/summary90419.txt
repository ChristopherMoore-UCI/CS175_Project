To help address other life-threatening conditions, such as influenza, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and senior abuse, the event also included a health fair, an immunization clinic and demonstrations on "cane-fu fighting," a method of self-defense that makes use of seniors' canes to ward off attackers. A fall -- or, worse, a broken bone that limits a senior's mobility -- can be the start of a downward spiral that ends up taking a life, says Dr. Sheldon Zinberg, founder of a senior fitness center called Nifty After Fifty. Aside from a seniors-gone-wild moment, this event served a very important purpose: to encourage seniors to get stronger and fitter, possibly saving them from life-altering injuries. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, falls are the leading cause of injury-related death in seniors. Falls are among many concerns for seniors.
