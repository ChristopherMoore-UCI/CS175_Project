Mourners gathered Wednesday in Copenhagen for the funeral of Jewish community member Dan Uzan, killed in a weekend terror rampage that also targeted a free speech forum in the Danish capital. A 55-year-old man was killed in that shooting, named by the Danish Film Institute as director Finn Noergaard. Large numbers attended Uzan's funeral, held at the Mosaiske Vestre Jewish cemetery in Copenhagen amid heightened security. Uzan, 37, was providing security for a bat mitzvah party taking place behind a Copenhagen synagogue when the gunman struck. He was killed early Sunday in a shootout with police outside a Copenhagen apartment building.
