For some customers, it is rising energy prices as much as concern for the environment that is prompting them to consider solar power for their homes and businesses. "We did have a lot of skeptical, raised eyebrows at the beginning," Jones said of his company, which installs solar power systems in Colorado. One percent of yearly revenues goes to solar systems donated to community groups. In the past 3Â½ years, Namaste has installed more solar systems than any other company in Colorado. Typical home solar systems cost about $12,000 up front, but supporters say they pay off in the long run.
