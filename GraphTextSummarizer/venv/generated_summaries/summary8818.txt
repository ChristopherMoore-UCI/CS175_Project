Southern China already had been battling severe flooding that killed 146 people over the past two weeks, destroyed about 113,000 homes and forced more than 1.2 million people to relocate this month, state media said Friday. The storm, which killed at least 39 people during its westward march across the Philippines this week, had maximum sustained winds of 112 kph (70 mph) Saturday, according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center. Along with the rising death toll, the Philippines' National Disaster Coordinating Council said Friday that 84 people were missing. Conson is forecast to move through the Gulf of Tonkin on Saturday, making a final landfall in northern Vietnam, near Hanoi, in the afternoon, according to CNN World Weather. At one point Friday morning, the storm's winds reached 139 kph (86 mph), making it the equivalent of a Category 1 hurricane when it reached China.
