"It's about damn time," James told NBA.com upon receiving the award, which was handed to him by NBA legend Bill Russell. -- Three-time league MVP LeBron James finally has an NBA championship to add to his belt, after the Miami Heat defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder 121-106 in game five of the 2012 NBA Finals. "We had to go through last year," Wade said of the team's loss in last year's NBA Finals. The Thunder, who kicked off the series with a big win against the Heat at home, lost games two and three by just a handful of points in the finals minutes of each game. A triple-double, as well as strong performances in each of the previous games earned James the coveted title of Most Valuable Player (MVP).
