"The FSA views market manipulation extremely seriously," said Alexander Justham, director of markets at the FSA. Steven Noel Perkins, a former oil futures broker in the London office of PVM Oil Futures, was also fined Â£72,000 ($108,400) for market abuse, the Financial Services Authority (FSA) said. Perkins' job was to trade orders on an execution-only basis in Brent crude futures contracts on the ICE Futures Europe (ICE) exchange for his firm's clients, the FSA said. Britain's financial regulator said Wednesday it has banned an oil trader after he made huge trades while drunk last year, causing global prices of Brent crude to jump to abnormally high levels. In sanctioning Perkins, the FSA said it also took into account the fact that Perkins initially lied repeatedly to his employer to try to cover up his unauthorized trading.
