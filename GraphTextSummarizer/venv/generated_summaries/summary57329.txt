The raid is part of a two-year investigation into a compound near Texarkana, Arkansas, owned by Tony Alamo Christian Ministries, said Bill Sadler of the Arkansas State Police. In addition to FBI agents and Arkansas state police, officials with the state Department of Human Services participated in the raid at the church property in the town of Fouke, about 12 miles from Texarkana. Alamo is well-known in Arkansas, said Lynn LaRowe, a reporter with the Texarkana Gazette. "It's not very rare to come out of any baseball game to find Alamo literature on your car," LaRowe said. -- Federal and state police raided an evangelist's compound in Arkansas late Saturday to investigate whether any children have been physically or sexually abused, officials said.
