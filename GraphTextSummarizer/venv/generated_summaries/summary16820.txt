"It takes a while to learn," Johnson said of his newfound maturity, having carded a second successive six-under-par 66 to clinch his second PGA Tour title this year and first of the new 2013-14 season. " Poulter, who also closed with 66 after a 63 on Saturday, moved up to fourth in the European Tour's Race to Dubai standings -- WGC events, like majors, count for points on both main circuits. U.S. Open champion Justin Rose was two shots back after a 68, just ahead of former world No. 1 Rory McIlroy and Canada's Graham DeLaet (both 69). " Johnson has already gone close twice, having led by three shots going into the final round of the 2010 U.S. Open before blowing up and then missing out on a playoff at the following year's PGA Championship after getting a two-shot penalty at the last hole. The big-hitting 29-year-old claimed the $1.2 million first prize at the HSBC Champions in Shanghai on Sunday, winning his first World Golf Championships title by three shots after a sizzling finish.
