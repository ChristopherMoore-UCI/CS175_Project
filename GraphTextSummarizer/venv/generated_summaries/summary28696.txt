Two lawsuits say the national chapter of the Phi Kappa Tau fraternity allowed a culture of "violent misogyny" after an internal email from the Georgia Tech chapter leaked last year instructing fraternity members on how to lure "rapebait." The lawsuits were filed Thursday in an Atlanta court on behalf of two anonymous women -- listed as Jane Doe and June Doe -- alleging they were sexually assaulted in separate incidents in 2012 and 2014 at the Georgia Tech chapter fraternity house based on a fraternity playbook for targeting women. "The Fraternity is disappointed that the plaintiffs' attorney chose to exploit the hypersensitivity of today's college environment towards sexual assault by drafting the complaints in a manner that sensationalizes completely inappropriate statements, while at the same time alleging that a Georgia Tech student committed criminal rapes of two different women. The school's chapter was disbanded for three years over accusations of sexual assault in March, Georgia Tech said. Georgia Tech, which wasn't named as a defendant in the lawsuits, had no comment on the litigation.
