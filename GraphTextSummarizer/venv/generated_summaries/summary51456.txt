Obama said Tuesday that he had ordered "concrete steps to protect the American people, new screening and security for all flights, domestic and international, more explosive detection teams at airports, more air marshals on flights and deepening cooperation with international partners." Additional federal air marshals are needed for high-priority international flights, with other law enforcement personnel filling in on key domestic flights, another source noted. The federal government is scrambling to find ways to comply with President Obama's order to put more air marshals on flights after a botched Christmas Day airline terrorist attack, government sources have told CNN. Internal notices issued Monday and Wednesday by the Department of Homeland Security ask employees to step up to train as air marshals and to serve at U.S. diplomatic posts abroad. Another source said marshals could be drawn from Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
