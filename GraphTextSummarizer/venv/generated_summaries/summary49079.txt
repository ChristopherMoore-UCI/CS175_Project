Holder said Hannah and her family had "provided a model for how a potential tragedy can be turned into an opportunity" to pass a law strengthening protection of stalking victims. -- Illinois teenager Hannah Perryman lived in fear for years until the young stalker who tormented and threatened her was finally convicted. Because the case was adjudicated in juvenile court, many of the specifics remain under seal, and Illinois officials and Hannah's family and supporters won't talk about many details. There are no available figures on juvenile stalking victims. Authorities stressed the individual acts may not be criminal, but collectively if they cause real fear they can violate the law, and courts can order protections for victims of any age.
