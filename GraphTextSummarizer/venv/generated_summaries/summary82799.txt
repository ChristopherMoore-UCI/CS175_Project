Miami Beach police said officers spotted the South Florida artist, whose real name is Tramar Dillard, driving his 2008 Bugatti erratically in the early morning hours. "Until we have an opportunity to meet with our client and conduct our own investigation into the facts, we are declining further comment on this matter," said a statement from his attorneys, Christopher Lyons and Sandy Becher. According to the arrest report, Dillard swerved in and out of lanes about five times and drove for another two blocks after the responding officer activated his emergency lights and air horn. Officers administered a field sobriety test, during which Dillard said, "Officer, I can't do this," and "I don't feel like I can walk a straight line." Dillard said, "I had a few drinks," according to the report.
