Then there's the race in Kentucky, where Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes holds a lead of 4 percentage points over Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. The media focus on 2016 is like a "Rocky Horror Picture Show," without Rocky. In Georgia, which has been a Deep South Republican stronghold -- since 2010, they've held every statewide office -- Michelle Nunn, daughter of former Sen. Sam Nunn, stands a good chance of becoming another woman senator -- and a Democratic one. But the game is changing, thanks to a couple of dynamic women candidates. A presidential run would risk that popularity -- and the legacy she's built as a senator and secretary of state (not to mention former first lady).
