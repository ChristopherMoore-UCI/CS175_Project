St. Louis officials urged Galleria retailers to close security gates after several hundred protesters entered the mall and disrupted shopping. Brown, the teenager, was black; Officer Darren Wilson, who shot him, is white. Protesters chanted, "Hands up, don't shop," while others lay on the floor in a "die-in." If supporters did shop, they were told to take their money to black-owned businesses, some of which were listed on social media. Activists were calling for students to walk out of school and employees to walk off the job nationwide Monday to protest police violence. At the University of Nevada-Las Vegas, protesters planned a die-in at the student union, while demonstrators in Illinois were asking students and employees along the Chicago Loop to walk out of school and work together, to name a few of the planned demonstrations.
