"One of India's greatest Test Captains under whose leadership India became the No. 1 team in the Test Rankings MS Dhoni, has decided to retire from Test Cricket citing the strain of playing all formats of Cricket," said the statement. In a statement, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), said that Dhoni made the decision to retire from Tests "in order to concentrate" on one-day and Twenty20 cricket. "BCCI while respecting the decision of MS Dhoni to retire from Test Cricket, wishes to thank him for his enormous contribution to Test Cricket and the laurels that he has brought to India. Dhoni, who made his debut in 2005, captained India in 60 of his 90 Test matches but decided to quit on Tuesday following the draw with Australia in Melbourne which meant his side conceded the series. That should not detract from a stellar career in which Dhoni has become India's highest earning sports star.
