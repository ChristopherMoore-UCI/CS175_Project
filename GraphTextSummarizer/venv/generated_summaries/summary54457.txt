Women pilots honored 65 years after World War II service First lady Eleanor Roosevelt was an early supporter of the program, writing in a September 1942 newspaper column: "This is not a time when women should be patient. "The combination of the two was just enough to kill this fairly radical idea of bringing women into the military as pilots," Landdeck said. "And at the same time, you have a group of male pilots who are very actively opposing the women becoming part of the military because they want to do the WASP jobs rather than being shipped overseas -- particularly to Japan, which is where they were going to be most needed." Inspired in part by a 2010 float honoring the Tuskegee Airmen, a group of WASP participants and supporters raised nearly $200,000 to build the Rose Parade float to highlight the wartime contributions of these trailblazing women. "We want the WASP to know that the work that they did during the war -- and the work they've done since in representing women who served as pilots -- that legacy lives on," she said.
