Most parents are inundated with the message that they should limit screen time at all costs and take away the phone if their teens and tweens misbehave. We need to stop taking away the phone so much and start teaching tweens and teens how to responsibly use and thoughtfully live with their phones. Parents, researchers and educators are beginning to get the message about flexibility and fear but we have a way to go in understanding identity and privacy. It stresses that human interaction and play are critical to development but screen time that is interactive and cooperative also has its benefits. There will be screen time and hopefully it will be limited, thoughtfully chosen, interactive and collaborative.
