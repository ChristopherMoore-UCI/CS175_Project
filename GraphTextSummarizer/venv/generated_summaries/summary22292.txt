A Delta representative at the Mexico City airport told Allen that Paco's dog carrier was too small, Allen said. A Delta spokeswoman, Susan Elliot, said Paco broke out of a dog carrier at the airport in Mexico City, Mexico, on May 3. Josiah Allen says his dog, Paco, didn't make it home when he flew recently from Mexico to his home in Seaforth, Canada. "I am hopeful that Delta will be able ... to locate and retrieve Paco and that he can come to my home and be loved and cared for," Allen said. Allen said he signed the waiver because Paco had slept in the crate for three nights with no problems.
