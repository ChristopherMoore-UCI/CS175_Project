Gigi Chao said her father, property developer Cecil Chao Sze-tsung, "loves her very much" and she was aware of the cash offer before it was first reported Tuesday by local Hong Kong media. The tycoon's offer came after Chinese media reports last week that she married another woman, her long-time companion Sean Eav, in a civil ceremony in Paris last week. The 76-year-old tycoon himself has never married, and has long earned a reputation on the pages of local newspapers and magazines in the arms of beautiful women, having once bragged of having had 10,000 girlfriends, the South China Morning Post reported. Gigi Chao is an executive director of Cheuk Nang Holdings, a luxury property development company run by her father. Asked by CNN to confirm her civil union, Chao said she was "not in a position to verify that." Her father, however, was unequivocal, telling CNN "reports of Gigi being married is not true, it's a rumor."
