" Determined to help other families deal with the same obstacles that he had faced, Wing-Kovarik started a nonprofit, Families Like Ours. That child sitting in foster care year after year after year is not going to their social worker and saying, 'I only want a mom-and-dad home.' Families Like Ours does it through donations and grants, and he hasn't been paid in years. "It's unacceptable that families are faced with barriers that are put in their way because of a myth, a misunderstanding, miscommunication ... preventing a child from having a family just because (other people) just don't like what that family looks like. But it was a long, arduous and invasive process, one that scares off many other potential parents, Wing-Kovarik said.
