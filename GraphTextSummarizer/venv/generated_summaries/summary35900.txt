Besides military training we had to undergo intensive political education and watch the news on government-run TV. In the evening I was faxing signed sheets to opposition leaders in Prague. Life in Czechoslovakia was not free. I was five when Czechoslovakia was invaded by Soviet troops. They traveled on occasional business trips to the West and smuggled banned books by Vaclav Havel, Alexander Solzhenitsyn or George Orwell back to Czechoslovakia, an act that could have landed them in prison.
