The former personal assistant of Adam Clayton of the Irish rock band U2 was sentenced Friday to seven years in prison for stealing 2.8 million euros (about $3.45 million) of Clayton's money. Jurors were told that Hawkins was a signatory on two of Clayton's bank accounts and wrote 181 checks to deposit into her own accounts. " "Nothing, frankly, could explain away the scale of this dishonesty other than the greed in pursuit of a lavish lifestyle that was no responsibility of Mr. Clayton's," the judge said. The judge also ordered that the proceeds of a sale of an apartment in New York bought by Hawkins be handed over to Clayton. Carol Hawkins, 49, was convicted last week of 181 counts of theft from Clayton's bank accounts over a four-year period while she worked for him.
