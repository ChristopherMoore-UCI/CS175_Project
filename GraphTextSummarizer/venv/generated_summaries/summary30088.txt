That's not a bad thing; as we reported in our original reviews of Tweetie 2 and Tweetie 2.1, Tweetie is one of the best Twitter experiences for any platform and, in our opinion, was the winning app on the iPhone by a wide margin. This means that the three hottest smartphone platforms all have official Twitter clients. You can sign up for a Twitter account within the app itself, complete with Suggested User List. If you never used Tweetie, we highly recommend downloading Twitter for iPhone. What is your favorite Twitter client for the iPhone?
