A Seattle police officer shot and killed John T. Williams, described as belonging to a First Nations Tribe, on August 30. Last month, the Justice Department launched a federal investigation of the police department for possible excessive use of force and discriminatory policing. Perez said the probe will be much narrower than a similar investigation of the New Orleans Police Department, but noted Seattle and New Orleans have both fully cooperated with federal authorities. They said rather than seeking to resolve any specific cases, the "pattern or practice" investigation will focus on Seattle police systems of enforcement and on policy changes that may need to be made. -- The city of Seattle will pay $1.5 million to the family of a man who was fatally shot by a police officer last year.
