According to Mashable, digital media producer Benjamin Savard was working on a video for the science department at Middlebury College in Vermont on Monday when he put a GoPro in a waterproof case inside an octopus tank. From battling water creatures to lions opening car doors, animals have taken center stage on social media. Finally, our beloved quokkas, a type of rodent, are the new stars of Instagram as folks in Australia clamor for selfies. The octopus grabbed it, took some selfies and then snapped a shot of Savard. A video from 2014 gained attention this week, showing a lion opening the car door of a family driving through a safari park in South Africa.
