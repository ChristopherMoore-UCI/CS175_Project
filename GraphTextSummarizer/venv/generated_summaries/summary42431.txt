A recent study that examined outcomes in patients identified with early HIV infection found that a risk factor for development of AIDS was residence in the South. For example, federal support is based on the number of cumulative cases of patients with HIV or AIDS rather than the development of new cases, penalizing states with later epidemics (like the South) and those whose policies did not support early reporting of cases of HIV. Among adults aged 20-24 (the fastest-growing age group to become infected), Georgia has 81.3 individuals with HIV infection per 100,000 population, compared with 58.6 per 100,000 in New York. For example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has initiated the Enhanced Comprehensive HIV Prevention Planning Project for 12 municipalities, including Atlanta and Miami, for efforts to reduce HIV infections, link patients to care and reduce disparities. At Grady Hospital and the Ponce de Leon Center, which is our outpatient HIV/AIDS clinic, we remain busy seeing newly diagnosed individuals with AIDS, particularly presenting with late-stage disease and afflicted by the classic infections and cancers so common 30 years ago, when HIV was first described.
