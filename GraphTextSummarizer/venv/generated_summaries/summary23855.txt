Journalists were swept up in a dragnet, forced to "confess" on Iranian state TV before being "tried" and  sentenced to the infamous Evin Prison. And Michael -- who had run Penguin Books after the 1980's Salman Rushdie affair, when Iranian Ayatollahs condemned Rushdie to death for writing "The Satanic Verses" -- admitted that Sony's originally pulling "The Interview" from theaters was a blow to freedom of expression, which is uniquely dear and protected under the U.S. Constitution. I didn't hear a peep of "Sony-rage" about this serious damage to freedom of expression. I don't want to spoil the discussion-party about satire, comedy, freedom of expression, etc., but I can tell you from personal experience the above-mentioned already think we are velvet revolutionaries at best, or CIA agents, military spies ... After days of caving, counter-caving, threats, U-turns, investigations and pontifications, it's hard to know which way's up anymore with Sony, "The Interview" and North Korea.
