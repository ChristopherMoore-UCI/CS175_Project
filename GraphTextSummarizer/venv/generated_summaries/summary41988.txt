-- Embattled Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh met Sunday with top military and security officials Sunday to talk about "hostilities and crimes" occurring in his country, the Yemeni State News Agency reported. The meeting came amid new reports of clashes between security forces and anti-government protesters in Taiz, where witnesses said tens of thousands of demonstrators had taken to the streets Sunday. Dozens of people were wounded as security forces opened fire on the demonstrators in an effort to disperse them, witnesses told CNN Sunday. Witnesses in the city described the forces in Zinjibar as "Islamic militants" but did not specify that they were al Qaeda. We tried to complain to security forces but could not find them," said a resident of the city of Zinjibar, east of Aden, who also asked not to be named for security reasons.
