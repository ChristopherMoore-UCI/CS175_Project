Afghan security forces stormed a bank branch besieged by insurgents in Helmand province Wednesday, ending a deadly attack, police said. The continuing violence comes as Afghan security forces prepare to take on greater responsibility for ensuring the country's security as international forces transition to a supporting role. Taliban spokesman Qari Yousuf Ahmadi said via Twitter that the target was Afghan security forces personnel who were visiting the bank to receive their monthly salary. Analysts say the Afghan and Pakistan Taliban groups are closely affiliated, often sharing resources and jointly plotting attacks on either side of the porous border. " Separately, two bomb explosions Wednesday morning in Nangarhar's capital city, Jalalabad, targeted Afghan police vehicles, killing two Afghan policemen and injuring five others, said Zia Abdulzai, a spokesman for the provincial governor.
