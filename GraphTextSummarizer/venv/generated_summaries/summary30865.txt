"Higgs was the final piece of the jigsaw of what we call the Standard Model of particle physics," Dr Mike Lamont, operations group leader at the facility, told CNN. "There are a number of theories that give you dark matter candidates -- one of the favourites is supersymmetry," Lamont said, adding that the team got no sign of it at all in the facility's first three-year run. It is a type of matter that can't be seen but whose presence can be inferred from its gravitational effects on visible matter, radiation and even the very structure of the universe. The Higgs may have gone a long way to answering the questions thrown up by the Standard Model, but Lamont says there will still be plenty of good physics to be examined by what is effectively the world's biggest machine. Regular matter, which we are made of along with all the stars, planets and other tangible cosmic material, accounts for just around 4 percent of the mass-energy of the known universe.
