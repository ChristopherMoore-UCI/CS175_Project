"Knowing Him, being in a relationship with Him ... in which He is God and we are His creatures, that is where joy is found." Believers may argue, however, that material wealth is evidence of being in covenant with God, says Michael Long, a teacher of religious studies at Elizabethtown College and editor of the book, "I Must Resist: Bayard Rustin's Life in Letters." Critics may say prosperity followers are wrong, but believers say they are sincere, Walton says. Tom Brown, senior pastor of the Word of Life Church in El Paso, Texas, says wealth and prosperity are what God desires for us. Prosperity ministers preach that God rewards the faithful with wealth and spiritual gifts. If God loves us, it teaches, then God will reward us with a new home, a good job, or good health, Walton says.
