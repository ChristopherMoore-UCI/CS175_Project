"Nobody's arguing that this is how you procreate, but marriage is about love and commitment and the right to it is about equality -- and you know that." Donohue: Marriage based on duty and commitment "Marriage is about family -- it's not about love," Donohue said. Why should heterosexual marriage be considered any different than gay marriage, he asked. " Donohue said gays and lesbians have individual rights, but contended that "the institution of marriage is best set when we have kids raised by a father and a mother."

"You need love" Donohue then moved on from the Arizona law to take aim at same-sex marriage in general.
