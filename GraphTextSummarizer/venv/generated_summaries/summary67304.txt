A host of well-known species are at risk, among them: • Brown pelicans, the state bird of Louisiana, are incubating eggs on barrier islands. • Mottled ducks, locally called "summer ducks" because they are the only ducks that breed along the Gulf Coast, living, feeding and nesting in coastal salt marshes where oil would have devastating consequences. Hour by hour, a massive oil slick is spreading to the fragile coastal wetlands and barrier islands of the Mississippi River Delta in Louisiana. Seaside sparrows, tiny and secretive marsh birds, will have nowhere to go if the salt marsh edges they frequent are destroyed by oil. Coastal areas of Mississippi, Alabama and Florida are also at risk.
