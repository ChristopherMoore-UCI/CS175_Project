How match fixing ruined the beautiful game "After the meeting held today on August 25th, 2011 between the AFE and the LFP, the strike planned for Friday 26th, Saturday 27th, Sunday 28th and Monday 29th has been called off. "The Strike Committee of AFE and the LFP have reached an agreement which guarantees through various means the salaries of footballers," read a statement on the AFE's official web site. The strike ended after the Spain's Professional Football League (LFP) guaranteed the Association of Spanish Footballers (AFE) payments owed to 200 players would be made. The Spanish football season is set to get under way this weekend, after strike action by players which forced the opening round of fixtures to be postponed was ended on Thursday. Players from Spain's top two divisions went on strike earlier this month, in a bid to force the league to increase the fund which protects players' wages should clubs experience financial difficulties.
