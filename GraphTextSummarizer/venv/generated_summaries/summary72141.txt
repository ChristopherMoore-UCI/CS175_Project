In 2000, the Hallaton Treasure was discovered, consisting of Iron Age coins, parts of Roman helmets and debris from feasting. Other findings include the walls and tiled floors of the site, fragments of stone masonry, wall plaster, tiles and lead from the windows. She adds that Roman archaeology beneath the chapel imply that something important already existed there, which made it a special place. Both skeletons also had lesions on their skulls which suggest they had head lice. Vicki Score, ULAS project manager, says the skeletons were placed together in this position, as there was enough room in the grave to have them buried apart.
