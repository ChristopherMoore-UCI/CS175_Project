The drivers and teams had called for urgent action after the dramatic scenes at Silverstone and the sport's governing body responded immediately by amending its rules which prevent race drivers testing and tires being changed during the season. " Tires still a concern Ferrari driver Fernando Alonso said on the team website: "After what we saw in Silverstone, we now go to the Nurburgring, confident we can see an improvement. The Italian company now hopes the introduction of new tires and an agreement to monitor and test the tires throughout the season, with the cooperation of the teams and the sport's governing body, will put an end to the problems. The fall-out from the British race means there will be regulated in-season tire testing as well as plans to introduce further testing next January. Pirelli hope to provide a long-term solution by introducing a new range of tires from the Hungarian Grand Prix at the end of July onwards.
