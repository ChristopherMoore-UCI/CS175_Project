The joint action by the International Cricket Council and the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) follows a tearful confession by former national captain Mohammad Ashraful that he was involved in match fixing. Spot-fixing first entered the cricket vocabulary back in 2010 when three Pakistan Test players, captain Salman Butt and bowlers Mohammad Amir and Mohammad Asif were caught in a sting organized by an English newspaper. "The continuing fight against corruption in cricket is not only the responsibility of the authorities like the ICC and the BCB, but it is increasingly the personal responsibility also of all players and support personnel," said ICC chief executive David Richardson. In a joint statement, the ICC and BCB said the latest charges relate to an "alleged conspiracy within the Dhaka Gladiators franchise to engage in match-fixing and spot-fixing activity during matches in the BPL 2013. Ashraful, who captained his country between 2007 and 2009, played for Dhaka Gladiators in the Bangledesh Premier League (BPL), a Twenty20 tournament.
