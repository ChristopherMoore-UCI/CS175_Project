-- Mileidy Ramayo hasn't seen her father since he left Cuba on a raft but is hoping the loosening of travel restrictions might help bring that reunion closer to taking place. But officials have said military officials, who might possess government secrets, and sports stars, who could earn a fortune overseas compared with their salaries in Cuba, will still face added restrictions. With the loosening of travel restrictions, Cubans officials again called for an end to the policy. Shortly after Fidel Castro took power in 1959, stringent travel laws were put in place to stem an exodus from Cuba. Still, Ramayo said, she dreamed of seeing the world beyond Cuba's shores and then returning home.
