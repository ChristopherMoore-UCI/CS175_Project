Julian Zelizer says Medicare is a case of government playing a positive role in health care. " When Congress returns in September, Obama will only be able to revitalize the prospects for health care reform if he offers Americans a stronger argument about what government can do to improve this situation. And finally, Medicare has proven to be more popular than private insurance programs. Those who want to keep government "out" of the industry rarely acknowledge that government is already "in." While doctors were at the forefront of the campaign against Medicare, they turned out to be among the program's biggest beneficiaries. But in the end, the key to Medicare was not politicking but a compelling belief that government could play a positive role in this country and in our health care system.
