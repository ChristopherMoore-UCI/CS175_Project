We accomplish this by transforming language translation into something that anyone can do -- not just bilinguals -- and that millions of people want to do: learning a foreign language. With its content split up into hundreds of languages -- and with over 50% of it in English -- most of the Web is inaccessible to most people in the world. By having multiple students translate each sentence, and then choosing the best one, Duolingo produces translations that are as accurate as those from professional language translators. However, coordinating millions of contributors to translate language presents two major hurdles. When Severin Hacker and I started Duolingo, we realized we needed a way to entice millions of people to help translate the Web.
