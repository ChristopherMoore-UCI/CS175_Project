The Brotherhood has repeatedly called for political reform in Jordan. Less than a week after dissolving the parliament, Jordan's King Abdullah II appointed a new prime minister Wednesday as the country deals with demands for political reform. Political reforms would mean taking power away from his base -- the Bedouin tribes, a group known as the East Bankers. Many have said Jordan's economy is hurting, and too many people cannot afford the high cost of living and are burdened by high inflation. On top of that concern, King Abdullah is also dealing with more than 200,000 Syrian refugees who have entered Jordan recently.
