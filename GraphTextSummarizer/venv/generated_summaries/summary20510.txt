Alyssa and Heath say it's little things like that -- and parking in someone's driveway for free or watching a Dallas Cowboys game with new pals in a neighboring RV -- that keeps them going. Alyssa Padgett recalls asking her husband, Heath, as their 29-foot RV careened off an exit toward the small town of Williams, Arizona. Heath, with a little entrepreneurial know-how, contacted Snagajob.com, an hourly employment marketplace, to help find hourly workers (which made up 58.8% of the American workforce in 2013, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics) to spotlight during their travels. "We work a lot, but we work side by side. "It's sometimes difficult to balance the chaos of life on the road with spending quality time together, but we chose this honeymoon knowing it wasn't going to be traditional," Heath says.
