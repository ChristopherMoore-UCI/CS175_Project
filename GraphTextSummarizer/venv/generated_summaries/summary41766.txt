"Relieving Haiti's remaining debt is part of our effort to pursue every avenue to help Haiti's reconstruction efforts," World Bank Group President Robert B. Zoellick said in a release. In addition, a broad array of international donors pledged nearly $10 billion in long-term assistance to Haiti's earthquake recovery efforts during a conference in March at United Nations headquarters. Since the earthquake, the World Bank has made $479 million available to Haiti to support recovery and development through June 2011. Last year, prior to the earthquake, Haiti obtained $1.2 billion in debt relief from the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and other creditors. January's 7.0-magnitude earthquake killed more than 200,000 people and leveled large parts of Port-au-Prince, Haiti's capital.
