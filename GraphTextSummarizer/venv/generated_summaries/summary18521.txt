Several days ago, Libyan soldiers abandoned this remote frontier post as anti-government groups took over the town of Nalut, 70 kilometers from the border along a twisting mountain road. He and others say Nalut remains in the control of anti-government groups, but there is anxiety that pro-Gadhafi forces nearby will launch an assault. Threatened by Libyan soldiers, he says he and a few friends fled south and tried to enter Algeria. Unlike the crossing 150 miles to the north, the border at Dhibet has no crush of foreign workers desperate to escape the violence in Libya. But on Monday Libyan troops loyal to Gadhafi returned to reclaim control of the frontier.
