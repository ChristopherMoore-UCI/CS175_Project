Even out of office, DeMint keeps counsel with a small but loyal network of Republican donors in South Carolina, an influential collection of business leaders and former state GOP chairmen who have relationships across the state's political spectrum. -- Jim DeMint may be long gone from the Senate and now running the conservative Heritage Foundation, but his blessing is still in demand for Republican presidential candidates marching through his home state of South Carolina. With a team of political advisers that includes Terry Sullivan, a strategist who labored in the trenches of South Carolina politics for over a decade, Rubio has started to put in serious facetime with the state's conservative community as he builds a case for the Republican nomination in 2016. During the 2012 presidential race, the DeMint donors flirted with endorsing a presidential candidate and invited the cast of Republican contenders to a quasi-debate, the "Palmetto Freedom Forum," in Columbia. On that same trip, he held court with a group of social conservative leaders at the Greenville home of Lisa van Riper, the president of South Carolina Citizens For Life.
