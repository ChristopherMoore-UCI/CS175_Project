Graham and Johnson had been married just more than a week when an argument in early July allegedly escalated to a case of second-degree murder. Jordan Linn Graham, who's charged with second-degree murder, broke down in tears when her mom walked into a courtroom on Wednesday, but remained composed for most of the detention hearing. According to a criminal complaint, Graham told a friend she was having second thoughts about marrying Johnson. New details in the case emerged during Wednesday's hearing, including an argument from prosecutors that a fake e-mail account had been created just days after Johnson's death as part of what appeared to be an attempt to cover up the alleged killing. According to the complaint, Graham reportedly told a friend she planned to talk with Johnson about her reservations on July 7.
