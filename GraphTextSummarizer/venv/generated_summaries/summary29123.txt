Tammy Meyers, a 44-year-old mother of four, had been giving her 15-year-old daughter a driving lesson Thursday when she had an encounter with another driver that left her scared and upset, Lt. Ray Steiber told reporters. "Through the course of them finding each other, at one point Mrs. Meyers was following what we consider a suspect vehicle and then at another point they broke apart and Mrs. Meyers went home." Shortly after Meyers arrived at her house a second time and got out of her car, a gray or silver sedan pulled into the cul-de-sac and a volley of shots was fired. Steiber said the man pulled in front, stopped his car and came back to the Meyers car. Meyers was struck in the head by one bullet and was rushed to the hospital, where she died on Valentine's Day after being taken off life support. Meyers drove back out of the neighborhood to see if she could find the man, Steiber said.
