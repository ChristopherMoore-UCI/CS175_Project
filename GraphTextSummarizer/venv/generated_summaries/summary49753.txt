"It's a bit of a science-fiction project in my lab to create intelligent furniture which can change shape and functionality," explains lab director Auke Ijspeert. "Eventually we want less and less human interaction to have a more fluid transition of furniture," says Ijspeert. "What I really hope is to provide Lego blocks for people to find their own use such as artists or designers," says Ijspeert. The goal is to create furniture that can be re-used in multiple ways. "Let's say an elderly person is using a walker, the furniture could have modules attached for it to move out of the way in a cluttered apartment or have a stool follow the person and remain close by," describes Ijspeert.
