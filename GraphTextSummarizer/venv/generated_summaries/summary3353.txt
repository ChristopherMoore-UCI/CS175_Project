He was gliding off a steep hill in Draper, Utah, Sunday when his parachute partially collapsed and "swung him into the hillside like a pendulum," Salt Lake County Unified Fire spokesman Brian Anderton told CNN. "Bachelorette" producers sent a statement to CNN saying they are "deeply saddened to hear about the tragic passing of our friend, Eric Hill." "Eric inspired us every day with his passion, his courage and his adventurous spirit, and for that we are very thankful," the show's statement said. Hill was flown to University of Utah Medical Center, where he later died, according to Anderton and Facebook postings by Hill's sister Karen Tracy. Hill's Facebook page and website proclaimed that he would visit "every country in world record time" while "sharing the awesome that exists in every country, especially with the people!" Although he was not far above the ground when he fell and he was wearing a helmet, Hill "hit with quite a bit of velocity," causing severe injuries, Anderton said.
