In Boston, it seems like they have been digging out from under the snow for weeks, only to have more fall. So much so that Gov. Charlie Baker on Friday declared next week as Valentine's week. Blizzard warnings will be in effect from 7 p.m. Saturday to 11 a.m. Sunday for much of eastern Massachusetts, including metropolitan Boston. The snow that has already fallen in Boston is almost the stuff of mythology. Speaking of hurricanes, the storm will have a widespread wind field, and blustery, frigid conditions may reach as far south as the North Carolina mountains.
