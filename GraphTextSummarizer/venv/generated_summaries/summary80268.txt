"President Karzai called the demise of Marshal Qasim Fahim a great loss for Afghanistan and offered condolences to the people of Afghanistan on his passing. " Karzai ordered Afghanistan's flags to be flown at half-staff through Wednesday in honor of Fahim. Fahim was an influential figure in Afghanistan -- having been described in some U.S. news reports as once a local warlord -- before joining the government after the 2001 fall of the Taliban. -- Afghanistan will begin three days of mourning starting Monday for the death of Mohammad Qasim Fahim, an important figure in the country and most recently its first vice president. President Hamid Karzai's office announced Fahim's death in a statement Sunday on its website.
