In a decision that goes strongly against Google, Europe's highest court has ruled search engine operators are responsible for the processing they carry out of personal data which appear on web pages published by third parties -- and that a form of the contentious "right to be forgotten" already exists. The man successfully sued both Google Spain and Google Inc. in the Spanish courts but Google appealed, and it is on that appeal that today's ruling was made. The European Court of Justice's ruling looks like a strong decision in favor of privacy and individual rights, and against the business models of search engines and certain aspects of freedom of speech. Thirdly, it considered if current law provides for a right to be forgotten that is enforceable on search engines. In effect, if Google looks to make money in Spain, the search engine itself is subject to local data protection laws.
