Therefore, the biggest questions at this year's Airshow China may be how long can China afford to be building military aircraft that are "for China only" and how soon will Beijing realize that growing its export market is the only way it can continue to afford to maintain this massive military machine. At least two new stealthy, next-generation combat aircraft -- the Chengdu J-20 and the Shenyang J-31, are under development -- making the managers of western fighter programs like the Lockheed Martin F-35 look nervously at what the next decades of military challenges from China might entail. Several major aerospace plants -- Chengdu, Shenyang, Xi'an, Hongdu and others -- are almost completely geared towards the production of military aircraft. Commercial vs. military Ask an executive working on one of Boeing's fighter aircraft, military helicopter or missile programs about their importance to the corporate bottom line and he or she will tell you that Boeing is an 80% or more commercial company. The business of building big commercial aircraft like the 787 Dreamliners and 737s is what keeps Boeing running, providing the economies of scale that allow the company to have a military aircraft division.
