That led to a bit of a hiccup Friday morning as a stream of fans eager to see the clip appeared to crash iTunes' site. Those are the images that make up the first look at "Star Wars: Episode VII -- The Force Awakens," which debuted its first teaser trailer Friday. Fans have been anxious to get a glimpse at the upcoming "Star Wars" installment since Monday's announcement that it would be available in 30 theaters Friday. It's the first time we've seen it onscreen since 1983's "Return of the Jedi," and it was probably enough to send chills down the spine of many fans. Of course, "Star Wars" aficionados quickly reacted on Twitter.
