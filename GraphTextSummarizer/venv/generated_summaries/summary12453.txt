It features a series of mixed media creations from a number of African artists, including Leonce Raphael Agbodjelou from Benin, Amina Menia from Algeria, The Nigeria Nostalgia Project and South African collective I See a Different You. But it only hosted a number of temporary exhibitions and events during the past year before work started in July to transform it into a permanent home for African design. Upcoming exhibitions at MOAD include "Fashioning Africa," running from March to May, and "Design of an African City," from June to August.
