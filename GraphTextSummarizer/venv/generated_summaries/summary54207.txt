The Vatican is not included in the European Commission's "white list" of states that fully comply with international standards against tax fraud and money laundering. Italy's central bank has blocked all electronic payments through cash machines and by credit cards in Vatican City following the world's smallest state's failure to fully comply with international anti-money laundering rules. A report by Moneyval -- Council of Europe experts who examine measures to counter money laundering -- last year passed the Vatican in nine out of 16 core recommendations. Deutsche Bank's Italian division, which runs a network of cash machines for the Vatican, was refused authorisation from the central bank to continue operating its services within the walled state from the start of the year. Its efforts to adopt international standards in combating money laundering and terrorist financing were given a mixed assessment last July in a study of its financial system.
