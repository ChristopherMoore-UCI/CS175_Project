"As a purely precautionary measure, we have asked the NHS to quarantine all stocks of HPV vaccine from the batch related to this case," a spokesperson for the NHS said. Millions of girls have received vaccinations for HPV since 2008, the virus that causes 99 percent of cervical cancers. The Cervarix HPV vaccine protects against the two strains of HPV (16 and 18) that cause cervical cancer in over 70 percent of women. "Where the local NHS has supplies of vaccine from other production batches, they should continue with the vaccination program. Using condoms reduces the risk of HPV transmission, but infection is still possible because HPV can be spread by contact with parts of the body that the condom does not cover.
