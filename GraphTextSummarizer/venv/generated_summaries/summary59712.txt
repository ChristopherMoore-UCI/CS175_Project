"The incident happened because of security breach." Pakistan is a largely Sunni Muslim nation, and the attack on Shiite Muslims conjures thoughts of the long-standing tensions between the two groups in the Middle East and Asia. All three blasts were the work of suicide bombers, said Nayab Haider, a spokesman for the Lahore police. Police have found two heads and one body separately, said Haider, who said authorities had assigned 2,500 police officers to the procession after receiving a warning that it might be attacked. Local TV channels showed pictures of angry people burning vehicles, beating police and trying to break into a police station. Police tried to stop the first suicide bomber as the procession was ending, but he blew himself up as the police officer caught up with him in the crowd, Haider said.
