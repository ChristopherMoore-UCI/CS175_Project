First win for Hector, too Ganong wasn't the lone racer to capture a maiden victory Sunday, as Sweden's Sara Hector triumphed in a women's giant slalom in Kuhtai in Tirol, Austria -- new to the World Cup tour. He was 0.09 seconds faster than Austria's Matthias Mayer and 0.21 seconds faster than home favorite Dominik Paris. After Steven Nyman won one of skiing's classics in Val Gardena about a week ago, Travis Ganong claimed the opening victory of his career by bettering the field in Santa Catarina -- a venue long known on the women's circuit but making its debut among the men. "To be on top of the podium is so special." Fenninger solidified her spot in second in the overall standings behind Tina Maze -- who tied for seventh Sunday. In second heading into the final run behind American Mikaela Shiffrin, Hector attacked the course and made up the 0.27-second deficit.
