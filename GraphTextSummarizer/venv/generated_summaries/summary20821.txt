Here are the stories of the aid workers snatched by militants bent on using them as political pawns: Henning: A 'national hero' Not even the calls of 200 mosques in Britain were enough to stop radical militants from decapitating Henning, a 47-year-old taxi driver from near Manchester. Over the weekend, hundreds of people attended a service in Manchester, England, to remember Henning. Henning joined a group of volunteers who traveled to Syria in December 2013 to deliver food, water and medical supplies to people afflicted by the country's devastating civil war. "We will remember him as a tireless and selfless volunteer aid worker whose only concern was to help people in need." And as it did in the beheading videos of American freelance journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff and British aid worker David Haines, ISIS threatened to decapitate another Westerner.
