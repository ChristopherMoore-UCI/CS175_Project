Joplin residents "sent down a giant truck of aid for the residents of Tuscaloosa," he said. "I got involved just by seeing that they needed the help in Tuscaloosa, and a friend of mine started just a group of us: 'Joplin Helping Tuscaloosa, Alabama,' " Schultz told CNN. The donations were delivered courtesy of the relief group Toomer's for Tuscaloosa and Ashley Furniture HomeStore of Birmingham, Alabama, said Chris Fields, a spokesman for Toomer's. So the people of Tuscaloosa and elsewhere in Alabama returned Joplin's favor. "These people have been through it and they know exactly what to bring," from flashlights to batteries to baby bottles, Fields said of Tuscaloosa residents' donations.
