In baseball-crazy Japan, where players are treated as celebrities, Yu Darvish is a superstar. " Japanese baseball players are expected to lead an exemplary life off the field, and while Darvish was never the enfant-terrible of the game, he believes that marriage to actress Saeko in 2007 has had a particularly positive effect on his life and his game. But mostly for Darvish, "it's baseball all the time." Standing 6 feet 5 inches (196 centimeters) he immediately stands out from most other players in the game and has added some extra color to the sport, as well as some peerless pitching. The media outcry that followed would have been comparable to a U.S. Major League player caught in a doping scandal.
