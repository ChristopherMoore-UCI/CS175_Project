Last year's winner in the car race, Spain's Carlos Sainz -- driving for Volkswagen Motorsport -- is back to defend his title, but he'll face a stiff challenge from the likes of Nasser al-Attiyah from Qatar and Mark Miller from the United States. The 15-day race will see 407 vehicles (of 430 original entries) embark on a grueling 13 stages and attempt to cover a distance of 9,500 kilometers (5,900 miles), before crossing the finish line back in the Argentine capital on January 15. -- Thousands of spectators turned out to cheer on competitors in the 2011 Dakar Rally as the historic race got underway in Buenos Aires, Argentina on Saturday. All competitors are heading northwest to Victoria, in the Argentine province of Entre Rios, 377 kilometer (234 miles) away. As usual, I'll be racing at my pace and in my own special way," Sainz told www.dakar.com on Friday.
