Cheapoair then charged us $535 per ticket in cancellation fees. Consolidator tickets typically come with more restrictions than the garden-variety nonrefundable tickets sold by airlines. A Cheapoair representative said that when you buy this type of fare and have to cancel, the penalty fees are enormous because the airlines want to recoup their lost revenue. We have accepted our responsibility in the cancellation, but think $535 per ticket is excessive. It works through a ticket wholesaler that buys tickets in bulk at a big discount.
