Algerian Interior Minister Noureddine Yazid Zerhouni blamed a militant Islamic group with ties to al Qaeda for the attacks, which also targeted a building housing Algeria's Constitutional Council and Supreme Court. He said he has sent senior advisers and other top U.N. officials to head to Algiers to assist in the investigation and rescue effort. Rescuers are sifting through the rubble of the United Nations headquarters in Algiers hoping to find survivors after a powerful bomb ripped off the building's facade and leveled nearby U.N. offices. In a posting on an Islamist Web site, the group al Qaeda Islamic Maghreb claimed responsibility. That group also uses the name al Qaeda Islamic Maghreb after merging with al Qaeda earlier this year.
