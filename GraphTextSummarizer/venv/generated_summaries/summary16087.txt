"The drama of Libya does not even end with the fall of (Moammar) Gadhafi's government," Chavez said. " Chavez demanded respect and protection for his country's ambassador and embassy staff, and condemned the "imperial insanity" that he said was behind the "destruction" of the North African nation, Venezuela's state-run VTV reported. "It is only beginning." Chavez and Gadhafi are close allies. On Tuesday he said Venezuela would recognize only a Libyan government led by Gadhafi. The Venezuelan president has spoken out numerous times since the unrest erupted in Libya, accusing the United States and other countries of blowing the situation out of proportion to justify an invasion.
