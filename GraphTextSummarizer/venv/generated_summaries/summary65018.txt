The U.S. military is ending its policy of excluding women from combat and will "expeditiously" open combat jobs and direct combat units to female troops, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta announced Thursday. Women already are on the front lines overseas despite an official ban on combat, "and the time has come for our policies to recognize that reality," Panetta told reporters at the Pentagon. The American Civil Liberties Union recently filed a federal lawsuit against the Department of Defense, charging that combat exclusion is unfair and outdated, harms America's safety and prevents women from receiving training and recognition for their work. The Pentagon must notify Congress of each job or unit as it is sent up to the secretary to be opened to women. We know they can do it." Sen. John McCain, an Arizona Republican who spent six years as a prisoner of war during the Vietnam War, said he supports lifting the ban on women serving in combat, pointing out women are already serving in harm's way.
