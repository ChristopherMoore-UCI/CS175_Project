-- Alan Gross, a U.S. State Department contractor jailed in Cuba, received his first visit by American doctors, Gross' attorney said Thursday. The change in course comes as Cuba intensifies its campaign to secure the release of Cuban intelligence agents serving lengthy prison sentences in the United States. Cuba's talks of a possible prisoner trade have been dismissed by U.S. officials, who say Gross should be released immediately. Gross, 64, is serving a 15-year sentence for bringing banned communications equipment to Cuba as part of a State Department program to increase access to the internet and spread democracy on the island. Cuban authorities had said that Gross was being adequately cared for in the military hospital where he is imprisoned, but in June said they had granted permission for doctors to visit.
