We believe that the enslavement of women began with the enslavement of their sexuality, so we therefore consider it legitimate to use their liberated sexuality as a symbol of women's worldwide liberation. We have been bringing the world the simple idea of women's liberation by means of sexual emancipation as expressed in highly visible acts of political protest. First, dictatorship, as a tool for enslaving women. The second part of the system consists of religion and the church, which have overseen the spiritual enslavement of women. In theocratic states, the position of women is horrifying and hopeless.
