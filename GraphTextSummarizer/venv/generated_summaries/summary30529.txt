Speaking from Ottawa on Tuesday, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said last week's deadly shooting there was an act of terrorism, and the United States is taking steps to counter extremist groups including ISIS online, which has sought to recruit and radicalize Westerners to its cause. The ability of groups like ISIS to influence and recruit Westerners online is one of the capabilities the U.S. and Canadian governments hope to disrupt. The shooter, Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, was only the latest in a string of young Western men, often converts to Islam with criminal backgrounds, who have become radicalized by extremist messaging and who sought to commit attacks. Kerry also had a message for ISIS and other terrorist groups. "President Obama, the State Department and our entire administration pledge to work even more closely with your leaders at every level in order to deter and prevent terrorist attacks," Kerry said.
