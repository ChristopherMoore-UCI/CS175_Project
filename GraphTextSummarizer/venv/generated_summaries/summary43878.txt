-- Toronto Mayor Rob Ford said he suffered a "setback" this week after a video posted on social media showed him babbling about the city's police chief Monday night while he was at a fast-food restaurant. His saga began in May, when allegations emerged that he appeared to be smoking crack cocaine on a pipe on cell phone video taken months earlier, in winter 2012. He uses a profanity at the beginning of the clip to describe Toronto Police Chief Bill Blair. Ford has ignored calls for him to resign or enter rehab and has said he will run for re-election in October. The mayor, who has pledged to refrain from alcohol, stopped briefly to talk to reporters Tuesday when he was asked about the video that shows him incoherently talking to customers at a Steak Queen in Rexdale.
