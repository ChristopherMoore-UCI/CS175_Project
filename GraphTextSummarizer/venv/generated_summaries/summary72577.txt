SafeSearch can filter out potentially offensive search results quite effectively after a user has hit "enter" -- the first page of results for "lesbian" with moderate safe search enabled is completely innocuous -- and it works for searches in progress too. When we contacted Google for comment, we received this statement from a spokesperson: "There are a number of reasons you may not be seeing search queries for a particular topic. The issue is that when you type them, Google Instant stops reporting results on the fly, and you must hit "enter" to see results. That happens because Google Instant doesn't just use what you've typed to display results. Type them in to Google and the instant search will immediately stop delivering new results.
