Blaming social media for fueling anti-government rhetoric, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan threatened to "eradicate" Twitter at a campaign rally in Bursa on March 20. Speaking to the daily newspaper Hurriyet, Metin Feyzioglu, president of the Union of Turkish Bar Associations, said, "If they don't abide by the ruling, we will file a criminal complaint against the (Telecommunications Directorate) by attaching the ruling of the Constitutional Court." A lower court overturned the Twitter ban last week, but access to the service has not been restored. Three people filed complaints to the Constitutional Court after the Telecommunications Directorate blocked access to the social media website Twitter. A Turkish court ruled Wednesday that the country's ban on Twitter violates the right to free expression and demanded that citizens' access to the popular microblogging service be restored. Wednesday's court ruling did not address a YouTube ban that took place less than a week after Twitter was blocked.
