I am constantly humbled at how purpose drives the people and companies I admire: Casey Sheahan served as the CEO of outdoor clothing pioneer Patagonia for a decade. Once defined, purpose informs a company's every move. Putting purpose into action I like the way Richard Leider, one of the world's foremost experts on purpose, describes how to approach the next step. He defines purpose as being in the right place with the people who matter to you, doing your life's work.
