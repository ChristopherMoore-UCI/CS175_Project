Letters were sent to a federal judge, a Spokane post office, President Barack Obama and Fairchild Air Force Base, the FBI said. Both that letter and one sent to a Spokane post office were intercepted on May 14, while the letters to Obama and Fairchild Air Force Base were tracked down on May 22. This letter was similar to threatening letters sent to New York Mayor Bloomberg and the gun-control group he founded. Tests are being conducted on the letter sent to Fairchild Air Force Base to determine whether it -- like those other three letters -- contained ricin. Eight days ago, 37-year-old Matthew Ryan Buquet was arrested as part of the investigation into the aforementioned letter sent to U.S. District Court Judge Fred Van Sickle.
