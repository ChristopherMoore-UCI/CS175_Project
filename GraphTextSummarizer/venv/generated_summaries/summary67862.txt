If the ads stay out of Kindle books and remain limited to the navigation screen and screen saver, they will at least be unobtrusive, and users might be OK with that. "It was very important that we didn't interfere with the reading experience," Marine told the publication, noting that ads would display across the bottom of the screen and on the Kindle's screen saver, but not while the user was reading a Kindle book. Kindle director Jay Marine revealed the company's plans in an interview with the Associated Press on Monday afternoon. According to a new ad on the front page of its website, Amazon offers three options: the Special Offers Kindle for $114, WiFi-only Kindle for $139, and the 3G Kindle for $189. "We think customers are going to love it." Loving the new Kindle with Special Offers -- yes, that's the actual product name -- might be somewhat of a stretch for many users.
