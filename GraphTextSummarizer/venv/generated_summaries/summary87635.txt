"On January 26, during a routine inventory of sensitive material in the chemical laboratory, Dugway officials discovered a discrepancy between the records and the agent on hand," said a statement issued by the U.S. Army's Dugway Proving Ground. "Testers here determine the reliability and survivability of all types of military equipment in a chemical or biological environment," according to Dugway officials. "It evaporates very slowly, almost like motor oil." People can be exposed to the agent through skin contact -- the most toxic way -- or through eye contact or inhalation, the statement said. About 1,500 employees and contractors are stationed at the proving ground, which covers 798,214 acres and is located in the Great Salt Lake Desert, around 85 miles southwest of Salt Lake City. -- A Utah military facility that tests chemical and biological weapons was opened Thursday after a nearly 12-hour lockdown that officials said was prompted by a missing vial of "nerve agent."
