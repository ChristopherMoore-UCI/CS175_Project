But since dual citizenship in Ukraine is illegal, the most visible of Russian citizens in Ukraine are (1) the Russian soldiers and sailors based in Sevastopol, (2) the Russian soldiers who have just invaded southern Ukraine and (3) Ukrainian riot police who are being given Russian citizenship at the Russian consulate in Simferopol to reward them for beating Ukrainian protesters. Independent Austria lasted for two decades; independent Ukraine has existed for only slightly longer. The Russian invasion of southern Ukraine is a threat above all to the citizens of Ukraine. Austrians and other citizens of European Union countries are beginning to consider what the end of Ukraine might mean for their own European system. Just as most European leaders were happy to accept the German idea that Austria had no right to exist, many people around the West seem ready to forget about Ukraine or to believe the Kremlin's propaganda that half of the country is Russian.
