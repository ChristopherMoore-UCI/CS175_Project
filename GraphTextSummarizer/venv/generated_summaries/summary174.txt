It wasn't until after Virgin America Flight 415 took off from John F. Kennedy International Airport on Friday that the airline discovered the man, identified as Olajide Oluwaseun Noibi, wasn't supposed to be on the flight, according to an FBI affidavit. Eimiller said the FBI did detain Noibi when the flight from New York landed in Los Angeles. "Noibi claimed he was able to go through passenger screening by obtaining a seat pass and displaying his University of Michigan identification and a police report that his passport had been stolen." When flying to Los Angeles last week, Noibi was questioned by a flight attendant. It is not clear what Noibi did for several days in Los Angeles, but he later told authorities he was recruiting people for his software business.
