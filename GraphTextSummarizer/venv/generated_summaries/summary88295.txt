-- Brooklyn Nets coach and former 10-time NBA All-Star Jason Kidd pleaded guilty Tuesday to a misdemeanor drunk-driving charge stemming from a 2012 arrest, according to authorities. Kidd was arrested by Southampton Town police on July 15, 2012, after his SUV smashed a utility pole against several trees, according to police records. "Jason has taken responsibility for his actions, and fully realizes that he needs to grow from this experience," Brooklyn Nets General Manager Bill King said Tuesday. At the time of his arrest, Kidd refused a breathalyzer test and a blood test. Kidd's plea can be reduced to a violation of "driving while ability impaired" if he completes his community service, according to the Suffolk County prosecutor's office.
