The report notes that from March to June, the Pakistani military "continued to avoid military engagements that would put it in direct conflict with Afghan Taliban or [al Qaeda] forces in North Waziristan. A private White House report to Congress, obtained by CNN last week, used unusually tough language to suggest the ally is not doing nearly enough to confront the Taliban and al Qaeda. The blunt language contradicted public comments by the Obama administration that Pakistan is working hard to crack down on militants. Former Pakistani President Gen. Pervez Musharraf defended Pakistan's role in the fight against terrorism amid criticisms that it falls short on that front. " Musharraf said that if critics want to point out deficiencies in North Waziristan, they should limit their comments to just that region.
