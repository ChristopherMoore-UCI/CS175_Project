"Anthony, you will deal with a much higher power for the pain you have caused," said Donnita Carmichael, daughter of victim Tonia Carmichael. -- A judge Friday upheld a Cleveland, Ohio, jury's recommendation that convicted serial killer Anthony Sowell be sentenced to death. Sowell, who pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity, had his eyes closed during almost all of Friday's hearing, CNN affiliates reported. Jurors convicted Sowell of 11 counts of aggravated murder and more than 70 other charges, including abusing corpses and kidnapping. Many of Sowell's victims struggled with drug addiction at some point, and court records showed many resorted to stealing and prostitution to support their habits.
