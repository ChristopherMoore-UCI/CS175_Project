Earlier this year, Human Rights Watch called on the government of Sudan to "end its crackdown on civil society." "The Sudanese government should respect and protect space for independent civil society to operate fully and freely," said Daniel Bekele of Human Rights Watch. -- An event organized by TEDxKhartoum in Sudan was canceled by security authorities, organizers say. "We promote positive thinking." Earlier in the day, members of Sudan's National Security and Intelligence Service interrupted the event, held at a luxury hotel in Khartoum, and asked for a permit, organizers said. TEDxKhartoum came into being in 2011 and has held 11 events since, organizers say. This year's TEDxKhartoum speakers included several local and international speakers including John Hall of Linux International.
