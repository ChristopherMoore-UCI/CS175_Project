But Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton has already tweeted a picture of his car bearing the hashtag "#PrayForMH370" along with the message: "All my prayers and sympathies go to the friends and families of the passengers on MH370 flight. -- Formula One will pay its respects to the 239 people who went missing aboard Flight 370 ahead of this weekend's Malaysian Grand Prix. The women's honor went to American swimmer Missy Franklin, who won a record six gold medals at last year's world championships in Barcelona. The plane disappeared almost three weeks ago, with Malaysian Airlines informing the relatives of those who were on board that it had to be assumed "beyond reasonable doubt" that the aircraft was lost and there were no survivors. " Sunday's race will be the second of the 2014 season, with Hamilton's teammate Nico Rosberg looking for his second win after taking the checkered flag at the Australian Grand Prix.
