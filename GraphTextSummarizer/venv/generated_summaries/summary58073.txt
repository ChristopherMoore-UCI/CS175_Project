I've also seen anonymous quotes from Collierville players characterizing Abel as a "psycho" and noting that wasn't his first rant. If you haven't heard the audio clip of high school football coach Shawn Abel going off, you need to take two minutes out of your life to do so. But based on that clip -- and the fact Abel is smart enough to teach A.P. precalculus -- if my son played football at Collierville, I would be perfectly fine with him having Abel as his coach. But funny, I didn't see any quotes that denied Abel's assessment of the team's playing or their commitment to hard work. We are so obsessed with shielding kids from disappointment and discomfort that they have no idea how to deal with life when they leave the nest.
