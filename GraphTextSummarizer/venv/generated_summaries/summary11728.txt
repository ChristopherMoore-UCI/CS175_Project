Terrence Lavaron Thomas, 39, was arraigned Tuesday on assault with intent to murder, drug possession and weapons charges in the Saturday night bus shelter stabbings in Southfield, Michigan. One of the victims, a male in his 50s, was stabbed five times in the face and neck and three times in the upper back, Southfield Police Chief Eric Hawkins said. Hawkins said Thomas asked a group of people waiting for a bus whether they were Muslim. When two people responded that they were not, Hawkins said, Thomas allegedly "became upset by that answer, saying he was Muslim and it was not acceptable that they were not." The stabbings of two people at a Detroit-area bus stop began with what police said was a simple question: Are you Muslim?
