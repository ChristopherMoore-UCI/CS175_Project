-- Anders Behring Breivik, who admits killing 77 people in Norway last summer, has been asked to stop raising his fist in salute each morning at his trial, his lawyer said Wednesday. Breivik boasted Tuesday that he had carried out "the most sophisticated and spectacular political attack in Europe since World War II" when he carried out his gun-and-bomb rampage. Breivik says his rampage was meant to save Norway from being taken over by multicultural forces and to prevent ethnic cleansing of Norwegians. Breivik, who boasts of being an ultra-nationalist who killed his victims to fight multi-culturalism in Norway, was in good spirits on the third day of his trial Wednesday, Lippestad said. Breivik faces trial on charges of voluntary homicide and committing acts of terror in the July 22 attacks.
