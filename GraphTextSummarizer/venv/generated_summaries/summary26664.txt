We are talking about mass market with these cars -- as Better Place and Renault have committed to 100,000 electric cars for Israel and Denmark beginning in 2011. Two years ago, most automakers considered electric cars a niche market, but today, we see almost every automaker in the world producing electric vehicles. The good news is we are already seeing a shift that will ultimately take us from a transportation system based on a volatile oil ecosystem to one based on a more sustainable model using electric cars that creates a market for clean energy. But a year later, our vision for an oil-free world where electric cars are more convenient and affordable than gasoline-powered cars remains the same. Motivations vary from country to country, but the end result will be the same: a stronger economy, healthier automotive sector and increased development of clean energy, leading to a healthier society.
