"Li mistakenly thought he was safe ... hiding halfway around the world in cyberspace anonymity," ICE Director John Morton said Tuesday. -- A Chinese man captured by federal agents in 2011 has pleaded guilty in a federal court for pirating copyrighted software worth more than $100 million, officials of ICE announced Tuesday. The software covered a wide range of applications used in manufacturing, engineering, space exploration, storm water management, explosives simulation and manufacturing plant design. An alleged co-conspirator, Chun Yan Li, remains a fugitive and is believed to be in Chengdu, ICE says. One of their largest customers was a former electronics engineer at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, who pleaded guilty to copyright infringement last April.
