Thursday's game saw home fans pelting Ghana's players and supporters with bottles, rocks, broken glass and cutlery after Equatorial Guinea conceded two quick first half goals. FIFA president Sepp Blatter and the head of the Confederation of African Football Issa Hayatou have slammed the "western media" over their reporting of the crowd violence that marred Thursday's Africa Cup of Nations semifinal between Ghana and hosts Equatorial Guinea. "If they're throwing this at players, Eq Guinea, you can have 3rd place," he tweeted after the incident, alongside a picture of some of the objects that had been thrown from the stands. But there were scared, scurrying fans, too," recalled Gary Al Smith, a Ghanaian football journalist who was in the stadium at the time. Equatorial Guinea had been fined close to $100,000 over the violence and ordered to pay the expenses of the 36 injured Ghanaian fans.
