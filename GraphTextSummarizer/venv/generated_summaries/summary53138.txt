"Every girl who has read it says, 'That was me in high school, or that was me in seventh grade,'" Holly Bario, DreamWorks president of production, tells EW. The girl with the flaming curls (and not-so-flattering nickname) from "Eleanor & Park" will soon be getting the cinematic treatment, with DreamWorks Studios picking up film rights to Rainbow Rowell's best-selling novel. "The book is uniquely structured in that one chapter is told by Eleanor and one chapter is told from Park's perspective, and they alternate," Bario points out. The best summer blockbusters ever Set in 1986, and following one school year in Omaha, the novel follows the tentative romance of two 16-year-olds: Eleanor, a somewhat heavy girl overwhelmed by insecurities and trying to survive an abusive household, and Park, the quiet, half-Korean kid who also doesn't feel like he fits in but finds refuge in music and comic books. There are all sorts of groovy stylistic things you could do with voice over, or words on the screen, but we want something that's real Rainbow.
