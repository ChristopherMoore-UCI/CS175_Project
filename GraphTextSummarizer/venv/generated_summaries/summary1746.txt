But the actions of a second soldier, who watched the first soldier fire at Qawasme and fired, too, were unprofessional, and that soldier's military service has been terminated, the IDF statement said. The investigation into the January 7 arrest operation, in which Amr Qawasme was killed, "concluded that the initial firing at Qawasme was done following a suspicious movement that caused the soldier to feel that his life was threatened," the IDF said in a statement. It found no fault with the initial shooting, saying it had been executed "in accordance with IDF rules of engagement." "The IDF deeply regrets the death of Amr Qawasme," it said. Asked why not, a woman who answered the phone for the IDF said his name was withheld for privacy reasons.
