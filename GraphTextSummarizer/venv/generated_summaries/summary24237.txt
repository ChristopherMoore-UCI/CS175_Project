Whether it's the remarks about former president George W. Bush or the fact that he repeatedly poked fun at the Jonas Brothers for wearing purity rings, it took Americans some time to get used to Brand's humor, says Jenny May Finn, who created The Russell Brand Fansite in 2005 after watching Brand on "Big Brother" in the U.K. "All he wants to do is make people laugh," says Finn, who lives in Dublin, Ireland. "The truth is as funny as 'Sarah Marshall' and 'Greek' have been, it's the tip of the iceberg for him," says MTV news movies editor Josh Horowitz. Finn says she often receives e-mails from recovering drug addicts thanking Brand for being an inspiration to them. " But there wasn't an immediate embrace of Brand, says Horowitz. "I can't wait to see Russell stretch and prove he's got true range outside of the provocateur he clearly can play with his eyes closed," Horowitz says.
