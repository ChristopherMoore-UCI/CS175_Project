Recent studies of time use by sociologists at the University of Maryland show employed mothers spending as much time in primary child care as nonemployed mothers in 1975. With more than two-thirds of mothers in the labor force today, few families are immune to negotiating child care and paid work. Black mothers historically have believed they are dedicated mothers, even while earning money for their families. "Working family" was a term newly in use when Clinton made her famous comment, but working mothers have been, however messily and tentatively, forging a new model of parenting and laboring since that time. Mostly, we remember the comment as a moment in the perpetual mommy wars, but I tend to think about it as a moment in the history of chocolate chip cookies.
