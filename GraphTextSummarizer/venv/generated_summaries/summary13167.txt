-- The number of interracial couples in the United States has reached an all-time high, with one in every 10 American opposite-sex married couples saying they're of mixed races, according to the most recent Census data released Wednesday. Neither black nor white: Three multiracial generations, one family Analysts suggest the new figures could reflect U.S. population shifts, broader social acceptance of such unions and a more widespread willingness among those polled to be classified as mixed race. The rate of interracial partnerships also is much higher among the unmarried, the 2010 Census showed. "Identifying as an interracial couple shifts over time," census spokeswoman Rose Kreider said. Among interracial opposite-sex married couples, non-Hispanics and Hispanics are by far the most frequent combination, making up about 45% of such partnerships, Kreider said.
