The daughter of team founder Frank Williams, the 36-year-old will work alongside her father as deputy team principal. But in recent times the team has floundered, although Venezuelan driver Pastor Maldonado did pick up Williams' first race win since 2004 at last year's Spanish Grand Prix. "I'm truly honored to be taking on the role of deputy team principal and look forward to working alongside Frank to help run the team this season and beyond," Claire told Williams' official website. Monisha Kaltenborn became the sport's first female team principal when she was handed the reins at Sauber in October and now Williams has followed suit after appointing Claire Williams to a similar key role. Williams' driver pairing of Maldonado and rookie Valtteri Bottas will both be on the grid for the Chinese Grand Prix on April 14.
