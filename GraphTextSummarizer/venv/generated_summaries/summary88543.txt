"Coal and coal mining are part of our nation's energy future, and EPA has worked with companies to design mining operations that adequately protect our nation's waters," Silva said. A historian of West Virginia coal mining, he's a member of Friends of Blair Mountain, which opposes any surface mining at the site of 15,000-miner revolt in 1921 that included his great-grandfather, who was charged with treason, which was later dropped. Despite industry objections, the EPA insisted "coal and coal mining are part of our nation's energy future," one official said in a statement Thursday. " C. Belmont Keeney, a history instructor at Southern West Virginia Community and Technical College in Logan, said the decision was "a major victory for environmentalists," but "it's not going to end coal mining," as some might suggest. But adversaries praised the ruling as "a major victory" for environmentalists opposed to surface -- or mountaintop-removal -- mining, which uses explosives on hilltops to expose underlying coal.
