"There are no words to describe it," Anastasia Moumouris told CNN Tampa affiliate WTSP. The dehydrated Moumouris, 51, was spotted by good Samaritans who were out fishing for scallops off of Crystal River in Citrus County. Moumouris' 16-food boat earlier Thursday was found unattended nine miles from the Fort Island boat ramp. The man had texted his wife Wednesday afternoon to tell her he was heading in, according to WTSP. The Citrus County Sheriff's Office said a storm tossed Moumouris from his vessel.
