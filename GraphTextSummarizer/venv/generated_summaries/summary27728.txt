-- Williams driver Nico Hulkenberg took advantage of changeable weather conditions to secure a remarkable first-ever pole position for Sunday's Brazilian Grand Prix, stunning all the Formula One title favorites in the process. Hulkenberg mastered the change in the weather, which saw the rain ease up in final qualifying -- prompting drivers to switch from intermediate to slick tires -- to give Williams their first pole position since the European Grand Prix at the Nurburgring in May 2005. The second Williams of Rubens Barrichello finished sixth, with Robert Kubica, Michael Schumacher, Felipe Massa and Vitaly Petrov completing the top 10 at Interlagos. The Red Bull duo of Sebastian Vettel and Mark Webber are second and third on the grid, with McLaren's Lewis Hamilton fourth and world championship leader Fernando Alonso in fifth position. The 23-year-old German has the four drivers battling it out for ther world title breathing down his neck.
