Tennessee police say trucker Bruce Mendenhall implicated himself as a serial killer. Mendenhall was detained, police said, because he gave statements implicating himself in Hulbert's slaying. Knowing that the slaying was similar to other recent homicides in the South, Postiglione questioned Mendenhall about those as well, police said. Nashville police said they are in contact with agencies in those states regarding statements from Mendenhall, who is being held without bail. Mendenhall implicated himself in the death of Symantha Winters, 48, of Nashville, who was found shot to death June 6 in a trash container at a Lebanon, Tennessee, truck stop, police said.
