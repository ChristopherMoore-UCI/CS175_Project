Far too many of us, especially those of us with friends and family members who have participated in Greek life, either are in denial about this -- or we choose to see egregious cases of racism, sexism and violence in the U.S. Greek system as somehow isolated. That orchard includes, but isn't limited to, Greek organizations, he told me. From 2003 to 2006, Hughey spent time interviewing students from Greek organizations at three colleges on the East Coast. Then we could know the answers to some interesting questions: How segregated are Greek organizations? The video is hard to watch, but I have a feeling it's one we need to see, both because it hints at the inner workings of certain Greek organizations, and because it shows the persistent racism that still exists in the United States.
