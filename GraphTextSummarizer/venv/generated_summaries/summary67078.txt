After a protracted legal battle, the Department of Energy is removing a small fee from electric bills intended to pay for the disposal of spent fuel at nuclear power plants. "The waste all sits at the plant sites where it was generated, despite the collection of some $40 billion." Meanwhile, stockpiles of spent nuclear fuel continue to grow. In 1982, Congress passed the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, which gave the Department of Energy a 1998 deadline to begin disposing of spent nuclear fuel. Power companies and state regulators successfully fought the Energy Department over the matter, saying the government has been collecting the fee for 30 years but won't begin disposing of nuclear waste for another 34 years. After lengthy studies, Congress designated Yucca Mountain as the site for a permanent repository of nuclear waste.
