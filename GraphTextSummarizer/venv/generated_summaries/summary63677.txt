Gaza's main border crossings, which Israel often closed in response to Hamas rocket attacks, were open Monday. Israel tried to avoid civilian casualties in Gaza, a senior Israel Defense Forces officer said in a posting Monday on the IDF Web site. Israel said its offensive was aimed at stopping Hamas militants from firing rockets into southern Israel. More than 170 supply trucks crossed into Gaza on Monday, less than a third of the daily number that crossed in 2005, said John Holmes, U.N. under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator. " Israel began the offensive in response to rocket fire by Hamas militants after showing eight years of restraint, the officer said.
