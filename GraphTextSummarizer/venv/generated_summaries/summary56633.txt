With its future in the tournament hanging by a thread, the U.S. produced a battling performance with former Germany international Jermaine Jones and Kyle Beckerman snarling at the heart of the midfield. Germany, which thrashed Portugal 4-0 in its opening game before being held 2-2 by Ghana, began in confident fashion and dominated possession. Germany, playing without a recognized striker, enjoyed plenty of possession in front of the U.S. defense but rarely managed to find a way through. For Klinsmann, a man who won the 1990 World Cup as a player with West Germany and coached the national side to the semifinals in 2006, this was always going to be an emotional occasion. And with 10 minutes of the second half played, Germany finally got the breakthrough it had threatened.
