-- Natasha Richardson came to Mont Tremblant ski resort in eastern Canada last month for what was supposed to be a skiing getaway. Richardson was transferred to the trauma center in Montreal about 7 p.m., more than six hours after her initial fall. The only way to get to the closest trauma center from here is to drive 2Â½ hours to Montreal. Actress Natasha Richardson died after suffering an epidural hematoma in a fall during a ski lesson. In an open letter to the citizens of Quebec sent to the Montreal Gazette, Dr. Michael Churchill Smith, director of professional services at the Montreal General Hospital, said incidents like Natasha Richardson's should serve as a wake-up call to Quebec.
