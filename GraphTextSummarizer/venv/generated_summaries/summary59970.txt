While we will create reputation on individual platforms, there will be an increasing demand for fluid exchange of reputation and ratings from one system to another. Beyond these scenarios, expect to see more fluid exchange of reputation between their original systems -- akin to monetary exchanges. We may even see reputation system APIs developed to enable the transfer of your reputation to new platforms. Reputation is co-created by individuals having experiences. We'll see more of personal reputation integrated in person-to-person transactions, which will enable deeper transactions in the resource sharing economy.
