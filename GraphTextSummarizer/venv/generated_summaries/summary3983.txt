"This is the worst day in my 24 years as the sheriff of Clark County," Kelly said Saturday, his voice breaking with emotion. Deputy Suzanne Hopper was investigating reports of gunfire in the area Saturday when she was killed, Clark County Sheriff Gene Kelly said. -- A sheriff's deputy who was shot and killed at a trailer park in western Ohio has been identified, as has the suspect who was also killed. The officer, Jeremy Blum, is in fair condition, Rebecca Czachor, a spokeswoman for the Miami Valley Hospital in Dayton, Ohio, said Sunday. A second law enforcement officer also was shot at the Enon Beach trailer park in suburban Springfield, Ohio.
