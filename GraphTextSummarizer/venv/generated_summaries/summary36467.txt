He said the incident took place more than two weeks ago, after several rebels and government troops were killed in a battle in western Homs. The Baba Amr district of Homs, once a bastion of anti-government sentiment, was subjected to a brutal counteroffensive by the Syrian army starting in February 2012, Human Rights Watch said. "It is not enough for Syria's opposition to condemn such behavior or blame it on violence by the government," said Nadim Houry, Middle East deputy director at Human Rights Watch. Homs came under weeks of relentless attacks by government forces, including indiscriminate shelling on civilian areas. Regardless of the horrors suffered in Homs, the atrocious act in the video is inexcusable, Human Rights Watch said.
