-- The film industry was devastated by two recent deaths that have led to a movement to alter this Sunday's "in memoriam" segment of the Oscars telecast: One was the natural causes passing of comedy filmmaker Harold Ramis, 69, and the other was the accidental death of camera assistant Sarah Jones, 27, who was struck by a train in Georgia while working on a biopic of rock musician Gregg Allman. Film crew worker's tragic death prompts Hollywood movement Under most circumstances, a film worker in Jones' position would not be included in the telecast's tribute. Roughly 40 end up being included in the film, which is created weeks in advance of the Oscars. Those who hope the Oscars will take a stand on this issue should be sure to make their request in the right direction. Ramis, the star of "Ghostbusters" and "Stripes," and director of "Vacation," "Caddyshack" and "Groundhog Day," died on Monday at his home in Chicago, while Jones, whose credits include "Midnight Rider" (the film that led to her death) and the TV series "The Vampire Diaries," was killed last Thursday while filming on a bridge that authorities said was supposed to be off-limits to the production.
