-- Former Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy will stand trial on charges of incitement to conduct murder and "thuggery" relating to clashes near the presidential palace in December, state-run MENA reported Sunday. After Morsy supporters chased protesters from the grounds, both sides threw rocks, fireworks and Molotov cocktails. The charges stem from when pro- and anti-Morsy protesters clashed outside the presidential palace in early December. Egypt has been in turmoil since then, with the military battling Muslim Brotherhood members and other Morsy supporters. Citing investigators, it said that Morsy and his staff are accused of ordering supporters to attack protesters after guards and members of the Interior Ministry reportedly refused to do it.
