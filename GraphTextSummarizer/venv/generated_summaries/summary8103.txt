"Jack and Jill" plays like the kind of crap Sandler's comedian character skewered in "Funny People." L.A. ad exec Jack Sadelstein (Sandler the guy) is gritting his teeth over a holiday visit from his loudmouthed, overweight twin Jill (Sandler in drag, showing an unfailing grasp of the obvious). It's odious to watch the movie make fun of Jill's looks, weight, and flatulence problems only to switch gears into gooey sentiment at the end and tell us we should love her. Maybe you thought since Adam Sandler is playing boy-and-girl twins in "Jack and Jill" that the movie would be double the fun. The siblings pick at each other relentlessly between Jill's bouts with farting and dropping chimichanga bombs.
