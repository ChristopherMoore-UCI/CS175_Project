"School administrators knew the student's extensive history of sexual and violent misconduct and were alerted to the substantial risk he posed" to other students, according to the brief. About a week before the alleged rape, Sparkman Middle School vice principals Jeanne Dunaway and Teresa Terrell received a complaint that the boy had touched a female student inappropriately and was assigned in-school suspension, according to federal attorneys. DoJ and DoE attorneys claim the boy had a long history of sexual and other misconduct in school and Sparkman Middle School administrators knew it. A 14-year-old girl with special needs allegedly was raped at school after a teacher's aide persuaded her to act as bait to catch an accused sexual predator, a fellow student. Federal attorneys say details about the severity of the incidents are unavailable because school administrators shredded the boy's disciplinary files.
