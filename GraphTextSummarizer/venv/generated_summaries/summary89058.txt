" After he was released in May in exchange for five senior Taliban members held by the U.S. military, Bergdahl underwent counseling and medical care at a hospital in San Antonio, where he is now back on regular duty at Fort Sam Houston. He will eventually be given a position commensurate with his current rank of sergeant, the Army said last month. Bowe Bergdahl, a former Taliban prisoner, on Thursday wrapped up a two-day interview with an Army investigating officer to discuss his disappearance in Afghanistan five years ago. Bergdahl was a private first class when he was captured, and the Army extended his enlistment and twice promoted him on schedule while he was in captivity. Bergdahl works at the headquarters of U.S. Army North in Texas.
