The colorful rapper retweeted replies from disgruntled fans who took issue with the star's lack of access. However, we do not allow reality TV to be filmed on school property. In a series of tweets posted on Thursday, the rapper implied that her former stomping grounds, New York's Fiorello H. LaGuardia High, turned down her request to speak to the school's students. (When asked directly whether she received an explanation, Minaj tweeted, "not really.") LaGuardia High deferred all comment to the New York Department of Education, who explained that former graduates could return to the school unless it would interrupt the students' learning. It isn't yet clear if Minaj's appearance would have included reality TV cameras.
