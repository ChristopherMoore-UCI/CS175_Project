He was forced to make a monthlong pit stop in Bermuda when the rudder broke in February, but he was back in the water in late March, Chmielinski said. By Tuesday, Doba was less than 200 miles from his destination of New Smyrna Beach, Florida. Doba is paying his own way with his retirement money saved during his career as an engineer, according to Piotr Chmielinski, a friend who helps with his logistics. The mayor and a high school band will be on the beach to greet Doba when he makes landfall, which is expected Friday morning unless another storm kicks up, Chmielinski said. Doba expects to have another 30 years left in his life to explore the world, because members of his family are known to live to 100, Chmielinski said.
