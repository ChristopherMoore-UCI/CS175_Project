They include 4-ounce, 16-ounce and 5-pound bags of alfalfa sprouts, plus 4-ounce and 16-ounce bags of spicy sprouts. -- A potential salmonella outbreak has prompted a multi-state recall of sprouts, an Idaho food company announced Friday. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration made a formal recall request Monday, urging on its website that people not eat alfalfa or spicy sprouts from Evergreen Fresh Sprouts. The recalled sprouts were delivered to four distributors and three retail stores in Idaho and Washington state, Evergreen said in its press release Friday. Nine of those were in Washington state, seven in Montana, three in Idaho, one in North Dakota and one in New Jersey.
