Maj. Steven Hutchison served 22 years in his first Army stint, then returned at age 57. -- Army Maj. Steven Hutchison fought battles in the jungles of Vietnam. Hutchison joined the Army in 1966 and served two one-year tours in Vietnam, according to a news release from Fort Riley, Kansas, home of Hutchison's 1st Infantry Division, the famous "Big Red One." The last communication the brothers had was a routine e-mail Steven Hutchison sent from Iraq about two weeks ago. That decision proved fateful, as Hutchison was able to stand by his wife's side through her battle with breast cancer.
