The flight left from Dubai, United Arab Emirates, Monday morning with 31 metric tons (more than 34 U.S. tons) of emergency supplies and arrived in Mogadishu early Monday afternoon, said Andy Needham from the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. "U.S. assistance will continue funding the urgently needed food, health, shelter, water and sanitation assistance to those who desperately need help," White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said in a statement. -- For the first time in five years, a relief agency dedicated to refugees airlifted emergency aid into the Somali capital of Mogadishu on Monday, according to a spokesman. The UNHCR is calling for more private and government donations for emergency operations in the Horn of Africa, warning that a lack of funds threatens future aid. The U.N. declared famine in five areas of southern Somalia in June, including Mogadishu.
