Defiant Cheney accepts no blame for Iraq Cheney also said that the Bush administration left Iraq in reasonably good shape after years of war, and blamed Obama for not getting a security agreement from Iraqi leader Nouri al-Maliki to keep some U.S. troops there after combat operations ended to help ensure stability. Although a fierce critic of Barack Obama, former Vice President Dick Cheney does not support calls from some on the far right of his party to impeach him, saying it would simply create a distraction. "Obama's failure to provide for a stay-behind force is what created the havoc we see in Iraq today," Cheney said. Asked whether some of the decisions made by him and Bush are responsible for the upheaval in Iraq now, Cheney deflected blame. Cheney, however, did offer limited support for House Republican efforts to sue Obama over their claims he has abused his authority on a number of occasions by unlawfully going around Congress to carry out policy.
