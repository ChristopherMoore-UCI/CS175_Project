9) Peter Van Vossen: RANGERS v Celtic 1996 So bad was this miss, that even now a howler in front of goal is known in Scotland as 'doing a Van Vossen'. 3) Robert Pires/Thierry Henry: ARSENAL v Manchester City 2005 Arsenal were 1-0 ahead, courtesy of an earlier Pires penalty, when they were handed another opportunity from the spot and instead of simply taking the second penalty, Pires attempted to roll the ball to French team-mate Henry. However, four years later, the Welsh winger managed to balloon his shot over the crossbar after a mistake had allowed him a clear run on goal. Despite the easy nature of the chance, Iwelumo is by no means the first player to fail to score in such simple circumstances on British soil... Smith is currently the chief executive of the Scottish Football Association, but during his playing career he was responsible for one of the most famous misses in FA Cup final history.
