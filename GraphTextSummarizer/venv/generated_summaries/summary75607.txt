In the words of a pair of German artists -- Matthias Wermke and Mischa Leinkauf -- the replacement of the Stars and Stripes fluttering above the bridge with two massive white flags last month was nothing more than an "art project" by the two performance artists meant to deal with "questions of historical legacy and art in the public sphere. "The city has always been a magnet for artists, a metropolis praised as 'the global center of creativity,' where new progressive art has its place," the artists said in their statement. NYPD Deputy Commissioner for Intelligence John Miller said at a news conference last month that the NYPD had video showing four or five people crossing the bridge just after 3 a.m. "This may be somebody's art project, or it may be an attempt at making some kind of statement, but at this point it's not clear what the statement is." "White American Flags" was meant in part as a tribute the German-born American architect of the Brooklyn Bridge, John August Roebling, who left Germany in 1831 "in search of a better future in the land of freedom and opportunity," the artists' statement said.
