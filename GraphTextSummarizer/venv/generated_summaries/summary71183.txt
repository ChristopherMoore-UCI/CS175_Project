A coalition of performers launched an online petition asking Facebook to let them use stage names on personal accounts. " "I am a proud Hawaiian who wants to be able display my Hawaiian given name," Silva said in a Facebook post. Many people use fake names on Facebook for safety reasons, Roma said. If people want to use alternative names on Facebook, they have several different options, Souvall said. The petition, which has drawn nearly 20,000 signatures so far, cites safety from stalkers and overzealous fans as one reason performers use stage names on public pages and personal profiles.
