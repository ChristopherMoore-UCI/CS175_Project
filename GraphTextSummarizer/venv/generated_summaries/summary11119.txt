So are millions in the motherland, who have heard the persistent false claims about grave threats, even warning of genocide against Russia's "brothers" in Crimea and elsewhere in Ukraine. There are clear signs that Putin has designs on eastern Ukraine. If Moscow makes a move to seize more of Ukraine, tell the Republic of Georgia, which yearns to join NATO and already lost territory to a similar Russian move, that its request will go on an approval track. Sure, the Russian speakers in Crimea are intoxicated with Russian nationalism right now. NATO will not go to war against Russia over Ukraine.
