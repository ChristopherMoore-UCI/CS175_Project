-- The wife of British hostage Alan Henning pleaded Saturday with the Islamic State terror group to release her husband, describing him as a "peaceful, selfless man" who was only in Syria to help people in need. Henning, a taxi driver from Bolton in northern England, was part of a team of volunteers traveling to Syria to deliver food and water to people in need when he was abducted in December 2013. Statement from family of David Haines, killed by ISIS jihadists Henning was kidnapped by ISIS a day after the video was made. "Alan is a peaceful, selfless man who left his family and his job as a taxi driver in the UK to drive in a convoy all the way to Syria with his Muslim colleagues and friends to help those most in need," Henning's wife said in the statement. While part of the convoy stopped at the Turkish border, Henning -- the only non-Muslim in the group -- volunteered to cross into Syria with a 10-person advance party.
