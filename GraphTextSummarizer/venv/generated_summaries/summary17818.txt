Klinko and his attorney turned over to ICE documentation and findings from their investigation, which, in turn, led to the government's investigation into Romero's marriage to Ross," Canterberry's affidavit says The complaint names Michael Ball as a target of the federal investigation, alleging that he helped arrange the sham marriage while Romero was modeling for his company. The former lawyer, Anthony Lopresti, said in a filing in Klinko's bankruptcy case that it was Klinko who hired the investigator "to pursue the criminal prosecution and/or deportation of Ms. Romero." "Klinko went to great lengths to see to it that this case was criminally prosecuted and ... did so because of his animus toward defendant Fernanda Romero," a defense petition said. Klinko said he turned the evidence over to the government because he feared extortion from Ball and Romero. According to a sworn affidavit by ICE Senior Special Agent Bonita Canterberry filed in the case, Klinko and Romero's relationship ended in 2007, about the same time Klinko filed a lawsuit against Rock & Republic jeans company and its owner, Ball, alleging breach of contract in relation to a photo shoot.
