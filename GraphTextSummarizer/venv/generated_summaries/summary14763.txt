Now, a typical day for Flemming starts with a few ounces of low or no-sodium turkey breast, a serving of dry cereal, a bowl of non-fat Greek yogurt with artificial sweetener and a glass of low-sodium vegetable juice. Flemming now hopes to go back to school to become a therapist specializing in weight loss, depression and anxiety. Flemming was addicted to alcohol, severely morbidly obese and full of self-pity when he met Jackie Eastham through a random match on Draw Something, the Pictionary-like mobile game. Eastham lived in England and was 20 years Flemming's senior. I feel that she saved my life, even though she would never take credit," Flemming wrote in a blog post. "Brian is so inspiring," Eastham said.
