-- Authorities arrested a man accused of secretly taping ESPN sports reporter Erin Andrews in the nude and posting the videos on the Internet, the FBI said Friday. FBI agents said they found evidence that a peephole to the door of Andrews' hotel room had been altered. The FBI learned that Barrett checked into the same hotel at that time and asked for a room adjacent to Andrews using his home address to register for the room. Andrews works as a sideline reporter traveling around the country covering college football games. Authorities arrested 48-year-old Michael David Barrett at Chicago O'Hare International Airport on Friday.
