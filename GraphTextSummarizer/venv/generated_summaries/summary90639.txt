London attack mirrors plot to behead Muslim soldier The soldier had apparently been on duty in central London and was returning to the Royal Artillery Barracks in Woolwich when he was attacked, Raynsford said. "I understand people want answers, but I must stress we are in the early stages of investigations." Centuries-old barracks part of London neighborhood Cameron -- who was in France at the time of the incident but headed back home promptly -- declined to confirm if the man killed was a serving soldier, while Britain's Defense Ministry said it was investigating to see whether that's the case. Letchworth said both suspects were taken to separate London hospitals for treatment. Even as they worked to piece together what happened and why, British authorities beefed up security around Woolwich and all military barracks in London, according to a British government source.
