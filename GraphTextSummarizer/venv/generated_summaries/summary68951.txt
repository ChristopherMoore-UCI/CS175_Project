-- I came to Mobile World Congress expected to be wowed by lots of shiny new gadgets, but I'm leaving impressed by the seemingly less sexy subject of mobile operating systems. Ubuntu Touch is an operating system for mobiles and tablets coming in October. They are lashing themselves to Firefox OS in the hope that it will lead to more money for them down the line. It doesn't have the big names attached to it like Firefox OS and Tizen, but it feels a lot slicker to us. It essentially looks a lot like Android, but seemed pretty janky to us and a long way from being ready for release to consumers.
