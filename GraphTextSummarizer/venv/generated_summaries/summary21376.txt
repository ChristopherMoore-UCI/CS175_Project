" Serena Williams cheered on her sibling from the players' box during the victory over Radwanska and said following her own win over Garbine Muguruza that she was still inspired by Venus. If Serena and Venus Williams -- who have combined to tally 25 majors -- both win their quarterfinals Wednesday, they'll meet at a grand slam for the first time since the Wimbledon final in 2009. Further it was her first top-10 win at a major since downing Italy's Francesca Schiavone at the 2010 U.S. Open. When the 34-year-old beat sixth-seed Agnieszka Radwanska 6-3 2-6 6-1, she ensured a quarterfinal berth at a grand slam for the first time in five years. "Of course, I want to be playing deep in all my events," Venus Williams told reporters.
