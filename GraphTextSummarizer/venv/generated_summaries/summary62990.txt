Jorge Barahona has been charged with aggravated child abuse, the West Palm Beach Police Department said and will likely face other charges. As often is the case when children are in the Florida foster system, a volunteer from the guardian ad litem program was assigned to look out for their best interests. Child investigators were called on more than one occasion to the home. The most recent was a call to a child abuse hotline received just days before the twins were found in the truck, according to testimony Wednesday. The bond he refers to is the five years the twins lived with the Barahonas as their foster children before being adopted by them in 2009.
