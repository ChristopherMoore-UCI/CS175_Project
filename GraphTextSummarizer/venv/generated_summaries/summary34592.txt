But on Friday, District Attorney Garnett said that Ridley altered his earlier statement to police. Ridley took the baby and his wife to the emergency room of Longmont United Hospital, and the hospital told police the baby "would have been viable," the police report said. Boulder County District Attorney Stanley L. Garnett was unable to file a murder charge under state law, and he highlighted how the coroner found that the fetus didn't show any signs of life outside the womb, Garnett said. David Ridley, the 35-year-old husband of Dynel Lane, told police he found his wife "covered in blood" in the family home and later found "a small baby lying in the bathtub," a Longmont police report said. The female fetus didn't exhibit "any signs of life outside of the womb, therefore the circumstance is not being considered a live birth," Coroner Emma R. Hall said in a statement.
