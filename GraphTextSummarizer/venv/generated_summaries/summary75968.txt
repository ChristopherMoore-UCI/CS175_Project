And there was an even bigger increase in the number of respondents who said they follow political figures on Facebook and other social media. Republican and Republican-leaning voters also said they like following politicians directly on social media because it allows them to skip the filter of traditional media outlets. In past elections, critics have complained that Facebook's testing of the megaphone tool -- for example, using the worlds "I Voted" on some and "I'm Voting" on others to see which had more impact -- could have an unfair impact on turnout. In all, 16% of registered voters said they follow politicians on social media, compared with the 6% who said they did so in 2010. Cell phones and social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter are playing a bigger role in how Americans get their political information, according to a new survey from the Pew Research Center.
