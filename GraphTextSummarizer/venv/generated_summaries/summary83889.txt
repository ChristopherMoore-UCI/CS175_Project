Editor's note: Paul Begala, a Democratic strategist and CNN political contributor, was a political consultant for Bill Clinton's presidential campaign in 1992 and was counselor to Clinton in the White House. Paul Begala says he admired Robert Novak for his skepticism about authority, work ethic and faith in his beliefs. When I was a White House official, one of my most dreaded responsibilities was dealing with Bob. He did the show via satellite from Atlanta, Georgia, and when Coach Gary Williams cut down the net for the Terps, Bob was courtside. In our innumerable debates, I delighted in calling Bob Novak "the finest mind of the 12th century."
