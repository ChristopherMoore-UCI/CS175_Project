German international Marco Reus put Dortmund ahead with a well-struck free kick just before the break, but Wolfsburg hit back with two second half goals from Ricardo Rodriguez and Croatia striker Ivica Olic to register a fourth straight victory which moves them up to fifth in the table. Jurgen Klopp's men followed a 1-0 Champions League defeat to English league leaders Arsenal with a 2-1 loss at Wolfsburg. In Saturday's other fixtures, Aston Villa beat Cardiff 2-0, Norwich City beat West Ham United 3-1 and bottom-of-the-table Crystal Palace drew 0-0 with Everton. The win sees the Reds move to within two points of leaders Arsenal who travel to Manchester United on Sunday. Only an injury time penalty by Belgian striker Eden Hazard preserved Jose Mourinho's record of never having lost a league match at Stamford Bridge.
