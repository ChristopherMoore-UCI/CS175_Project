" British PM condemns brutal attack on soldier in London Meanwhile in Woolwich itself, resident Felix Rios captured a poignant image of a black flower placed at Woolwich Arsenal train station Thursday morning. Many Britons, including soldiers, used photo-sharing service Instagram to post picture tributes in the hours following the attack. A particularly popular tribute was of armbands emblazoned with the name of the charity Help for Heroes, a British armed forces organization that supports wounded soldiers. A brazen attack on a serving soldier in the British army, brutally hacked to death in broad daylight in the southeast district of Woolwich, has sparked fear, anger and a search for answers -- but also moving tributes to the man who died.
