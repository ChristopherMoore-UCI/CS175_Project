"On a practical level, a previously unknown, undiscovered asteroid seems to hit our planet and cause damage or injury once a century or so, as we witnessed on June 20, 1908, and February 15, 2013," said Bob Berman, Slooh host and astronomer. But the ongoing threat, and the fact that biosphere-altering events remain a real if small annual possibility, suggests that discovering and tracking all NEOs (near-Earth objects), as well as setting up contingency plans for deflecting them on short notice should the need arise, would be a wise use of resources." The blast left more than 1,500 injured, mostly by glass from shattered windows, and raised concerns about humanity's vulnerability to stray asteroids. Slooh.com tracks potentially hazardous objects, like asteroids and comets. Berman added: "Every few centuries, an even more massive asteroid strikes us -- fortunately usually impacting in an ocean or wasteland such as Antarctica.
