-- Rafael Nadal warmed up for next week's Indian Wells hard-court tournament by thrashing David Ferrer in the final of the Mexican Open at Acapulco Sunday. Since his return from a seven month absence with a knee injury in February, Nadal has won 12 of his 13 matches, coming second in Vina del Mar, Chile, before winning at Sao Paulo last month. In the women's final, Italian top seed Sara Errani breezed past second seed Carla Suarez Navarro of Spain 6-0 6-4. He is not an easy player to beat," Ferrer told reporters. Federer: 'Naive to think tennis is clean' Nadal required just 65 minutes to defeat Ferrer, winning 81% of his first serve points, while saving both of the break points he faced.
