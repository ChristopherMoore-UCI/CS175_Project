But the military sniper, long held in suspicion for his independence by Marines and other American military units, has an almost romantic appeal for those immersed in gun culture. The Western-style showdown staged in "American Sniper" between Kyle and the crack enemy sniper Mustafa (Sammy Sheik) is not only a nod to Eastwood's filmmaking history, but to a fundamental figure in American history: the lone gunman, on a crusade to make the world safe. He is the perfect hero for a country that has made a cult of the art of precision shooting, whether in combat or at the local range or gun show, and a country that clings to the right to bear arms, no matter how many civilian casualties, Kyle among them, accumulate. Unlike a helicopter or airplane pilot or tank commander -- to cite icons of other times, other wars -- the sniper works alone. The sniper's ascent comes in part from his utility in American counterinsurgency campaigns such as those conducted in Afghanistan and Iraq.
