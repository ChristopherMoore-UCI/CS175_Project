So the refunds, for the portions of government operations that have been shuttered, are owed. On the one side of the federal government shutdown are the people whose job it is to run that government: the Congress and the White House. Some people may not like how the government operates; some may not care for a particular president or a particular member of Congress or a particular government program. We pay federal income tax with one solitary and bedrock expectation: We are handing our money over so that the federal government will run. But when we are told that the government has been shut down-- that it has been closed for business -- that's different.
