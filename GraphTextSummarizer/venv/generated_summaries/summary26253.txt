We look forward to him returning to golf." Elsewhere, PGA Tour Commissioner Tim Finchem told CNN that Woods' words contained a message of good news after some months of bad headlines. -- Six-time former major champion Nick Faldo said that big questions surrounding the future of Tiger Woods still remain despite the world No. 1 apologizing for his "irresponsible and selfish behavior" in a public statement on Friday. Hopefully we can maintain the decorum we have had at our tournament in the past, and we'd ask golf fans to react positively to his requests." " In response to the criticism Woods faced over refusing to take questions at the press conference, Finchem said: "I don't know the extent to which the media will allow him the opportunity to return in the way he wants. "The good news from today is that one, he plans to return to golf; two, it could be by the end of the year, and three, he's taking the right steps to return.
