It all started last week when a group of Princeton researchers published a paper that suggested Facebook could lose a whopping 80% of its users by 2017. Recent research has suggested, and Facebook has admitted, that younger users are abandoning Facebook for other social platforms. A Princeton University spokesman did not immediately respond Friday to CNN's request for comment. It's an Internet feud between polar opposites: East Coast vs. West Coast, old school vs. new media, Ivy League gravitas vs. Silicon Valley geekery. "It's an old journalistic trick: Just add the words 'research' or 'study' to a sensational claim for instant credibility," wrote Slate's Will Oremus, who criticized news outlets for reporting uncritically on the paper.
