Departures on January 6, 23 and 30 and February 6 and 13 have been added to cancellations originally stretching through mid-January. "We sincerely apologize to our guests for having to cancel these additional cruises," said Gerry Cahill, Carnival's president and CEO. -- Carnival Cruise Lines announced five more cancelled sailings Wednesday on the Carnival Splendor to allow more time to repair the ship damaged by fire last month. Refunds or future cruise credits are being provided to impacted travelers. Carnival will also reimburse passengers for air travel change fees and some customers will be eligible for a 25 percent discount and/or an onboard credit on a future cruise.
