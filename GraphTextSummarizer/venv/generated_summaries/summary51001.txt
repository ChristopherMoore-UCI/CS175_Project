Ni√±o took us to Mogo Mogo, one of many uninhabited islands just off the shore of Contadora. "We're filming." Contadora, one of Panama's Pearl Islands, draws visitors with beautiful beaches and excellent snorkeling. Contadora locals certainly make money off the film staff, medics and contestants, but evidently they haven't printed the T-shirts yet. First let me tell you how we stumbled onto the Pearl Islands in Panama, and then I'll tell you how we came upon the Orange Tribe on the island of Mogo Mogo. We jumped out of the boat, waded through the clear, warm blue water and onto Mogo Mogo, unacknowledged as work continued on the wooden set.
