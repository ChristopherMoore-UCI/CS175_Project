The boys, ages 5 and 7, were found dead Monday morning at an apartment in Campbellton, New Brunswick. The store, Reptile Ocean Inc., offered condolences on its Facebook page before the page shut down. They had been sleeping over at a friend's apartment above a reptile store, according to a statement from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. It showed police cars, cones and yellow tape blocking off the area. Autopsies on the boys' bodies will be performed Tuesday.
