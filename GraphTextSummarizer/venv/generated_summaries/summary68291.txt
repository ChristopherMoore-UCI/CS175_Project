Zidane: the ex-footballer identifies mutual respect as the most important quality that players need to exhibit within a team. -- Zinedine Zidane is sure of the quality most necessary to create a successful team: mutual respect. Under the tenure of President Florentino PÃ©rez the club made a host of big-name transfers including Portuguese international Luis Figo, Brazil star Ronaldo, Zidane and David Beckham. Zidane says great teams need clear and defined leaders that the players can rally behind. After a 2001 friendly match between France and Algeria had to be abandoned when angry young French Arabs invaded the pitch, Zidane was forced to break his silence, publically repudiating the libel.
