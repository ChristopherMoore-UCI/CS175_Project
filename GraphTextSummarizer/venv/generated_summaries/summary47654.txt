"North Korea's nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs constitute a threat to U.S. national security and to international peace and security," President Barack Obama said after the North's nuclear test last month. Russia, another veto holder, will support a resolution on North Korea if it doesn't go beyond "missile and nuclear issues," Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Gennady Gatilov said Tuesday, according to the Russian news agency Interfax. Analysts say Beijing wants to maintain the North as a buffer between its border and South Korea, a U.S. ally. It was the first nuclear test the isolated state has carried out since its young leader, Kim Jong Un, inherited power in December 2011 after the death of his father, Kim Jong Il, who made building up North Korea's military strength the focus of his 17-year rule. The U.N. Security Council is expected to meet Tuesday to consider a proposed resolution to authorize more sanctions against North Korea following the secretive regime's controversial nuclear test last month.
