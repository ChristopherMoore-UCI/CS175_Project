Marc Spiegler, the director of Art Basel, says that the fair in Miami Beach is going from strength to strength. For many of these stars, Art Basel Miami Beach is about much more than lavish parties and bacchanalian nights. Still, this year's Art Basel Miami Beach, which wrapped last night, might as well have been staged on a red carpet. -- When you mix the neon-lit, art-deco splendor of Miami beach with one of the world's most bankable art fairs, throw in a horde of fashion designers and a seemingly unending list of parties, you'd be hard-pressed to stop the celebrities from showing up. "I've bumped into Jay Z and Beyonc√© in Miami a couple of times," says Emily Tsingou, a private art dealer based in London and a regular at Art Basel.
