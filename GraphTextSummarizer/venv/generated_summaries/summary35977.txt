-- A cruise ship of the Costa Cruises line is adrift off the coast of the Seychelles after a fire in its engine room, the Italian coast guard said Monday. The Seychelles is sending a tug, and merchant ships in the area are steaming toward the Allegra, the coast guard said. The ship, the Allegra, is a sister of the Costa Concordia, which wrecked off the coast of Italy on January 13, killing at least 21 people. The Allegra's fire has been put out, and the passengers are all in good health, the authorities said. The fire left the Allegra without propulsion, although its communications equipment is intact, the authorities said.
