But many of the images appear to be faked with the software program Photoshop and the ones that were not faked seem to depict the launch of a Chinese ballistic missile, said Geoffrey Forden, an MIT weapons analyst. They have said they were trying to determine whether the objects were private or military aircraft, rocket flares, reflection in the sky or something else. Forden, who also specializes in Russian and Chinese space systems, published his analysis on a blog called "Arms Control Wonk." In the analysis, Forden used scientific theories to examine the images of the flying object that he felt were not created with Photoshop. Chinese officials have been looking into the reports about UFOs.
