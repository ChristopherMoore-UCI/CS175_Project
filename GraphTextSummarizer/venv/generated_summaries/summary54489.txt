In doing the Push Across America, I wanted to help promote disability sports in the United States and encourage people to view athletes with disabilities in the same way they view other athletes -- in other words, no differently. During my Paralympic experience in London, where 80,000 fans cheered for me and my fellow Paralympians at each and every event, I was impressed with how the fans embraced us as athletes -- athletes first, Paralympians second. I also wanted to build awareness for the potential of all persons with disabilities and disability sports. I started playing sports at a young age and gravitated toward wheelchair basketball and track. Stay-Focused offers a SCUBA certification program for teens and young adults with disabilities.
