Police said Wednesday they had received 370 leads, and Massey said Friday that investigators and searchers had spent "many thousands of hours looking for Ayla (and) evaluating evidence." Waterville Police Chief Joseph Massey previously has said authorities were confident that someone took Ayla from the house. Jessica Reynolds said Friday that she and her sister, Trista, are frantic in their efforts to find Ayla. On December 15, the day before Ayla went missing, Reynolds filed a complaint seeking sole custody. The toddler's mother, Trista Reynolds, told HLN's Nancy Grace that she'd raised Ayla for 18 months and Dipietro became involved after "I needed to go and get a little bit of help for myself."
