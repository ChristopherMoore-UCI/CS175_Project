From there Djibouti Port was just a few hours away, hours that stretched into infinity for the families ringing my phone to check that their loved ones had made it into harbor. It was time to go into town to see what life was like for the people of Aden. It didn't look like much, but we'd been told it was typical of the kind of craft ferrying the route between Djibouti and Aden. As we arrived back at port, we found we weren't leaving alone. After waiting at port, praying a passing ship would dock, ours had become an unexpected lifeline for some of the families caught in the fighting.
