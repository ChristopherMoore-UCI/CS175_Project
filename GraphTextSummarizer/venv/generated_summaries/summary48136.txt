However, despite this, Muslim elites have been unable to de-link themselves from the source of their identity as Muslims -- the religion of Islam itself. For decades, Muslim elites have pursued a policy of disassociation from classical Islamic institutions and sometimes even the religion itself. Any such vision will have to be at once grounded in the roots of Muslim identity and positively engaged with the greater society. The original institutions, native to Muslim society -- whether religious or civil -- had always provided a balancing effect to the community, securing the integrity of self-understanding, memory, and praxis -- thereby facilitating balanced and responsible citizenship. Community leaders both East and West have been unable to articulate a clear direction for Muslims that illustrates a positive, authentic identity that is engaged as a participant in global society.
