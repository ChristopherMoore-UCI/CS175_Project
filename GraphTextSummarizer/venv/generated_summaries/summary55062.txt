Warriner wed Tuesday in the NICU of Cook Children's Hospital in Fort Worth, where baby JJ has been since September. He was born 15 weeks early on September 2; his twin, Colt Austin, died in utero. She started having contractions on September 1, and JJ, which stands for Justin Jr., arrived the next day. With the help of Cook Children's staff, the couple wed in JJ's room, surrounded by family and their 8-year-old daughter, and invited local media to witness the event. Warriner went to the emergency room on August 31 and discovered baby Colt had passed away.
