"Eric Frein had a mission that was to attack law enforcement," Noonan said. Heavily armed U.S. marshals captured Frein on Thursday night and turned him over to state police, who slapped the slain officer's cuffs on him, put him in the back of the trooper's squad car and sent him back to the barracks where the ambush occurred. Authorities have not discussed a motive but have said Frein has talked and written about hating law enforcement. According to the criminal complaint against him, Frein searched the Internet going back to 2012 for information related on placing supply caches, police manhunt techniques and how to evade them and other topics. "We just thought it was fitting," State Police Commissioner Frank Noonan said.
