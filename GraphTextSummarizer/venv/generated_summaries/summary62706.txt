This leg of the tour will be full of photo opportunities -- but Kate and William may well have mixed views about that. The last leg to Malaysia was overshadowed by the French magazine Closer's decision to publish pictures of Kate sunbathing topless while on a private holiday with William in France. As they arrive in the Solomon Islands on the next step of their Asian tour, "Welkom William and Kate" is the message the royal couple will see on huge billboards scattered across the capital, Honiara. -- After the furor caused by a French magazine's decision to publish topless photos of the Duchess of Cambridge, she and Prince William will be more than ready to get away from it all in the South Pacific. What will hearten, and possibly surprise, William and Kate when they get here is that nobody is talking about the topless pictures.
