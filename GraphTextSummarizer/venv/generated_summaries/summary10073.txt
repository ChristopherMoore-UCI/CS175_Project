Character actors -- and Hoffman, for all his intensity, was a character actor -- support movie stars. For years, Hoffman was the kind of anonymous character actor who earned critical raves but was often unnoticed by the general public. " "Philip Seymour Hoffman's precise, uncanny performance as Capote doesn't imitate the author so much as channel him, as a man whose peculiarities mask great intelligence and deep wounds," wrote Roger Ebert about 2005's "Capote." Hoffman was found dead Sunday. He worked with director Paul Thomas Anderson ("Boogie Nights," "Magnolia," "The Master") before either was a big name, and Anderson provided him with a steady stream of interesting roles. Indeed, even when movie stars do try to disappear, we're all too aware of the tricks, whether it's weight gain, a putty nose or an unfamiliar accent.
