" Not only did Hunter's peck get him suspended from school, but the school accused him of sexual harassment, KRDO reported. "I remember writing on the chalkboard 'I will not kiss girls at school,' and it was a private Christian school ... go figure." Robin Gooldy, the superintendent of Ca√±on City Schools, told KRDO that Hunter's record will remain within the district and that his behavior fits the school policy description of sexual harassment, which includes unwanted touching. Now my son's asking questions, 'What is sex, mommy?'" She said Hunter had problems at school before, getting suspended for rough-housing and for kissing the same girl on the cheek. " Hunter for his part said he feels "sorry" for doing something wrong and tries to be good in school.
