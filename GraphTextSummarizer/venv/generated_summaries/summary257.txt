-- Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund recorded thumping wins in the Bundesliga on Saturday as both teams returned to domestic action following Champions League triumphs in midweek. First-half goals from German defender Jerome Boateng, Mario Gomez and Brazilian Rafinha gave the home side a virtually unassailable lead before Swiss winger Xherdan Shaqiri grabbed a fourth 11 minutes into the second half. After narrowly getting past Malaga in their Champions League quarterfinal on Tuesday, Dortmund made lighter work of Greuther Fuerth on Saturday. Jupp Heynckes rested nine of the team who beat Juventus 2-0 in the Champions League quarterfinal but still cruised to victory. The 6-1 hammering of the Bundesliga's bottom side sees Jurgen Klopp's side consolidate second place in the table.
