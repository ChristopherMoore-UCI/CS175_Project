Rahman, who is also a professor of Arabic at the University of Memphis, said he and his colleague cooperated throughout the process and thanked Transportation Security Administration agents and others for their kindness and courtesy. Rahman, with Zaghloul by his side, eventually got to North Carolina and talked to CNN from there. Earlier, Rahman told CNN affiliate WCNC that the incident reminded him of the prejudice Rosa Parks faced during the civil rights movement. " Ibrahim Hooper, spokesman for the civil rights group Council on American-Islamic Relations, told CNN the two men contacted his office and said they were told that other passengers did not want them on board the small commuter plane. "Atlantic Southeast Airlines Flight 5452 from Memphis to Charlotte returned to the gate to allow for additional screening of a passenger and the passenger's companion," the statement said.
