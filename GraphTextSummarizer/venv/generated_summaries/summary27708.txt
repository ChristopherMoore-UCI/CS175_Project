Acting Director Todd Jones said after 30 days of studying ATF issues and staff he is instigating a major shuffle of ATF personnel but is not yet firing anyone. He then quickly confirmed he was talking about the controversial "Operation Fast and Furious" in ATF's Phoenix Division, which featured ATF agents allowing illegally purchased firearms to "walk" from Arizona gun stores across the Mexican border and into the hands of drug cartels. "I'm a political appointee, but I'm not a politician," Jones told a dozen reporters at ATF headquarters in Washington. "These have been difficult times for everyone in ATF because of a case in a division," Jones told reporters. Jones also said he understood trust has been damaged within ATF and said it would take time to heal.
