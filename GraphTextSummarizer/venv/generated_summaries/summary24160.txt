The high court rejected lawyers' arguments that Mohammad Munaf and Shawqi Ahmad Omar should be released, saying that U.S. courts are not allowed to intervene in foreign courts. -- Suspected terrorists and foreign fighters held by the U.S. military at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, have the right to challenge their detention in federal court, the Supreme Court ruled Thursday. In 2004, the justices also affirmed the right of prisoners to challenge their detention in federal court. "I have long been an advocate of closing Guantanamo, so I would hope this is in furtherance of taking that action," Pelosi said. Under the system, those facing trial would have a limited right to appeal any conviction, reducing the jurisdiction of federal courts.
