Public service reform, tax collection reform, electoral law reform are made impossible, because an unreformed party system would always treat reform as a deadly threats. " Ministers walk into their fiefs, escorted by dozens of political counselors who take over from the counselors of the previous minister and do the job, instead of the top public servants, who are discarded, unless they are party loyalists. A retired public servant once described to me the process: "When parties alternate in power after an election, what goes on in the public service is a hand over from one mafia organization to its rival. Public service has thus become gradually annexed to a party system, distributing the spoils of power. Parliament has been subdued to party leaders, as members of the majority usually express loyalty to the leader, waiting their turn for a ministerial post.
