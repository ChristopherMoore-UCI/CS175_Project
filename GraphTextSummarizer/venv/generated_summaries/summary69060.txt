We know what such a step will require: spending cuts and some revenue increases, best achieved with tax reform and entitlement reform. What's doubly dumb about this particular battle is that it is over relatively small change -- some $2.5 billion in disaster relief at a time when a bipartisan joint super committee is struggling to find a minimum of $1.2 trillion in deficit reduction. For example, one solution would be to cut tax rates but close select loopholes, allowing higher revenue to be raised from lower rates. House Republicans played politics with disaster relief and felt that they would be rewarded by their base if they do so. Even Bill Clinton and House Speaker Newt Gingrich found ways to work together despite intense personal dislike, achieving welfare reform and turning deficits into a surplus.
