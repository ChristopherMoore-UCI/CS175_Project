NBC plans to return "Smash" in midseason, giving time for new showrunner Josh Safran ("Gossip Girl") to creatively polish the series. UPDATE: Brian d'Arcy James, who played Julia's (Debra Messing) husband Frank, and Will Chase, who played Julia's former lover Michael, are leaving "Smash," too. Philandering fiancÃ© Dev (Raza Jaffrey) and devious assistant Ellis (Jaime Cepero) will not be regulars in the show's second season, sources say.
