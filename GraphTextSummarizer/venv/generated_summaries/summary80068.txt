At 28, Garfield's slightly older than Maguire was when he played Peter Parker in 2002, but his combination of fresh-faced innocence, nervous agitation and wry humor is immediately appealing. " Only 10 years have passed since Tobey Maguire started swinging through the urban jungle in "Spider-Man," and now Andrew Garfield is stepping into his flight path in what often feels like a straight-up remake. The biggest plus point has to be Garfield, the Anglo-American actor who played Mark Zuckerberg's former friend and ally in "The Social Network." Not surprisingly, director Marc Webb -- whose last film was the sleeper rom-com "(500) Days of Summer" -- employs a deft hand with the relationship scenes, and Garfield and Stone have a nice, frisky rapport. When the semi-sympathetic Dr. Connors rashly doses himself into a poor man's Godzilla -- a Middle-aged Mutant Ninja Lizard -- Webb dutifully strings together three or four wham-bang set pieces, including a novel interlude in the sewers, where Spidey spins his own advance warning system, a welcome breath of presumably foul air after all his usual zip-lining antics.
