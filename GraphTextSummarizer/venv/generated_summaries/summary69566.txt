Greek activities at the university, including "all chapter social and pledging activities," have been suspended "until further notice," according to a joint statement released by the university, the Inter-Fraternity Council and the Panhellenic Council. The Sigma Chi chapter was suspended by its national chapter and the university after fraternity members were accused of taking 19 fraternity pledges into a residential neighborhood and ordering them to find their way home. Clemson suspended all Greek social and pledging activities following the death of a 19-year-old sophomore, one of a "high number" of incidents involving fraternities on the South Carolina campus. The national chapter of Kappa Sigma Fraternity said it was investigating the events surrounding Burch's death. That incident is also under investigation by police, he said.
