Kirby Archer is expected to change his plea to guilty in exchange for a prosecutors' agreement not to seek the death penalty against him, according to Jeff Branam, an uncle of slain boat captain Jake Branam. Archer and Guillermo Zarabozo are charged with four counts each of first-degree murder, kidnapping and robbery in the deaths of Branam; his wife, Kelly; his half-brother Scott Gamble; and first mate Samuel Kairy. Jeff Branam said the government's case against the two appears strong but said he's glad a jury won't decide Archer's fate. Jeff Branam said the victims' relatives met with prosecutors a few days ago. Archer, 36, was once an Army MP who served at the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
