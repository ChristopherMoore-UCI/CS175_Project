Several police cars and an assault vehicle were disabled in the chase and gunfight, police said. They not only hit homes and cars on busy streets with their bullets, but they also lost police at one point and used the opportunity to attack rather than escape, Jones said. Asked why police opened fire on the men when they held a woman hostage, police spokesman Joseph Silva told reporters, "There was a fear for safety, not only for our officers, but also for the community. Gunfire from a semiautomatic "AK-47-type assault rifle" and other weapons struck 14 of the 50 or so squad cars that gave chase, police said. It wasn't clear whether police or the robbers killed her, but one suspect acknowledged using her as a human shield, Jones said.
