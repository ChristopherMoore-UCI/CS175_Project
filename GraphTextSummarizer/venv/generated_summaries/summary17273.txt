The swearing-in eventually took place but was delayed, the MDC said, because Mugabe and his ZANU-PF party wanted to appoint more ministers than they were allowed in the new government. Roy Bennett, left, pictured with MDC leader Morgan Tzvangirai, is also the party's treasurer. The incident happened the same day that other MDC ministers in the new unity government took their oaths of office. The stalemate lasted for more than an hour, until Mugabe's party agreed that only 17 of their proposed ministers take office. The Movement for Democratic Change nominated Bennett to be deputy minister of agriculture in a national unity government with President Robert Mugabe's ZANU-PF party, which has ruled the country since independence in 1980.
