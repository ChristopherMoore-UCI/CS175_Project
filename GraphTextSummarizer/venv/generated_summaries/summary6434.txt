During World War II, the Japanese army forced American and Filipino prisoners of war on a march so horrific that the Japanese commander was later executed for war crimes. The brutal conditions of the march contributed to the subsequent deaths of an estimated 25,000 Filipinos and 1500 Americans in Japanese prison camps, says Michael Norman, a Vietnam veteran who wrote "Tears in the Darkness," with his wife, Elizabeth. Steele says Bataan taught him to treasure small pleasures, like a drink of cool water and a warm bed at night. Steele also discovered that he and Koyama had something else in common: a passion for drawing Montana's rural life. By the end of the semester, Koyama was one of Steele's best students.
