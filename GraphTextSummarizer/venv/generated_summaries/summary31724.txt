Depending on the source of jet fuel and how it's cultivated, Caryn estimates using biofuel could reduce carbon emissions between 50 and 80%, depending mainly on the feedstock and conversion process. "Today, bio jet fuel is still three to four times more expensive than fossil fuel, because there's no continuous production. To name just a few partnerships, the airplane manufacturer teamed with Virgin Australia Airlines to to produce sustainable aviation fuels from eucalyptus mallee trees in Australia. Airbus has similarly partnered with local producers and airlines to sniff out sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels. Airbus has also joined other aerospace companies in launching the ITAKA initiative, a collaborative project funded by the European Union to produce and test the use of sustainable jet fuel.
