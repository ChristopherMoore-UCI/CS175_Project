Juarez municipal police spokesman Jacinto Seguro said Friday that federal police were responding to a call that a police officer had been killed. He said that while Friday's car bombing did not appear very sophisticated, he noted that Mexican drug cartels are often advised by former members of Colombian cartels. La Linea is an extension of the Juarez cartel, made up in part of former Juarez police officers, according to authorities. Jose Marulanda, a security analyst based in Bogota, Colombia, called Friday's bombing a "turning point" in Mexico's drug war and found it remniscent of Colombia's own battle with cartels and car bombs in the 1990s. Earlier in the day, police announced the arrest of Jesus Armando Acosta Guerrero, believed to be a leader in the Juarez cartel -- one of two drug trafficking organizations operating in the area.
