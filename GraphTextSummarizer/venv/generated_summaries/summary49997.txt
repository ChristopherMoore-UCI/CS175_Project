"We hope It is the beginning of a republican dialogue," said Miaka Oureto, acting president of the Front Populaire Ivoirien, the party of former President Laurent Gbagbo, at the end of the meeting. In the days following the capture and arrest of Gbagbo, the newly installed president appointed former Ivorian prime minister and political ally Jean Konan Banny as president of a commission for reconciliation that he vowed "would be fair and independent. How could there be reconciliation when Laurent Gbagbo, his wife and most of our political leaders are illegally imprisoned with their assets frozen?" asked Gbabgo communication adviser Alain Toussaint. Last week, Gbagbo's party pulled out of the commission in charge of the elections, citing a "recent modification of the electoral commission's composition in favor of the coalition of parties behind President Ouattara." -- President Alassane Ouattara opened negotiations Thursday with a coalition of opposition parties to try to convince supporters of the country's former president not to boycott upcoming parliamentary elections.
