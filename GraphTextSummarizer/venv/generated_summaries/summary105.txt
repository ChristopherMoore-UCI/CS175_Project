In the defense opening statement Friday, defense attorney Juan Guerra told jurors he would call experts on domestic violence. Wolf also said cocaine was found in the victim's system, and several witnesses testified to his occasional drug use, which defense attorney say may have rendered him aggressive. Explicit photographs of the victim's wound-riddled body were displayed for jurors, with defense attorney Jonathan Munier describing the man as a "leaking sieve" from injures ranging from his head to his genitals and legs. Wice attributed his client's sentence to rookie defense attorneys who were "steamrolled" by a veteran prosecutor. Wright, flanked by new attorneys, cried often during the testimony this week but smiled at the mention of her two children, now in the care of her former in-laws.
