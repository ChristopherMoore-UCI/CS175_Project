-- Three times, Adrian Pracon prepared to die on Utoya island, a Norwegian paradise turned to hell Friday. Police and rescue teams were still combing Utoya island -- 13 boats on the water and a meter-by-meter land search, said Sven Mollekleiv, president of Norwegian Red Cross. Pracon was surprised to hear the shooter speaking Norwegian. But for Pracon, Haheim and other survivors of the slaughter, a long journey of healing lies ahead. As though it was more satisfying to shoot at a group of fleeing people, Pracon thought.
