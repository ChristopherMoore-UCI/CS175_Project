A private launch event September 7 in New York's Times Square was described in media reports as a "madhouse" with celebs such as Emma Roberts, Camilla Belle and Rachel Zoe in attendance. The collection was scheduled to be available from Tuesday through October 22 at Target stores and Target.com. The much-anticipated launch of a new collaborative line between Italian designer Missoni and Target caused the retailer's website to crash several times Tuesday. Target has collaborated with other designers before, from Isaac Mizrahi to Jean Paul Gaultier, but none to this effect. A full-priced knit scarf by the iconic Italian designer runs from $175 to $200 at department stores such as Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus.
