European banks have seen U.S. dollars flow out as U.S. financial institutions and money market accounts scale back exposure to European banks, amid fears over those institutions' exposure to debt held by Greece and other European nations. Finance ministers for the European Union member states, central bank presidents and representatives of other major financial bodies will also be present. The European Central Bank, along with the Fed, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan and the Swiss National Bank, said three U.S. dollar auctions would be held to help out European banks that need the currency to fund loans and repay debt. There is a "much higher chance that this bank will now be broken up" into a wealth managament firm and an investment bank to reduce clients' exposure to investment banking losses, he said. Shares in UBS were down 11% on the U.S. stock exchange at midday trading, though, even as European markets closed higher Thursday.
