-- Police in the Turkish city of Istanbul are dispersing crowds demonstrating against government corruption amid a growing political scandal in the nation. Istanbul's Gezi Park, the site of anti-government protests last spring, is completely cordoned off by riot police. Public prosecutors have publicly complained that they are unable to conduct a second wave of arrests in a wide ranging probe that includes bribery and the rigging of government tenders. A high-level corruption investigation involving the government of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan sparked the anger against the government and caused the currency to drop against the dollar. Earlier Friday, the Prime Minister lashed out at his own judiciary, accusing an Istanbul prosecutor of behaving like a buffoon.
