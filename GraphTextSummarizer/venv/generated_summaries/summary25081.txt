The election was called after Canada's House of Commons passed a no-confidence resolution aimed at Harper's government, triggering the dissolution of Parliament. "They chose hope, hope and unity of purpose and a strong Canada," said Harper before adding that he would be a leader for all Canadians. Michael Ignatieff, the former Harvard scholar who returned to Canada in 2005 to get into politics, led his Liberal party to arguably one of its worst defeats. The head of Canada's Green party also made history on Monday night. Preliminary results also showed that Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper would remain in power for the third time and also showed that a left-leaning political party, the New Democratic Party, would be propelled to the historic position as the country's official opposition.
