With her prescribed treatment and an outpatient program completed, Lovato is getting back into her regular routine and spending time with family and close friends, the family source said. -- Disney star Demi Lovato left the treatment center she voluntarily entered three months ago and returned to her home in Los Angeles this week, a source close to her family said. Lovato, 18, dropped out of a world tour with the Jonas Brothers and sought help for "emotional and physical issues" in early November after an "altercation" with a dancer on her concert tour, a source close to Lovato's camp said at the time. "People say sticks and stones may break your bones, but names can never hurt you, but that's not true," Lovato wrote on a anti-bullying website in October. "She is doing just that." Last year, Lovato also suffered a public end to a short romance with Joe Jonas, one of the three brothers she had been traveling the world with.
