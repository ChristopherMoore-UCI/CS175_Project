At least 20 Israeli rockets landed in southern Lebanon, according to the IDF and the Lebanese official National News Agency. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, at the weekly meeting of the Israeli Cabinet, said he blames the Lebanese government for allowing Hezbollah to position rockets in neighborhoods while attacking civilians. "This is a double war crime that is being perpetrated under the aegis of the Lebanese government and army, which are not lifting a finger to prevent this arming and these crimes," he said. -- Rockets coming from Lebanon smashed into northern Israel on Sunday near the town of Kiryat Shmona Israeli forces fired toward the source of the launch, the IDF said.
