2010 PGA Championship winner Kaymer had started the third round with a six stroke lead after reaching halfway with a record 10-under total of 130 at Pinehurst No.2. Nobody else bettered par with testing pin positions set by officials. Defending champion Justin Rose of England moved into a tie for 10th, with rising star Jordan Spieth also on that mark, after a fine level-par 70 for one-over 211, but still nine shots behind Kaymer. American pair Rickie Fowler and Erik Compton both shot best of the day three-under-par 67s to take closer order to the runaway leader. -- Martin Kaymer drained a crucial birdie putt on the 18th green Saturday to hold a commanding five-shot lead going into the final round of the U.S. Open in North Carolina.
