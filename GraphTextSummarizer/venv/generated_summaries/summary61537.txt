"Weird Al" Yankovic, the king of the song parody, has been nominated to perform at the next Super Bowl halftime show on a Change.org petition -- and close to 60,000 people have signed on their approval as of Thursday morning. Next year's Super Bowl -- that would be Super Bowl XLIX, for the Roman numeral-inclined -- will be held February 1 in Glendale, Arizona. His new album, "Mandatory Fun," debuted at No. 1, and the series of eight videos he made to promote it -- including parodies of "Royals" ("Foil"), "Blurred Lines" ("Word Crimes") and "Happy" ("Tacky") -- quickly became some of the most-viewed on YouTube. Ed Ball, who created the petition, told The Hollywood Reporter that he was inspired by a suggestion that Justin Bieber headline the extravaganza, which has featured such names as U2, the Rolling Stones, Prince and Beyonce (and, to be fair, Elvis impersonators and Up With People). "In all honesty, would you rather have Justin Bieber or Miley Cyrus perform the Super Bowl or something different?"
