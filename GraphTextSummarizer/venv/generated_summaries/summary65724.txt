Watch police announce arrest Â» "They work in the same building, passed in the hallways," New Haven Police Chief James Lewis said of Le and Clark. -- Raymond J. Clark III, charged with murder in the death of Yale graduate student Annie Le, was smart, amiable and loved his dog, say those who knew him. "Anything beyond that, I won't talk about." Though details of the investigation are scant, police said they arrested Clark on Thursday and charged him with Le's murder after collecting more than 250 pieces of evidence. Clark, 24, the same age as Le, was a technician in the school of medicine's Animal Resources Center. Clark was an honor student at Branford High School in suburban New Haven.
