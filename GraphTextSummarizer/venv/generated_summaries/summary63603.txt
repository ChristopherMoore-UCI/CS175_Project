On a recent visit to the main college campus, a group of village women were hard at work making solar cookers, which can boil a liter of water in eight minutes. The station, powered by solar panels, provides the area with a rare commodity: clean drinking water. Then, solar light arrived and changed everything. Villagers could play music at night. Solar power first arrived two years ago.
