Of all of them, perhaps the most memorable is a scene in which Henry DeTamble (Eric Bana) asks Clare Abshire (Rachel McAdams) to be his wife. Eric Bana and Rachel McAdams hope love conquers all in "The Time Traveler's Wife." But Clare is a woman in love, an emotion that tends to trump all others. Typically, these are first words, first steps, graduations, births, weddings and -- of course -- marriage proposals. It's a complicated request because Henry, a kind man, also has the uncanny and often unfortunate ability to be transported suddenly and unexpectedly from one time period to another, leaving Clare on her own.
