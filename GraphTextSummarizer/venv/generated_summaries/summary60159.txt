"That would be the largest sales week for a rap album since November of 2013, when Eminem's 'The Marshall Mathers LP 2' bowed at No. 1 with 792,000 sold (according to Nielsen Music) in its first week. "While it's still a bit early to get a proper projection on what it might sell through the end of the tracking week on Sunday, Feb. 15, sources have floated figures as high as 400,000," Caulfield writes. Tracks include collaborations with artists Lil Wayne, Travi$ Scott and PartyNextDoor. Billboard's Keith Caulfield reports that the album could be the rapper's fourth No. 1 on the publication's 200 chart. A handwritten note on Drake's OVO site gives shout-outs to the Toronto Raptors, Madonna and Ginuwine, among others.
