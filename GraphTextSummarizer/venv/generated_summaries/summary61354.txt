He said, 'No, there they say, 'Miami, Miami.'" Elian Gonzalez, who turned 20 last week, was just 6 years old when he was found clinging to an inner tube after the tiny boat he was traveling in from Cuba sank on the way to the United States. Then-Cuban leader Fidel Castro led massive protests in Cuba demanding Gonzalez's return. Elian Gonzalez now studies engineering at a military school in Cuba and appears to be emerging as a new spokesman for the Cuban government. But Delfin Gonzalez says he's not surprised by pro-Cuba comments his nephew made in an interview with CNN this week. When asked by CNN en Espa√±ol to describe what his life has been like since he left Miami, Elian Gonzalez said "magnificent." "I have experienced unprecedented, great growth, as a Cuban revolutionary, joining the cause," he said.
