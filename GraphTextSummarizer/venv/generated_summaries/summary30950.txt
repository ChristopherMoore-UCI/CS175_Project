So when NBA star LeBron James wanted to apologize to his neighbors in Cleveland for a recent bout of chaos he headed straight for the bakery. His decision to re-sign for his hometown Cavaliers franchise prompted an explosion of joy in the city, and an explosion of interest in him. A minority of Cavs fans still haven't forgiven James for walking out on his local team but he went on to win back-to-back NBA Championships with the Heat. And his way of saying sorry to his community was to enlist a local bakery to deliver the treats on behalf of the LeBron James Family Foundation. James is one of the NBA's biggest stars and left the Cavs in storm of controversy in 2010 when he announced he was signing for the Miami Heat in a televised special called "The Decision."
