"I now think that decriminalizing possession of marijuana is an acknowledgement of the low priority that our courts, our prosecutors, our police, and the vast majority of citizens already attach to this transgression of public order and public health." As for where the governor is on legalization, Lis Smith, his top political adviser, said as long "as long as it is consistent with the goal of driving down crime," O'Malley is "open to sensible drug policy." With an eye on 2016, some activists are starting to contrast that view with Clinton's. Later in the year, Clinton labeled marijuana a "gateway drug" where there "can't be a total absence of law enforcement. This means legalization activists will be better funded to reach the nearly 70% of 18- to 29-year-old Americans who support legalization.

While raising money in Colorado for Sen. Mark Udall earlier this week, Hillary Clinton saw marijuana in her coffee.
