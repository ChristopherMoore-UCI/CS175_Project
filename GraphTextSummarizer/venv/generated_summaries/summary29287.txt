Through her efforts, Latiker has become a voice for local youth and she wishes more people would take the time to listen to them. "KOB" caters to people age 11 to 24, but 80% of those in the program are male, Latiker said. With 301 members from Roseland, Latiker said the center has brought community outreach to "a whole new level." "We are losing a generation to violence," said Latiker, who started the program in her living room. " To help "shock the community" into action, Latiker set up a stone memorial in front of the community center for all the young people who have lost their lives to violence since 2007.
