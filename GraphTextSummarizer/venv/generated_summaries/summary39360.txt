In the words of the Societe's Alain Sager: "The border today is not between the religious and the atheist, between the Christian and non-Christian, Muslim and non-Muslim, between the Jewish and non-Jewish. Last week, the justice minister here, socialist Christiane Taubira, celebrated Voltaire's legacy when speaking at the memorial for the Charlie Hebdo cartoonist Tignous. Among the millions of tweets in the wake of the Charlie Hebdo killings, not a few cited these words attributed to Voltaire: "I do not agree with what you have to say, but I'll defend to the death your right to say it." Voltaire never actually said that. The French publisher Folio says sales of the "Treatise" have increased significantly since the Charlie Hebdo attacks. When first published, the "Treatise" was a revolutionary creed, and one that landed Voltaire in trouble with the French government and especially powerful religious interests, such as the Jesuits.
