-- President Barack Obama is running against former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, but the economy may truly be his greatest opponent. But a slight majority, 50% to 44%, says Romney has the right kind of business experience for the task, despite attacks by the Obama campaign on the former Massachusetts governor's record at private equity firm Bain Capital. "It's not the only factor, but it's arguably the most important factor," said George Washington University associate professor John Sides, who has created a computer model to analyze the impact of the economy on the presidential campaign. What his models show him is that the president is facing similar conditions to what former President Jimmy Carter faced when he lost to Ronald Reagan in 1980, with one exception: Carter was less popular than Obama among his own party. "The president can count on a reservoir of support in his own party that previous Democratic presidents may not have been able to count on," Sides said.
