"I felt much better today than in a few of my other matches here," said defending champion Williams, who has won a record six Miami titles. Murray, who won his second Miami title 12 months ago, beat France's Jo-Wilfried Tsonga while Djokovic beat Tommy Robredo of Spain. World No. 1 Rafael Nadal, seeking his first Miami title after three losing finals, romped into the last eight with a 6-2 6-2 win over Italian 14th seed Fabio Fognini. The Serb, who is seeking a fourth Miami title, needed just over 80 minutes to see off 16th seed Robredo hitting 19 winners and five aces. Both players had match points in the tiebreak but it was Nishikori who eventually prevailed in three hours, seven minutes to send last year's losing finalist crashing out.
