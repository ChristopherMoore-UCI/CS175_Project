McCabe, of nearby Seal Rock, called police around 6:30 p.m. Monday "saying she threw her child over the side," Newport Police Chief Mark Miranda said. -- A 6-year-old boy was found dead in the frigid waters of Oregon's Yaquina Bay after his mother told police she threw him off a bridge Monday evening The body of London McCabe was found in the water about a mile from the Yaquina Bay Bridge about 10:20 p.m., roughly four hours after his mother called 911 to say she'd thrown him from the span, Newport police said. The mother, Jillian Meredith McCabe, 34, was arrested on charges of aggravated murder, murder and first-degree manslaughter, police said. Two boats and a Coast Guard helicopter searched the water for hours before the body was found, Coast Guard spokesman Jonathan Klingenberg told CNN.
