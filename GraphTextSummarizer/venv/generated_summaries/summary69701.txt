There is more work to do, but we can see that even in challenging circumstances it is possible to work together to ensure that the world's most vulnerable children, pregnant women and mothers have access to food and drinkable water. Mothers carry emaciated children long distances across the sand to reach UNICEF-supported health centers for life-saving fortified foods. Drought, failed crops and skyrocketing food prices have left people with little to nothing to eat. Traveling for UNICEF for over more than a decade, my focus has been on countries -- particularly in Africa -- that are being impacted by conflict including the Darfur region, South Sudan, Central African Republic and the Democratic Republic of Congo -- areas convulsed by violence. Throughout my travels with UNICEF -- from Angola, to Central African Republic, Chad, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Haiti, Sudan and Uganda -- I have met countless young girls and boys whose bodies and minds have been permanently damaged because they were malnourished during the first 1,000 days of their lives.
