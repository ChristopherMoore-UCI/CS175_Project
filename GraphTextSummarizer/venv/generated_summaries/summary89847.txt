Photos of naked Prince Harry published The real watershed has come in the last 18 months, with the discovery of the full scale of the phone-hacking scandal (initially revealed by the hacking of Prince William and Prince Harry's mobile phones), which forced the closure of the News of the World, and prompted the Leveson Inquiry into press standards. But offered the chance to splash images of Prince Harry cavorting in the nude with a naked woman during a trip to Las Vegas across their front pages this week, the UK's papers have hesitated, apparently genuinely puzzled as to whether to "publish and be damned." A tale of two brothers As journalist and royal watcher Phil Dampier tweeted: "The whole world will be seeing - and laughing at these pictures - so will British papers run them? And the royal family was by no means immune: Prince Charles, Prince Andrew and the Duchess of York, Sarah Ferguson, have all been caught up in tabloid scandals -- with or without embarrassing photos to accompany them -- in the past. The British media landscape has altered beyond recognition since the death of Harry's mother, Princess Diana, killed in a car crash as she fled a crowd of photographers in Paris 15 years ago.
