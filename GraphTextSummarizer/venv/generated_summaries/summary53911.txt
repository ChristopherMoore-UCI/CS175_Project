Kenya did not assist their cause by conceding 46 extras as Pakistan scored    317 for 7 in their 50 overs with half centuries for Kamran Akmal, Younis Khan, Misbah-ul-Haq and Umar Akmal. "Ricky knows that his action was in breach of the code, involving a brief moment of frustration," said match referee Roshan Mahanama. Australia play New Zealand in Nagpur Friday in their second group clash. Captain Shahid Afridi then took five wickets for 16 as Kenya crumbled to 112 all out for a second straight loss after going down by 10 wickets to New Zealand in their opener. Ponting was found to have breached an ICC rule which relates to "abuse of cricket equipment or clothing, ground equipment or fixtures and fittings during an international match".
