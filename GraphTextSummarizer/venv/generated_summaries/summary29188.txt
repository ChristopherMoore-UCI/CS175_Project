There are different kinds of IQ tests, but most analyze your visual, mathematical and language abilities as well as your memory and information processing speed. "The cars that people drove in 1900 have altered because the roads are better and because of technology," Flynn said in a TED Talk last year. "The difficulty with these kinds of tests is that they're a snapshot," Van Gemert said. It's known as the Flynn Effect, for moral philosopher James Flynn.
