No decision will be made on a shift in the date for soccer's Qatar 2022 World Cup before the 2014 World Cup is played, FIFA President Sepp Blatter said Friday. Asked about remarks last month in which he said FIFA may have made a mistake in choosing Qatar for the 2022 World Cup back in 2010, Blatter said his words did not relate to the choice of location. " The World Cup is usually played in the northern hemisphere's summer months, but concerns have been raised over the safety of players and football fans in Qatar, given that temperatures in July can soar to 122 degrees Fahrenheit (50 Celsius). There has been controversy around plans to stage the 2022 contest in Qatar's intense summer heat, prompting calls to move the tournament to the winter. It had been expected ahead of the executive committee, or ExCo, meeting that a decision on whether to shift the tournament from Qatar's summer to the winter months would come Friday.
