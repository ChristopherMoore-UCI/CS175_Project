Representatives from ASEAN allowed into Myanmar in 2010 did not carry out thorough monitoring of the elections that year, said Aung Saw, editor of the Myanamar exile magazine Irrawaddy, which is based in Thailand. In a meeting Tuesday with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, President Thein Sein said Myanmar would consider allowing observers from the association to watch the elections. He noted that the Thailand-based Asian Network for Free Elections, which aims to promote and support democratization, is an example of a regional body that could provide independent election monitoring. The Myanmar government will "seriously consider" accepting observers from neighboring countries to monitor elections taking place in April, a regional organization said Tuesday. The international attention trained on the elections may prompt the Myanmar government to allow more rigorous monitoring this time around, Aung Saw said.
