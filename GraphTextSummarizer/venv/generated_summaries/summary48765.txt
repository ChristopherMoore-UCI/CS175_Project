Since then, figures had been fluctuating, with August being the deadliest month for Iraqi civilians in more than a year. Combat fatalities have decreased significantly since June, when the United States started withdrawing troops from Baghdad, Iraq's capital, and other urban areas. Among Iraqi police, 22 died and 56 were wounded. "That is a very significant milestone for us as we continue to move forward, and I think that also speaks to the level of violence and how it has decreased over time," said Army Gen. Ray Odierno, the top U.S. commander in Iraq. In addition, 12 Iraqi soldiers died in November and 44 were wounded.
