In the last few weeks, the dynamic duo of Comedy Central has had a field day with the subject of super PACs, those fundraising machines that can raise unlimited donations to fund political ads, provided that they are not officially affiliated with a specific candidate. For all the hyperventilation about super PACs, we'll also examine all the ways in which the narrative of this campaign shows that money still isn't everything in politics: the flameout of Rick Perry's deep-pocketed campaign, the staying power of Ron Paul's grass-roots movement, the number of times that the "free media" of press coverage have shifted the momentum overnight, from the latest debate to the personal scandal du jour. As CNN's team of political reporters and analysts decamps from South Carolina to cover the Florida primary this week, they will assess the impact that money has -- and hasn't -- had in this electoral cycle so far. When Colbert launched his mock run for "President of the United States of South Carolina," Stewart came on his show to announce that he would head up the "Definitely Not Coordinated with Stephen Colbert Super PAC," swearing that it would have no ties to the friend whose hand he was holding on the set. PAC run by his former aides hadn't had millions to savage Gingrich with negatives ads in Iowa, or if Adelson hadn't put up his $5 million to tear down Romney in South Carolina?
