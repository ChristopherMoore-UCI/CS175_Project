Former Philadelphia Eagle lineman Jon Runyan was elected to Congress last year and former NHL player Brian Propp ran an unsuccessful campaign for a 7th District Assembly seat in 2007. Lewis, a nine-time Olympic gold medal winner, wanted to run for the state Senate seat in the 8th Legislative District. New Jersey Democrats had sought Lewis, a resident of Medford, New Jersey, to put his name on the Democratic ballot against Republican state Sen. Dawn Addiego, in the Republican-leaning Burlington county. Guadagno, a Republican, ruled that Lewis, who grew up in New Jersey before going to college out of state, failed to meet a four-year residency requirement. The running star won four gold medals at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, two golds for the long jump and 100-meter 1988 in Seoul, two more at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, and one gold for the long jump at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta.
