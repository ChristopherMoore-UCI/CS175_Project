The painting -- part of Rothko's Seagram mural series -- was hanging at London's Tate Modern museum when a man began tagging the canvas with black paint Sunday afternoon. -- UK police charged a Polish man Tuesday in connection with the defacement over the weekend of a painting by famed artist Mark Rothko at a London museum. Rothko rejected the commission but completed paintings stemming from the project, many of which made their way into the halls of museums. Rothko, a Russian-American abstract expressionist, was commissioned to do a series of paintings for the Four Seasons restaurant of the Seagram building in New York in 1958. Wlodzimierz Umaniec, 26, will appear in a south London court Wednesday on one count of criminal damage in excess of Â£5,000 (about $8,000), London's Metropolitan Police said.
