-- Syrian opposition voices spoke out Monday against a proposed law that would allow for new political parties, calling it little more than a publicity stunt. Human Rights Watch says Syrian security forces have intensified their campaign of mass arrests in cities that have had anti-government protests. Syria's Cabinet approved the bill Sunday to provide for the formation of new political parties, according to SANA, "as part of the directives of the political reform program." Citing "reliable activists and witnesses," it estimated that security forces have arrested more than 2,000 anti-government protesters, medical professionals caring for wounded protesters and people alleged to have given information to international news media and human rights organizations. " President Bashir al-Assad had introduced economic and, to a lesser extent, political reforms in Syria as early as 2006, according to a July 2006 report by the Carnegie Endowment.
