-- Israel expressed regret Tuesday over the killing of a Palestinian judge from Jordan, who was shot by Israeli soldiers at a border crossing, and promised Amman that it would carry out a joint investigation into his death. The Israeli military had denounced Judge Raed Zeiter as a "terrorist," saying he was shot dead Monday after he attacked soldiers at the Allenby Bridge crossing, also known as the King Hussein Bridge, while making his way to the West Bank. The Palestinian Authority in the West Bank city of Ramallah condemned what it called the shooting "at close range" by Israeli troops. " In a separate incident Monday, Israeli soldiers shot dead a 20-year-old Palestinian in the West Bank. "Israel regrets the death of Judge Raed Zeiter yesterday at the King Hussein (Allenby) bridge and expresses its sympathies to the people and government of Jordan," the statement said.
