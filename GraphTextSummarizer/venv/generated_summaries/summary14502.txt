The victim was found unconscious under a bench shortly before midnight Saturday, after police received a call from someone in the area who had overheard people at the assault scene "reminiscing about the incident," Richmond Police Lt. Mark Gagan said. "We will be making arrests continually as we develop probable cause," said Richmond Police Lt. Mark Gagan. "As people announced over time that this was going on, more people came to see, and some actually participated," Gagan said. "There is one individual in custody who has made some spontaneous statements that have led me to believe that he is culpable for what happened," Richmond police Lt. Johan Simon said. School administrators and police apparently weren't watching the area as they should have, Ramsey said.
