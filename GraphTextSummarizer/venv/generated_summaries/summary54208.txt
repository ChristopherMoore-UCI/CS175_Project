Most embassies in Libya have closed due to the ongoing fighting there between Islamists and the internationally recognized government more than three years after rebels -- backed by NATO aircraft -- toppled the regime of Moammar Gadhafi. In August, U.S. Pentagon and State Department officials said they believed Egypt and the UAE had been carrying out secret airstrikes against Islamist militants. Bombs exploded near two shuttered embassies in Tripoli Thursday morning, according to state media and eyewitness accounts. The explosions come a day after bombings killed at least five and wounded more than a dozen in two eastern Libyan cities that are strongholds for Libya's anti-Islamist government. No injuries were reported in either blast, but photos posted to social media appeared to show extensive damage around both buildings.
