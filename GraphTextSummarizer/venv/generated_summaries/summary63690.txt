"Contributing to the accident, the board said, were the lack of [Federal Aviation Administration] regulations and guidance requiring helicopter windshields to be resistant to bird strikes," among other factors, the NTSB said in a news release. On January 4, 2009, a dual-engine Sikorsky S-76C helicopter crashed into marshy terrain near Morgan City, Louisiana, about seven minutes after takeoff from Amelie, Louisiana. The helicopter initially was equipped with laminated glass windshields that complied with European bird-strike resistance standards, but PHI had replaced them with lighter-weight acrylic windshields without bird-strike resistance. " Feathers and other debris, identified as belonging to a red-tailed hawk, were collected from the helicopter's canopy and windshield, the NTSB said. The crash occurred just days before pilot Chesley Sullenberger and co-pilot Jeffrey Skiles landed a US Airways flight in the Hudson River at New York City after a bird strike to the engines.
