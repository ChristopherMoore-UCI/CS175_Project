In addition to targeting police, alleged police informers and people they call "class enemies," the insurgents also are believed to have attacked infrastructure such as roads, bridges, railways, and power and telecommunication networks. -- A senior official from India's governing Congress party suffered brutal treatment at the hands of Maoist insurgents during an audacious and deadly attack on a political motorcade over the weekend, police said Monday. At least 16 cars in the motorcade of local Congress leaders were passing through the area when the insurgents set off a land mine and opened fire on them, police said. On Sunday, Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh visited a hospital in Raipur, the capital of Chhattisgarh, where some of those wounded in the attack were being treated. Authorities suspect that the Maoists enjoy support not only in the poorest areas and in tribal communities but also among young people and intellectuals.
