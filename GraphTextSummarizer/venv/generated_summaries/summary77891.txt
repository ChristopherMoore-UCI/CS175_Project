I've even noticed that in summer dreams seem especially vivid, as if the membrane between sleeping and waking were somehow permeable. Even the night takes on a special quality in summer, with the crickets playing on their little musical instruments underneath the bedroom window as breezes push through the screens, offering a form of natural air conditioning. This timelessness may be, of course, an illusion, but there's no doubt that the pressures of everyday life, in summer, seem less pressing. Frost tells us that the bird frames for us the essential question that everyone faces at the end of summer: "What to make of a diminished thing?" Our summer garden, like Eden, can't stay put. -- I've never liked the end of summer, with the days already growing shorter, with a handful of trees (in Vermont, where I live) beginning to turn red, with my stomach fluttering as I begin to think about the busyness and complications of the fall.
