Roland Martin says the GOP is missing its chance to win black voters. The GOP as a whole is completely scared of black voters, and the actions by the front-runners for the party's 2008 nomination show they are continuing the same silly political games the party has played for years. Why should the GOP talk to black voters, and what would they talk about? And every GOP debate has been about faith in the public square, and we know that plays well with black voters. Ever since Richard Nixon ran for the White House, the GOP has run on a "Southern Strategy," meant to alienate blacks in an effort to garner white voters.
