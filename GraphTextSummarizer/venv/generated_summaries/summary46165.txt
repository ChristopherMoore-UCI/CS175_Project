-- A North Carolina man was arrested Wednesday and accused of threatening to kill President Barack Obama in a series of Twitter messages, including one saying, "The Secret Service is gonna be defenseless once I aim the Assault Rifle at Barack's Forehead. According to a criminal complaint, Sims sent five Twitter messages Monday morning threatening the president. According to the court document, the agent then arrested Sims on several outstanding warrants. In the affidavit, the Secret Service agent who interviewed Sims said the suspect admitted to having the Twitter account associated with the messages and wrote that Sims smiled when the threatening statements were read aloud to him. The court document states a Secret Service intelligence research specialist saw the messages on Twitter, which led to an agent going to Sims' home to interview him on Wednesday.
