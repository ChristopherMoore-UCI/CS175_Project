"The publicity surrounding this case is ... unprecedented," said presiding Judge Maxwell Wiley, urging the possible jurors not to read any media reports on the case. In May 2012, Hernandez confessed to choking the boy to death in New York City in 1979, according to police. Hernandez admitted to luring Etan, who was en route to a school bus stop, into the basement of a bodega where Hernandez worked as a stock clerk and killing him, according to police. Hernandez, joined by his attorneys, Harvey Fishbein and Alice Fontier, sat in court opposite prosecutors from the Manhattan District Attorney's Office as jury selection for the criminal case began. Around 100 potential jurors made their way into a Manhattan courtroom Monday morning, as Pedro Hernandez, alleged killer of 6-year-old Etan Patz, looked on.
