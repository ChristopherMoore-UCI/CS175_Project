States like Kazakhstan with aging leaders and Russian minorities worry that succession crises might be turned into secession crises. And Russia's entire modus operandi, of which its current actions in Ukraine are only the most visible part, is not only a challenge to the European order, but a challenge that is dangerously exploiting the many existing problems within the EU. And if Ukraine does fail to transform itself, it will be only one in a string of dysfunctional states ringing the EU. None of the scenarios look good: if Putin rides out the pain and the Russian economy really crashes; if the pain leads to internal crisis in Russia; or if EU soft-liners water down sanctions before they have their full effect. But Ukraine has to get there first, with the risk of further crises and renewed conflict very real.
