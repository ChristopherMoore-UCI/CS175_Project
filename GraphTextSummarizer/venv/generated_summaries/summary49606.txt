The Rodriguez family said police also hit Luis Rodriguez in the head, according to KOCO. The report does not list the techniques, but Moore Police Chief Jerry Stillings earlier told CNN affiliate KOCO that pepper spray had been used. Luis Rodriguez's wife, Nair Rodriguez, has accused police of brutality in the incident, part of which she recorded on her cell phone at the Warren Theater in Moore, Oklahoma. Three Moore police officers involved in the incident have been placed on paid administrative leave pending further investigation. According to the report, Luis Rodriguez refused to provide police with identification, stepped back, crossed his arms and repeatedly tried to walk around them.
