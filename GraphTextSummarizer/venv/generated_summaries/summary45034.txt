-- England batsman Kevin Pietersen ensured his place in cricket's history books with an unbeaten double-century on day two of the sport's 2,000th Test match. With much focus on Indian veteran Sachin Tendulkar's bid to become the first player to score his 100th century at international level in such a historic match, Pietersen stole the spotlight as he resumed on 22 after a rain-affected opening day in London. Pietersen added 98 for the third wicket with Jonathan Trott before his fellow South Africa-born teammate became the first of five victims snared by medium-pacer Praveen Kumar -- his best effort in just his fourth match in the five-day format. Matt Prior, another England player with South African ancestry, helped Pietersen add another 120 runs for the sixth wicket as he made 71 off 93 balls before Kumar provided captain and wicketkeeper Mahendra Singh Dhoni with his third catch of the innings. India, the top-ranked nation in Test cricket, safely negotiated the six overs before day's end, with the experienced Gautam Gambhir on seven and 21-year-old Abhinav Mukund on eight in just his fourth Test appearance.
