Watch Niaz explain the effects of 9/11 on abused Muslim women Â» "Women who were caught in abusive marriages were trapped even more," recalled Niaz. After volunteering with South Asian victims of domestic violence, Niaz, who speaks five languages, got a job using those skills to advocate for immigrant women affected by family violence. Today, her work focuses on three main areas: providing direct services to abused women, raising awareness through outreach, and educating young women -- an effort she hopes will empower future generations to speak out against abuse. Robina Niaz said the Quran "condemns" abuse of women. Today, her one-woman campaign has expanded into a multifaceted endeavor that is raising awareness about family violence and providing direct services to women in need.
