On Wednesday, the climbers, Kevin Jorgeson and Tommy Caldwell, became the first people in the world to free climb the "Dawn Wall" route of Yosemite's El Capitan face. Like anyone with an Instagram account, I've been captivated in recent weeks by the insane-and-pioneering efforts of two men attempting to free climb a vertical rock face at Yosemite National Park. We drill deeper wells into the ground, sucking out water at such an unsustainable rate that California's Central Valley is sinking. Rather than seeking to understand and explore the many uncharted parts of the world -- the 95% of the ocean that is unseen by humans, for example -- we extract capital. "Free climbs are puzzles," wrote Andrew Bisharat for National Geographic.
