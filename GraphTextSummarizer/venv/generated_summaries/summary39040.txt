Krusinski was initially charged with sexual battery, but prosecutors later changed that charge to assault and battery, according to CNN affiliate WJLA. The former head of an Air Force sexual assault prevention program was acquitted Wednesday of an assault charge stemming from an incident in Arlington, Virginia, last spring, his lawyer confirmed to CNN. He was removed from that post after his arrest, which came two days before the Pentagon released a report showing a 6% year-over-year increase in the number of reported sexual assault cases within the military in the fiscal year that ended September 30, 2012. "We are very gratified by the verdict and gratified by the very serious consideration the jury gave to this matter," defense attorney Barry Coburn told CNN. CNN's Larry Shaughnessy contributed to this report.
