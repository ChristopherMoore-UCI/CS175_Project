A gunman stormed in on November 1, killing Transportation Security Administration officer Gerardo Hernandez and injuring several others. "A driver had a medical emergency, causing her to lose control of the vehicle," said Patrick M. Gannon, the airport police chief. In an overabundance of caution, we evacuated terminal 4," Gannon said. Almost simultaneously, a call was placed in dispatch -- "probably a prank" -- saying there was a man with a gun in terminal 4, Gannon said. Officers evacuated the area and stormed in, guns drawn.
