The World Bank, for example, says nearly half of people in sub-Saharan Africa live on less than $1.25 per day. That's how a group of Kenyan women describe the game of netball in a new (pre-viral?) video from a nonprofit group called Mama Hope, which seems bent on re-framing the way the Western world thinks of Africa, particularly African women. But they only do so, she said, after living in the community for long enough that they can listen to people there about what problems could be solved with the help of outside funds or expertise. "We have to have partnership instead of pity," she said of the way the West interacts with Africa. "We asked the women what they wanted to talk about," Nyla Rodgers, founder and "chief visionary" of Mama Hope told me.
