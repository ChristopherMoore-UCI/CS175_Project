-- A second man has been arrested in connection with last week's shooting at a Philadelphia high school, police said Monday. He faces charges including aggravated assault, violation of the Uniform Firearms Act, recklessly endangering another person and having a weapon on school property, according to police. Walker turned himself in to police on Saturday. The shooter was in the school gym with about seven other students, city police Commissioner Charles Ramsey said. Rochwell was reportedly going to be the target of an assault after school and may have requested the gun, according to police.
