Many paleontologists disapprove of the sale of fossils, saying museums are often unable to afford the frequently high prices at auction, according to the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology. Despite a Texas judge's order barring the sale at the behest of Mongolian President Elbegdorj Tsakhia, a Dallas-based auction house on Sunday unloaded the rare skeleton of a Tarbosaurus bataar -- also known as Tyrannosaurus bataar -- to an undisclosed buyer for $1,052,500 at an auction in New York. An attorney for Mongolia tried to stop the sale, standing up and waving a cell phone with the Texas judge waiting on the other side, but auction officials declined to stop the sale and escorted the lawyer outside. "From what any of us can tell from the photographs on the auction site, the specimen is a typical Nemegt Tarbosaurus from Mongolia," he said. Governments such as Mongolia's are concerned about maintaining control over fossil and cultural relics while scientists worry about such items disappearing into private collections.
