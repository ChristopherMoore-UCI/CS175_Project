On Thursday, Storro admitted her injuries were self-inflicted, Vancouver police said. "She's got a long road ahead of her, but she's on the road, and we're going to walk it with her." Joe and Nancy Neuwelt said there were no signs of trouble leading up to the August 30 incident, after which Storro originally told police she had been attacked by an African-American woman with an athletic build and slicked-back hair pulled into a pony tail. "She's obviously dealing with some deep internal, emotional and psychological problems that we had no knowledge of, and we hope that she'll get the help that she needs," said Nancy Neuwelt, mother of 28-year-old Bethany Storro. Police would not speculate on Storro's motives, only saying the incident did not occur as she described and that there were discrepancies in her account, including wearing sunglasses in the evening. Prosecuters will decide whether or not to charge Storro, police said.
