Right now, the FDA's Center for Tobacco Products -- established in 2009 by the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act -- has the authority to only regulate certain categories of "tobacco products," which exclusively applies to cigarettes, cigarette tobacco, roll-your-own tobacco and smokeless tobacco, according to Haliski. E-cigarettes will still be permitted in areas where smoking is allowed, in addition to retail e-cigarette stores and vapor lounges. "Further research is needed to assess the potential public health benefits and risk of electronic cigarettes and other novel tobacco products," Haliski said. " There are no e-cigarette devices regulated by any federal body, and e-cigarettes are not an FDA-approved method to quit smoking. A 2010 court decision, which the FDA agreed to abide by, held that if e-cigarette companies stopped making therapeutic claims, their products would not be regulated by the FDA, according to Haliski.
