No matter what the potential reasons, the end result is that Federer will have to wait for a record-extending 18th grand slam title after he lost to Andreas Seppi 6-4 7-6 (5) 4-6 7-6 (5) in the third round in Melbourne on Friday. That Seppi was the man who knocked out Federer was a surprise -- in their 10 previous matches, the Italian had never won. And against tennis' big three of Federer, Djokovic and Nadal, Seppi owned a dismal 1-25 record. Federer rued missed opportunities in the second set tiebreak, too, when Seppi was there for the taking. Federer also defended his decision to play exhibition matches in India in December during tennis' notoriously short off-season.
