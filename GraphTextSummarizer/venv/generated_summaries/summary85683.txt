-- Dutch international Wesley Sneijder scored twice as Inter Milan continued their renaissance in Serie A by beating Udinese 3-1, keeping alive the Italian side's chances of European Champions League qualification. Juve, seeking a first Serie A title since 2003 and 28th overall, condemned bottom club Cesena to division two next season thanks to a late goal from striker Marco Borriello -- his first since joining on loan from Roma in January. Champions League football was but a distant dream for Inter, but 11 points from a possible 15 has left the 2010 European title winners sixth in the table -- just three points off third-placed Lazio, who surprisingly lost 2-1 to relegation-threatened Novara earlier in the day. Sneijder's brace turned Wednesday's match after Udinese had taken an early lead through Danilo, then midfielder Ricardo Alvarez scored at the end of the first half to all but seal the win for Inter. The result means that the Nerazzurri have been undefeated -- winning three matches and drawing two -- since youth team coach Andrea Stramaccioni replaced Claudio Ranieri earlier this month.
