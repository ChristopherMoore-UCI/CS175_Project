The court said Davis didn't enjoy diplomatic immunity because neither he nor the Pakistani government provided documents proving that he was a diplomat, according to Asad Manzoor Butt, a defense lawyer for the shooting victims. -- A Pakistani provincial court ruled Thursday that Raymond Davis, the CIA contractor accused of killing two Pakistani men, does not have diplomatic immunity. The court in Lahore was responding to a personal application that Davis filed last week asking that he be released from jail because he has diplomatic immunity. The court adjourned the case until Tuesday when additional documents will be provided to Davis' legal team. On March 14, the Lahore High Court will take up the matter again when the federal government will submit its opinion on whether Davis enjoys immunity.
