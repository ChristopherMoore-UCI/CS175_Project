No. 1 said he would join Nadal in boycotting the Madrid tournament next year if organizers did not restore standard red clay to the courts. Federer, who didn't face a single break point against Ferrer, will play Tipsarevic in the semifinals, while Juan Martin del Potro meets Berdych in the other after a comfortable 6-3, 6-4 win over Alexandr Dolgopolov. A day after Rafael Nadal exited the Madrid Masters and vowed never to return while the clay is still blue, a similarly disgruntled Novak Djokovic suffered a shock 7-6 (2), 6-3 loss to fellow Serb Janko Tipsarevic. Williams said the clay was "extremely slippery" but she wouldn't join the top men's stars in skipping Madrid next year. World No. 1 Victoria Azarenka avoided another upset when she recovered to beat French Open champion Li Na 3-6, 6-3, 6-3.
