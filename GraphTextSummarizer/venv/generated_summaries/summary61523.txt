Even though he was the subject of racist comments on Twitter, the San Antonio native was again wearing a mariachi outfit, according to Carlos Manzanillo, corporate communications manager at San Antonio Spurs. Sebastien was introduced by San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro, who stressed how proud he was by his talent and composure over the past few days. "I'm proud of our young San Antonio superstar Sebastien de la Cruz for a spectacular rendition of our national anthem at last night's Spurs game. The 11-year-old Mexican-American boy's singing of the national anthem in his mariachi outfit caused a stir during game 3 of the NBA finals in his San Antonio hometown Tuesday. " "El Charro de oro" will make his way up to New York City this weekend for the second New York City Mariachi Conservatory Conference, where he will be singing in the national anthem competition.
