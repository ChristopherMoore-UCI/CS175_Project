Kauffman said this kind of marketing says to customers, "If you're not a geek and you want what geeks have, because geeks are cool and have cutting edge -- bleeding edge -- technology, we can bring that to you." Nick Devita, a member of the bell-ringing Geek Squad team, thinks Best Buy has plenty of geek. Along with the mainstreaming of geek interests comes a bittersweet trade-off for geeks who had been marginalized in the past. Nugent said that when geeks and nerds were not as readily accepted in American culture, they had a thriving, fraternal community spirit. "I think what's interesting about geek culture is that it doesn't need to be marketed to, much," said Nugent. Thanks to Silicon Valley and the charismatic representation of geekdom by people like Apple's Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak and Microsoft's Bill Gates, geeks are fashionable and associated with economic power, Nugent said.
