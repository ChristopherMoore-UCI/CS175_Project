-- The Obama administration Thursday evening asked a federal appeals court in California to reconsider its order last week temporarily blocking the U.S. military from enforcing its "don't ask, don't tell" policy on gays and lesbians serving in the military. "The (judicial) panel's order cuts that process short and overrides the judgments of Congress and the President on a complex and important question of military policy." After the court's order last week, Pentagon spokesman Col. Dave Lapan said the military "will of course comply with orders of the court, and are taking immediately steps to inform the field of this order." He added, "In the meantime, implementation of the DADT repeal voted by the Congress and signed in to law by the President last December is proceeding smoothly, is well underway, and certification is just weeks away. Federal courts -- including the Supreme Court -- have bounced back and forth over the temporary enforcement question, ignoring for now the larger question's of the federal law's constitutionality. U.S. officials have been moving ahead with dismantling the policy but had objected to having the courts force the government to officially repeal it at this time.
