Karas won $8,000 playing blackjack, but San Diego District Attorney Bonnie Dumanis says video shows the gambler cheated with a technique known as marking cards. On Friday, police arrested the 62-year-old Karas, whose legal name is Anargyros Karabourniotis, at his home in Las Vegas, on allegations he marked cards during a blackjack game in San Diego in July. Archie Karas has described himself the "king of the gamblers," but authorities in San Diego are now calling him a cheater. Marking cards allows a player to identify the value of cards. The alleged incident occurred at San Diego's Barona Casino.
