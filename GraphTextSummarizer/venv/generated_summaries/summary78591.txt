"Now then, Sergeant," Patton said to Mauldin, as recalled in a new biography, Todd DePastino's "Bill Mauldin: A Life Up Front" (W.W. Norton). But the soldiers themselves -- men such as Schulz, a World War II vet who didn't meet Mauldin until years after first mentioning him in "Peanuts" -- knew Mauldin's value. He took on racism, Cold War politics, Vietnam and Chicago Mayor Richard Daley. But Mauldin had some officers on his side, up to and including the Supreme Allied Commander himself, Dwight D. Eisenhower. DePastino, a history professor at Waynesburg College in Pennsylvania, found Mauldin's work a revelation.
