The death of Stacey Nicole English, last seen alive shortly after Christmas, was classified an accident by the Fulton County Medical Examiner, which cited autopsy results, medical records and witness and acquaintance statements. In an interview with police on New Year's Eve, Strothers said that her friend "appeared upset" and told her "she felt as if someone was attempting to hurt her." Earlier, English's mother and stepfather told police that they typically talked with her "several times a week" and became worried after she did not answer their calls since they last talked with her on Christmas. "Because cold exposure is an external, environmental condition, the manner of death has been classified as accident," medical examiners said. He said that he left around 10:30 p.m. on December 26, after English "began asking him if he was Satan" and told him to leave "her residence immediately." A friend, Michelle Strothers, told police that she last saw English on that day or the next one. Her mother, Cynthia Jamison, said that English "was currently taking medication" and had attempted suicide by overdose a little more than two years earlier, according to police.
