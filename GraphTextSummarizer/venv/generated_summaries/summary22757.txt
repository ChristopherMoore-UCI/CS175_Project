The National Hurricane Center in Miami said Gonzalo -- if it stays on its current predicted path -- will remain well east of the Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos islands as it moves north over open Atlantic water. Gonzalo is a major hurricane, gaining in strength Tuesday as it pulled away from Puerto Rico and headed toward Bermuda. The hurricane has maximum sustained winds of 115 mph (185 kilometers per hour), and forecasters believe it will grow into a category 4 storm by the time it approaches Bermuda from the southwest. There are no hurricane warnings as of Tuesday evening, and the storm is not a threat to the United States, the center said. He said residents in his area experienced strong winds on Monday.
