" 'A burning thing in my heart' Joanna Church of Oak Harbor, Washington, which is on Whidbey Island, remembers being at a church service as a young girl, and hearing about how children are less likely to be adopted as they get older and how older children in foster care are at greater risk for homelessness and incarceration once they age out of the foster care system. Raising awareness Church has become a passionate advocate for children in foster care, hoping her story will help raise awareness about how many kids are waiting for homes and how life-changing adoption can be for them. At 18, children in foster care essentially age out of the system. Louis said she had targeted kids like Deon who she thought needed new photos. Deon was one of seven children in foster care, from age 9 through 17, chosen for the two-day photo shoot.
