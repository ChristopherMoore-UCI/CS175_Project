France would be the ninth country in Europe to allow same sex marriage. -- France's top court ruled Friday that a bill permitting same-sex marriage and allowing gay couples to adopt children adheres to the constitution. The first same-sex couples walked down the aisle in the Netherlands in 2001, with others following suit in Canada, South Africa, Belgium and Spain. Lawmakers in Australia voted against a bill to legalize same-sex marriage last September. Argentina was the first Latin American nation to legalize such marriages, in 2010.
