Noshir Gowadia, 66, of Maui, Hawaii, was sentenced late Monday for sharing classified defense information with China, illegally exporting military technical data, money laundering, filing false tax returns and other offenses. There he helped develop features for the B-2 Spirit Bomber, also known as the "Stealth Bomber." Between July 2003 and June 2005, Gowadia made six trips to China to provide design, data analysis and test support services needed to develop a stealthy exhaust nozzle for a cruise missile system, according his trial evidence. Gowadia worked as an engineer with Northrop Grumman Corporation for about 17 years, according to evidence at his trial. "Mr. Gowadia provided some of our country's most sensitive weapons-related designs to the Chinese government for money," said David Kris, assistant attorney general for the Justice Department's National Security Division. -- A former B-2 Bomber engineer has been sentenced to 32 years in prison for selling secret defense designs to China.
