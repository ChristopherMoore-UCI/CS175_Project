When entrepreneurs, empowered by venture capitalists, take new ideas and turn them into new products and businesses, job creation occurs. But when venture capitalists and entrepreneurs make bad decisions, the people who are hurt are people who knowingly chose to invest, work for or do business with them. Venture-backed businesses generate a large number of good jobs because businesses that require the financial muscle of venture capital usually require the intellectual muscle of highly skilled and educated labor. But we don't see the risk venture capitalists take by investing in entrepreneurs, and so when venture capitalists strike it rich we assume the profit is ill-gotten gains. And because it is often their personal money on the line, venture capitalists tend to be careful in considering the partnership of potential customers and entrepreneurs.
