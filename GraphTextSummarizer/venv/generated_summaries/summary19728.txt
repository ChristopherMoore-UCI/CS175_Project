Some in the news media are convinced that Obama's endorsement of gay marriage was designed to raise Hollywood dollars. Same-sex marriage is at the center of this revolution, resulting in a plethora of homemade Hollywood ad campaigns. Of course, the same-sex marriage endorsement has increased Hollywood enthusiasm for the president and induced liberal skeptics to give more. It's noteworthy that Obama's relationship with Hollywood is far from strong. When Obama visited Hollywood in September 2011, he was reduced to appearing at an event hosted by a sitcom actor at the House of Blues rock club.
