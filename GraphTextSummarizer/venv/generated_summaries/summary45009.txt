At another photo exhibition featuring people with disabilities, Calib Lee, a 19-year-old with Down Syndrome, strikes a Taekwondo pose in his green belt. There have been efforts around the globe to be more inclusive of people with Down Syndrome, including Target ads in the United States featuring child models and a TV ad by British department store, Marks & Spencer's. He said that the aim of the exhibition was to show a more playful side of people with Down Syndrome. Nowadays, more and more parents love or like to do that." Frank Freeman photographed Lee and other young people with Down Syndrome as models for his exhibition entitled "The Purest People." In a sense, Lee and the 15 or so people involved with the project have been "neglected" in one way or another by Hong Kong society, all of these people have struggled to get by because they all have intellectual disabilities.
