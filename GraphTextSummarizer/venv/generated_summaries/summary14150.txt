Alonso dropped to fourth in the drivers' championship -- and 30 points behind the leader, Red Bull's reigning champion Sebastian Vettel -- after his race in Bahrain was compromised by problems with his car's rear-wing overtaking aid. " Strong performances in Australia and China, where Alonso raced to a dominant victory for Ferrari, continue to give Ferrari hope that they can still challenge their main rivals Red Bull, Lotus and Mercedes in the title hunt when racing resumes in the Spanish city of Barcelona on May 12. But the team say there is still work to be done, especially as Ferrari's Brazilian driver Felipe Massa also had a torrid race in Bahrain, finishing 15th because of tire problems. Italian motorsport maestros Ferrari want to get back to being "bellissimo" in Barcelona next month after two team errors saw their No. 1 driver Fernando Alonso fall behind in the race for the Formula One title. The mistakes mean Ferrari -- who have not won the team title since 2008 -- are now third in the constructor standings behind Red Bull and Lotus.
