"Emergency personnel from Frederick County responded and found two crash scenes," said Maryland State Police spokesman Greg Shipley. -- Three people died and two were injured when a small aircraft and a helicopter collided Thursday afternoon at a municipal airport in Frederick, Maryland, according to Frederick County Fire Chief Denise Pouget. One of the men was uninjured and the other had a laceration to the forehead, said National Transportation Safety Board investigator Brian Rainer. The two survivors taken to a hospital were later discharged, said Meritus Medical Center spokeswoman Joelle Butler. Maryland State Police told CNN it "appeared" to have been an in-flight collision.
