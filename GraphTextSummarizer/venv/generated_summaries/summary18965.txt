The 2009 U.S. Open champion will face Spain's Fernando Verdasco in the final after his semifinal opponent Canadian Milos Raonic withdrew with a back injury during the first set of their semifinal. -- World No.2 Novak Djokovic extended his season's winning streak to 26-0 on Saturday, as he reached the Serbian Open clay court final after his semifinal opponent Janko Tipsarevic withdrew with a thigh injury. Meanwhile, at the Estoril Open in Portugal, Argentina's Juan Martin del Potro defeated Pablo Cuevas 6-2 7-6 (8-6) in Saturday's semifinal. Del Potro took one hour and 49 minutes to overcome the Uruguayan breaking Cuevas's serve in the first game helping him establish an  4-2 lead when rain intervened. I sincerely hope he will manage to recover for the rest of the clay court season.
