The African Union Mission in Somalia has been helping government forces fight al Shabab rebels in the country. The additional troops, he said, will help fight Islamist rebels who have been battling peacekeeping troops and government forces. "The threat level in Mogadishu and in southern-central Somalia has actually increased," Augustine Mahiga told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday. Somalia has not had a stable government since 1991, and fighting between the rebels and government troops has escalated the humanitarian crisis in the famine-ravaged country. The envoy said plans are under way to submit a request for more troops in Somalia to the United Nations Security Council.
