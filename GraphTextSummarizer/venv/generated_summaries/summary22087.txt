The two bodyguards injured in an attack on a convoy transporting Britain's ambassador in Libya are "safe and in good condition," an embassy representative in Tripoli said Tuesday. Another had surgery and will leave a hospital Tuesday, the representative said. The ministry asked all diplomatic missions in Libya to inform security forces of their movements within Libya so they are provided with security. It issued directives to increase security around embassies and foreign missions in Libya. The attack occurred near a university, Libya's state news agency LANA reported, citing a spokesman for the Supreme Security Committee in Benghazi.
