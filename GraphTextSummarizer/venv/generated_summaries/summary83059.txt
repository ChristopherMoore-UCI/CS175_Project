" This wasn't the first time a drone was used in a smuggling attempt from Mexico, according to drug war analysts, U.S. officials and local Mexican police. "In collaboration with our federal, state, local and international law enforcement partners, CBP remains vigilant against emerging trends and ever-changing tactics employed by transnational criminal organizations behind illegal attempts to smuggle narcotics into the U.S." The drone was loaded with more than six pounds of the synthetic drug crystal meth, Tijuana police said. The crashed drone was a prototype that used a global positioning system, or GPS, to send it to a particular destination, Tijuana police said on the department's Facebook page. Transporting drugs is a bit more complicated," said Sylvia Longmire, a leading drug war analyst. "In San Diego, the street value, at last account, for a six-pound load would be about $48,000," DEA Special Agent Matt Barden said.
