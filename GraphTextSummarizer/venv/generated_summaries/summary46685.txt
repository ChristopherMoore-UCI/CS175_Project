High-tech kit speeds athletes into new era "To have been selected to represent Team South Africa at the London 2012 Olympic Games in the individual 400-meters and the 4x400-meter relay is a real honor, and I am so pleased that years of hard work, determination and sacrifice have all come together," he said last month. The four-time Paralympic Games gold medalist won a silver medal as part of South Africa's 4x400-meter relay at the world championships in Daegu, South Korea, last year. But he looked set to be excluded from the individual event in London after failing to run the Olympic 'A' standard qualification mark twice in international competition. But South African selectors relaxed their qualification rules last month and named him in both events. Paralympian swimmer Natalie du Toit was in the 2008 Games and table tennis player Natalia Partyka competed in both 2008 and 2012.
