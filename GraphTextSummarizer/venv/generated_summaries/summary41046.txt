The Zeeland left the Netherlands 12 days ago en route to the southern tip of Florida, said Lt. Maartje Van Der Maas, a spokeswoman for the Royal Netherlands Navy in the Caribbean. The Dutch sailors will pick up a Coast Guard helicopter in Key West to use over the next four months in drug interdiction operations in the Caribbean. Upon arrival, they took over the operation from the Dutch navy and will transport those rescued to the Florida mainland, Coast Guard Petty Officer Sabrina Laberdesque told CNN. A Dutch naval vessel, the Zeeland, heading toward Key West, Florida, first alerted the U.S. Coast Guard at noon about the ship. -- At least three people died and seven others were rescued Thursday after their boat capsized off the coast of southeastern Florida
