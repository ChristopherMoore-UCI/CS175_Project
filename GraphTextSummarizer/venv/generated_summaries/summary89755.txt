Laws regarding pilot breaks during flights vary from country to country. "It's a serious incident," said Wim van der Weegen of the Dutch Safety Board, "What makes it serious is the combination of the pilot being unable to access the cockpit and the first officer being asleep. U.S. airlines also require a flight attendant to be in the cockpit when the pilot or first officer take bathroom breaks, in case the person flying the aircraft becomes incapacitated. The Dutch Safety Board will decide whether to open its own inquiry when the airline's investigation is finished, van der Weegen said. Flights longer than eight hours require a relief pilot on board to take over when pilots sleep.
