As video from the concert shows, West really wasn't kidding, as he took several moments to scan the audience for anyone sitting down. -- Kanye West has high expectations from his fans at concerts. While performing in Sydney on Friday, West paused his performance to request that all audience members stand before he went on with the show. It's not unusual for an artist to ask the audience to physically participate, but West's insistence at his concert Friday led to a very uncomfortable moment. "I've decided, I can't do this song, I can't do the rest of this show until everybody stands up," West said, adding an exception for those with handicaps.
