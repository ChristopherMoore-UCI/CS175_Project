Speaking to reporters Tuesday, Ostreicher said his case was only one of many in the South American country. But members of Bolivia's Jewish community said Ostreicher, an Orthodox Jew from Brooklyn, had been unjustly accused. " On Tuesday, Ostreicher was released on bail of 100,000 bolivianos (about $14,200), and now will be in more comfortable conditions, although the case against him hasn't been dropped. Demonstrators outside the courthouse Tuesday both advocated and denounced Ostreicher, CNN affiliate Bolivision reported. Word of Ostreicher's release was posted on the "Free Jacob Ostreicher" Facebook page Tuesday.
