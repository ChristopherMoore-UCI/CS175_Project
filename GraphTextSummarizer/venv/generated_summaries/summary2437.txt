No-one does royal tours quite like Prince Harry, and he's clearly fond of the United States, visiting several times during the years, both in official and private capacities. He's a big asset for the British government, able to attract A-list political, corporate and showbiz guests to receptions at tour stops in Washington, Denver and New York. For Prince Harry is a soldier and a prince: both will be on duty for this tour, if a bit more prince than during his last visit. This is the prince who dispensed with handshakes when he met Jamaican prime minister Portia Simpson Miller in March 2012 and gave her a hug instead (he said he had heard that she liked hugs.) If there is a Usain Bolt moment in the U.S., it will be on a baseball diamond In New York on Tuesday.
