In the four Baltimore ZIP Codes where Jones' nonprofit works, there are nearly 3,000 men who together owe more than $40 million in child support, according to the Maryland Department of Human Resources. "We help them get them jobs so they can pay taxes and child support." Most men, like Dixon, walk through the center's doors because they need help finding a job. "If we don't crack the code of men having babies for whom they're not responsible for, all of our efforts to build a better Baltimore will be limited," said Jones, 57. Since 1999, the center has helped thousands of Baltimore residents find jobs and enabled hundreds of fathers to become more responsible parents. He also knows that children who grow up without fathers are more likely to become teen parents, use drugs and commit crimes, according to the National Fatherhood Initiative.
