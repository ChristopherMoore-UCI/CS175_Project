The simplicity of Arduino in managing sensors, combined with the flexibility of a microcomputer based on ARM are integrated in UDOO, giving you a powerful prototyping board able to run Linux or Android," UDOO project coordinator Bruno Sinopli, a Carnegie Mellon professor in electrical and computer engineering, said in a video on UDOO's Kickstarter page. Now, a project called UDOO ("you do") seeks to bring the best elements of Raspberry Pi and Arduino together into a single mini-PC that can run either Android or Linux. "With UDOO, we want to combine the winning characteristics of Arduino and Raspberry Pi in one single board. Arduino boards have been around nearly a decade, meanwhile, powering robots and all sorts of other creative electronics projects. UDOO allows you to create any kind of project and share it with the community," the Kickstarter page states.
