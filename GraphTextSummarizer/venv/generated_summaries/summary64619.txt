" Google's Street View project to map 360-degree images of roads and homes across the world has generated numerous complaints over privacy, despite automated software that blurs faces and car licence plates. "I was upstairs when I spotted the camera car driving down the lane," resident Paul Jacobs told The Times of London. The spokesman added: "We take privacy very seriously, and we were careful to ensure that all images in our Street View service abide by UK law." "We know that some people are uncomfortable with images of their houses or cars being included in the product, which is why we provide an easy way to request removal of imagery. Most imagery requests are processed within hours."
