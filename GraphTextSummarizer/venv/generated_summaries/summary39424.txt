Ronald Sepulvado, one of BP's well site leaders -- "company men," in rig jargon -- told the Coast Guard-Interior Department board investigating the drill platform's sinking that there were "off and on" problems with valves that directed hydraulic fluid inside the mechanism. Ross Skidmore, a subsea supervisor for BP contractor Swift, testified Tuesday he questioned why BP was waiting to install a "lockdown sleeve" -- a fitting placed atop the well to secure the casing -- after drilling fluid was replaced with seawater for pressure tests. BP, rig owner Transocean and well cementing contractor Halliburton all blamed each other for the disaster. -- A control unit on the Deepwater Horizon's blowout preventer was leaking hydraulic fluid before the explosion that unleashed the worst oil spill in U.S. history, a BP official testified Tuesday. But BP lawyer Richard Godfrey seized on the statement, saying it showed "a complete loss of command and control aboard the bridge" after the explosions.
