-- Police released two photos Thursday of a man they suspect abducted the mother of Baltimore Orioles legend Cal Ripken Jr. from her Aberdeen, Maryland, home before she was found nearly 24 hours later tied up in the back seat of her car. Officials in Aberdeen say they are still looking for motives in the case and haven't found evidence of ransom demands for Violet Ripken, the mother of a baseball Hall of Famer. He also said police don't know of any relationship between the suspect and the Ripken family. Trabert said Violet Ripken was understandably upset after the ordeal. There is also a $2,000 reward for a tip leading to the man's conviction, Aberdeen police said.
