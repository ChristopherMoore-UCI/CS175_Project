Lifetime doing Whitney Houston movie with Angela Bassett Basset co-starred with Houston in 1995â€²s "Waiting to Exhale," making this something of a personal project for the actress. Lifetime previously announced that Oscar winner Angela Bassett (who appeared most recently in "American Horror Story") will direct the film about the pop star, who died two years ago at 48. The Brown graduate (as she frequently reminded us on the show) has made a name for herself since taking second place in the modeling competition, nabbing acting roles in "All My Children," "Ugly Betty," "House" and even "Lee Daniel's The Butler." "Whitney Houston" (working title) marks Bassett's first directorial debut and is scheduled to premiere in 2015. Lifetime's project will focus on Houston's tumultuous relationship with the model, singer, and songwriter Bobby Brown, which continued throughout much of her career.
