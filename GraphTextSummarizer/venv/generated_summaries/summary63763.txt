That's why Wood posted a plea on her local community's closed Facebook page on Saturday to track down the woman, according to CNN affiliate WMBA. "The note from their mom brought me to tears and shows there is still good people in the world," Boyd wrote on the sheriff's department Facebook page. The two moms are now Facebook friends. The woman Wood was trying to reach is Rebecca Boyd, who saw the sheriff's department post and contacted her. The woman I'm looking for addressed them and asked them to be quiet and they were disrespectful," Wood wrote on her Facebook post. "After the movie she approached my girls and told them that her husband had been laid off and this was the last movie she would be able to take her daughter to for a while and my girls ruined that for her," wrote Wood, who asked the woman to contact her.
