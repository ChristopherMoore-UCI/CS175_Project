Garcia's attorney, Charles Frisco, said Friday he hasn't had much time to talk to his client but said stories such as the neighbor's make him doubt the state's case. Stop judging the California woman who walked away from her alleged captor after a decade, an angry and emotional Michelle Knight told CNN's "New Day" on Friday. Knight was referring to the case of a California woman who approached police after contacting her sister on Facebook, saying -- according to police -- that she had been abducted by her mother's boyfriend at 15, then raped, beaten and forced to marry her alleged captor, Isidro Garcia. "She had plenty of time to actually escape so it's hard to believe this is really going on because she had a lot of free time. Knight said she worries that questions such as those raised about the California woman's case will keep other people suffering from abuse from coming forward and seeking help.
