-- U.S. Navy hospital corpsman Francis Nicola received a unique Christmas gift Thursday: a phone call from his commander in chief. "He quickly earned my trust [and] confidence." Nicola said he invited Obama "for a day of burgers and basketball on the pier in San Diego," the Rentz's home port. The Rentz is on an extended eight-month deployment, Public Affairs Officer Corey Barker noted in a statement. Nicola, who previously served on the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz, is the senior medical representative for over 220 crew members on the Rentz, Barker said. Nicola has served on the guided-missile frigate USS Rentz for one year.
