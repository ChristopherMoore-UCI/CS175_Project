Boy drowns, another missing in Yosemite National Park river An unidentified 37-year-old man from the San Francisco Bay area died in late July, said Dr. Vicki Kramer, chief of the department's vector-borne disease section. California's health department has worked with Yosemite National Park for years to reduce the risks to visitors, Kramer said. -- Two Californians, one of whom died, may have been exposed to mice droppings or urine that contained hantavirus while vacationing at Yosemite National Park, health officials said Thursday. Yosemite National Park saw one hantavirus case each in 2000 and 2010.
