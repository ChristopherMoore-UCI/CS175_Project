Jens Hegeler and Mehmet Ekici made sure of victory for Nuremberg in the second half to leave Stuttgart languishing in 17th position. With the match entering stoppage time, striker Jan Moravek fired home from the edge of the penalty area to rescue a point for Kaiserlautern. German international Simon Rolfes put Leverkusen ahead in the ninth minute when he fired a left-footed shot past Frankfurt goalkeeper Ola Nikolov. A goal from Croatia forward Mladen Petric was enough to defeat Wolfsburg, who recently sacked English coach Steve McLaren. Goals from Timmy Simons and Julian Schieber gave Nuremberg a two-goal lead inside 29 minutes, before Patrick Funk reduced Stuttgart's arrears on the stroke of half time.
