-- The state of Pennsylvania gave us Joe Montana, Broadway Joe Namath and Smokin' Joe Frazier. To the Penn State students rioting in the streets Wednesday night, Joe Paterno was pope, a word that also means father. Eternal paternal Paterno. But added together their moral authority would total a tiny fraction of that established over a half-century by Joe Paterno. If I didn't know Joe Paterno was a real person, I would swear he was invented, a character in a sports adventure novel written for boys in the 1950s.
