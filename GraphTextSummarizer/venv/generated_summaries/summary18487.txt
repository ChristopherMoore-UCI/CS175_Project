Matos said they collaborated with government officials on logistics and security and sometimes faced pressure. Often referred to as "Cuba's Woodstock," the festival's focus has traditionally been on apolitical electronic music and DJs, although last year the main attraction was the polemic hip-hop group Los Aldeanos. The Rotilla Festival, a hugely popular three-day rave on a beach outside Havana, was launched in 1998 by Matos and a handful of friends. "They're kidnapping, stealing our festival," said founder and until-now executive director Michel Matos. "Up until now, we were tolerated," Matos said.
