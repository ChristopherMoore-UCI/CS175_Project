More than 100,000 want to go to Mars and not return Soil types Scientists are also learning about the diversity of the soil on Mars. " More broadly, the analysis gives us new information about the hydrological cycle on Mars, said John Grotzinger, lead scientist on the Curiosity mission. The rover's Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) instrument helped scientists probe the soil by heating a sample up to 835 degrees Celsius. Still no methane Scientists are interested in whether Mars has methane gas, which could be an indicator of the planet's habitability. "Somehow, there's a process on Mars where, even though there are just trace quantities of water in Mars's atmosphere, this noncrystalline material is able to absorb it like a sponge and bind it into its framework," Grotzinger said.
