Ojeda, who served as the Orange County leader of the Mexican Mafia for decades, is accused of ordering Hispanic gangs to pay a "tax" or "tribute," and in exchange, they were permitted to exert influence over their neighborhoods and seek Mexican Mafia protection, authorities said. The Mexican Mafia is a powerful and violent prison gang that controls drug distribution and other illegal activities within the California penal system and on the streets of southern California by organizing Hispanic street gang members to establish a larger network for the Mexican Mafia's illegal activities, authorities claimed in a statement "If a gang does not accede to the Mexican Mafia, the Mexican Mafia will assault or kill the gang's members who are not in custody, as well as those members who are incarcerated within the California penal system," authorities said in a statement. Santa Ana, California -- Federal authorities arrested 26 members or associates of the Mexican Mafia gang in southern California Wednesday on charges involving drug trafficking, racketeering and murder, officials said. The 57 are charged in five indictments accusing them of being members or associates of the Mexican Mafia and the affiliated Forming Kaos street gang, both of which operate in Orange County, California, officials said. One names 28 alleged members of the Mexican Mafia, including its Orange County leader Peter Ojeda, who is currently serving a federal prison sentence for an unrelated 2006 conviction, authorities said.
