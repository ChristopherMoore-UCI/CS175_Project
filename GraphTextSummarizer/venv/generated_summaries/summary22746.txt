That's the maximum specific absorption rate (SAR), a measurement of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed into the body -- information that phone manufacturers must provide to U.S. consumers. "By testing mobile phones only when at a distance from the body, FCC may not be identifying the maximum exposure, since some users may hold a mobile phone directly against the body while in use. The GAO also asked the FCC to consider updating its cell phone testing procedures to account for phones being used while next to the body -- such as in a pocket or held in your hand -- rather than only testing how phones emit radiation when held up to your ear. Some consumer groups told the GAO they don't think the info provided by federal agency websites about mobile phone health effects is sufficiently precautionary. The GAO looked into the issue of revisiting cell phone radiation standards at the request of three high-ranking congressional Democrats: Ed Markey of Massachusetts and Anna Eshoo and Henry Waxman of California.
