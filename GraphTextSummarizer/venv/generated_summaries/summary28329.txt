Ominous mannequins Just before Kyenge arrived for Friday's rally, a group smeared blood-red paint and anti-immigrant messages onto mannequins. A man popped up out of the crowd and launched two bananas toward the podium, Kyenge spokesman Cosimo Torlo said. Insults from other politicians Two weeks ago, Italian Sen. Roberto Calderoli likened Kyenge to an orangutan. He said doesn't believe that Italians generally are racists and hopes Kyenge will be able to ease racial tensions. A local politician recently said on Facebook that Kyenge should be raped so she can understand the pain felt by victims of crime, which some politicians blame on immigrants.
