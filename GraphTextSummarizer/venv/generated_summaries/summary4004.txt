Smart told reporters Wednesday that she was determined to dedicate her life to child advocacy, "to help stop and prevent future kidnapping crimes, sexual crimes against children, against anyone." -- Brian David Mitchell, the homeless street preacher who abducted, raped and kept a 14-year-old Elizabeth Smart captive for nine months, was sentenced to life in prison Wednesday. Smart said she was raped nearly every day during nine months in captivity and forced to drink alcohol, smoke cigarettes and watch Mitchell have sex with his legal wife, Wanda Barzee. Wednesday's sentencing occurred nearly nine years after Smart was abducted. A jury found Mitchell guilty in December of Smart's 2002 kidnapping.
