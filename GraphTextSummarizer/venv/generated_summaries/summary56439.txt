Watch David Cook show his chops Â» Cook, 25, dropped by CNN's New York offices (with his mother, Beth Foraker, in tow) to talk about keeping creative control, losing his privacy and his responsibility as Idol No. 7. CNN: All this talk about you and ["American Idol" runner-up] David Archuleta being mortal enemies is absolute garbage, isn't it? [Lead single "Light On"] debuted on the Billboard charts at No. 17, and then several weeks later -- about four -- it dropped to No. 80.
