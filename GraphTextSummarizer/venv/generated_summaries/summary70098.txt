They extended their partnership to 48 before paceman Morne Morkel picked up his second wicket as Mishra was caught at second slip by Jacques Kallis, who had earlier dropped the batsman as did captain Graeme Smith. -- India racked up a massive first-innings lead of 347 runs over South Africa on the third day of the second cricket Test in Kolkata as V.V.S. Laxman and captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni contributed centuries. Laxman completed his 15th Test century and Dhoni his fourth in only the second time that four Indian batsmen had reached three figures in the same innings. South Africa, who will return to the No. 1 Test ranking above India with a draw, reached 6-0 at stumps as only five balls of a scheduled 10 overs were able to be bowled due to bad light. He put on 79 for the first wicket with Imrul Kayes, who made 28 before edging spinner Daniel Vettori to Ross Taylor at slip.
