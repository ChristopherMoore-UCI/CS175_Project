Markoff was found dead in his jail cell in Boston on Sunday morning, Suffolk County District Attorney Daniel Conley said. Markoff was charged with the April 14, 2009, fatal shooting and attempted robbery of Julissa Brisman, 25, at Boston's Copley Marriott Hotel. Conley said Markoff's death deprives Brisman's family of seeing justice pronounced, but said the evidence against the suspect was "overwhelming in quantity and substance. "It should not obscure the overwhelming evidence against Mr. Markoff by the brutality of his crime. He also faced charges in connection with robberies of women at hotels in Boston and in Warwick, Rhode Island.
