Media debate Digby Warde-Aldam, the art critic for the UK's Spectator magazine, said: "Surely no arbiter in their right mind could have let such hectoring, cultural studies-sanctioned guff slip through the net?" "If you're serious about the rubbish on show this year, you are insulting every artist working in Britain today," he said. A film that features a dance routine inspired by Karl Marx and examines African art has won Britain's most prestigious and controversial art prize. The Turner Prize, which is worth Â£25,000 ($40,000), was awarded to the Irish film artist Duncan Campbell in a glittering ceremony last night. And the Telegraph newspaper quoted the director of the Tate Britain, Penelope Curtis, as saying that the video was "a bit baffling" and "quite odd." Campbell, who lives in Scotland, is a graduate of the Glasgow School of Art. The school's director, Professor Tom Inns, described Campbell's success as "a great accolade both for Duncan and for the Glasgow School of Art."
