Diamond is releasing his first album in six years, "Melody Road," and said on "Today" that he "was a nervous wreck going into this new album." For years the lore has been that Neil Diamond's 1969 song "Sweet Caroline" was an ode to the then young daughter of late president John F. Kennedy and his wife, Jacqueline. " "Sweet Caroline" has since become a staple track, and in 2013 Diamond announced that he would donate the royalties to One Fund Boston to help those affected by the Boston Marathon bombing. The song has been played at every Boston Red Sox home game for more than a decade, and there was a spike in downloads after the April 2013 tragedy. I needed a three-syllable name," Diamond said during an appearance on "Today."
