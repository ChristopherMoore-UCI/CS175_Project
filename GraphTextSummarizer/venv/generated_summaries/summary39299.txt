Tristan da Cunha Officially: British Overseas Territory Forget what the people of the Galapagos tell you, this is the most remote inhabited place on the entire planet -- a volcanic island in the South Atlantic 1,750 miles from the nearest populated place, Cape Town, South Africa. Air New Zealand flies to Niue from Auckland twice a week. It's inhabited by a huge population of Barbary macaque monkeys and miles of tunnels on and in the Rock, dug out during the 19th century by locals to protect the territory during a siege by the French and Spanish, who were trying to wrestle it out of British hands. Gibraltar Officially: British Overseas Territory A source of near constant friction between Britain and Spain, the tiny enclave of Gibraltar on Spain's far southern coast was granted to the UK in the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713 -- it remains the only overseas territory Britain possesses in Europe. When Napoleon was exiled to St. Helena (another British territory in the Atlantic) a small band of British soldiers was stationed on Tristan to prevent the island being used as part of any escape attempt.
