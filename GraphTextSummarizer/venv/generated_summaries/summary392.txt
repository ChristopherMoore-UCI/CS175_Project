The way Serena Williams cruised in New York for her 18th major, she has to be the favorite to pick up multiple grand slams in 2015. Gulbis began the year strong, so the outspoken Latvian's win was hardly as surprising as those of Sergiy Stakhovsky and Tommy Robredo against Federer in London and New York last year. This year's trip to Roland Garros bailed Sharapova out -- the 27-year-old didn't get to the quarterfinals in Melbourne, London and New York. But the Swiss' health recovery and larger racket led to a return to the later rounds at grand slams in 2014. Federer's increased forays to the net shorten points and thus figure to add to his longevity, but his net points won in his four losses at grand slams this year -- 59.9% -- shows you how difficult it is to enjoy success with such tactics against the best opposition.
