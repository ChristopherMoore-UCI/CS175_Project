The gang rape of a 23-year-old woman in a bus in New Delhi in December sparked debate and introspection in India about sexual crimes against women. The attack has shocked and disappointed many Mumbai residents, who consider their city to be a safer place for women than the capital, New Delhi. Across India, 24,923 cases of rape were reported last year, according to the National Crime Records Bureau. Delhi Police said the number of reported rapes in the capital had jumped from 179 for the first 3Â½ months of last year to 463 for the same period this year.
