Combining information from state DMVs (Departments of Motor Vehicles) and RMVs (Registry of Motor Vehicles) as well as police reports and other sources, a vehicle history report can give you a comprehensive overview of where the car's been. Carefully reviewing the vehicle description is one way to avoid various types of vehicle fraud, like VIN cloning. In the case of CARFAX, the company's database contains more than five billion records from thousands of public and private sources, including all DMVs in the United States and Canada and thousands of vehicle inspection stations, auto auctions, fleet management and rental agencies, automobile manufacturers, and fire and police departments. Rental cars and former taxis, for example, will often have undergone a lot of abuse, although they tend to be quite inexpensive. Winter storms (with their accompanying salted roads) can be rough on cars, as obviously can floods, excessive heat or even sea air.
