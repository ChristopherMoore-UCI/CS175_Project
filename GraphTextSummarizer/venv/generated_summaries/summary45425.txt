On a research trip in Nigeria, Dr. Laura Stachel watched as physicians performed an emergency cesarean section. For Stachel, the solar suitcase is only part of a bigger mission to improve maternal health care and lower mortality rates in developing countries. He drew up designs for a solar electric system to provide a free source of power to the state hospital in northern Nigeria where Stachel had conducted her research. "I realized that my skills as an obstetrician-gynecologist were utterly useless (without) something as basic as light and electricity," Stachel said. It also spread to other countries after Stachel and Aronson started a nonprofit, We Care Solar.
