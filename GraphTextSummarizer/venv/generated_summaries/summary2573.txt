The effort by the Army was recently accelerated, according to Army officials, after U.S. Rep. John Murtha, D-Pennsylvania, told the Army he had a number of complaints from soldiers in Afghanistan who said the current camouflage pattern was not effective in the mountainous regions. Troops will still keep the existing ACU, and commanders will be able to decide mission by mission what the soldiers should wear, according to Army officials. U.S. Army commanders in Afghanistan say the current uniform does not blend well in the countryside. Both battalions will be based in eastern Afghanistan where the terrain is the most rugged and diverse, Army officials said. The testing is part of the Army's long-term development of a permanent alternative to the current ACU, according to Army officials.
