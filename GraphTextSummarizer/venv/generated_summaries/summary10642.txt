Bryan brothers break McEnroe's record The world champions are decided by a system which lends greater weight to grand slam and Fed or Davis Cup success than world rankings or ATP and WTA Tour tournaments. Kvitova headed off top-ranked Caroline Wozniacki after securing the first grand slam triumph of her career at Wimbledon in July and triumphing at the season-ending WTA Championships in October. Kvitova's Fed Cup teammate Kveta Peschke, 36, and Slovenia's Katarina Srebotnik, 30, won the women's doubles honor after claiming their first grand slam title at Wimbledon. -- The International Tennis Federation honored Novak Djokovic and Petra Kvitova for breakthrough years on Tuesday, as the duo were named the governing body's men's and women's world champions for 2011. The 24-year-old Serbian clinched the Australian Open, Wimbledon and U.S. Open crowns to become the first player outside of Spaniard Nadal and 16-time grand slam winner Roger Federer to claim the award since American Andy Roddick in 2003.
