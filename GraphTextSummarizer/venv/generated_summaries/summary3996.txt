-- Indiana voters retired Dick Lugar on Tuesday after 36 years in the Senate, punishing him for the qualities he considered assets: seniority, expertise in foreign policy and a penchant for bipartisan cooperation. "I liked the fact that Sen. Lugar isn't a strict party person," Vicki Johnson, a voter in Fairland, said Tuesday afternoon. "When I began this campaign, Senator Lugar was not my enemy," Mourdock said. Lugar focused his pitch on his more than three decades in the Senate as a leading voice on foreign policy. What was striking about Lugar's loss is how evident it is Hoosier voters respect him.
