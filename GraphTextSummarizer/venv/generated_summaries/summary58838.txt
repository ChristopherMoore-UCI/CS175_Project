After the initial flurry of concern, the dark corner of Vine was mostly forgotten about by people who weren't actively seeking out salacious content, at least until last month, when a young man rose to temporary Internet fame when he filmed himself being intimate with a Pop Tart and then a Hot Pocket. Just days after Vine's official launch in January of last year, reports surfaced about the presence of porn on Vine, a service for sharing 6-second long videos on Twitter and with other Vine users. The content will largely be flagged by other Vine members using the "Report this post" option. -- Twitter has officially banned pornographic content on Vine, its year-old social-video service. Twitter said the change in policy is just a matter of the type of content that fits with the Vine community.
