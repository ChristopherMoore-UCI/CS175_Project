Juicy Campus is a Web site, founded on August 1, 2007, which claims to have "the simple mission of enabling online anonymous free speech on college campuses. The Act aims to shield Web publishers from liability for libelous comments posted by third parties. Juicy Campus and similar Web sites are protected under Communications Decency Act of 1996. Some recent posts discuss the breasts of a professor, sluttiest girls and sexiest guys on campus. The First Amendment certainly protects free speech, even unpopular speech.
