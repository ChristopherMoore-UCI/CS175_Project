Following the dissolution of an ANA-AirAsia joint venture, AirAsia Japan is being rebranded (hilariously, to some) as Vanilla Air; Singapore's Tiger Airways has the new name of Tigerair; and Jetstar Hong Kong is expected to launch within the year; Meanwhile, South Korea's Jeju Air has been busy recording a whopping 960% increase in profits compared with last year. LCC fleets are young and frequently built around a single model "People tend to think that low-cost carriers have these old planes, but that is a complete myth," said Edward Lau, CEO of Jetstar Hong Kong, in a low-cost carrier workshop earlier this month. North Asian travelers who have grown partial to the over-the-top service and quality of legacy carriers in the region are still finding the concept of low-cost carriers foreign, or simply irrelevant. " In order to keep the cost of buying planes as low as possible, low-cost carriers place bulk orders of the newest planes. While Southeast Asia has a remarkably high LCC presence of almost 50% -- meaning more than half of total seats are sold by low-cost carriers -- North Asia still has an extremely low LCC penetration and thus represents the biggest opportunity for the industry.
