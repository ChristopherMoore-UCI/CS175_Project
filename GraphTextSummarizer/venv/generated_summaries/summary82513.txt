The first video, recorded Sunday afternoon, shows Fort Lauderdale police officer Victor Ramirez escorting Bruce Laclair, who CNN affiliate WSVN reports is homeless, at a bus terminal. The second video, shot Monday by attorney Bill Gelin at the Broward County Courthouse, shows Broward Sheriff's Deputy Christopher Johnson dragging a handcuffed, screaming woman down a hallway by her leg restraints. "I am concerned by the way the deputy handled this situation because there were other courses of action he could have taken," Broward County Sheriff Steve Israel said. The two argue for a few seconds and, after telling the man to "get up" multiple times, Ramirez reaches for Laclair's arm. Ramirez wrote in the report that he told Laclair to leave the terminal and gave him plenty of time to leave.
