"For a tourist coming in, it's the buzz of that red carpet," said hotel manager Michael Robertson. From former Sen. John Edwards, who was discovered there with his mistress, to Heidi Fleiss, the so-called Hollywood madam whose alleged prostitutes were caught in an undercover sting at the hotel, many public figures have stories that haunt the Hilton's halls. "Hollywood is a world most people don't live in," Robertson notes. It was before music mogul Clive Davis' pre-Grammy party in 2012 that Whitney Houston was found dead in her room at the Hilton. In fact, a photo of Kennedy at the Hilton is hanging on the hotel wall.
