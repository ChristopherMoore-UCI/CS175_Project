While the woman apparently was opposed to the Jackson's lawsuit seeking billions of dollars in damages, AEG Live lawyer Marvin Putnam used the incident to suggest that the judge should crack down on Michael Jackson fans who wear Jackson shirts and carry signs of support for Katherine Jackson in the court hallway. A key piece of evidence used by the Jackson lawyers is an e-mail sent by AEG Live CE Randy Phillips to "This Is It" show director Kenny Ortega on June 20, 2009 -- five days before Michael Jackson died from an overdose of propofol administered by Murray. Jackson lawyers contend that Murray's deep debt, which included $1 million in foreclosures and judgments, made him conflicted since he could lose his $150,000 a month job if Jackson didn't make to rehearsals and perform his concerts. "This doctor is extremely successful (we check everyone out) and does not need this gig so he is totally unbiased and ethical," Philips wrote in an effort to assure Ortega Jackson was in good hands with Dr. Murray. Nephew: Jackson was murdered Prince and Blanket dancing Jurors would have learned a lot about Michael Jackson's work and worth if they had traveled with the Jackson family to Las Vegas over the weekend for the premiere of Cirque du Soleil's "Michael Jackson One" show.
