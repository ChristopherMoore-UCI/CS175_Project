Smith's wife and another daughter were in Cascade, Idaho, on Tuesday awaiting news about the search, Kriech said. About 3 p.m. Sunday, as they were flying over central Idaho at an altitude of 9,000 feet, the 51-year-old executive reported engine trouble and asked controllers in Salt Lake City for the coordinates of the Johnson Creek Air Strip, the sheriff's spokesman said. Dale Smith had left Baker City, Oregon, with his son, his son's wife, his daughter and her fiance, said Rand Kriech. It employs 25 people, said Kriech, who described Smith as a religious man who had done humanitarian work with the group Medecins sans Frontieres. "We've done a ping on the cell phones, and we've narrowed it down to a 4- or 5-square-mile area that we're searching right now," Valley County Sheriff's Office Lt. Dan Smith told CNN affiliate KGO.
