McBride was unarmed and there was no evidence of a break-in, so Wafer -- who authorities say shot McBride from behind a closed, locked screen door -- cannot lawfully claim he needed to shoot her to stop an imminent threat, Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy told reporters Friday. Theodore Paul Wafer, 54, also was charged with manslaughter and possession of a firearm in the commission of a felony in the November 2 shooting of Renisha McBride, who authorities say was intoxicated and possibly disoriented following a car crash before Wafer shot her on his Dearborn Heights porch. " Thurswell, the attorney for McBride's parents, told reporters Friday that Wafer was safe in his home, and he should have called 911 before shooting if he believed his life was in jeopardy, not after. Worthy said her office didn't feel McBride's intoxication was relevant in the decision to file charges. You took a life, and you took a beautiful life that was starting to blossom into a beautiful woman," Monica McBride told reporters, addressing Wafer, who was in custody elsewhere.
