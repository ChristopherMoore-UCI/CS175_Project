AEG Live lawyers initially asked for $1.2 million from the Jacksons, but Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Yvette Palazuelos ordered them to resubmit their claim with $400,000 in expenses removed. A California appeals court will hear arguments on the case in November, but it could be years before the judgment is final. A jury rejected their case after a six-month trial last year. The Jacksons sued the concert promoter, accusing the company of responsibility in the pop icon's 2009 death because it hired, retained or supervised the doctor convicted of involuntary manslaughter. -- Michael Jackson's mother and three children may be on the hook for $800,000 if they lose their appeal of the AEG wrongful death verdict, a judge ruled Monday.
