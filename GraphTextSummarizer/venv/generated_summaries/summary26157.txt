Kurdish officials said they were concerned ISIS fighters would break through their lines. CNN's Senior Political Analyst Ron Brownstein said he was surprised to see that 47% of the people polled said they approve of sending ground forces to fight ISIS. ISIS fighters launched a major assault Tuesday night southwest of Irbil, Kurdish officials said. While there is an example of ISIS' brutality nearly every day, terrorism experts such as CNN's Peter Bergen and Tim Lister remind us Tuesday that it's critical to look at the big and frightening picture of what's happening. If that happens, there would be little standing between ISIS and the Kurdish capital, though Tuesday's attacks are likely aimed at drawing the already stretched Kurdish forces in many different directions to relieve the pressure on Mosul, which ISIS seized in June.
