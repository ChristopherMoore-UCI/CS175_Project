-- Diego Costa and Arda Turan took part in training with Atletico Madrid teammates at the Estadio da Luz Friday ahead the Champions League final clash with city rivals Real Madrid. The pair have been an integral part of Atletico's title winning side but remain doubts for Saturday's fixture after being forced off during last weekend's league clash with Barcelona -- the match that saw Atleti clinch La Liga for the first time in 18 years. Atletico manager Diego Simeone, however, remained tight-lipped about the pair's chances of making his starting lineup in Lisbon on Saturday. "Since Carlo Ancelotti arrived he has emphasized hard work and intensity and now that is what Real Madrid are associated with," Ramos said. The naturalized Spaniard, who has scored 36 goals in 51 appearances this season, reportedly flew to Belgrade for horse-placenta treatment on a hamstring tear earlier this week while Turan has nursed the hip-knock he sustained against the Catalans at the club's training base in Madrid.
