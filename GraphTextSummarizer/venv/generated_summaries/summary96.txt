"The ruling frees thousands of home care and child care providers from financially assisting government unions that they disagree with. "No court case is going to stand in the way of home care workers coming together to have a strong voice for good jobs and quality home care," she said. The ruling stems from a decision by Illinois lawmakers to classify home health care workers paid by Medicaid as state employees and require them to pay fees to the Service Employees International Union. In a decision that sidesteps a major shift in labor policy, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled Monday that Illinois can't force home health care workers to pay dues to unions. But it also deals a blow to union efforts nationwide to extend their reach in an era of declining membership and political influence.
