Militants are trying to regroup In Azzan, an al Qaeda-controlled town in neighboring Shabwa province, officials said. -- Yemeni troops raided a third al Qaeda stronghold in a southern province, killing 40 suspected militants, authorities said Friday. Yemen is intensifying its fight against al Qaeda after a year-long political crisis allowed the militant group to seize large areas in the south. The troops entered Shaqra town in Abyan province. The operation comes three days after government troops retook Jaar and Zinjibar towns from the militants.
