Rebels in Aleppo on Tuesday fired upon pro-government enclaves in that town in retaliation for Syrian troops earlier firing upon the opposition in Homs, according to the rebels and an opposition group. The truce began last Wednesday in the strategic and symbolic city of Homs, where opposition fighters and their families underwent an evacuation, the opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights in London said. On Monday, Syrian troops opened fire on al Waer, the last known opposition stronghold in Homs, killing at least one person, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. "The regime's shelling of the town of Addar al-Kabira north of Homs, to where rebels of Homs retreated in line with a deal organized by the U.N., makes evident the falsity of the truces that the Assad regime seeks to promote," Nasser al-Hariri, a member of the Syrian Coalition, said in a statement Tuesday. The rebel Ahl al Sham fighting coalition in Aleppo posted video of fighters firing rockets into the two Aleppo neighborhoods, known to be sympathetic to the government.
