After Pyongyang fired on balloons last October and South Korea returned fire, those living close to the border have been trying to physically stop the launches, arguing they are being put in the line of fire. Yet he is still sending thousands of copies across the border from South to North Korea in balloons, determined his people will see the movie in which the leader Kim Jong Un is assassinated on screen. The chances of at least some North Koreans having watched the film that North Korea sees as "an act of terrorism" is certainly possible. At 1 a.m., Lee makes a final check of the wind speed and direction, then heads towards the border with North Korea. The decision to launch the balloons in the dead of night is not just to avoid confrontation with North Korea, but also with South Korea's local residents.
