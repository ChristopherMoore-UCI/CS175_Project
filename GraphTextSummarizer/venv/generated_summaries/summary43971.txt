" From its outset, the Extreme Sailing Series has tried to be different -- from the element of stadium racing that Tourrell and his team first introduced, to the idea of getting guest sailors, whether they be celebrities, journalists or sponsors. -- It's like motor racing on water -- deafening music blares out in the countdown to races, and fans flock to the water's edge. " Crashes do happen though, and not surprisingly with relative frequency compared to most sailing racing formats. There are four days of racing at each act -- one open-water and three other stadium-racing days in front of the eyes of an expectant public. Despite some impressive collisions and capsizes, organizer Andy Tourell believes only one boat has lost out a day's racing as a result of a prang -- a remarkable achievement bearing in mind the topsy-turvy nature of this form of racing.
