The victory will see him leapfrog England's Luke Donald as world No.1, a week after missing out on the honor when beaten by Hunter Mahan in the WGC Match Play final. -- Rory McIlroy kept his nerve in the face of a last day charge from Tiger Woods to win the Honda Classic Sunday and jump to the top of the world rankings. 14-time major winner Woods showed he is still a force to be reckoned with after a closing eight-under 62, his lowest final round as a professional. The U.S. Open champion duly completed that test in level par and he played safe on the 18th for a par-five to wrap up his third PGA tour title. The 22-year-old from Northern Ireland finished with a one-under-par 69 for a 12-under total of 268 at the PGA National in Florida.
