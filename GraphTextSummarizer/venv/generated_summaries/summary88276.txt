"We need to assume, or at least pray, that Mrs. Dermond is still alive, and we desperately need to know her whereabouts," Putnam County Sheriff Howard Sills said Thursday. Russell Dermond has paid taxes on a 23-foot boat, which Sills said the couple recently sold, and Dermond reportedly owned fast-food restaurants. The Dermonds' friends hadn't heard from them in days and went to their home in the upscale, gated, lakeside Great Waters community, where they found Russell Dermond in the garage. Investigators believe Russell Dermond was killed between last Friday and Sunday, and they're still searching for his severed head, Sills told reporters, describing the case as "very unusual" and the most frustrating homicide of his career. "The only person who's not a suspect is Sheriff Sills, because I know where I was." 'This has been a shock' Residents described Reynolds Plantation -- a tony resort community about 75 miles east of Atlanta, which also boasts a Jack Nicklaus signature golf course and a Ritz-Carlton Lodge -- as a safe enclave where people were comfortable leaving their doors unlocked.
