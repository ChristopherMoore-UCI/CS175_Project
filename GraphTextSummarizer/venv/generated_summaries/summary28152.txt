All-conquering Spain marched on at the Confederations Cup Sunday with a 3-0 win over Nigeria to top Group B. Two goals from Jordi Alba and a further strike from substitute Fernando Torres made it a comfortable night in Fortaleza for the World and European champions. Spain take on fellow European powerhouses Italy in Fortaleza the following night. The red cards came in the second half, the first to Andres Scotti for a second yellow after he had seen his penalty saved by Gilbert Meriel. African champions Nigeria briefly rallied, but Spain took total command in midfield and might have added further to the scoreline before the break. The defeat marked the end of their fairytale inclusion in a top level FIFA tournament, losing to Nigeria, Spain and now Uruguay and conceding 24 goals to just one scored.
