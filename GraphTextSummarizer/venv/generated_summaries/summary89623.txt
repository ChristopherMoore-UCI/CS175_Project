A British transport minister on a trade visit to Taipei got a lesson in the perils of diplomatic gift giving Monday when she presented a pocket watch to the city's mayor -- a taboo act in Chinese culture. Kramer and Ko can take comfort that it's not the first time an exchange of official gifts has stirred controversy. President Obama was widely slammed by the British press in 2009 when he gave then British prime minister Gordon Brown a set of DVDs, which did not play on the British system. Baroness Susan Kramer apologized for the inadvertently inauspicious gift -- the word for a watch or clock in Chinese sounds like "the end" and many associate it with death. The same year, the President Obama raised eyebrows again when he gave Queen Elizabeth II an iPod loaded with video footage of her visit to the United States in 2007.
