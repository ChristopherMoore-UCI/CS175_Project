India's Tata Group names successor It was widely expected that Tata's half brother, Noel Tata -- who is married to Mistry's sister -- would be named chairman. Asked in an exclusive interview with CNN earlier this year what are the chances a Tata family member would replace him, the 73-year-old Ratan Tata said, "My stepbrother is one of the candidates that is being considered and I don't think it's my lot to say whether it's 50%, or 90% or 10% (chance). " "People raised eyebrows when Ratan Tata succeeded JRD (Tata, the previous chairman)," Darius Pandole, a partner in New Silk Route, told India's Economic Times. Reaction across the Indian business press was one of surprise at the appointment of 43-year-old Cyrus Pallonji Mistry as the successor to business icon Ratan Tata, the man who has led the $80 billion conglomerate for the past two decades. Most of the company's stock is controlled by Tata family philanthropic trust funds.
