Zuma was re-elected to a second term last month despite economic woes, deadly mining protests and corruption allegations. -- South African President Jacob Zuma has been admitted to the hospital for tests, his spokesman Mac Maharaj said in a statement Saturday. "Yesterday President Zuma was advised to rest following a demanding election and transition programme to the new administration," Maharaj said. His party, the African National Congress, won the general election with 62% of the vote, which was lower than the previous election. After a turbulent first term, Zuma said during his inaugural address that his government will perform better this time around and take responsibility for any shortcomings.
