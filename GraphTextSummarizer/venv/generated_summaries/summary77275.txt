-- An autopsy to determine why Rodney King was found dead in his swimming pool began Monday morning, but it will be several weeks before the findings are made public, a San Bernadino County, California, coroner's spokeswoman said Monday. De Anda said he did not see any drug paraphernalia "or anything that would indicate that Mr. King was intoxicated" at the scene. King, whose beating by Los Angeles police in 1991 was caught on camera and sparked riots after the acquittal of the four officers involved, was found dead at his Rialto, California, home early Sunday, authorities and his fiancee said. Kelly, who was a juror in King's lawsuit against the city of Los Angeles in 1994, told police that King was an "avid swimmer" but that she was not, De Anda said. King also sued the city of Los Angeles and was awarded $3.8 million in damages.
