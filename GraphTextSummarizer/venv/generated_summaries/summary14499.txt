In a recent study at the University of Maryland Medical Center, researchers found that sleep apnea can cause a rise in depression and that sleep-related breathing disorders can also worsen nightmares and post-traumatic stress disorder. Losing pounds can "cure" sleep apnea, especially for overweight people, LoRusso said. "In some cases, changing these factors can eliminate sleep apnea from some patients," LoRusso said. A disorder in which breathing is briefly and repeatedly interrupted during sleep, apnea occurs when the muscles in the back of the throat fail to keep the airway open, despite efforts to breathe. According to the National Sleep Foundation, more than 18 million American adults have sleep apnea, and many of them don't know it.
