Using conventional electricity was never an option, he adds, after all "what's the point of turning carbon into fuel if the electricity you're using to do it burns up more carbon than you started with?" He says that, while all efforts should be made to reduce our dependence on liquid fuels, it may not be possible for some industries: "The thing with fuel is that it offers very high density energy storage ... Wouldn't it be great if you could simply grab carbon dioxide from the air and turn it back into fuel? Hardy points out that, even if we reduce our thirst for fossil fuels to just one or two percent of this figure over the next century, we may still need millions of barrels for things like commercial flight that are unable to use electricity for power. "The combustion of synthetic fuel does not increase the amount of C02 in the atmosphere," he explains.
