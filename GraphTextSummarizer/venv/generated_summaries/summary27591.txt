" The research was part of Conservation International Rapid Assessment Program (RAP) that aims to record biodiversity and promote conservation across the world. Dr. Trond Larsen, director of RAP said: "As a scientist, it is thrilling to study these remote forests where countless new discoveries await, especially since we believe that protecting these landscapes while they remain pristine provides perhaps the greatest opportunity for maintaining globally important biodiversity and the ecosystems people depend upon for generations to come." Instead of camouflage, its body is covered with bony spines to deter potential predators. During a three project in 2010, scientists were joined by indigenous people from villages in southwest Surinam to documented nearly 1,300 species along the Kutari and Sipaliwini Rivers that lie in one of the most inaccessible forests in the world. "The area was paradise for the entomologists with spectacular and unique insects everywhere," said Dr. Leeanne Alonso, of Global Wildlife Conservation, who was part of the research team.
