Unconfirmed reports stated the fire was caused by a lightning strike which hit the transformer, according to Agence France-Presse (AFP), which quoted Phuket deputy governor Chamroen Tipayapongtada. It's not known whether those killed were Thai nationals or foreign tourists, as the bodies were burnt beyond recognition, director of Patong Hospital, Bhumin Silapan, told CNN. -- Four people have been killed in a fire that swept through a popular nightclub in the early hours of Friday morning on the Thai island of Phuket. Phuket is popular holiday resort for foreign tourists and the Tiger Bar is described by one online travel guide as "one of the most popular places to have a drink in all of Phuket." Police are still trying to determine the cause of the blaze but the officer in charge of the case told CNN that it's believed a transformer near the Tiger Pub, also known as Soi Tiger, on Bangla Road, Patong, caught fire.
