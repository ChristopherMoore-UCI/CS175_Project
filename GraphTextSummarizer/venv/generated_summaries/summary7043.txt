In the years leading up to the financial crisis of 2007-8, banks and mortgage companies rushed to provide mortgage loans to homeowners, many of whom weren't capable of shouldering the debt. The settlement covers a wide range of sins committed by banks and other mortgage lenders. The third and most serious issue involved foreclosures where banks could not prove that they owned the property. When housing prices stopped rising and homeowners could no longer refinance their way out of bad mortgages, the cycle ended and the financial crisis set in. If there's no evidence of deliberate fraud, banks will be given immunity from responsibility for sloppy paperwork.
