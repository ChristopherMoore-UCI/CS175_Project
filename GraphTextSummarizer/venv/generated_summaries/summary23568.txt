In an equally significant move, Oklahoma Rep. Tom Cole of the Republican Whip team told House Speaker John Boehner that he thought the Republicans should join President Barack Obama and immediately pass a tax extension for 98% of Americans who earn under $250,000. The Republican budget that passed the House, but not the Senate, before the election would cut food stamps as excess spending for unemployed parents. More Republicans must put their country before someone else's agenda, and their Pledge of Allegiance before "The Pledge" to Norquist. That top Republicans are willing to openly defy Norquist's pledge and that any are willing to buck McConnell and Boehner are seminal events in recent American history. When King said that he felt his pledge was only for one Congress, Norquist compared the pledge to marriage vows, hinting King's wife should be worried.
