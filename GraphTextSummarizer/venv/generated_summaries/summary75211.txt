Flu vaccine may work better in women, study suggests New York City requires flu vaccine in city preschools and day cares Horizons Healthcare Services spokesman Alan Peterson told CNN affiliate WPVI that it's unconscionable for a health care worker not to be immunized and that pregnant women are more susceptible to the flu. She stated she only wants the company to reevaluate their policy on vaccines for pregnant employees and to continue working as a nurse. She told her employers that she would not get the vaccine after she explained that there were very limited studies of the effects on pregnant women. The CDC website states that getting a flu shot while pregnant is the best protection for pregnant women and their babies.
