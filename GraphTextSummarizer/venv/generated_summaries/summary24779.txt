Pakistani security officials told CNN that if tensions with India escalate, Pakistan may shift its military forces from the Afghan border east to prepare for any conflict. The fallout from the attacks is damaging the tenuous relationship between India and Pakistan, said CNN's sister station in India, CNN-IBN. "We found bullets with them, hand grenades, bombs," said R. R. Patil, deputy chief minister of Maharashtra state, where Mumbai is located. Indian Home Minister Shivraj Patil addresses the media after a cabinet meeting with PM Manmohan Singh. Officials say they found telephones and a global navigational device on an abandoned boat floating off the coast of Mumbai that was used by the terrorists, CNN-IBN reported.
