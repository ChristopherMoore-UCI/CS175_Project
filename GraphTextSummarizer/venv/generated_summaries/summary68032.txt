Many younger Americans exiting college work multiple jobs to make ends meet or find work in transitory positions without benefits. In his stimulus bill, passed at the height of his influence, the President focused too much on tax cuts and not enough on the kinds of public jobs that would have been attractive to younger Americans struggling to find a place in the workforce. As Sarah Ayers of the Center for American Progress noted, the unemployment crisis for young Americans includes "high school students who are having a harder time finding after-school jobs, twenty-somethings who are increasingly stuck in unpaid internships instead of paying jobs, and college students who are settling for low-wage, low-skill jobs such as waiting tables or serving coffee." Like all the other Americans who are struggling in the modern economy, younger voters want job security. For many younger Americans this has been a great disappointment.
