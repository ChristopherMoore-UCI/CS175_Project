The Discovery's 11-day flight, which had been set to launch on Monday, will be a "very busy mission," according to NASA Flight Director Bryan Lunney. "After we fly around the Earth about 170 times, Discovery will come home for its last flight," Lunney said during a news conference last month. -- A mechanical problem forced NASA to delay the final launch of the Space shuttle Discovery at least until next Tuesday, the space agency said Friday. Launchtime on Tuesday is set for 4:12 p.m., when weather experts predict a 70 percent chance of acceptable weather, NASA said. This will be the 133rd space shuttle mission and the final one for Discovery.
