The first witness in the trial of Ratko Mladic, the former commander of the Bosnian Serb army, testified Monday that the army slaughtered Bosnian Muslims from his village in 1992. But a combined force of Bosnian Serb army soldiers and Serbian civilians ambushed them, he said. Shortly after Mladic was sent to The Hague last year, authorities nabbed former Croatian Serb rebel leader Goran Hadzic. In May, prosecutor Dermot Groome laid out details of the case against Mladic, saying that ethnic cleansing was not a byproduct of the war, but a specific aim of the Bosnian Serb leadership. Mladic is accused of masterminding the army campaign to "cleanse" Bosnia of Croats and Bosnian Muslims.
