Training that doesn't just focus on how to react to shootings but knows the community and makes relationships that lead to safer communities. In the wake of shootings in Newtown, Aurora, Tucson, Oak Creek, and too many more places, people are asking again, "What can we do?" First, we must stop asking "why?" and start asking "why not?" These include the proliferation of assault rifles and clips of 30 to 100 rounds, access to mental health support or lack of it, and, most important, falling short in our efforts of prevention. Holes made by the fact that the Newtown children are not the only children we have lost to mass shootings. Holes inspired by the glorification of the shooters in previous shootings.
