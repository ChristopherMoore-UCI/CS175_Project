It has been spared the brand of Sunni extremism in Pakistan, where ruthless attacks on Shia are a shocking part of the fabric. Whether the culprits turn out to be the Pakistan-based Haqqani network -- the group blamed for recent high-profile and sophisticated attacks in the capital -- the Lashkar-e-Janghvi al Almi, or another complex part of Afghanistan's insurgency, fractured and complicated after 10 years, many Afghans place the blame at one source: Pakistan. The interior ministry here points its finger at the Taliban, despite an effusive denial from spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid. It's arguable that an offshoot of the Lashkar-e-Janghvi movement, which reportedly rang in a claim from Pakistan, is capable of mounting a sophisticated, targeted and vicious attack in the very heart of Kabul without some assistance. That's the "address" that Kabul thinks the Taliban now resides under.
