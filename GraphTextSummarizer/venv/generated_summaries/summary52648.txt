-- A South Korean court has issued an arrest warrant for the brother of President Lee Myung-bak on bribery charges, a court official said Wednesday, dealing a blow to the governing party ahead of elections later this year. The incumbent president won't be running for re-election later this year because the law limits presidents to only one five-year term, but the arrest taints the image of his governing party. "Families of former presidents have been misusing power before," said Kwang Won-taek, professor at Seoul National University. The president's brother said he was sorry as he was taken to the detention center but did not comment further, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported. Lee Sang-deuk, a former six-term lawmaker, has been charged over allegations he received about half a million dollars from the savings banks Solomon and Mirae in exchange for exerting influence over officials investigating the banks, the court official said.
