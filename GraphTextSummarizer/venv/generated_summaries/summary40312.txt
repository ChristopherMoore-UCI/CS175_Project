-- Leandro Benitez scored both goals as Copa Libertadores winners Estudiantes de La Plata beat Pohang Steelers 2-1 in Abu Dhabi on Tuesday to book their place in the Club World Cup final. Mexicans Atlante and European Cup winners Barcelona will meet on Wednesday in the second semifinal. Benitez opened the scoring with a free-kick on the stroke of half-time, curling home a 25-yard strike that deceived goalkeeper Shin Hwa Yong. Kim Jae-Sung was first to go moments after the goal and keeper Shin followed five minutes later to leave Pohang with eight men. The Argentine side will now face either Barcelona or Atlante on Saturday after a turbulent second half at the Mohammed Bin Zayed Stadium saw the South Korean side finish with just eight players.
