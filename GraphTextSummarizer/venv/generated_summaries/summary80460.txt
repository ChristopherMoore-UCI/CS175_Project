Warren's comments did make one clear case: women will be treated as equals when there continue to be more women in the Senate. Sen. Elizabeth Warren told CNN she has been treated differently as a woman in the clubby upper chamber — echoing the general sentiments of her colleague Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, who wrote about sexism in the Senate in a recent book. In the book, Gillibrand recounted specific details of unnamed male senators remarking about her appearance—even squeezing her waist. During a wide-ranging interview on the Colorado campaign trail—where she was stumping for endangered incumbent Sen. Mark Udall—CNN asked Warren whether she had experienced any different treatment as a woman. Our story, airing today on the Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer, looks at Warren as the unusal Washington phenom—a combination of loyal Democratic soldier and outside agitator, a party star who is willing to take on her own party—including the president.
