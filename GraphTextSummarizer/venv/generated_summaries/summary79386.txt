-- There were smiles, laughter and tears -- but little politics -- when former Presidents George W. Bush and his father, George H. W. Bush, joined current President Barack Obama at the White House for the unveiling Thursday of the younger Bush's official portrait. "After three-and-a-half years in office and more gray hair, I have a deeper understanding of the challenges faced by the men before me, including President Bush," Obama said, adding that one truth is you can't make everybody happy. Both Bush and Mrs. Bush, who also had her official portrait unveiled, thanked the Obamas for their hospitality in hosting the event that included lunch with the Bush family -- including both former presidents and first ladies as well as former first daughters Jenna and Barbara. " Mrs. Bush also drew a big laugh when she said in reference to the new paintings that "nothing makes a house a home like having portraits of its former occupants staring down at you." "George, you went out of your way, to make sure the transition to new administration was as seamless as possible," Obama said, adding: "I'll always be grateful for that." He also cited Bush's strength and resolve that reassured the nation after the September 11 terrorist attacks, and made sure to note that anti-terrorism efforts started in the Bush administration helped bring the signature national security achievement of Obama's presidency so far -- the killing of Osama bin Laden.
