-- Joe Paterno, the Penn State football coach who lost his job amid allegations of child sex abuse against his former defensive coordinator, has a treatable form of lung cancer, his son said Friday. National outrage percolated over Paterno's reaction to a graduate assistant's 2002 report that he had seen former Penn State defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky performing anal sex on a young boy in the shower room of the football complex. Paterno said that he'd never been told the graphic details revealed in a grand jury report about sex abuse allegations but that he nevertheless passed the allegations on to his boss. Paterno, who served 46 years as head coach in State College, was known to generations of football fans simply as JoePa. "This unprecedented situation demands the NCAA evaluate the university's accountability" and application of NCAA bylaws, NCAA President Mark Emmert said in a letter to the school.
