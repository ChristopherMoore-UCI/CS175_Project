Bipartisanship was in the crowd too as Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, came to cheer on his team as did Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California, and a number of others including Reps. Jan Schakowsky, D-Illinois, Dennis Kuchinich, D-Ohio, Democratic Caucus Leader John Larsen, D-Connecticut, and Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, D-Maryland. Wasserman Schultz, whose jersey simply read "DWS", made the incredible game winning hit, driving in Rep. Linda Sanchez, D-California, to win the game 5-4. Players included Congressional team MVP and DNC chair Wasserman Schultz, Reps. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Florida, Jean Schmidt, R-Ohio, Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-New York, Kelly Ayotte, R-New Hampshire, and Kay Hagan D-North Carolina for the Congressional Women's team. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minnesota, who repeatedly pointed out that the average age of the Members' team is 53 years old, and NBC's Andrea Mitchell called the game. CNN's Erika Dimmler made an incredible outfield somersault catch to make it two outs but then Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Florida, came to the plate.
