Knox's words capped a dramatic week of closing arguments by the host of lawyers battling over the outcome, from the lawyer for a man falsely accused of the crime, who called Knox "Lucifer-like, demonic, Satanic," to the Sollecito defense counsel Giulia Bongiorno, who insisted that like the buxom cartoon temptress Jessica Rabbit in the movie "Who Framed Roger Rabbit?" Knox and co-defendant Raffaele Sollecito are fighting to be acquitted of the murder of British exchange student Meredith Kercher. As Knox defense lawyer Luciano Ghirga made his final statements to the court before Knox and Sollecito spoke Monday, he reminded the jury that the standard is "beyond a reasonable doubt. Knox did not look at Sollecito as he addressed the court, though he detailed for the judges and jurors the night of Kercher's murder. Prosecutors and police say Kercher's genetic material was on the knife blade and Knox's was on the handle, and that a Kercher bra clasp found at the crime scene had Sollecito's DNA.
