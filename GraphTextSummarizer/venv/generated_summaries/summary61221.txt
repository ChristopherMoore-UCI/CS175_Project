Flowers and gifts are piled around a sign that reads: "Pray for Chloie and Gage's family." Tim Miller, the school's principal, told CNN affiliate WTVF that he feels he's on an "emotional roller coaster. When asked whether the TBI fears for the children's safety, Helm responded: "Yes, because we have two children who are outside their personal zone of safety. ... The children -- identified as 9-year-old Chloie Leverette and 7-year-old Gage Daniel -- were last seen Sunday around 6:30 p.m., approximately three hours before their home burned down, according to the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, or TBI. "After an extensive five day search, multiple fire experts have processed the scene and are unable to locate evidence that Chloie and Gage were victims of the fire. The location of Chloie and Gage are unknown at this time," the TBI said.
