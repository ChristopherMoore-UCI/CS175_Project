Tarkanian compiled a career record of 784-202 while at Long Beach State, UNLV and Fresno State. "Jerry Tarkanian is one of the true legends in the coaching profession," current Fresno State head men's basketball coach Rodney Terry said. In 1998, while he was with Fresno State, the NCAA reportedly settled with Tarkanian for $2.5 million. Jerry Tarkanian, the legendary men's basketball coach who won the 1990 national championship at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, and who was known to battle with the NCAA, died Wednesday in Las Vegas. Coach Tarkanian welcomed me in from the first day I arrived in Fresno.
