Android users, take note: Google Keep — a long-overdue app for creating lists and reminders — has arrived. Using Android's sharing features, you share a photo by e-mail, text messaging, Picasa, Google+, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Path, Dropbox and even Amazon's Send to Kindle feature. You can type out a reminder or list using the Keep Android app, which landed in Google Play on Wednesday (after leaking for a bit Monday), or on the web at drive.google.com/keep. If you snap a photo in the app, you can then edit it using all of Android's built-in camera features (cropping, color balancing, photo filters and borders). As you'd expect, Keep is integrated with Google Drive, the cloud storage service Google wants anyone who uses anything it makes to use.
