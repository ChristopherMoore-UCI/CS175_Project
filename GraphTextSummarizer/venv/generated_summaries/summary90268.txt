Supreme Decree 748 is intended to stop that and to give oil producers an incentive to invest in Bolivian petroleum production "so that Bolivia is not continuing to import either diesel or gasoline," he said. Of that, $150 million worth of gasoline will have been sold for higher prices in neighboring countries, he said. Morales said he would add 10 percent to the national price for staples like rice, corn and wheat to incentivize domestic food producers to grow more and would invest in water projects, too. For example, under the old system, $27 worth of gasoline in Bolivia was worth $90 on the international market, he said. -- President Evo Morales sought Wednesday to drum up support for his move over the weekend to end subsidies on the price of gasoline, a decision that resulted in the largest gas price increase in 30 years and led to protests in some cities.
