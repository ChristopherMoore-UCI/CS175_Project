In neighboring Uruzgan province, a battle between Taliban militants and troops Tuesday left more than 65 insurgents dead in a six-hour battle. Afghan and coalition troops have killed an estimated 104 insurgents in ongoing fighting since Tuesday morning near the Musa Qalah Wadi in Helmand province, the coalition said. A coalition service member was killed and four others were wounded in the fighting between troops and Taliban militants. "As with our forces near Musa Qalah, this operation is intended to deny the enemies of peace the use of Deh Rawod as a safe haven," said Army Maj. The Afghan-coalition patrol had been near the same spot, northeast of Deh Rawod, where more than three dozen insurgents preparing an ambush were killed last week.
