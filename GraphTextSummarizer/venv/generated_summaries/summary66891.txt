Reports in India's media said four Pakistani soldiers were killed, but Pakistan's military "strongly denied the report of any (casualties) on the Pakistani side." Pakistan's military also denied its forces crossed the Line of Control, saying the skirmish started when Indian soldiers tried to establish a forward post on Pakistan's side of the line. Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas told CNN that Pakistan "made our point clear" regarding the firefight, which he said began after Indian soldiers crossed the Line of Control that separates Kashmir between India and Pakistan. Kashmir has been at the root of two wars between India and Pakistan, both of which tested nuclear weapons in 1998. "On Pakistan's' objection, Indian troops opened indiscriminate and unprovoked fire," a Pakistan military news release, posted on Monday, stated. Neha Goyal, told CNN Pakistani troops crossed the Line of Control and "started firing on our patrol," killing an Indian soldier.
