Interior Minister Rehman Malik temporarily blocked cell phone services in cities, where gathered intelligence indicated the possibility of bombs detonated by cell phone. The spokesman for the Pakistani Taliban, Ihsanullah Ihsan, said the group would continue "its mission" and attack Shiite Ashura processions across Pakistan. Despite heightened security, at least 31 people were killed and 68 wounded in multiple bomb attacks Wednesday. A spokesman for the Pakistani Taliban said the group was behind Sunday's bombing on the procession and warned of more attacks. Taliban claim blasts killing dozens in Pakistan Shia Islam is a minority sect in the mainly Sunni Muslim country, and its members face persecution from extremists.
