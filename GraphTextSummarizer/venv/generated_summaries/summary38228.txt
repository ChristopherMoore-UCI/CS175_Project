A Japanese researcher said Friday that residents in eastern Japan, including Tokyo, can expect more such aftershocks in the coming months. "We should not be surprised to have magnitude-7 level aftershocks even a year afterward anywhere as wide as east Japan in the wake of such mega-quake of magnitude 9," said Satoko Oki of the Earthquake Research Institute of Tokyo University. ANA said it will make three "relief" flights daily to and from Tokyo's Haneda airport, while rival Japan Airlines said it will operate three flights a day into the airport from Tokyo and Osaka. Currently, the airlines believe that, at the earliest, they will be able to restore regular service by the end of May. The re-opening of the airfield will bring relief to the region, which is still without express train service.
