Chicago police continued to search Friday for a suspect in the brutal rape of 15-year-old girl who was walking to school near one of the city's Safe Passage routes for children. Meanwhile, as the crime put national attention again on Chicago's violence, police Superintendent Garry F. McCarthy made a surprise visit to a community meeting Thursday night, where residents expressed anger and outrage over the crime. This school year, city and school officials doubled the number of Safe Passage routes to accommodate more children being forced to walk greater distances because the school system closed a record 48 elementary schools amid a $1 billion budget shortfall. About 12,000 students are attending new schools this year because of the budget crisis, and many of them must walk through some of Chicago's most violent neighborhoods. Just this fall, local officials pledged that an expanded Safe Passages program -- with its big yellow signs above sidewalks patrolled during key times by paid, trained workers -- would be a sanctuary for children walking to and from school.
