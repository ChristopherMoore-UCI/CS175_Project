-- The mother and father of missing Oregon boy Kyron Horman repeatedly urged stepmother Terri Horman to co-operate with police during a news conference Thursday. The restraining order bars Terri Horman from having any contact with Kaine Horman or the couple's 20-month-old daughter. KGW reported that sources believe Terri Horman approached the landscaper, who had been working on the family's property in northwest Portland, and offered the man "a large sum of money" to kill Kaine Horman. " Court records released Thursday revealed that Kaine Horman, the boy's father, believes the stepmother is involved in Kyron's disappearance. Kyron went missing after Terri Horman dropped him off at school on June 4.
