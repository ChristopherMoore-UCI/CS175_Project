Attorneys for Diallo complain she is being treated by prosecutors like a criminal defendant and not an alleged victim. After Diallo took her case public, Strauss-Kahn's attorneys, William Taylor and Benjamin Brafman, put out a statement saying, "Ms. Diallo is the first accuser in history to conduct a media campaign to persuade a prosecutor to pursue charges ... against a person from whom she wants money." Attorney Douglas Wigdor, who is working on Diallo's behalf in Paris, said Monday that he was to meet with several people prior to a news conference scheduled for Tuesday. And in a rally after the district attorney's court filing Monday, some of her supporters urged prosecutors to still pursue the case and warned about the message sent by dropping charges. "If you go back to the hearing on May 16, when (an assistant district attorney) called the evidence against Strauss-Kahn 'substantial' and he said the medical exam (of Diallo) supports her account, this is not a 'he said, she said' case. A grand jury indicted the then-IMF chief in May over allegations he sexually assaulted housekeeper Diallo in his New York hotel suite.
