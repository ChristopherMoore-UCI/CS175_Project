The incident happened Friday when Premila Lal and her 12-year-old cousin decided to play a joke on Nerrek Galley, a close family friend, according to Lal's father. Galley and Pranil heard a noise and went to check it out, the brother told CNN affiliate KUSA on Sunday. Lal and her cousin snuck into the house just before 8 p.m. unbeknownst to Galley, who was playing video games with Premila's 15-year-old brother, Pranil. Pranil told KUSA that Galley "is devastated right now." Police said they do not suspect the involvement of alcohol or drugs. "All the witnesses had consistent statements," Commander Jeffrey Satur of the Longmont Police Department told CNN Sunday.
