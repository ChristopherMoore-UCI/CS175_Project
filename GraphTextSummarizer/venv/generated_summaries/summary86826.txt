Note: Reading this article does not give you the information you need to really eat fire, fire walk or even turn into a skid. Whether it's fire walking or knowing that the Earth is round, everyone seems to dig counterintuitive thinking. He tells us that even though the government had control over the banks and did nothing to stop the bad that's going on, if we give them more control over more other bank-like things, then they can make sure bad stuff doesn't happen ever again. Maybe the United States borrowing more money than I could imagine in a billion years with a billion computers and a billion monkeys typing on them, will get us out of financial trouble. It's certainly true that many counterintuitive things are true, and when you have the guts to do something counterintuitive that works, it's really cool.
