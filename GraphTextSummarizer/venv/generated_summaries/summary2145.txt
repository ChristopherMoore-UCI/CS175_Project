An analysis of charter schools in New York by economist Caroline Hoxby revealed that students are most likely to outperform peers, both in traditional district schools and at other charters,  if they attend schools that are open at least 10 days more than the conventional year. But during the summer, they lose those gains while their more advantaged peers -- whose parents can afford to arrange for summer enriching activities -- maintain theirs. But this idyllic picture masks the reality that for too many children, particularly those from low-income families, languid summers can be educationally detrimental, and for families in which both parents work, summers are a logistical nightmare. It's called summer slide. Students graduating middle school proficient in algebra and reading have opportunities open to them that are simply nonexistent for students at risk of  failure.
