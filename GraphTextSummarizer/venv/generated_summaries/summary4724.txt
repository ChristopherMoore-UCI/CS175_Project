A senior Indian military official told CNN on Monday that military radar near the Andaman and Nicobar Islands isn't as closely watched as are other radar systems. Analysts interviewed by CNN said that it would be extremely difficult to fly such a large aircraft so close to the ground over a long period of time, and that it's not even clear that doing so would keep the plane off radar scopes. That leaves open the possibility that Indian radar systems may not have picked up the airplane at the time of its last known Malaysian radar contact, near the tiny island of Palau Perak in the Strait of Malacca. "Anything like this is possible," radar expert Greg Charvat told CNN's "Piers Morgan Live." Jeffrey Beatty, a security consultant and former FBI special agent, says someone could have planned a route that avoided radar detection.
