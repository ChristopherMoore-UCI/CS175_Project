The British began speaking of defensive "foxholes," dug not by foxes but by soldiers on the battlefield, a word that now may seem as old as shooting wars themselves. Older terms and nicknames sometimes gained new popularity that guaranteed they'd remain in English long after soldiers returned home. World War I gave the English language new terms as varied as "blimp" and "Boches" and "devil dog" and even "D-Day." Many of them survive today -- there are "cooties," "camouflage," "scrounge" and "dud," for example -- but many have lost their once-widely recognized associations with the war that was hoped would "end war. Others remain as well-known as the war's idealistic slogans, like H. G. Wells' call for "a war to end wars" and Woodrow Wilson's to make the world "safe for democracy."
