" Quinn is the openly gay speaker of the New York City Council, and a proponent of legalizing same sex marriage in New York state. Five states now allow same-sex marriage: Maine, Connecticut, Iowa, Massachusetts and Vermont, and the states with active debates include California, New York, New Jersey and New Hampshire. In an interview in their apartment in the Chelsea neighborhood of New York, Quinn and Catullo agreed the ideal solution for them would be federal recognition of the right of same-sex couples to marry. And President Obama says he supports civil unions and other benefits for same-sex couples but opposes marriage. We're probably only one Supreme Court justice away from a nationally imposed right to same-sex marriage whether we like it or not.
