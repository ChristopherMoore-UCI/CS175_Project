-- The countdown to the release of a Michael Jackson posthumous album began Monday with the debut of a song Jackson recorded 15 years ago. "Jackson had a habit of over-recording for albums; often times this meant outstanding songs were left on the cutting room floor," the album liner notes said. The new album draws from tracks Jackson worked on from 1983 through 1999. Each song was "contemporized" to make it sound like a current production, but Jackson fans who want to hear the original recordings can purchase a deluxe edition. "Chicago," which is also known as "She Was Lovin' Me," was a track that didn't make the cut on Jackson's 2001 "Invincible" album, but a version updated by producer Timbaland will be on "Xscape," an album to be released next week on Sony's Epic label.
