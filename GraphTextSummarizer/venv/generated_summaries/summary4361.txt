The woman filed her complaint in Ibiza in August 2008, but a local judge shelved it in 2010, citing a lack of evidence that a crime had been committed, according to court documents. -- Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, one of the world's richest men, Thursday excoriated a young woman model whose accusation that he raped her was dismissed a day earlier by a Spanish court, the prince said in a statement. On Wednesday, a Spanish court in Palma de Mallorca found there wasn't sufficient evidence to press charges. Bin Talal said the conduct of the model, her lawyers and her mother were "particularly blameworthy." "The model and her mother have admitted that they only learned of HRH Prince Alwaleed by searching the Internet for 'Saudi Royal Family,' yet even then, as the Court pointed out, they did not identify HRH Prince Alwaleed as her alleged attacker, an outrageous defect which, the court agreed, 'infected the whole investigation'," the statement from the prince's office said. "After the model, her mother and her lawyers learned along with the rest of the world that HRH Prince Alwaleed had been in France at the time of the alleged events, they deliberately initiated a relentless public attack on HRH Prince Alwaleed through a public relations campaign involving multiple interviews, calls to reporters, and television appearances, all in an attempt to harm HRH Prince Alwaleed through the media," the prince said.
