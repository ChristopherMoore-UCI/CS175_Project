Affleck, Maher in heated debate about Islam Maher said he was most attracted to Paul because of the senator's general views on foreign policy, though he's not a fan of his recent support for bombing ISIS. Sen. Rand Paul has spent quite a bit of time reaching out to liberals over the past year, and that list apparently now includes Bill Maher. If the 2016 presidential race came down to Paul and Hillary Clinton, Maher said he might consider backing Paul. Paul, a libertarian-leaning Republican from Kentucky, and Maher, a comedian who shares some of Paul's libertarian views, had drinks two weeks ago, Maher told the liberal news outlet Salon. Maher said that Paul's answer on the environment was "wholly unsatisfactory" and that the senator would lose his vote based entirely on that issue unless Paul comes up with a better answer.
