-- Suspected arson at the future site of a mosque in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, has "really raised the fear factor" among area Muslims, a representative of the mosque told CNN on Monday. " A candlelight vigil, organized by Middle Tennesseans for Religious Freedom in response to the alleged arson, was held Monday night in front of the Rutherford County Courthouse. "We simply cannot allow the actions of a few destructive individuals to go overlooked by Rutherford County residents. The Saturday morning blaze destroyed an earth mover and damaged three other vehicles at the future site of the Islamic Center of Murfreesboro, said Camie Ayash, a spokeswoman for the center. Last month, Tennessee Lt. Gov. Ron Ramsey publicly criticized the project.
