Tahiti were handed a harsh introduction to the Confederations Cup as African champions Nigeria inflicted a 6-1 defeat on the minnows Monday. Tehau's goal was undoubtedly the highlight but the 138th ranked team in the world will have their work cut out with further Group B fixtures against world champions Spain and Copa America winners Uruguay. It was no more than Tahiti deserved for a spirited display and they celebrated in trademark style by forming a circle and pretending to use canoe paddles. Tahiti immediately took the game to them, but Nigeria went ahead after just five minutes due to a huge slice of fortune as Echiejile's shot took a big deflection off Nicolas Vallar before finding its way into the net. Congratulations to them." Brazil, Mexico, Japan and Italy make up Group A of a tournament which is contested every four years by the winners of FIFA's six confederations, plus the hosts and the reigning World Cup champions.
