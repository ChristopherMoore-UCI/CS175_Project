The court rejected a prosecution motion that Francesco Schettino be sent back to jail as well as a defense motion that he be set free, according to lawyer Alessandro Antichi. The Italian captain of the shipwrecked cruise liner Costa Concordia must remain under house arrest while investigators look into possible charges against him, a court in Florence, Italy, ruled Tuesday, a defense lawyer said. The captain faces possible charges of manslaughter, shipwreck and abandoning ship in connection with the January 13 incident. Schettino has said managers of the cruise line instructed him to sail close to the island and has denied allegations that he was sailing too fast. Attorneys will likely wait until February 9, when the full text of the court's decision is published, to decide whether to appeal, Antichi said.
