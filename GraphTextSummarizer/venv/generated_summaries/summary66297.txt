"This is wild stuff," said Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Bill Mason. He is up for parole next year but with Tuesday's additional indictments could now face the death penalty, according to Mason. The unit matched two cases to felon Joseph Harwell, who is currently serving time on a separate murder charge, Mason said. "He was kind of a little stunned by it, to say the least," Mason said on Harwell's reaction to his DNA linkage to the two victims. Believing there could be more victims related to the ones found in the Sowell home, "we kind of drew a circle around his residence," Mason said.
