This is odd -- one would think geosocial services and mobile maps and navigation would go hand in hand. For the most part, who's most likely to use mobile geosocial services is almost the inverse of who's most likely to use mobile maps and navigation. About one-third of American smartphone owners whose education went no further than high school don't use location info or services on their phones. The fact that your phone always knows where you are enables not just mobile maps and navigation, but also "geosocial" place check-in services such as Foursquare, Facebook Places and Google Latitude. Pew's numbers on exactly who's using mobile geosocial services are intriguing.
