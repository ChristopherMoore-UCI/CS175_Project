Fars added that in November, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had "warned enemies about Iran's tough response to any aggression or even threat. Gen. Mohammad Hejazi, a deputy head of Iran's armed forces, said his country "will no more wait to see enemy action against us," according to the semi-official Fars News Agency. " "Iran is not a nation to sit still and just observe threats from fragile materialist powers which are being eaten by worms from inside," Khamenei told students at a military college in Tehran, according to Fars. Iran insists its program is for civilian purposes, but numerous countries are concerned Tehran is working to build a nuclear weapons arsenal. Israel has made clear it is considering an attack on Iran's nuclear program.
