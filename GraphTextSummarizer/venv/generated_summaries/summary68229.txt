City players now enjoy average annual salaries of $7.4 million, or around $142,389 per week. That's a whopping $166,934 per week and a 6% rise on last year. Despite the NBA claiming just two teams in the top-24, basketball is still the best-paid league in the world with players earning average annual salaries of $4.29 million. European soccer teams dominated the list, claiming seven of the top 10 spots. The report's authors say the plummet is partly due to wages being restricted in the U.S. since 2010, while in Europe the amounts spent on top players continues to rise.
