Said Victoria Montenegro: "It is a miracle that the EEAF, with a drop of my blood, has succeeded in identifying the remains of my father that were in Uruguay since May '76." Luis Fondevrider, president of EAAF, said that identifying the remains of Montenegro was a process that started 10 years ago in Colonia, Uruguay, across the Rio de La Plata from Buenos Aires. Roque Orlando Montenegro, who disappeared at age 20 in 1976 when Victoria was just a few days old, was an apparent victim of the war's barbaric "death flights," a series of military airplane rides in which political prisoners were thrown alive into the sea, forensic investigators said. -- Victoria Montenegro of Argentina considered the military couple who raised her as generous, humanitarian people, taking her into their home as if their own baby because her real parents were killed in a shootout in Buenos Aires in 1976. The Argentinian Forensic Anthropology Team (EAAF by its Spanish acronym) announced this week that forensic and DNA tests prove that human remains found in a Uruguayan cemetery are those of Roque Orlando Montenegro, known as "Toti." The group investigating the war's legacy, Abuelas de Plaza de Mayo (May Square Grandmothers), which determined her father's fate through DNA testing, is now continuing to help Montenegro about the mystery of her mother -- as well as thousands of others who were taken away from their politically persecuted parents as children.
