"Air travel has become incredibly accessible, and as a result, millions of travelers navigate the challenges of the airport, especially during the upcoming holiday season," said Amy Winter, general manager of TLC, in a statement. TLC promises "unprecedented access" that will reveal what it takes for Southwest to transport passengers in the era of packed planes, unruly passengers and countless air travel frustrations. TLC has ordered a new reality series that will take viewers behind the scenes at Southwest Airlines. Production begins this weekend at Baltimore Washington International Airport and Denver International Airport, just in time for the holiday travel rush. The series of 13 half-hour episodes will also profile some of the airline's customers "as they prepare to travel for milestone moments," TLC says.
