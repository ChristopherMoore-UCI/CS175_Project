Spain midfielder Andres Iniesta is fit for Spain's opening World Cup match against Switzerland on June 16 after overcoming a thigh injury. Meanwhile, Dutch winger Arjen Robben is still eight days away from full fitness, according to Netherlands coach Bert van Marwijk. The Azzurri had to come back from a goal behind against Paraguay and will need to improve dramatically if they are to win the tournament and match Brazil's record haul of five World Cups. Robben was back in training on Tuesday following the hamstring injury which ruled him out of their 2-0 victory over Denmark, but is likely to miss the June 19 clash with Japan. And England duo Ashley Cole and Wayne Rooney returned to full training on Tuesday having rested on Monday to recover from the 1-1 draw with the United States.
