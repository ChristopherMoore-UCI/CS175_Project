Lida Xing, a member of the research team from the University of Alberta who made the discovery, told CNN it was named Qijianglong, the "dragon of Qijiang" because farmers thought the bones resembled the shape of Chinese mythical dragons. If you imagine a big animal that is half neck, you can see that evolution can do quite extraordinary things," Tetsuto Miyashita, a PhD student at the University of Alberta, said in a press release. "Nowhere else we can find dinosaurs with longer necks than those in China. "Qijianglong shows that long-necked dinosaurs diversified in unique ways in Asia during Jurassic times -- something very special was going on in that continent," said Miyashita. So the locals began to say the long body looked just like a dragon from ancient Chinese stories," said Xing.
