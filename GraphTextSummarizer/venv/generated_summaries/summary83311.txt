Just a year or so ago, girls behaving ''badly'' — really raunchy, really messed up on drugs, really promiscuous and narcissistic — seemed to be a revolutionary flavor in movie comedy. Whatever their virtues or flaws, each of these movies makes the dirtiest episode of "Sex and the City" look like Doris Day fluff. As for Regan, she doesn't need drugs — she gets high on hating others, and on hating herself, too. Each of the trio has a guy she's passively pursuing (they're played by James Marsden, Kyle Bornheimer, and the always droll Adam Scott), and the encounters with them are funny in a merciless, this-is-a-woman's-brain-on-drugs sort of way.
