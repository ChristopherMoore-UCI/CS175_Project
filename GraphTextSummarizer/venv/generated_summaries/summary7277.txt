" More than just a comedian, Churchill is today focused on growing the next generation of comic talent in Kenya and beyond. "There is nothing as exciting as being a pioneer for a big dream, not only for one country, but the whole continent and creating history and influencers -- it's the most amazing thing," says Churchill. "With the talent that you see coming up on the stage every day, in the next five years you might be sure, it's a matter of time before you see a Chris Rock or a Steve Harvey coming from the academy and that would be the dream," he muses. And to Churchill's credit, he did and today, thanks to his hard work and determination, he is at the helm of two of Kenya's biggest comedy shows: Churchill Live and Churchill Raw. Daniel Ndambuki might today be one of Kenya's top comedians, having the crowd in stitches every time he performs, but things were quite different when he first took to the stage.
