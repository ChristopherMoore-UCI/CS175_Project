The ministry operated in a secluded area of Pine County from about 2000 until 2011 or 2012, Chief Deputy Steven Blackwell of the county sheriff's office told CNN last year. Barnard had moved to Washington state after an admission to affairs with married women caused the religious group to split, the complaint says. The complaint filed in Minnesota says Tornambe alleges she was sexually abused by Barnard from the ages of 13 to 22 while she and her parents were members of River Road Fellowship. The last U.S. sighting of Barnard was last year in Raymond, Washington. Barnard set up a so-called "shepherd's camp" in the mid-1990s in Pine County.
