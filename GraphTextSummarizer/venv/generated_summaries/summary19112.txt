Al Fayed was a friend of the Jackson and the late singing superstar accepted an invitation to watch Fulham take on Wigan at Craven Cottage in English football's third tier in 1999. " Al Fayed ended 16 years at the helm of the London club last summer when he sold the club to Khan, owner of American football team the Jacksonville Jaguars. After a period of stability under Al Fayed, the club's form plummeted and it dropped down to the Championship after 13 years in the top flight of English football. After buying the club from Al Fayed in July 2013, American billionaire Shahid Khan had the two-and-a-half meter tribute dismantled. When it came to relegation from the English Premier League Fulham could not quite "Beat It" -- but things could have been very different if the London club had kept its lucky statue of Michael Jackson.
