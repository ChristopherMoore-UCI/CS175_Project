Spain authorized the sale of $2.6 million euros ($3.5 million) in riot-control equipment to Venezuela last year, the Economy ministry reported. The other official said it's not the first time Spain has suspended the sale of riot control gear to Venezuela. Spain has suspended the sale of police riot-control equipment to Venezuela due to instability there, two Spanish government officials said Friday. Amnesty International's president in Spain, Esteban Beltran, told reporters this week, "In our opinion, if human rights are not placed at the top of the political agenda in Venezuela, then Venezuela risks entering a spiral of violence that would lead to even more human rights abuses and violations." Spain's inter-ministerial government commission routinely reviews sales of military weapons and other sensitive material like police riot-control equipment, and takes into consideration "the internal stability of the nation destined" to receive the equipment, said one of the government officials.
