5 ways community colleges are fixing higher education If enacted, the President's proposal would be unlikely to achieve its ultimate aims and would exacerbate a larger problem lurking behind college financing.

Rather than supporting innovative options like Patten and Southern New Hampshire, the President's plan would nudge students toward a community college sector that is incapable of repositioning its model around student success and fuel rising college costs. In his State of the Union address, President Obama proposed making community college tuition free for two years to boost college graduation rates and lift more people into the middle class.
