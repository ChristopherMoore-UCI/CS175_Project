Wildfire photographer Kari Greer goes inside the inferno Maketa said Monday that no structures were lost in the fire Sunday. Investigators are treating the 16,000-acre Black Forest Fire, which was 75% contained Monday, as a crime scene, though they don't yet know whether a crime was committed, El Paso County Sheriff Terry Maketa said. The weather cooperates Maketa's comments came after fire teams made significant progress against the flames northeast of Colorado Springs over the weekend, with containment growing from 5% to 75% in just a few days' time. "When you're talking about a potential for prosecution -- we don't know yet whether it's a crime or not -- we're going to treat it as (if) it is, and preserve every element of that scene as we can," Maketa told reporters Monday. Temperatures in the 90s, little rain and blustery winds fueled the Black Forest Fire in its early days.
