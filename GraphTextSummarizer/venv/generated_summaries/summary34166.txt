In a statement Tuesday, Ferguson leaders vowed to rebuild the city's business district, parts of which have been ravaged by looting and unrest. That's the same day that U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder is expected to visit Ferguson to check in on the Justice Department's civil rights investigation into Brown's death. "So, we can stay energized and keep walking because they're saying if we stand still we're going to get locked up." White, who once lived in Ferguson, also poured out several bottles of water and filled them with milk, to help wash tear gas out of people's eyes. Brown, meanwhile, will be eulogized by civil rights leader Al Sharpton at a public funeral Monday morning. Demands for prosecution Many civic leaders worry the unrest is taking away from the main message of the protests: accountability for the officer who shot the 18-year-old Brown.
