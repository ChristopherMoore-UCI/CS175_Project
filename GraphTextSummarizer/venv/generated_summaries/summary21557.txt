There appears to be no precedent for a dead heat at U.S. Olympic Team track and field trials, prompting the U.S. Olympic Committee to announce new rules Sunday. -- With three places up for grabs on the U.S. Olympic track team, two women tied for third place in the women's 100 meters over the weekend -- crossing the line at exactly the same time -- which means the coveted Olympic spot could be decided by a coin toss. Two women beat Felix and Tarmoh: Carmelita Jeter and Tianna Madison. Sprinters Allyson Felix and Jeneba Tarmoh threw their bodies across the finish line so evenly matched that cameras recording 3,000 frames a second couldn't tell who beat whom. And if both athletes refuse to declare a preference, officials will flip a coin -- a U.S. quarter to be exact.
