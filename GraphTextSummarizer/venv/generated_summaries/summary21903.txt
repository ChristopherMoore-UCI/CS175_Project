And in May, league CEO Mark Miles said executives would look at new safety initiatives, including the possibility of new types of fences, more safety precautions near where drivers stop for service and repairs, and driver safety enhancements. NASCAR took similar safety precautions after February's wreck at Daytona International Speedway by adding extra cables on crossover gates and tethering frames of gates to posts. Last year, a league consultant said the league was committed to investigating ways to better design barriers to prevent crash debris from reaching fans, according to IndyCar.com. The incident comes eight months after a February accident during a NASCAR race at Daytona International Speedway that spewed debris into the stands, injuring 28 fans. The issue of fan safety has long been on IndyCar's agenda.
