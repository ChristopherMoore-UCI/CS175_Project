The Premier League were quick to trumpet the benefits of having their stellar names on social media sites, like Twitter and Facebook, as it allows for interaction with numerous fans, but stressed it must be used responsibly. "Social media is doing a good job of allowing fans to feel closer to the players," Premier League chairman Richard Scudamore was quoted as saying on their official website. Only this week Chelsea and England defender Ashley Cole caused a storm when he joined Twitter and responded to the barbs from fans of his former club Arsenal by mocking them as to how many trophies he had won since leaving. More and more fans are not only watching the matches they attend, but filming them on mobile phones and uploading them to Twitter, Facebook or YouTube. With a wealth of action taking place during the Games fans from across the globe can interact with each other via various platforms.
