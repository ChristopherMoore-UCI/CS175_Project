-- [Updated 3:45 p.m. Monday, October 29] An aluminum sculpture called "Greetingman" bows to people Wednesday in Montevideo, Uruguay. Yoo raised money for the Uruguay sculpture by selling 800 much smaller "Greetingman" statues for $200 each, according to the Uruguayan newspaper El Pais. Uruguay was chosen by Yoo because it is diametrically opposite of South Korea on the world map. "The greeting is the first step in any relationship," Yoo said Wednesday in Montevideo. Yoo's goal is to put up 1,000 of them across the globe as a way to link other cultures and people.
