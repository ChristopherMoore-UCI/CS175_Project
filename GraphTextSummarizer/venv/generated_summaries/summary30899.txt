" Revelations of Rekers' trip to Europe with a male escort surfaced last week, shortly after he returned to the U.S. The male escort who traveled with Rekers -- who goes by the name Lucien, though that is not his given name -- said that he advertises his service exclusively on the website rentboy.com, where visitors can choose from hundreds of male escorts in suggestive and revealing poses. The site said Rekers "found his recent travel assistant by interviewing different people who might be able to help, and did not even find out about his travel assistant's internet advertisements offering prostitution activity until after the trip was in progress. Lucien says Rekers first contacted him through the site. He was hired to give Rekers daily "sexual massages" on the trip, which took them to London and Madrid, Lucien says. "He got excited," Lucien said of the massages, adding that Rekers wanted Lucien to touch him, though Lucien said that he didn't have sex with Rekers and that Rekers didn't ask to have sex.
