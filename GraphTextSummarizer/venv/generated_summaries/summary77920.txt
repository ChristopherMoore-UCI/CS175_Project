After killing the animal, skinning it and burying parts of it in the yard, "he said that he ... found (a) recipe for dogs online" and found states where eating dogs is allowed, the complaint says. New Mexico is one such place; in fact, there are no laws against eating cats or dogs in most states. Salvador Martinez was released Wednesday on bond tied to the felony charge of extreme cruelty to animals, Torrance County Sheriff Heath White said. According to a criminal complaint filed in a Torrance County, New Mexico, court, the dog was stabbed in the heart and skinned. She was a family dog, one that Mandy Malone kept in part to play with her grandchildren.
