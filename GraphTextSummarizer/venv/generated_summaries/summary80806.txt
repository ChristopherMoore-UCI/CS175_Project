In Hungarian Cubes, Roters documents those countryside row houses during Kádár's reign, after residents started freewheeling with colors and shapes to make it so no two houses looked like. Roters noticed the painted "Magyar Kocka", or Hungarian Cube, houses in 2003 after moving from Germany to a small Hungarian town. The result—those decorated houses—are the subject of Hungarian Cubes, by Katharina Roters. Unlike the leaders of the other Eastern Bloc countries, Kádár practiced a sort of relaxed strain of communism: the Hungarian People's Republic had a free market, and was tolerant (more than Stalin, at least) of individual voices and public dissent. It's fitting, then, that during the Goulash Communism era, a peculiar architectural trend took off: People started painting the facades of their houses with abstract shapes, in wild shades of color.
