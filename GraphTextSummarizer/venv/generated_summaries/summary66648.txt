--  Police found three men dead in a car parked outside a spa Monday morning -- the latest in a string of suicides involving detergent, officials said. In early May, police evacuated about 350 people from their homes on the island of Hokkaido after a neighbor mixed detergent and chemicals to kill himself. According to local media reports, more than 60 people have committed suicide across Japan in the last month by mixing detergent and other chemicals, and inhaling the hydrogen sulfide gas that results. In western Japan, police found a 21-year-old man with a plastic bag over his head Monday. In some cases, officials had to order residents to leave because the resulting gas from the detergent mix can sicken people.
