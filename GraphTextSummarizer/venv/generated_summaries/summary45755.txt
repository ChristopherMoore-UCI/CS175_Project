"Raccoon Creek in Pike County is probably the hardest hit," Emergency Management Director Doug Tackett said. There was no specific number of missing people, Maynard said, but searches in the Raccoon Creek area continued. -- Waters were receding Sunday as rescue crews conducted searches in the aftermath of flash flooding in eastern Kentucky that killed at least two people, a top county official said. About 5,000 people were affected, and there were a number of high water rescues and several evacuations, Tackett said. "I know there were some people taken from cars in swift water, and a few folks were taken from roofs of their homes or from windows to be removed from their homes," Tackett said.
