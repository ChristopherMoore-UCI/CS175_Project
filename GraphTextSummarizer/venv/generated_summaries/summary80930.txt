Outgoing Arkansas Gov. Mike Beebe is leaving office with a personal problem that has gone national: His decision to pardon his own son. The issue, Beebe made clear during an interview in his Little Rock office on Friday, is more than just a political one for him. "On a personal note, I am embarrassed," Beebe said at his Little Rock office on Friday. If I wasn't governor, he wouldn't be under a bigger microscope." Beebe, though, will be leaving that microscopic scrutiny in months. "This one is being scrutinized for obvious reasons," Beebe said.
