A new company in Germany is trying to break into the fashion business selling stylish clothes designed and produced by prison inmates. Some of the clothes are manufactured at a corrections facility in Halle, near Leipzig, in Eastern Germany. Many of the clothes, cooking aprons and even stainless steel food trays offered in the Berlin store were either designed or manufactured in jails, but not just German ones. The company Haeftling, which in English means inmate, has just opened its first store in Berlin. "It's wonderful, at least it takes your mind off jail for a little while," says Mario Hildebrand, who is serving a 20 month term in Halle.
