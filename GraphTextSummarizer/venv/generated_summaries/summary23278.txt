McCormack said the United States and North Korea had reached agreement "on an number of important verification measures" of North Korea's nuclear program. "Based upon the cooperation agreement North Korea has recently provided ... the secretary of state this morning rescinded the designation of the DPRK [Democratic People's Republic of Korea] as a state sponsor of terrorism, and that was effective as of her signature," McCormack said. " Participants in the Six-Party Talks, besides the United States and North Korea, are South Korea, China, Japan and Russia. North Korea was added to the list of state sponsors of terrorism in 1988, the fourth country to be added. "President Bush's decision to remove North Korea from the list of state sponsors of terrorism is an appropriate response, as long as there is a clear understanding that if North Korea fails to follow through there will be immediate consequences," Obama said.
