-- A United Arab Emirates sheikh was acquitted Sunday of charges connected to the videotaped beating and torture of an Afghan grain dealer. Nabulsi said he was arrested, jailed and ultimately convicted on drug charges -- and was tortured and humiliated by UAE police, who demanded he return the tape. Nabulsi, a Lebanese-born U.S. citizen now living in Houston, said he met Issa when the sheikh came to Houston for medical treatment in 1994. UAE officials have said the grain dealer survived and has settled the matter privately with the sheikh, with the two agreeing not to bring formal charges against the other. Al-Mulla said he is "pleased with the verdict as it was proven that Sheikh Issa was a victim, and he was not what the media tried to portray him
