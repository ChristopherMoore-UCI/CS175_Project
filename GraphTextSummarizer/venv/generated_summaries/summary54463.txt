The National Weather Service predicts between 1 to 2 feet of  snow to fall in northeastern Massachusetts through Monday night. Flurries and light snow are expected to fall in Boston on Saturday evening, turning into heavy snow Sunday night through Monday. Winter storm warnings have been issued across upstate New York, northern Connecticut, northern Rhode Island and the greater Boston area. "I'm tired of it," said Boston University freshman Cameron Barkan, who's already missed three days of class because of the storms. Two brutal storms hit the Northeast just last week, closing airports, canceling classes and creating piles of snow along cleared roadways.
