Report: Russian signal Swedish intelligence had picked up a radio distress call last week -- in Russian -- which set off the defensive reconnaissance, major daily newspaper Svenska Dagbladet reported. Moscow said it had no vessel in Swedish waters and suggested Sweden ask the Netherlands if it was one of theirs stationed nearby. Moscow has practiced mock attacks of Stockholm and has flown very close to Swedish planes and ships, he said. The news of the military's search had Schmidt's business phone ringing, mostly with annoying calls. According to a report, the Dutch said they did not had a sub in Swedish waters.
