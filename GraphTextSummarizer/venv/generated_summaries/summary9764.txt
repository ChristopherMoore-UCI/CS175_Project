Interest in Apple's iconic former leader also boosted online sales of a handful of other Jobs-related books, including "I, Steve: Steve Jobs in His Own Words," by George Beahm, and "Inside Steve's Brain," by Leander Kahney. In its blurb for the book, Simon & Schuster promises "a riveting story of the roller-coaster life and searingly intense personality of a creative entrepreneur whose passion for perfection and ferocious drive revolutionized six industries: personal computers, animated movies, music, phones, tablet computing, and digital publishing." The book by Walter Isaacson, titled simply, "Steve Jobs," rocketed from 437 to No. 1 on Amazon's bestseller list -- a spike of 43,000% -- in the hours after Jobs' death, thanks to pre-orders. Responding to a rush of interest following Wednesday's death of the Apple co-founder, Simon & Schuster announced it's moving up the publication date of its Steve Jobs biography from November 21 to October 24. -- Apple fans won't have to wait as long to read the authorized story of Steve Jobs' life.
