United States next take on Canada in Group A Tuesday, with Eugenie Bouchard and Vasek Pospisil looking to recover from their 2-1 loss to Czech Republic Sunday. Williams and Isner then joined forces in the mixed doubles to complete the whitewash by defeating Pennetta and Fognini 6-2 2-6 11-9. Williams, who was representing her nation in Perth alongside John Isner, began proceedings with a victory over Flavia Pennetta. The hot drink seemed to do the trick, as Williams went on to dominate Pennetta, dropping just three more games and going on to win 0-6 6-3 6-0. After Williams had set U.S. on their way, Isner secured the win over Italy by defeating Fabio Fognini 7-5 5-7 7-6 (7-4).
