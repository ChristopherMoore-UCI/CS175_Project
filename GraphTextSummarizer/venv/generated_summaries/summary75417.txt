In the past few years, we have seen marijuana from an array of perspectives on the government's side of the war on drugs. Since 1968, the National Institute on Drug Abuse has contracted with the university lab to grow, harvest and process marijuana and to ship it to licensed facilities across the country for research purposes. The lab also collects samples of marijuana seized by police to determine its potency and to document national drug trends. In January, a DEA administrator turned down an application by a Massachusetts man to open a second facility to grow marijuana for research purposes. And last year, far from either border, we accompanied drug czar John Walters on a trip to a national forest where a drug cartel had a 10,000-plant garden.
