-- Singapore was shrouded in haze on Wednesday as smoke from forest fires in nearby Sumatra drifted across the Malacca Strait in the city's worst pollution crisis in more than a decade. Critics have accused Singapore and Malaysian palm oil companies of investing in Indonesian companies that are clearing land for palm plantations. Authorities in Singapore are anxious to avoid a repeat of the 1997 Southeast Asian haze which the government estimates cost $9 billion in health care costs and disrupted air travel and business. The agency said that thick haze would continue for the next few days as forest fires were still raging in Sumatra. He said for three days the city has been under a pall of wood smoke that gave Singapore's normally highly urban central business district the smell of a campfire.
