The sons of former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak were released from prison Monday after serving 18 months, according to the state-run MENA news agency. In another case, he was convicted in 2012 of issuing orders to kill peaceful protesters during the country's 2011 uprising and was sentenced to life in prison. He appealed and was granted a new trial last year. Mubarak was sentenced last year to three years in prison; his sons to four years each. In November, he was cleared of those charges and of corruption.
