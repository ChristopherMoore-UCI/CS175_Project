"Our President and government are saying to society everyday that they do not believe in women and men's equality; woman is [seen as] God's gift to man, the man protects the woman. " With 69% of men in paid work in Turkey compared to 29% of women, more women in the workplace is a good place to start establishing gender equality, says Finkel. If you get more women into employment, you have to change social rules which objectify and discriminate against women." President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who condemned Aslan's murder on Twitter, was criticized for claiming at an event last year that men and women are not equal. And in 2011, Turkey was among 14 countries to ratify a European Treaty aiming to combat violence against women.
