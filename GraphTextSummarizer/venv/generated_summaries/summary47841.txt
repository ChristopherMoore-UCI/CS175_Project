Richard Coutts, director of Baca Architects said in a statement: "From the outset, we sought the expert advice of the (UK) Environment Agency to determine the most appropriate construction model to mitigate flood risk on the site and provide a safe dwelling, sympathetic to its setting and fit for the challenges of the 21st century. Sea level rise: Impacts and mitigation measures A terraced garden will also surround the property encouraging incremental flooding while also helping manage run-off when water levels start to subside. The "amphibious house" was recently granted planning permission for construction on a island on the River Thames in Marlow -- a small town 35 miles west of London. The upper part of the house is constructed from lightweight timber, according to its creators Baca Architects, while a concrete basement level sits inside a "wet dock" consisting of a base slab and four retaining walls. "Amphibious design is one of a host of solutions that can enable residents to live safely and to adapt to the challenges of climate change," he added.
