Starr is about to begin the countdown to shout "peace and love" at noon when out of nowhere a loud, monotonous tone begins to blare. As he always does on his birthday, he celebrates a moment of peace and love at the stroke of noon, and encouraged everyone else to do the same. "Wherever you are -- on a bus, in the office, in the studio, hanging out ... whatever you're doing, at noon, just go, 'Peace and love.' Fellow members of his ever-rotating All-Starr band are there in full force: Toto's Steve Lukather with his signature goatee; music producer extraordinaire Todd Rundgren and his instantly recognizable white-and-black mane; a young-looking Richard Page from Mr. Mister; Santana's Gregg Rolie sporting aviators. Peace and love.
