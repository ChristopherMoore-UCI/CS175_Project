Military officials haven't provided much explanation about the reasons for the summonses, saying only that it's necessary "to ensure smooth operation of restoration of peace and order." The yellow shirts' former camp by the Democracy Monument is now a mountain of rubbish and abandoned tents awaiting removal by the army of municipal workers with their trucks and cranes. -- The morning after Thailand's military came clean and admitted their operation to restore order was in fact a coup, the capital appeared normal with shops open and commuters heading for work -- though schools were shuttered. Meanwhile, protest sites belonging to both "red shirt" supporters of ousted former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, and the "yellow shirt" protesters associated with Bangkok's urban elite and middle class have emptied -- the detritus from their long struggle all that's left. But after months of protests -- and periodic outbreaks of violence -- many ordinary Thais seem content to let this play out for the time being, with many of the opinion that anything that avoids further chaos and might help to resolve the political conflict is a good thing.
