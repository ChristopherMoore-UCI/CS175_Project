GoPro has some competition from companies like Sony and will probably see more similar products on shelves as bigger camera companies try to duplicate its success. The dizzying variety of places GoPro cameras have gone shows how the product has grown from a niche tool for surfers into to the rugged video camera of choice for recording physical, outdoor, dangerous or first-person footage. Working with existing camera companies to license their hardware for a wrist strap turned out to be difficult, so Woodman went to China and commissioned a cheap camera in a waterproof case. GoPro has found a unique place in the camera market by focusing intensely on its main product: a tiny wearable waterproof and shockproof HD camera that can be mounted almost anywhere. With the camera market split into two main categories -- high-end digital SLRs and camera phones -- GoPro is carving out a third category: high-definition action.
