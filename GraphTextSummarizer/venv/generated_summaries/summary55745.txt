That kind of tape keeps the injured joint from bending to prevent further injury. The highs and lows of the 2012 Olympic 'crying games' Ullucci says he keeps the tape as a tool to help improve balance in athletes, and says it helps prevent excessive protraction injuries -- in layman's terms, shoulder problems from activities including playing tennis. Because the tape is thin and pliable, it's different from athletic tape used on ankles or wrists, he says. It's called kinesio tape. It also has been spotted at the usually staid Wimbledon and on athletes including soccer's David Beckham and cycling's Lance Armstrong.
