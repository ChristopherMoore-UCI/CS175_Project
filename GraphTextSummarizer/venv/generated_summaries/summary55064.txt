The FAA has greatly restricted the commercial use of drones over U.S. land and water as it seeks to safely integrate them into national airspace. Meanwhile, seven aerial photo and video production companies have asked for regulatory exemptions that would allow the film and television industries to use unmanned aircraft systems with FAA approval for the first time. The drone's manufacturer, AeroVironment, conducted its first flight for BP on Sunday, the FAA said, but the flight of the 4Â½-foot-long aircraft wasn't disclosed by the FAA until Tuesday morning. A drone that just started flying for energy giant BP in Alaska is the first commercial drone operation authorized over land by the Federal Aviation Administration, the agency announced Tuesday. The FAA said Tuesday it approved BP's plan for an unmanned aircraft system to survey roads, pipelines and other equipment at Prudhoe Bay, Alaska, the largest oilfield in the United States.
