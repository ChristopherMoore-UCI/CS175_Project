In March, a divided Supreme Court heard arguments over the legality of two marriage laws -- the federal Defense of Marriage Act, which defines marriage as between one man and one woman, and California's Proposition 8, which bans same-sex marriage. Among them is France, where lawmakers passed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage and adoption last month despite vocal protests from conservatives. Gov. Mark Dayton has said he would sign it into law, according to local news website MinnPost. Five days later, it was the turn of Delaware, which became the 11th state to sign same-sex marriage into law. -- Minnesota's House of Representatives passed a bill that would legalize same-sex marriage, putting the Midwestern state in line to become the 12th nationwide to take that step.
