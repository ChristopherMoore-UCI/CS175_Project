Probably the Village Voice furiously typing this tweet after Ryan made a reference to the generation gap between him and Romney based on their music preferences: @villagevoice Paul Ryan fails to realize that classic rock is pretty much the new elevator music http://bit.ly/NExCe8 Comedian @robfee quipped, " 'Haha Paul Ryan has dumb music on his iPod!' But before Paul Ryan even opened his mouth Wednesday night, Twitter was already reflecting on Paul Ryan's sex appeal. @Lynzeebug22 Paul Ryan is kinda hot... "I don't care what their beliefs are I will always feel completely awful for any woman who has lipstick on their teeth in public," wrote Twitter user @Morgan Murphy. The distraction theme continued as Paul Ryan and his widow's peak took the stage.
