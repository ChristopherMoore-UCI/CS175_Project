According to a Los Angeles Times report, that's the travel nightmare story Sandy Valdivieso and her husband, Triet Vo, will get to tell for the rest of their lives. "When the flight attendant said we were heading to Dhaka, we believed that this was how you pronounced 'Dakar' with a Turkish accent," Valdivieso told the Times. The couple boarded a flight in Los Angeles booked by Turkish Airways, intending to travel to Dakar, Senegal, in western Africa. "That's when we knew a serious mistake had been made," Valdivieso told the Times. After landing in Dhaka, the airline flew the couple to Dakar via Istanbul, about a six-hour trip.
