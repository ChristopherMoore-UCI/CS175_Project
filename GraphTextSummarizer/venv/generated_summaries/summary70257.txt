"If we made a different decision," Reed said, "every single dollar for everything else would have gone to fund and modernize the stadium." Critics have pointed out that, in recent months, city money has been allocated for another stadium in downtown Atlanta: $200 million for a new home for the NFL's Atlanta Falcons. Reed said he learned about the baseball club's new thinking, including a reported offer of $450 million of public financing from Cobb County, the next day. "We wanted the Braves to stay in Atlanta, but (there was a) business problem that we had to solve," Reed said Tuesday. As to what will then happen with the Braves' current home, Reed says it will be demolished to make way for "one of the largest developments for middle-class people that the city of Atlanta has ever had." Still, the Braves did ask for extensive public investments in the publicly owned stadium and the surrounding area, money that Reed said he didn't feel the city could give now, given other needs and the desire to keep spending and debt in check.
