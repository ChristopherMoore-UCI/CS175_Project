My father, Fritz Pleitgen, was the bureau chief for ARD West German television in East Berlin, and with that title he became one of the people the intelligence service -- the Staatssicherheit or "Stasi" -- hated and spied on the most. But this used to be one of the main streets of Communist East Berlin, where the East German regime showcased its arsenal during military parades. Being a West German family living in East Berlin, we were allowed to pass through the Berlin Wall to West Berlin anytime. "That was their nightmare -- that there could be an alliance of West German correspondents with the people of East Germany." And they also did everything they could to stop East Germans from talking to West German reporters.
