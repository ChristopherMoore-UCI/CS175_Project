In the indictment, authorities said Lauren Wright on November 11 taped a conversation with Hadnot in which he allegedly admitted to selling drugs to Wright on the day he disappeared. At the time the toxicology report came out, Alfred Wright's mother, Rosalyn Wright, said she believed the drugs were pumped into her son. The family had maintained Wright never used drugs. Shane Hadnot, 28, who graduated with Wright from Jasper High School, has been charged with two counts of drug-related offenses that resulted in Wright's death. The indictment said authorities tried to search Wright's truck but were not given consent.
