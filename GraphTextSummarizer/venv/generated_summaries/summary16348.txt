Few studies have been conducted on the psychological effects of young defendants facing life in prison at such a young age, said the Equal Justice Institute, which is representing Sullivan's high court case. After a daylong trial, Escambia County Circuit Judge Nicholas Geeker sentenced Sullivan to life without parole. And although about a thousand people under 15 are arrested for rape every year, none has been given life without parole since Sullivan. -- The Supreme Court will decide whether it is cruel and unusual punishment for young criminal offenders to be sentenced to life in prison with parole. Only a handful of states -- including Alaska, Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico and Oregon -- prohibit sentencing minors to life without a chance for parole, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
