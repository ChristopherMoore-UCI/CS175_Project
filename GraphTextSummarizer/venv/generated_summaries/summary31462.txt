Matthew made a virtual appearance at the Fairfax hearing via video from jail in Charlottesville, where he's being held in connection with the Graham case. "In Charlottesville, the case is much more complicated than Fairfax, because the Charlottesville case relies almost wholly on circumstantial evidence," Goodman said. In Friday's arraignment in the Fairfax case, defense attorney James Camblos tried to introduce a motion seeking an evaluation for his client. Matthew separately is charged with abducting Graham, the 18-year-old sophomore whose body was found on an abandoned Virginia farm October 18, more than a month after she was last seen in Charlottesville. It is also unclear what forensic evidence may exist in the case, aside from a surveillance video from the night of Graham's disappearance -- on September 13 -- that shows Matthew, 32, apparently following her in Charlottesville's Downtown Mall area.
