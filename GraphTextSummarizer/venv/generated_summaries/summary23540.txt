"I definitely wanted to win the super-G and I didn't." Boisson, who has never finished on the podium at a World Cup event, claimed France's first medal in the sport's premier discipline since Luc Alphand also took bronze in 1996. Svindal was disappointed to finish with bronze in that race, won by American Ted Ligety, but bounced back to become the first man to take golds in four consecutive world championships as he won back the title he claimed in 2007. Svindal won the fifth gold of his career and his eighth medal overall as he headed off Italy's World Cup downhill standings leader Dominik Paris by almost half a second, with third-placed Frenchman David Poisson adrift by double that margin. Home fans had to make do with fourth place as Klaus Kroll was the top Austrian finisher, with 2011 super-G runnerup Hannes Reichelt skiing out in the first of the two runs. The margins between ultimate success and ultimate failure are too small," Svindal told reporters.
