Opponents say it targets media critical of the current government and President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, especially the media giant Grupo Clarin. Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner has blamed Grupo Clarin for her low approval ratings. "It hits other media groups, but Clarin is the one it hurts," said Daniel Kerner, an analyst at Eurasia Group. "We urge Argentinean legislators not to pass this bill in its current form." If anyone is applying unfair pressure, it is monopolistic media companies, Fernandez de Kirchner said. Last month, the government pushed the nation's soccer association to rescind a contract it had with Clarin to broadcast games.
