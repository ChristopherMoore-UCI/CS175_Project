Fox plans to air six one-hour episodes this summer, debuting the show on Thursday, June 7 at 9 p.m. Five of the episodes will have male celebrities with female contestants; one will have female celebrities and male contestants. In an announcement that seems like a brilliant April Fools' Joke (but, we're assured, is not), Fox's new summer series will feature -- like "The Voice" -- contestants in blind auditions for a quartet of celebrity judges who are seated in spinning chairs. "I think there's a big hole in the dating show world," says Darnell, who is also launching the U.K. dating show import "Take Me Out" this summer. "The Choice" is from longtime Fox alternative series president Mike Darnell and producers A. Smith & Co, who presumably didn't get this idea while watching "Survivor." In the first round, celebrities will listen to "sexy singles" describe themselves.
