-- Low-income households in Egypt are being hit by soaring food prices, placing a major strain on many poor families in the country, who are struggling to put basic staples on the table. Sky rocketing prices of fertilizers and seeds, coupled with an increasingly dysfunctional government, are creating a difficult situation for farmers, and this is reflected in food prices and availability. "The agricultural sector will need a new revolution of its own to be able to feed the increasing number of people and the increasing demands for food that Egypt requires," he adds. One solution could be increasing the size of farms, as most of Egypt's agriculture is in the form of small holdings of just a few acres. Some farmers also complain that access to water can be cut for months, hampering even further their capacity to grow food.
