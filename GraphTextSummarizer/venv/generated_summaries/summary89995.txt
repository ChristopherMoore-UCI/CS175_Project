Most shocking was that on the scraps of paper were pieces of sensitive information, including the names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, banking data, and other personal information about Nassau county police officers and detectives, some of whom are believed to be undercover, according to CNN affiliate WPIX, whom Finkelstein contacted along with the police after finding the pieces of sensitive material on Thursday. On Sunday, Nassau County Police detectives came to Finkelstein's home as part of an investigation into how the documents made their way from Long Island to Manhattan and ended up in the parade. -- Authorities in Long Island are investigating how shredded confidential police documents ended up as confetti in the annual Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade in New York City, according to Nassau County Police. "The fact they sent two people on a Sunday night all the way from Nassau County means they must be trying to figure this out," Finkelstein said. "There were shredded papers all over the place, like snowball size, all over the ground," Finkelstein said.
