New Orleans police said Monette was last seen on March 2 at Parlay's, a bar in the Lakeview area of New Orleans. Terrilynn Monette had been out celebrating a recent nomination for a "Teacher of the Year" award in her district the night she vanished, her friends told CNN affiliate WWL. "We have received tips, and we are following up," New Orleans police officer Hilal Williams said. According to police, Monette told her acquaintances she was going to sleep in her car before driving home "due to having consumed alcoholic beverages." As hundreds of volunteers and police scoured parks and waterways in an area of New Orleans Tuesday, there were many questions but few answers about the disappearance 11 days ago of a 26-year-old teacher.
