"(Bagley) advertised and publicized FV over the Internet and in live web cam sessions as his slave who would engage in sexual acts and could be tortured during live online sessions, or in person," an indictment read. A federal judge accepted a plea agreement from Edward Bagley Sr., 46, in a Kansas City courtroom on Wednesday morning, the U.S. Attorney's Office said. The woman -- who was a runaway minor at the time when the abuse began -- was sometimes "hung upside down," "water boarded" and had animals she cared for shot in front of her by Bagley to coerce her to engage in commercial sex acts, the indictment read. The four men were alleged to have traded Bagley things like "cigarettes, computer hard drives, sadomasochism videos, coats and meats" to use the young woman as a sex slave, according to the indictment. Five other defendants, including four men and Bagley's wife, Marilyn Bagley, are scheduled to be sentenced this week.
