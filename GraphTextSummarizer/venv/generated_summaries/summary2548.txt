The Democrat was elected after some high-level campaign stumping with President Barack Obama, First Lady Michelle Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary -- not all at the same time, of course. But he won't be the first Iraq War veteran to serve in the Senate: Sen. John Walsh, who led a combat battalion in Iraq, was appointed to fill Montana Sen. Max Baucus' Senate seat earlier this year but dropped his bid for a full term after a plagiarism scandal killed his campaign. Tom Cotton is the first Iraq War and the first Afghanistan war veteran to be elected to the Senate. Tim Scott became the first African-American from the South elected to the Senate since Reconstruction, according to the Charleston Post and Courier. Scott also became the first African-American to be elected to both the House and the Senate.
