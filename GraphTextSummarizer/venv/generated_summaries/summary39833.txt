Cain: Opposing mosque construction is not discrimination Bahloul said construction will go on until the Islamic Center receives orders to stop. He said the planning commission violated state law by not providing proper public notice. " For months, mosque leaders searched for contractors willing and able to do the job. "The judge's ruling is apparently based on a fictitious 'heightened standard' for public notice when Muslims are involved," he said. The order says the May 2010 decision by planning commissioners to approve the center's plans failed to meet public notice requirements.
