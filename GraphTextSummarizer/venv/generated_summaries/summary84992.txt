But the White House response falls short of wholesale changes that some suggested should be made after police deployed military-style vehicles on the streets of Ferguson, Missouri, after the Brown shooting. President Barack Obama ordered the review after widely criticized heavy-handed police response to August protests following the shooting of Michael Brown. A White House review suggests largely leaving intact federal programs that provide surplus military equipment to local police departments. Some law enforcement officials say that instead of focusing on equipment, more attention should be paid to police training. The president plans to issue an executive order to tighten some of the controls over the programs to better track equipment provided to law enforcement agencies.
