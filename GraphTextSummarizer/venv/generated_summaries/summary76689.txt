-- Evangelist Billy Graham was released from the hospital Tuesday after a two-day stay and returned to his North Carolina home, Mission Hospital said. Graham, a resident of Montreat, about 18 miles east of Asheville, has provided counsel to generations of U.S. presidents, beginning with Harry S. Truman, and is the founder of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association. Graham was admitted to the hospital in the western North Carolina city of Asheville early Sunday morning. "I am also grateful for the prayers and letters I received from people across the country and around the world during my short stay," Graham said in the news release. Graham said he received "exceptional care" during his stay.
