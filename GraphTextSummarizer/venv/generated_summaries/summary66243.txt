The most basic method involves phishing, sending an e-mail that lures a target into clicking on it and unknowingly downloading NSA spyware. This report follows a string of revelations leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden about privacy and spying, from the tracking of millions of overseas cell phones, to the monitoring of foreign leaders' phones, to the global bulk scanning of e-mails. "This is NSA's hacking organization," said Matthew Aid, who wrote a book about the NSA and said he has spoken to members or former members of the unit. According to the documents posted online by Der Spiegel, TAO programmers develop spyware to infiltrate everything from smartphones and computers to routers, servers, hard drives and firewalls to access global communications traffic. According to Der Spiegel, a German magazine that published some of the documents, the unit's interception techniques are worthy of James Bond: intercepting a computer being shipped to a target and installing spyware before it is delivered; supplying an altered monitor cable that transmits everything on a computer's screen to the NSA; or planting a USB plug with a secret radio transmitter.
