Burke said he initially delayed the race by several minutes due to inclement weather. Kudryk was driven to one of four New York City Fire Department boats stationed in the river, where he was treated by paramedics on board before being taken to the emergency medical station on Dock A, Burke said. Manhattan Borough president Scott Stringer sent a letter to Burke Monday requesting a "top to bottom review of the safety protocol for the triathlon," he told CNN. New York Police Department spokesman Lieutenant John Grimpel identified the deceased athletes as Martich, 40, and Mike Kudryk, 64. Both Martich and Kudryk were transferred to St. Luke's Roosevelt Hospital Center just after 8 a.m. on Sunday, Burke said.
