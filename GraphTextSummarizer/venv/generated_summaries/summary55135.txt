For her, Oprah Winfrey wasn't just a role model but a "reference point," and seeing Winfrey and Whoopi Goldberg in "The Color Purple" was key to her belief that she could become successful. "I've heard people talk about images in popular culture changing, and that makes me feel great, because it means that the little girl I was, once upon a time, has an image to instill in her that she is beautiful, that she is worthy," she said. Nyong'o has big things ahead, including next year's "Star Wars" movie. That's no surprise to most people: The actress won an Oscar for "12 Years a Slave" this year and has been popping up on "best dressed" and "most beautiful" lists ever since. She hopes she can have the same effect on people who see her.
