-- Kuwait's leaders met in emergency session Thursday, vowing to clamp down on violence after protesters forced their way inside Parliament. The protests late Wednesday led to the injury of five police and Kuwait National Guard officers, the Interior Ministry said. U.S. State Department deputy spokesman Mark Toner said Kuwait has a history of "political freedom and cooperation" and that it should respect peaceful protests. But the anti-corruption protests have turned more violent recently, after members of the Kuwaiti opposition saw revolutions in Tunisia, Egypt, and Libya, and fighting between protesters and government forces in Syria. The Interior Ministry said the crowd of protesters Wednesday night "brawled with the police, the National Guard and other state agencies," and property was damaged.
