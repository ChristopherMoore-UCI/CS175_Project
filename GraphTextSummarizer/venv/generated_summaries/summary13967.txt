Line said dressing main characters Emily, Spencer, Aria and Hanna like typical high school students would be boring, adding, you can't blame viewers for "wanting to go to some sort of fantasyland. And Line says fashion lovers are in for a treat when the third season returns. " Line said she used to think that Aria, played by Hale, was the most fashionable of the girls, but now she just considers the character to have "schizophrenia fashion. "(Spencer is) not that girl you were introduced to in the argyle sweater and the pearls in the pilot," Line said. Minkoff said her fall offerings include "a lot of embossed, faux python" handbags, "great outerwear pieces" and a ton of "rich burgundy and purple" -- so don't be surprised to see such trends show up on "Pretty Little Liars" this fall.
