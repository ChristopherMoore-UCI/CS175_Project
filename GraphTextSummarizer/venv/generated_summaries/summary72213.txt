After many attacks on army buses, especially during the morning and evening rush-hour periods, Kabul residents are worried. At the end of December, U.S. forces will end their combat role in Afghanistan and instead focus on counterterrorism missions and training, advising and assisting Afghan troops. ISAF, which also reported the attack but did not release the nationalities of the victims, said the attack happened in eastern Afghanistan. Two American soldiers and at least 19 Afghans were killed in a spate of attacks in Afghanistan Friday and Saturday, some of which were claimed by the Taliban, officials said. That afternoon, a suicide bomber targeted a bus carrying Afghan National Army personnel in the Guzargah area of Kabul on Saturday afternoon, said Sediq Sediqqi, a spokesman for the Afghan Interior Ministry.
