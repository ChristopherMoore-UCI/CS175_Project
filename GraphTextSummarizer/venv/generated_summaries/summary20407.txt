Arizona measles exposure worries parents of at-risk kids Last year, the United States had its most number of measles cases -- at 644 -- since 2000, the CDC says on its website. Most cases -- 58 -- are linked to an outbreak at Disneyland in mid-December. The disease outbreak became apparent when visitors reported coming down with measles after visiting the park from December 15 to December 20. The new numbers include two cases in Marin County, near San Francisco, where one parent of a 6-year-old has asked school officials to bar any children who have not been vaccinated for measles, mumps and rubella (MMR). The California Department of Public Health sent out the latest numbers Friday of confirmed cases since December and while the total is still small, the jump was a startling 54% in just more than a week.
