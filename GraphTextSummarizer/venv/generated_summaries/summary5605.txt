Belgium's next game is against Russia on June 22 while Algeria takes on South Korea later that day. It wasn't until the 66th minute that it created a real opportunity when Divock Origi, on as substitute for the disappointing Lukaku, fired straight at the Algeria goalkeeper. -- Just when it looked like the World Cup "dark horses" were about to turn up lame, Belgium turned on the power in the final straight to overcome Algeria 2-1 in Belo Horizonte. Nonetheless, Belgium was still expected to deal with an Algeria side which has been widely dismissed by fans and pundits alike. And Belgium sealed victory with 10 minutes left when Dries Mertens rounded off a stylish counter-attack to snatch victory.
