Proposed changes to its ethics committee, which will be split into two entities, one to investigate allegations and another to rule on them, were hailed as "historic" by FIFA president Sepp Blatter after being approved by the executive committee. Wahl also doubted FIFA would implement the ICG recommendation to limit the terms of FIFA president and executive committee members to two terms of four years. A FIFA statement said: "To underline the significance of the FIFA World Cup for world football's governing body, the complete FIFA executive committee is now, for the first time, part of this decision-making forum which is responsible for monitoring and organizing each edition of FIFA's flagship event." FIFA pledged Friday to reform its governance structure after the corruption scandals which rocked football's world governing body last year. But Grant Wahl, a senior writer for Sports Illustrated, who unsuccessfully tried to challenge Blatter in the FIFA presidential elections last year, told CNN that while the 76-year-old Swiss remained at the helm there would be doubts about the implementation of the proposed changes.
