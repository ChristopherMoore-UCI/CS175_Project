-- Pakistan President Gen. Pervez Musharraf swore seven of his allies into a caretaker government on Friday. "We are are creating history because I think never has Pakistan seen such a smooth transition of government," Musharraf said after the official ceremony. Bhutto and other opposition leaders accuse Musharraf of imposing the emergency order so he could remain in power by avoiding an expected ruling from the previous Supreme Court that would have nullified his October election victory. Asked Wednesday if Musharraf would include members of the opposition in the caretaker government, Musharraf was vague in an interview with The Associated Press but said "we are looking into names (from opposition parties). " A close Musharraf associate, Pakistani Senator Nisar Memon, was sworn in as interim information minister, a post he previously held in Musharraf's government.
