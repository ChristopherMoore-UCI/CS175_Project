widow yells at Bulger During the seven-week trial, jurors heard dramatic testimony from convicted gangsters, bookies, extortion victims, a disgraced FBI supervisor, ex-drug dealers, retired FBI agents and relatives of people Bulger is accused of killing. After the jury was dismissed Friday, Bulger waived his rights to a forfeiture hearing on the nearly $822,000 and 30 weapons found in his Santa Monica, California, home where he had been living under an alias until he was arrested in 2011. Bulger never took the stand despite repeated hints from his lawyers throughout trial he would testify. Bulger, 83, is accused of racketeering, including involvement in 19 killings, and also 13 counts of extortion and money-laundering during a 20-year "reign of terror" that defined South Boston from the early '70s through 1995, when Bulger fled Boston. Bulger was a fugitive for more than 16 years, disappearing after a crooked FBI agent told him he was about to be indicted on federal racketeering charges.
