While "Night of Hunters" uses Amos' familiar themes of spirit guides, magical elixirs, forces of nature and reclaiming female power, making this album was a new undertaking for her. But when (classical music label) Deutsche/Grammophon approached me and said, We heard you're working on this musical, what about if you did a 21st century song cycle based on classical themes? Twenty years after her groundbreaking solo debut, "Little Earthquakes," Tori Amos talked to CNN about the irony of her getting kicked out of classical music school, women's sharp and deadly tongues and why she has no desire to be 30 again. Amos returned to the piano and used the classical music format of a song cycle, where there is a common theme to the collection of songs and they are intended to be performed in sequence, to present her supernatural tale. I wanted there to be a poetic level to this (album), where the poems come to life, and the emotion, but the plotline isn't necessarily in the songs themselves.
