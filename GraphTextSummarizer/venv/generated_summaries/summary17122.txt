In a news conference on Wednesday, Onondaga County District Attorney William Fitzpatrick harshly criticized Syracuse Police Chief Frank Fowler and Deputy Chief Sean Broton over the handling of a 2002 probe into a ball boy's molestation claims against Syracuse University assistant basketball coach Bernie Fine. Davis told university officials six years ago that he informed Syracuse, New York, police that he had been "subjected to inappropriate contact by an associate men's basketball coach" during the 1980s and 1990s, according to university Senior Vice President Kevin C. Quinn. Attempts to reach Fowler were not returned, but Syracuse Mayor Stephanie Miner defended the police department's actions. Syracuse placed Bernie Fine on administrative leave last week after the accusations surfaced. -- The investigation into claims that a Syracuse assistant basketball coach molested young boys is at a standstill as law enforcement officials find themselves at odds.
