"Many thanks to my fans for the love and support and I will be seeing you very soon back on the courts." Venus' absence means she will be unable to defend the doubles title she won last year with Serena, their fifth triumph at Wimbledon. Venus, who lost in the first round for the first time last year, won her titles in 2000, 2001, 2005, 2007 and 2008, while Serena is the defending champion. The duo, who have contested four singles finals against one another at Wimbledon, also triumphed on Center Court last year when winning a gold medal in the doubles at the London Olympics. -- Five-time champion Venus Williams has pulled out of next week's Wimbledon championships because of injury. Serena aside, the women's field only has two other ladies that have managed to win the title: Maria Sharapova, who succeeded in 2004, and 2011 champion Petra Kvitova.
