Most flights resumed takeoff early Saturday after the airline resorted to a backup system. "The manual process is involved because the team doesn't have access to all of the normal tools they would use to be able to communicate and dispatch flights." Agnew said the glitch was in the internal system used to dispatch flights. "Flights have started to depart, but employees are working through a manual process so their routine work flow is taking a bit longer," said Michelle Agnew, a spokeswoman for the airline. Flights already in the air were not affected by the glitch, which started late Friday night. -- A computer glitch forced Southwest Airlines to ground 250 flights, the company said early Saturday.
