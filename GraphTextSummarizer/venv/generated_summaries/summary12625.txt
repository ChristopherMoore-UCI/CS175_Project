The Russian coast guard seized two Chinese vessels and detained 36 fishermen Tuesday after they were allegedly found fishing in Russian-controlled waters in the Sea of Japan, according to state media Warning shots were fired at one vessel during a three-hour pursuit by Russian Coast Guard, which eventually rammed the vessel and soldiers fired directly on the ship when sailors resisted being boarded, according to Russia's state-run RIA Novosti news agency. "The aggressive behavior by some Russians at the grass-roots level not only harms Chinese confidence in fostering a long-term friendship with Russia, but also provides excuses for forces seeking to undermine China-Russia ties." A second Chinese fishing vessel, with 19 crew members, was also detained in nearby waters. The ship had 22.5 metric tons of squid and a crew of 17 RIA reported, and didn't have documents allowing them to fish in Russia's Exclusive Economic Zone. Clinton slams Russia, China over Syria
