Starting from the end of the week-long event, Racked brings us a video love letter via Vimeo of dancing models and Fashion Week attendees. For a culinary twist on the action outside the shows, makeup artist Annamarie Tendler teamed up with comedian Aziz Ansari to document visits to their favorite restaurants on her Tumblr. No fashion week coverage would be complete without putting the spotlight on one of the most famous names in fashion. Images from GQ's street style series and Citizen Couture's spotlight on fashion week could easily be mistaken for a fashion shoot, although it helps that everyone's so attractive. Since it's fashion week, they dress for the occasion.
