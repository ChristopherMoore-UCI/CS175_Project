The fourth season was streamed exclusively on Netflix in 2013, after Fox canceled the show several years before. It was not yet known if the full cast, including Jason Bateman, Michael Cera and Will Arnett, will return for the season. "Arrested Development" executive producer Brian Grazer said the show will return for a fifth season of 17 episodes. The Hollywood mogul was interviewed on Bill Simmons' podcast recently, and let it drop that fans can expect more of the quirky comedy. Netflix had no comment for CNN when asked to verify his statements.
