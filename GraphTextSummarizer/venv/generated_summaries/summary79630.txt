Patients who have a slower than normal heart rate or are already taking drugs to treat arrhythmias should also be cautious. Ray told CNN it's unclear why azithromycin can cause heart issues. Drug labels for azithromycin have been updated to include warnings about this risk, the FDA said. Ray said doctors often prescribe Z-Paks because the drug only needs to be taken for five days, versus the 10-day periods that are typical with other antibiotics. They found a 2.5 times higher risk of death from heart disease in the first five days of using a Z-Pak when compared to another common antibiotic or no antibiotics at all.
