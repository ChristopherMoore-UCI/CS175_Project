Title hopefuls Lazio could have moved up to third place above Udinese, but went 3-0 down by halftime against Siena after goalkeeper Albano Bizzarri was sent off. Destro, on loan from Genoa, sealed victory with nine minutes to play, heading in Cristiano Del Grosso's cross for his fifth Serie A goal this season as Siena moved up to 14th -- six points above the bottom three. Milito set up strike partner Giampaolo Pazzini in the 56th minute, and the South American's 76th-minute replacement Marcoo Faraoni sealed Inter's biggest win this season with his first touch of the ball, as the 20-year-old fired in a volley off the crossbar for his first goal in Serie A. Inter Milan moved closer to a Champions League place after crushing Parma 5-0 on Saturday following fourth-placed Lazio's shock 4-0 defeat by Siena. The win left Inter five points behind defending champions AC Milan and second-placed Juventus, who travel to mid-table Atalanta and bottom side Lecce respectively on Sunday.
