Father Saad Sirop Hanna said Christians in Iraq are scared of more attacks. -- A Syriac Orthodox archbishop in Britain called for all Christians in Iraq to leave the country Sunday, one week to the day after gunmen stormed a Catholic church in Baghdad. Speaking at a service in London, he also asked the British government, and those in other European countries, to grant asylum to Christians living in Iraq. Elsewhere in Baghdad, at Saint Joseph's Church, about a dozen worshippers attended evening Mass, significantly less than a typical turnout, the parish priest said. The Islamic State of Iraq, which has local ties to al Qaeda, claimed responsibility for the attack, which was set off when gunman stormed the church and took worshippers hostage.
