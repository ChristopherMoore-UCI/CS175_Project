U.S. District Court Judge James Robinson said Schroer's civil rights were violated. "The evidence established that the Library was enthusiastic about hiring David Schroer -- until she disclosed her transsexuality," Robinson wrote. There was no immediate reaction from the library, which had claimed at trial that transgender people are not covered under federal anti-discrimination laws. Diane Schroer won her federal lawsuit against the Library of Congress after officials backed out of a 2005 job offer when told of her intention to become a transsexual. Court records show that Schroer, then a male, took her future boss to lunch to outline her transition to a female, as she planned to present herself as a female on her first day of the job.
