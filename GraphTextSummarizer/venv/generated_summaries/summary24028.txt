-- Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, who underwent surgery this week to remove her thyroid, did not actually have cancer, her spokesman said Saturday. "We thank God and all the Argentinean people for the blessings received," Fernandez said on her Twitter account Saturday morning. A post-surgery examination, however, showed that there were no cancerous cells, and the original diagnosis of cancer has been discarded, spokesman Alfredo Scoccimarro said. Before the operation, Fernandez handed over power to Vice President Amado Boudou until January 24. Hundreds of supporters had waved flags and banners outside the Austral Hospital, located about 60 kilometers (35 miles) from Buenos Aires.
