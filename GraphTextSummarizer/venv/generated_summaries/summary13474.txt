Once again, current students are facing the possibility of interest rates on Stafford Federal student loans doubling. Last year, the interest rate on federal Stafford student loans was set to double from 3.4% to 6.8%. House Republicans, the Obama administration, and a number of senators are all pushing to permanently tie the rate for student loans to the government's borrowing costs. But it lacks any cap on how high interest rates can go, and continues the worrying practice of the government profiting off student loans. The government would mark up the costs 2.5% to 4.5%, based on the type of loan.
