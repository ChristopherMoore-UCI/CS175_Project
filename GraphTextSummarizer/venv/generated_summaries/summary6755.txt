-- Lindsay Lohan made sure she made it to the Los Angeles morgue early Friday for her first day of court-ordered community service. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Stephanie Sautner ruled Wednesday that Lohan had violated her probation. "We can confirm she came in well before her appointed time, between 6 and 6:30 this morning," Los Angeles County Coroner Assistant Chief Ed Winter said Friday. As part of her sentence for a necklace theft conviction, Lohan was ordered to work 120 hours at the county morgue after she completed 360 hours of community service at the Los Angeles Downtown Women's Center, but she was booted from that program for missing too many appointments. Lohan, 25, was on probation after pleading guilty in May to stealing a necklace from a Venice, California, jewelry store.
