We already knew "That '70s Show" co-stars Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher were parents. In the same feature article, Kunis revealed that her first kiss was with Kutcher while filming "That '70s Show." After the show ended, the A-list actors followed different journeys for some time. While Kunis, 31, and Kutcher, 36, have stayed pretty quiet about their pregnancy and engagement, Kunis told W magazine in July that she was "excited about being a full-time mom." It appeared on Kutcher's website Thursday night along with a bunch of baby pictures. The two rekindled their relationship in 2012 -- shortly after Kutcher separated from his then-wife, Demi Moore, and became engaged in early 2014.
