The latest casualty is a police officer who died after an armed mob of about 400 to 500 mostly Hindus torched a police station in the district on Monday, Orissa state police said. Both sides said the violence has left Christian churches and Hindu temples razed to the ground. The attack came two days after police fired on a crowd to prevent it from attacking Christian residents. The Christian community in the Karnataka -- numbering about 2.5 million -- said right-wing Hindus are targeting them for opposing the violence in Orissa. Some Hindu groups view the work of Christian missionaries in the state with suspicion.
