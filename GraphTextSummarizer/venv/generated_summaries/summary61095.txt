What strikes Weyers is LA's access to the front lines of battles between ISIS and other militant groups in Syria.

Janice Stein, professor of conflict management at The University of Toronto, said she believes proposed Canadian legislation would allow law enforcement in the future to not only stop people who have publicly shown support for terror groups to travel abroad to fight for them, but would also give cause to arrest someone for simply voicing support for a terror group. The question for Weyers and other researchers is: What is LA's plan in Syria?
