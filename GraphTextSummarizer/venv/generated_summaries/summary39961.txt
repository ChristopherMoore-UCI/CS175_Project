Red Bull team chief Christian Horner said he was delighted that Ricciardo would be teaming up with three-time defending champion Sebastian Vettel. Ricciardo is following in the illustrious footsteps of Germany's Vettel, who also learned his trade with Torro Rosso before joining Red Bull in 2009. Ricciardo has been groomed by Red Bull since joining Torro Rosso, claiming 21 points from 41 Grand Prix races. The 24-year-old, who is currently with Red Bull's sister team Torro Rosso, will replace his compatriot Mark Webber, who is quitting F1 to race sportscars. The announcement comes ahead of this weekend's Italian Grand Prix, with Vettel again holding a commanding advantage over Fernando Alonso of Ferrari in this year's title race.
