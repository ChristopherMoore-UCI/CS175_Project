Yemen's National Civil Aviation Security Committee said Monday it has implemented "tight security" at all of its airports in the aftermath of a plot to send bombs from Yemen to the United States. On Friday, authorities in the United Arab Emirates and Britain found two packages with explosives that were destined for synagogues in Chicago, Illinois. U.S. investigators believe al Qaeda bomb maker al-Asiri, 28, is linked to the packages. The explosive found in the packages, PETN, is the same as the material found in the December 2009 foiled underwear bomb attack in the United States. 'Most wanted' man linked to plot
