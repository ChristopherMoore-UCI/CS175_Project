-- Derrion Albert was different from the other boys in the often violent and tense neighborhood of Roseland in South Side Chicago. But Albert, like many kids, hung out with some of the same boys who were known to menace other children in the neighborhood. Last school year, Albert complained to her that some boys were threatening him and that his leather jacket and shoes had been stolen from his locker. She grew up in the neighborhood that has drawn national attention since a video captured Albert, a 16-year-old honor student, being beaten to death with a railway tie, kicked and punched by other teens. Matthews works with Cease Fire, a Chicago, Illinois, grassroots organization founded in 1995 to try to curb gang violence.
