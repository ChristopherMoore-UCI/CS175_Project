"Study after study shows that young people raised by gay parents are as happy and healthy as other young people." Does Hollywood have a Latino problem? GLAAD (formerly the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation) announced that Galavis will meet with gay and lesbian Latino families this week in Los Angeles. But the comment that caused the most uproar was: "There's this thing about gay people. In his apology "to all the people I may have offended," Galavis said he "would never disrespect anyone" and he has "nothing but respect for gay people and their families." What I meant to say was that gay people are more affectionate and intense and for a segment of the TV audience this would be too racy to accept.
