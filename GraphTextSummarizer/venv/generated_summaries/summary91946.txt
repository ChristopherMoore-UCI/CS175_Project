After a month of largely leaderless popular protests against the government, Ben Ali fled the country on Friday, and Fouad Mebazaa, the speaker of parliament, was sworn in the following day as interim president, and new elections are due within 60 days. " President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali's departure followed weeks of protests over what Tunisians said were poor living conditions, high unemployment, government corruption and repression. Beji said she hopes the next president will support freedoms for Tunisians -- especially after what regular citizens showed what they are capable of. -- As Tunisia adjusts to a new government, Selma Beji is cautiously optimistic about the future -- and freedoms -- of her fellow Tunisians. Already, filters on websites such as YouTube -- put in place under Ben Ali -- were dropped, and internet speed picked up considerably -- a development that followed the new government's vow to ease restrictions on freedoms.
