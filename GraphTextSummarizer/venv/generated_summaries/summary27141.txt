" North Korea parades launch pad for world media After a period of time, the North Koreans tend to follow up their effective walkout with a provocative act such as a missile test. That is true, but with an important caveat: The North Koreans usual way of doing things is first to pull out of a negotiation over some issue that would not be an issue among normal countries, but becomes a deal breaker for this "exceptional nation. Obama warns against provocation This farcical argument, prevalent among those who have convinced themselves that they would have been more competent than the U.S. negotiators, has been "confirmed" by the North Koreans themselves -- surprise, surprise -- who deny the launch was even mentioned in negotiations. Besides, the North Koreans view their space program as a kind of NASA of their own, and how could anyone think the launch was anything but their own contribution to the peaceful exploration of space? The process was very much on track, and -- dare one use a word that should not be used in the context of North Korean negotiations -- there was optimism.
