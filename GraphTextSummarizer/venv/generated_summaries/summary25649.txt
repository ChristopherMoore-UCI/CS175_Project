Elsewhere, Chelsea recorded a 1-0 win at Sporting Lisbon, Athletic Bilbao suffered a surprise 2-1 defeat at BATE Borisov in Belarus and Cypriot side APOEL held Ajax to a 1-1 draw. Roma sits second in Group E following a 1-1 draw at Manchester City courtesy of a goal from Francesco Totti. David Luiz, Marco Verratti and Blaise Matuidi got the goals for the home side, which was forced to play without injured talisman Zlatan Ibrahimovic. Barcelona had not conceded a goal in any of its six league matches before arriving in Paris but its defensive frailties were exposed for all to see. While Lionel Messi and Neymar were busy scoring goals for Barca, in a losing cause, it was the celebrities in the stand which were capturing the attention of the photographers by the field.
