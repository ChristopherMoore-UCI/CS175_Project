The tool, which has been available for Android devices since last summer, uses the wealth of data Google has about an individual to serve up information it thinks he or she will find useful at the moment it's most needed. There are other predictive assistant apps such as Grokr and Osito that you can give access to your e-mail and calendar information, but for many, Google products are already integrated into every part of their lives. On Monday, Google's predictive search feature Google Now finally rolls out for iPhone and iPad users as an update to the existing Google Search app. Google is also in a unique position to know what information people are most interested in seeing and when they want it based on the giant volume of Web searches processed by the search engine daily. Google already uses a lot of this data to serve ads in Gmail and on search results.
