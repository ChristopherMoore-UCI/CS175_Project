U.S. Vice President Joe Biden asked Ecuador "to please reject" the request for asylum from self-avowed National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden, according to Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa. Biden made his phone call the day after Correa and other top Ecuadorian officials said they wouldn't bow to U.S. pressure about Snowden. In a telephone conversation with Biden on Friday, Correa told him "what was the Ecuadorian position" and that Ecuador "can't even proceed with the request because Mr. Snowden is not in Ecuadorian territory." Europe furious, 'shocked' by report of U.S. spying Correa said Ecuador would be cautious about processing any asylum request from Snowden. Snowden wasn't in Ecuador on Saturday, but if he does arrive there, the country will make a decision based on sovereignty, taking into account U.S. input, Correa said in his weekly broadcast on state TV. "In the face of threats, insolence and arrogance of certain U.S. sectors, which have pressured to remove the preferential tariffs because of the Snowden case, Ecuador tells the world we unilaterally and irrevocably renounce the preferential tariffs," Correa said.
