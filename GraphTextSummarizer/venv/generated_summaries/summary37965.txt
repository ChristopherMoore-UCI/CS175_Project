There are so many dead that it's unlikely the local morgue will be able to hold them all, Sneider said, even in a volatile region that's seen waves of death recently amid clashes between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian separatists. Sneider said he hadn't seen any looting by people in the area. And there are some reports that pieces of the aircraft have been looted and put in people's yards, CNN's Nic Robertson reported from Kiev. In the wide fields of tall grasses, debris stretched so far, in so many small pieces, that it seemed unfathomable that anyone would ever know for certain what happened to Flight 17, Sneider said. "When there was the battle for the Donetsk airport, something like 50 people died and they didn't have the space," Sneider told CNN's Anderson Cooper.
