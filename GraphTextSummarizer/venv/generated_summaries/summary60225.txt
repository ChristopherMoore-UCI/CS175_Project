That's when the airline launches its "Mint" business class service for customers willing to pay more for flights between New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport and Los Angeles International Airport. JetBlue also plans to offer Mint service between New York's Kennedy Airport and San Francisco International Airport by the end of the year. JetBlue officials hope to attract cost-conscious business class customers away from the higher priced business- and first-class service of traditional airlines. All the benefits won't go to business class. It remains to be seen if Mint -- which offers fully flat beds, some private suites, dual power outlets with USB ports, amenity kits and a tapas menu -- will change perceptions of the airline.
