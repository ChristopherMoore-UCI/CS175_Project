The historic ceremony took place amid tight security before the Supreme Constitutional Court and was overseen by Egypt's military rulers who have been in control of the country since Hosni Mubarak was ousted last year during a popular revolution. SCAF, which assumed legislative powers after they dissolved parliament after a court ruling, continues to wield that power even after Morsi's swearing-in. Mohamed Morsi was sworn in Saturday as Egypt's first democratically-elected president, taking the helm of a deeply divided nation that is economically strapped and lacks a working government. Egypt is witnessing a new democratic process," the head of the SCAF,  Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, said at a military ceremony for Morsi Saturday. Egypt's electoral commission declared Morsi the president-elect Sunday after a runoff with Ahmed Shafik, a former air force general who served as Mubarak's last prime minister.
