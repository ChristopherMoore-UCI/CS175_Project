However you viewed Walter White (Bryan Cranston) and Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) â€” and chances are that view changed radically over the last five seasons -- the two men will forever be linked as the heart and corroded soul of AMC's meth-making drama Breaking Bad. Walt sought revenge, first by handing over Jesse to the neo-Nazis (who gave him two scoops of torture and ice cream), and then by returning from cold and lonely New Hampshire to wipe out Jesse along with Uncle Jack (Michael Bowen) and his crew. " Walt's unplanned self-sacrifice in shielding Jesse from the bullet not only exposed what humanity was left in Walter White, but underlined the significance of their relationship, no matter how fractured. The pair's relationship flamed out spectacularly in the final season, as Jesse, realizing that Walt was responsible for the near-death of Brock, the son of Jesse's ex-girlfriend, helped ASAC Schrader (Dean Norris) to (almost) bring Walt to justice. But when Walt saw the hideous, ragged condition of his estranged and now-enslaved labmate, who turned out not to be a 50/50 partner in meth manufacturing with these vicious white supremacists, he had an instinctive change of heart and saved Jesse from the hellfire that they were all going down in.
