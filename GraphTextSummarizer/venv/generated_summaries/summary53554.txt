Doctors at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle have an open clinical trial protocol for doing stem cell transplants on patients with Stiff Person Syndrome, says Dr. George Georges. The woman had been diagnosed with Stiff Person Syndrome, or SPS, a rare neurological disorder characterized by painful muscle spasms and progressive stiffness in the lower back and limbs. While there is no cure yet for SPS, patients are often put on benzodiazepines to treat muscle stiffness and calm the spasms. Yet after years of freezing and falling unexpectedly because of stress or sudden sounds, many patients with SPS develop agoraphobia, an irrational fear of certain places and/or situations. In patients with SPS, antibodies mistakenly attack certain neurons that produce GAD, leaving the body without the protein it needs.
