In the note left at the scene in Sodini's gym bag, Moffatt said, he complains that he had never spent a weekend with a woman, never vacationed with a woman and never lived with a woman, and that he had had limited sexual experiences. He "just had a lot of hatred in him," Allegheny County police superintendent Charles Moffatt said Wednesday. Moffatt said police have no knowledge of any mental health issues involving Sodini but are still puzzled at the violence. Authorities think Sodini targeted the aerobics class specifically, as a schedule was found in his home with that class circled, Moffatt said. Sodini apparently had "practice runs" before the shooting Tuesday, Moffatt said.
