Five teenagers are in custody after the desecration of a Jewish cemetery in Sarre-Union, France, Saverne prosecutor Philippe Vanier said Monday. The vandalism comes within weeks of other Jewish cemeteries being targeted around the world. And in Dunedin, New Zealand, on Saturday, a vandal spray-painted a swastika on a headstone and knocked over two others, breaking them, in the Jewish section of the Southern Cemetery, the New Zealand Herald reported. In Warsaw, Poland, on January 31, someone wrote "Jews for slaughter" on the fence outside one of the continent's largest Jewish burial grounds, according to the Jewish Telegraphic Agency. One of the teens denied the attack was anti-Semitic, Vanier said.
