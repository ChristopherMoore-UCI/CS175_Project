While many lawmakers have been denouncing the Staten Island grand jury decision not to indict white police officer Daniel Pantaleo in the July chokehold death of an unarmed black man, Eric Garner, Rep. Peter King, R-New York, has been taking a different approach. " Obama on Garner verdict: 'We are not going to let up' King, who grew up in New York, and has represented the state in Congress for nearly 22 years, also claimed no organization has done more to protect young African-Americans in New York City than the New York Police Department. "I think it would be very helpful if President Obama went and met with the police officer, or at least invited him to the White House," King said on Fox Business Network. "Thanks to SI grand jury for doing justice & not yielding to outside pressure," King tweeted. "So police hear that all the time." King also defended the officer's decision to use the chokehold as an arrest procedure.
