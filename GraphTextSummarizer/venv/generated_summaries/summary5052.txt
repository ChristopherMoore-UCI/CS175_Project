"It's nearly impossible to text in California while driving," said Los Angeles County resident Karen North. A Virginia Tech Transportation Institute study released this week showed truck drivers are 23 times more likely to be in a crash if they're texting, and several fatal accidents have been blamed on drivers or train operators who were distracted by texting. "Now with e-mail and with the advent of the BlackBerries and hyper-accessibility, there's this sense that if you don't show that you're always prepared and ready to respond and address an issue, then somehow you're going to be perceived as not being conscientious or not keeping up on things," said Tom Britt, a professor of social psychology at Clemson University in South Carolina. Texting is easier than talking on a cell phone, she said, because she can set the device down in mid-text without disrupting the conversation if she needs both hands free for driving. A sign in San Francisco warns drivers late last year of a new California law prohibiting texting while driving.
