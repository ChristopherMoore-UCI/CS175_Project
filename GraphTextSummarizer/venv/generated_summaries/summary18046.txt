Six Flags Magic Mountain is the 18th most popular amusement park in North America, with more than 2.9 million visitors in 2013, according to the Themed Entertainment Association and AECOM global attractions attendance report. The car was about 20 feet in the air, Los Angeles Fire Department supervisor Ed Pittmann told KTLA. "It was just a lot of leaf noise and then cracking noises and crashing noises and a lot of screaming," Brandy Chambers, who witnessed the incident from her vantage point on another ride, told CNN affiliate KTLA. The index lists the 25 most visited amusement parks and theme parks worldwide, based on attendance figures compiled by AECOM.. But worldwide, such incidents are very rare, and attendance at amusement parks has been increasing, experts say.
