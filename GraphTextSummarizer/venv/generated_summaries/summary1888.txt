Fans can expect to find lots of barbecue and souped up RVs, complete with fully functioning entertainment systems for watching the pre-game coverage and other college football games. Football is the heart and soul for a lot of people, and they love to combine an eating party and football. Mike Clardy, director of university communications for Auburn, estimates that 20,000 or so people show up on game weekends with no intention of actually going to the game. "About 7,000 students get tickets to every game out of about 70,000 fans." Hundreds of RVs are set up in parking lots, where, weather permitting, fans grill out and play typical tailgating games. It's smaller than many Southeastern Conference and Big 10 schools, but Notre Dame sees a surge of people on campus for game day.
