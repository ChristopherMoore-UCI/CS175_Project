After years of near-silence, Eddie Murphy gives a rare extensive print interview in the new issue of Rolling Stone, on stands and available through Rolling Stone All Access on October 28th. " Unlike other "Saturday Night Live" alumni, Murphy has refused to participate in retrospectives and hasn't been on the show in years -- but he's gotten over his grudge. "They were s***** to me on 'Saturday Night Live' a couple of times after I'd left the show," he says. Murphy says that his days of making family movies may be over. Murphy, who co-stars in the upcoming "Tower Heist," is baffled by his reputation as a near-recluse: "I leave my house all the time," he says.
