The dog was discovered in its owner's checked luggage by Transportation Security Administration officers at LaGuardia Airport in Queens, New York. Not in the checked luggage, as an independent Chihuahua discovered on Tuesday. The officers in search of more dangerous items found the dog and called the owner, who had not intended to bring her darling dog on her Tuesday trip. On the other hand, traveling with torch lighters that look like grenades? Luckily for the dog, the TSA screens all checked luggage.
