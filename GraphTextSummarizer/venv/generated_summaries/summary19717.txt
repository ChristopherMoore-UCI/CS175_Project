Stories of students and fathers committing suicide due to the pressure of tuition circulated in the local media earlier this year, and students are frustrated with President Lee Myung-bak for not having kept his campaign promise to reduce college tuition by half if he was voted into power. "In the case of tuition, I'm taking out student loans, so I'll be focusing on making money for living costs. At least for tuition fees I can take out loans for now," said Lee. However, Lee decided that in a country where more than 80% of students go to university, if she didn't earn a college degree she would not stand a chance in the job market. By the time she graduates, Lee will have accumulated nearly $32,000 in student loans.
