Indeed, Adam Smith -- the first economist -- felt that even a "principal clerk" (his word for CEO) would always be paid based on his "labour and skill" and never in "proportion to the capital of which he oversees the management." Fortunately, times have changed in part because economists -- Smith's intellectual heirs -- invented myriad ways like the "principal agent problem," "competitive assignment models," or the "marginal product of labor" to justify otherwise outrageous levels of compensation, provided there is enough capital in the picture. The book confirms what you already know firsthand: The rich are getting richer; the really rich are getting really richer; capital is hot; labor is not. The obvious implication is that you must find a job where the distinction between capital and labor is blurry. Piketty estimates that total capital is up almost threefold since I graduated from college 30 years ago. I'd suggest you steer clear of smaller companies as they're just as hard to run as the bigger ones but don't hold enough capital -- the average Russell 3000 company has a market value of only $1.4 billion -- to be worth your while.
