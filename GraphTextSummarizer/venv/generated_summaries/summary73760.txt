Women might not want to admit this but we often hate women who look good, are smart and successful. I have disagreed with the president at times, but if POTUS is sexist, then we need more men just like him; the world would be a much better place for women. Throughout my career, I've had to learn how to deal with men, and a few women, who made it a point to always comment on my looks, or tell jokes about women working in sports. In my book, when a person -- man or woman -- acknowledges someone's intellect and professionalism and then gives a lighthearted nod to her beauty, it's not sexist. President Obama's observation is not a major offense to women around the globe.
