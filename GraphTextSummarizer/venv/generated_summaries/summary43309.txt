I started reporting on income inequality last year because CNN readers wisely voted me to cover that topic as part of the Change the List project. "If you want to live the American Dream," Kate Pickett, a researcher who studies income inequality, told me last year, "you'd better go to Denmark or Finland. We need to start more entry level jobs so that low income can work their way up. America's new war is on income inequality. But I do think one way we can start to knit our nation back together is to talk about income inequality -- to acknowledge how different America is today from the time of John F. Kennedy and Johnson, when the rich weren't so stratospherically different from the rest of us, and when the minimum wage was actually worth more in real dollars than it is now.
