Though the National Parks Service, which operates the memorial, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund urged visitors to treat veterans memorials -- sites of powerful and often emotional pilgrimages for many who served -- with respect. "Please remember to be respectful to memorials honoring and remembering our nation's veterans," the group wrote on Facebook. On the Mommyish parenting blog, associate editor Maria Guido wrote that "there's nothing wrong with children who may not understand how gleefully playing all over a memorial may seem inappropriate to some." As the photo went viral, comment after comment poured in on Facebook and Twitter, chastising the parents for allowing the kids to play on the statue, part of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial that depicts three women tending to a wounded soldier. "Disgusting," Facebook user Trisha Davidson wrote of the children's actions.
