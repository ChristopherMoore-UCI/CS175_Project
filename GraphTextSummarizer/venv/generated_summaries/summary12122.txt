SAG's board fired Executive Director Doug Allen and named a new chief negotiator last week amid a bitter division among the actors over the question of calling a strike against the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP). -- Instead of resuming contract talks to prevent a Hollywood movie and TV production shutdown, Screen Actors Guild (SAG) members were in court Tuesday fighting over who should lead those negotiations. The new negotiators arranged for contract talks to resume Tuesday, after several months of a deadlock, but a faction of union filed a complaint Monday disputing Allen's firing. The two sides have been at odds mainly over the amount actors should be paid when their movies or TV shows are distributed on discs or through "new media," such as mobile phones and the Internet. A Los Angeles judge rejected their request for an injunction, finding "that the notice and application for the injunction, as well as the underlying complaint, were procedurally defective," according to a statement issued Tuesday afternoon by SAG.
