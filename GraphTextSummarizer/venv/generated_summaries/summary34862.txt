Furthermore, Nettles said she did not know whether Sugarland tour manager Helen Rollins prevented a delay or not, and was unaware of conversations that allegedly occurred about a possible postponement. Jennifer Nettles, half of the country music duo Sugarland, said she was never asked to delay the band's show at the Indiana State Fair because of an approaching storm. In our opinion they (Sugarland) bear ultimate responsibility." Seven people died and more than 40 were injured last year when a storm caused a stage at the state fair to collapse, shortly before Sugarland was to perform. Metal scaffolding supporting the stage lights fell onto a crowd of fans and workers as a storm swept through the Indianapolis fairgrounds on August 13, 2011, right before Sugarland was to perform.
