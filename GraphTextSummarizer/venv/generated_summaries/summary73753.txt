The list of opposition demands circulated Sunday called for a decree guaranteeing the right to peaceful demonstrations and the "termination of all threatening and intimidating acts against our sons and daughters in our schools whether by school staff or secret service agents in and around the schools and to refrain from obliging them to participate in demonstrations supporting the regime. Syrian security forces were searching for members of an "armed group" that killed "a number of citizens and security forces" in Douma on Friday, the Syrian Arab News Agency reported on Saturday. Activists and witnesses dispute the government account, telling CNN that government snipers fired shots at unarmed protesters and government forces beat demonstrators. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said security forces in the volatile southern city of Daraa and in Homs arrested  about 20 people on Saturday after demonstrations the day before. Before Friday's fighting, dozens of people were killed in the last two weeks across Syria, with many deaths reported in the southern city of Daraa, where popular demonstrations started, and the coastal city of Latakia, activists say.
