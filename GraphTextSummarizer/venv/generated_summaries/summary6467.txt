Two fire engines escorted by specialist prison officers in riot gear went onto prison grounds Saturday afternoon as fires engulfed large parts of two more buildings, sending thick black smoke into the air. -- Buildings were burning at a prison in southern England on Saturday, more than 12 hours after prisoners started a riot by smashing windows and setting fires. The incident began around midnight (7 p.m. ET Friday) and forced prison staff to retreat. Police, firefighters and specialist teams of prison officers had to be called in. An additional 140 prison service staff arrived at Ford around midday Saturday to help bring the prison under full control, the Ministry of Justice said, emphasizing it was not an indication the situation was escalating.
