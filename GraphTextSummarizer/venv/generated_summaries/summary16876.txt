-- Andrew Dice Clay, one of the hottest and most controversial comedians two decades ago, sits on his front porch late at night, plotting his comeback. His co-stars include Alec Baldwin, Cate Blanchett and comedian Louis C.K. "I was almost like self-exiled from the business, you know, other than going out and making a living for myself, I wasn't really making any career moves," Clay says, talking with fellow comedian Tom Green. A career resurgence started last year when he landed a role in the final season of HBO's hit series "Entourage." While he says he may rotate them into his personal routine, don't expect to see them in his hand on stage when he's reciting his infamous versions of Mother Goose nursery rhymes.
