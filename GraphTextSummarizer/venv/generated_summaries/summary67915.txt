Pastors said the Biya government sees the mass proliferation of churches as a threat. He said the pastor described him as "an unrepentant devil." Pastors marched against the government's decision Wednesday in Bamenda and Douala. Cameroon's President Paul Biya has ordered the closure of nearly 100 Christian churches in key cities, citing criminal practices organized by Pentecostal pastors that threaten the security of the West African nation. Targeted Pentecostal Christians in Bamenda are transforming their private homes into churches. But Pentecostal pastors said the move is evidence of Biya's insecurity about the churches' criticism of the government.
