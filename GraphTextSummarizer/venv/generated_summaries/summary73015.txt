United's miserable night was complete in the final minute when a long ball from Newcastle goalkeeper Tim Krul was turned into his own net by England defender Jones. Superb strikes from Demba Ba and Yohan Cabaye plus a late Phil Jones own goal earned the home side a deserved victory and condemned United to a second successive loss following Saturday's shock 3-2 home defeat by bottom club Blackburn. Newcastle doubled the lead early in the second half with another spectacular goal, as Cabaye curled home a delightful long-range free-kick that hit the underside of the crossbar before bouncing over the goal-line of keeper Anders Lindegaard -- who was recalled in place of David De Gea. The home side took a 63rd-minute lead in freak circumstances when Everton goalkeeper Tim Howard's long clearance flew over his opposite number Adam Bogdan and into the net. However, former Liverpool striker David Ngog leveled for the visitors just four minutes later before captain Gary Cahill -- who has been linked with a move to Chelsea during the transfer window -- smashed home the winner with 12 minutes remaining.
