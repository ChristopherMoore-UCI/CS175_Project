I've come to the conclusion that wanting to stop mid-workout has little to do with my body and everything to do with my mind. Everyone, even the toughest endurance athletes, occasionally struggle during workouts. I've been in the middle of many workouts when I desperately wanted to stop. I imagine that magical mixture of physical exhaustion, elation, pride and disbelief that I actually did it. The real key to overcoming these fears, as Roll pointed out, is faith.
