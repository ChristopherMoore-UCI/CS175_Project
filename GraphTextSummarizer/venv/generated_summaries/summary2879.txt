The Hernandez family -- a large clan consisting of 11 brothers and sisters -- moved from Puerto Rico to southern New Jersey in the early 1970s, a relative told CNN. Describing Hernandez as having been a quiet young man, relatives say his demeanor changed upon his return to New Jersey. Pedro Hernandez attended high school in the Camden, New Jersey, area before moving to Manhattan at the age of 18, sharing an apartment in the city's SoHo neighborhood with his older sister. Roberto Monticello, a former SoHo resident who says he knew Hernandez in New York at the time of Etan's disappearance, described him as a "very strange guy." Hernandez has since been charged with second degree murder and is currently awaiting trial.
