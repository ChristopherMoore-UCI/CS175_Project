-- FIFA president Sepp Blatter has denied reports that he plans to hand over power to UEFA chief Michel Platini before the end of his final four-year tenure as the head of world football's governing body. Former France international Platini was voted in for a second term as head of European football's ruling body in March, and also serves as a FIFA vice-president. "The existence of a reported 'deal' between me and Michel Platini for the FIFA Presidency is pure nonsense," Blatter wrote on his official account on social networking site Twitter. " It has been a troubled 12 months for FIFA, with officials Amos Adamu and Reynald Temarii both receiving bans from the organization in November 2010. Bin Hammam, who was Asian president when Qatar was awarded the 2022 tournament, was then suspended in May and subsequently handed a lifetime ban from football for allegedly offering bribes in exchange for support in June's presidential ballot.
