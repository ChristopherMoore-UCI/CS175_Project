The chain-reaction crash happened shortly after noon on a ramp from Embankment Road West to Charles Street Circle, Massachusetts State Police Trooper Thomas Murphy said. -- Five people suffered minor injuries Friday when a duck boat crashed into several other vehicles in downtown Boston, Massachusetts. Cindy Brown, general manager of Boston Duck Tours, said a piece of fallen equipment caused the crash. Duck boats are amphibious vehicles often used for tours on land or water. "A computer box fell off and become lodged under the brake" pedal, Brown said.
