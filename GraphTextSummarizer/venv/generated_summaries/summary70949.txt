Cameron: 'Strong case' for Syria action Asked about the possibility of a change of approach to Syria, Cameron said the situation there was "more complicated" than in Iraq and that he was not going to change strategy right now. The government insists such action is legal because Iraq's government has requested international help to tackle the Sunni extremist group, which has overrun vast swathes of Iraq and Syria and massacred religious minorities and Shia Muslims. "ISIS needs to be destroyed in Syria as well as Iraq Cameron made that point again Friday, saying there was "no question" of the legality of action given the request by Iraq's leaders and the broad international backing for the campaign against ISIS. " British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond told CNN before the vote he was confident the MPs would approve Britain's participation in the Iraq air campaign against ISIS, but "there will be assurances that they want to receive."
