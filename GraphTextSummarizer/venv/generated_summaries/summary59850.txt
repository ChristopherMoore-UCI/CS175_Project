It said Mercedes would miss out on a boardroom place despite its large investment as an engine manufacturer in the past two decades, while rival teams Red Bull, Ferrari and McLaren would all be given representation by F1 chief Bernie Ecclestone. The German marque has won only one race since returning to the elite division of motorsport in 2010 after an absence of half a century away, but Rosberg has hopes of emulating the 1954-55 world championship successes of legendary racer Juan Manuel Fangio. And with no clear favorite yet to emerge, Mercedes driver Nico Rosberg says his team is in a strong position to finally end a long title wait. " Rosberg's veteran teammate Michael Schumacher has blamed F1's sole tire supplier Pirelli for the unpredictable results in 2012, but the younger German is keen to see the positives in an open season and said the difficult conditions at last month's Bahrain Grand Prix were a great learning experience. "Before China we were really struggling in races and we worked hard and improved the car, modified the set up quite a lot with the car," Rosberg told CNN ahead of this weekend's Spanish Grand Prix.
