U.S. President Barack Obama and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi are pals, if you haven't heard. During a press conference, Obama remarked that Modi was greeted like a "Bollywood star" when he visited New York's Madison Square Garden last year. Obama and Modi, punctuating their bilateral talks, sauntered side by side through the formal gardens at Hyderabad House, a stately 1920s home that now acts as a ceremonial venue. Here's a highlight reel of social media's favorite Obama and Modi broments so far: In case anyone doubted the deep bond between Obama and Modi (and how could they?), Air Force One's arrival on Sunday put any questions to rest. Modi showed up on the tarmac to be the first to greet Obama in India.
