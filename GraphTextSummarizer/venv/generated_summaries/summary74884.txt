Amnesty International identified land grabs and forced evictions as a major human rights issue facing China's leadership, saying the increasing volume of lawless forced evictions constitutes a breach of China's human rights obligations "on an enormous scale." -- The death of a four-year-old girl run over by a bulldozer in rural China has triggered outrage on Chinese social media, rekindling anger over the issue of forced evictions. "There are so many people killed or disabled because of land grabs in China, and (the officials) usually resolve these things with little compensation," wrote somebody using the handle @yongbao_ai on the popular micro-blogging service Sina Weibo. The state-run China Daily reported that the girl's grandmother, Chen Saijiao, of Linqian village, had attempted to stop a bulldozer she spotted pushing mud on one of her fields. Zhangpu County publicity department issued a statement Wednesday saying workers building a path near Chen's fields had mistakenly pushed mud onto one of her fields.
