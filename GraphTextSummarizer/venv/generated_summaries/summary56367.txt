"If no one finds new antibiotics for common infections, what will happen is we will go back to the pre-antibiotic age in which a simple cut could turn into an infection that becomes deadly," said Marcel Jaspars. Jaspars is the founder of the PharmaSea project, an EU-funded initiative to bring research groups together around the world in search of new antibiotics. "In the past, bacteria and fungi have been the main sources for new antibiotics," Jaspars explained. They are part of Jaspars' PharmaSea team, and they have identified the icy waters of the Norwegian Arctic as a potential breeding ground of new bacteria. "What was once common treatments are no longer treatable by using standard antibiotics," Jaspars said.
