But then, last week, it had a massive uptick in popularity when, for several hours, a collection of French Girls images somehow managed to climb to the very top of the front page of Reddit. Now, the basic idea of French Girls is that users anonymously post selfies and then other users draw them from within the app. French Girls co-founder, 29-year-old Adam Ceresko, told me, "The day-over-day growth in just the past few days has been astonishing, and it's not slowing down. " Taking it a step further, now there's even a portrait-sketching mobile app called French Girls that has also clearly borrowed from "Titanic." When I first learned of French Girls and downloaded it, I immediately served up a selfie and eagerly awaited someone turning me into art.
