In an interview with CNN this week, Abobaker provided a detailed account of how he, Sotloff and three armed guards were abducted in Syria by ISIS fighters in August 2013, but since then, never once did U.S. officials try to interview Abobaker about his first-hand experience with ISIS and its captivity of Sotloff. American journalist Steven Sotloff began his last journey into Syria with a surprise gift for his fixer, Yosef Abobaker. Abobaker blamed a guard on the Turkey-Syria border for possibly betraying Sotloff's whereabouts to an ISIS contact. Conscious of security, he didn't use his car that day and instead borrowed one, he said Their harrowing abduction by ISIS occurred just 20 minutes after Sotloff, Abobaker and his relatives as aides entered Syria, on August 4, 2013, Abobaker said.
