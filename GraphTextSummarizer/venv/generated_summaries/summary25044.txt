Ghana, the only team from Africa to reach the knockout stage, went ahead in first half stoppage time as midfielder Sulley Muntari scored with a superb long-range strike. But Ghana were left to rue a missed penalty in the last minute of extra time on Friday night which denied them the honor of becoming the first African team to reach the semifinals. Both teams had opportunities to claim victory in normal time but the match was petering out in extra time until the cruel last-gasp drama. The penalty was awarded after Ghana's Dominic Adiyiah had his first shot blocked on the line by Luis Suarez and his follow up effort was kept out out by the Uruguayan striker's hand. It meant a red card for Suarez, but Asamoah Gyan's spotkick hit the crossbar to stun Ghana and their supporters in Johannesburg's Soccer City.
