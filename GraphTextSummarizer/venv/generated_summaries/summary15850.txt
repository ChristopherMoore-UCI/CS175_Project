While the fully stocked bar is the main attraction, popular foods like fried Oreos and waffle fry nachos leave customers raving. Instead, visit one of these wacky restaurants for unique dining experiences that put good fun, fantasy and more on the menu. Ellen's Stardust Diner, New York Musical theater fans, 1950s throwback fans and general food fans alike flock to this one-of-a-kind Broadway dining experience that blurs the line between dinner and entertainment. The restaurant's cuisine rotates every couple of months to serve foods from a hot spot with which the United States is in conflict. The Stinking Rose's walls are adorned with animated garlic characters, and the restaurant is filled with garlic-themed collectibles.
