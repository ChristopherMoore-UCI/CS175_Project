A collective gasp as Louisiana town braces for flood The plan is to let out water from as many as one-fourth of the spillway's 125 bays to spare the Louisiana cities of Baton Rouge and New Orleans from severe flooding, Corps spokesman Ricky Boyett has said. But it maystill affect nearly 4,000 people who live along the river, as it sends water toward homes and farmland in the Atchafalaya Basin, according to Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal. While the spillways will divert water away from Louisiana cities, low-lying central parts of the state will be flooded. "The river at Baton Rouge through New Orleans will crest sooner than upstream locations due to Morganza spillway operations," said the latest forecast, issued Saturday. The weather service said the river was also cresting Sunday in New Orleans and Reserve, Louisiana, because of the spillway operations.
