Star performers in South Africa, Werder Bremen's Mesut Ozil and Stuttgart's Sami Khedira may have been snapped up by Real Madrid but with the likes of Thomas Muller and Arjen Robben still at Bayern Munich and Spain legend Raul signing for Schalke, the race for the Bundesliga title could be the closest yet. This season, Van Gaal's side will be considered favourites but Felix Magath, who won the championship twice with Bayern and once with Wolfsburg, will be looking to repeat that feat as Schalke coach. Raul and Metzelder's arrival at Schalke combined with the return of Jermaine Jones from long-term injury could help Felix Magath close the gap (just five points last term) on title favourites Bayern. -- The 48th season of the Bundesliga will commence this week with champions Bayern Munich looking to defend their title against Steve McClaren's Wolfsburg. The likes of Schalke, Wolfsburg, Werder Bremen, Hamburg and Bayer Leverkusen all stand a chance of snatching the crown from Bayern -- a club nicknamed 'FC Hollywood' because of its reputation for big-name stars and high-octane drama.
