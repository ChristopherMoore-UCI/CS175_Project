It said Turkish Airlines, Air Malta, Alitalia, Austrian and Egypt Air "are operating flights but these are all full at present." Air Malta said a Malta-bound flight finally left Tripoli International Airport after it had been delayed because of heavy congestion there. The French Foreign Ministry said that it had sent three planes to Libya to help repatriate French citizens and that its embassy in Tripoli was helping to get citizens to the airport. The U.S. State Department was not able to land charter aircraft in Tripoli to fly out U.S. citizens because Libyan authorities did not give permission for those aircraft to land, said a senior administration official not authorized to speak for attribution. Libya's official Jana news agency reported that airport authorities said Libyan airspace was open to civilian aviation and was operating normally, contrary to the rumors broadcast by "conspiring media channels." One Air Malta official -- who declined to be identified in keeping with company policy -- said thousands were waiting at Tripoli's airport for a flight out.
