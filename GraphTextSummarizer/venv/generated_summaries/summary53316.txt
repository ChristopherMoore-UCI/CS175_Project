After months of rumors, it's finally official: Max Weinberg won't be going with Conan O'Brien to Conan's new show on TBS. " Weinberg was Conan's bandleader from the very beginning of "Late Night With Conan O'Brien" in 1993, though he would take frequent breaks after Springsteen reunited with the E Street Band in 1999. "But whatever, they had some good years, and Conan gave Max credit for keeping the show on the air for the first two years. " E Street Band guitarist Steve Van Zandt tells Rolling Stone that he's not sure what caused the split. "I don't know why Max and Conan aren't together anymore," he says.
