-- Actor Andrew Koenig, who had been missing since February 14, committed suicide, his father told reporters after his son's body was found Thursday in a park in Vancouver, British Columbia. Andrew Koenig's mother, Judy Koenig, said people who are depressed "don't realize there is help and they need help." Koenig, 41, was reported missing by his parents after he did not board a flight to Los Angeles from Vancouver last week. She said they should "connect with each other if there's something that's bothering you." Andrew Koenig had many people who loved him, but "in his pain, he didn't realize it was available to him," she said. The body of the former "Growing Pains" star was found by several friends who conducted their own search of Stanley Park, where Andrew Koenig liked to walk, his father said.
