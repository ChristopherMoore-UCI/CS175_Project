The Collective has a new 170,000 sq ft project in the works in London's Wilesden Junction area that will include common facilities like spas, libraries, secret garden rooms, discos, laundrettes and private dining rooms which people can hire out when they have dinner parties. With space tight and increasingly expensive, some are predicting micro-living -- residency in compact homes and apartments strategically designed to maximize usable space -- could become a common theme in the coming years. "I think it is a new, more permanent approach to living, especially in city centers, because there's only a finite amount of space so people can't build more." According to Smithers, shaving off excess space in new-build properties can squeeze more people in while still providing all the necessary amenities of city living -- although Pocket would argue that their 38 square meter properties (409 square feet) are perfectly proportioned. Pocket is popular with local authorities for providing living space for workers near to council offices while the Collective is in talks with KPMG to house its graduate workers.
