Pictures of the burned intensive care unit, published Tuesday in the Romanian newspaper Adevarul, showed a burned incubator, a blackened room, and equipment that had melted and was singed. The Romanian press was critical Tuesday of the staff's response, saying it showed the weakness of the Romanian health care system. Staff also failed to evacuate any babies in the five minutes between the time they placed the emergency call and firefighters got to the burning intensive care unit, fire department spokeswoman Anca Onofrei said. Dr. Gheorghe Burnei, a renowned surgeon with the Children's Hospital Marie Curie in Bucharest, told Realitatea TV that due to the poor Romanian health care system, this kind of tragedy could happen again at any time. The fire at Giulesti Maternity Hospital in the capital, Bucharest, began Monday after an electrical cable in the air conditioning system caught fire behind a wooden closet in the intensive care unit, according to prosecutors' preliminary conclusions.
