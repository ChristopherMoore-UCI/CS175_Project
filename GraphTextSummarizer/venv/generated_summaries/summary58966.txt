For the past 17 years, McRae and her colleagues at the ICSC have been spreading the message of urban sustainability at home and overseas sharing ideas and innovations with cities, regions and associations in Asia, Africa and Europe. McRae has been impressed with what U.S. cities Portland and Chicago have accomplished and praises Europeans being a leaders in tackling greenhouse gas emissions and energy conservation. Unprecedented levels of urban migration in recent decades coupled with the challenges presented by climate change are threatening to create a perfect storm for city planners, design engineers and architects. Only time -- and an enormous effort on the part of everyone -- will tell if cities can survive the twin assault of humans and climate change. The same sustainability rules apply to cities wherever they are, according to McRae.
