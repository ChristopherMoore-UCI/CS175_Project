More recently, an attack on a convoy in southern Yemen, believed to have been carried out by drones, killed several al Qaeda operatives but al-Awlaki again escaped injury. -- The death of Anwar al-Awlaki deprives al Qaeda of a leading propagandist and an inspirational figure to jihadists the world over. His calm eloquence and fluent English turned al-Awlaki into a YouTube phenomenon, and his emergence as the ideological guide of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP, put him at the heart of one of the most dangerous terror groups on earth. As he became more prominent -- and more closely associated with the operational side of al Qaeda -- al-Awlaki escaped at least two attempts to kill him. Internet communications presented as evidence during the British trial of Karim revealed al-Awlaki to be playing a key key role in handling jihadist volunteers arriving in Yemen and the key driver behind its ambition to attack the West.
