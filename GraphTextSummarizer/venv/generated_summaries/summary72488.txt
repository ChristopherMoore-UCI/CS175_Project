Authorities found him in his bed at the Roosevelt Hotel, where he lived, about 7 p.m. Pacific Time (10 p.m. ET), said Los Angeles Police Officer Jason Lee. -- Johnny Grant, Hollywood's honorary mayor, was found dead Wednesday night, Los Angeles police said. Grant last conversed with his business manager Wednesday afternoon and said he was feeling "lousy," said Jim Harper, who had managed Grant for 60 years. Grant was chair of the committee that selected stars for the Hollywood Walk of Fame and was a familiar face in the foreground when celebrities immortalized their handprints in cement outside the Grauman's Chinese Theatre. A radio personality and television producer, Grant was best known as the honorary mayor of Tinseltown.
