Behind this success stands Maithili Ahluwalia, a former strategy consultant-turned-fashion-entrepreneur, who after a stint in a New York firm decided to return to her native Mumbai and follow her passion for design. The Bungalow Eight concept store has built a cult following since its inception in 2003, with its finely made kaftans and home d√©cor attracting fans such as Madonna, Hilary Swank and Maggie Gyllenhaal, as well as Bollywood royalty. Ahluwalia doesn't regret the years she spent fine tuning commercial sense, and says they served her well when she set up her own enterprise: "I think it gave me critical business tools, and even though I don't think that I realized the value of them back then, I think today I really appreciate it." In the heart of Mumbai's historic quarter, a luxury emporium stocked with the finest India-inspired fashion and furnishings is putting the country on the global design map. Mixing global and local Ahluwalia, who was raised in Mumbai but went to school in Singapore and university in the U.S., wanted to blend her international sensibility with the best of India's design.
