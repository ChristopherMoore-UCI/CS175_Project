The statement continued, "The Perez Matos family is absolutely convinced that Carlos Andres Perez belongs now to Venezuela, and all the Venezuelan people." Perez, 88, served two terms as president of the South American country, the first from 1974 to 1979 and again from 1989 to 1993. In a statement, Perez's longtime partner, Cecilias Matos, said her family would not stand in the way of a Venezuelan final resting place for the ex-president. During his final term, he survived a coup attempt led by Hugo Chavez, who spent two years in prison but later amassed support among millions of poor people angry about corruption and became Venezuela's president. Blanca Perez, the former president's wife in Venezuela, asked for the injunction. "At the present time in Venezuela, love should be lavished to it and its great men," the Matos family said in the statement.
