" CNN exclusive: ISIS fighter says U.S. airstrikes aren't effective Those remarks echoed Obama's own statement from early August, when he told reporters "intelligence estimates" hadn't accurately predicted ISIS' advances through Iraq and Syria. He cited his director of national intelligence James Clapper, who told the Washington Post in mid-September the U.S. "underestimated ISIL [the government's name for ISIS] and overestimated the fighting capability of the Iraqi army. "[Al Qaeda in Iraq/ISIL] probably will attempt to take territory in Iraq and Syria to exhibit its strength in 2014, as demonstrated recently in Ramadi and Fallujah, and the group's ability to concurrently maintain multiple safe havens in Syria," Mike Flynn wrote in prepared testimony for the Senate Armed Services Committee. In remarks and testimony, however, U.S. officials have been warning of ISIS' rise going back more than a year -- while at the same time warning of the limited intelligence-gathering capacity inside the countries where ISIS was expanding. "The way that I would describe it is that everybody did; that everybody was surprised to see the rapid advance that ISIL was able to make from Syria across the Iraqi border and to be able to take over such large swaths of territory in Iraq did come as a surprise," Earnest said.
