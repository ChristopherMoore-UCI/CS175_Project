Co-founder Kelly Yim -- a former actuary with a major bank -- left her job to devise a system that would benefit charities, creative projects and social enterprise projects. Other projects include work with abandoned animals and medical projects in China. "It takes a lot of perseverance to get corporations to invest in this type of creative project -- it'll at least take a year to educate them," Yim said, adding that the group have now set their sites on China as its next frontier and is already investigating a tie-up with the mainland digital giant Sina Weibo. "We want to rally supporters to share interesting stories on creative projects that carry a sponsor's logo. "What we do is match-make creative projects with corporates," explained Yim.
