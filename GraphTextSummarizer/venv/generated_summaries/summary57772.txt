" During three bouts of looting between the time Brown was shot in the summer of 2014 and November's grand jury decision, Lalani estimates the business sustained about $300,000 in damages and losses. Surveillance video released by the St. Louis County Police Department on Wednesday shows looters at the Dellwood Market, just outside Ferguson, Missouri, following the November 24 grand jury decision not to indict Officer Darren Wilson in the August death of teenager Michael Brown. A wave of looters -- at least 180, according to St. Louis County police -- can be seen in the video pouring into the small business. " The surveillance video released by police only shows about five minutes of what happened that November night but, Lalani said, the looting started about 11 p.m. and continued until about 6 a.m. Of some 2,000 bottles of liquor on the shelves, Lalani said, only about 40 remained that November morning.
