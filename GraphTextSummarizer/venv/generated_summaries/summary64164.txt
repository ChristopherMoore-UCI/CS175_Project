-- A man who allegedly threatened to decapitate Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii appeared in court Friday in San Diego and was ordered to remain in jail for now. The FBI and the U.S. Capitol Police said Thursday that Sherbow's threats were "deemed credible." Sherbow, 43, was arrested by Mexican law enforcement officers in Tijuana on Wednesday. The message said in part, "I, Aniruddha Sherbow, with the Divine as my witness, do hereby solemnly vow to find Tulsi Gabbard, wheresover she may be, and to sever her head from her body." An affidavit said that Gabbard had been getting harassing messages from Sherbow since 2011 and identified his voice as the caller. On August 3 Sherbow allegedly sent an e-mail to the FBI and some unnamed media outlets and identified himself by name, according to the affidavit.
