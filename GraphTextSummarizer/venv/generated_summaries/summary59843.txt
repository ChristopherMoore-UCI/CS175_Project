The man in charge Dmitry Chernyshenko told me that the Olympics would be "one of the brightest moments in the history of modern Russia." " A very overused, but very apt quote for my take on Sochi following my first visit to the Russian host city of next year's Winter Olympics. The Rosa Khutor alpine center, Sanki sliding center and Laura cross country and biathlon center have all held test events of their own with the structures firmly in place. But from what we've seen on our first trip here organizers are doing all they can to make sure this Black Sea resort does the same as it plays host to the 2014 Winter Olympics. All 10 of them have been newly built -- and they don't just look great, they've all successfully held a number of high profile test events already.
