Tsarnaev's lawyer is known for representing high-profile clients in death penalty cases. In a 2013 Boston Globe poll, 57% of Boston respondents supported a life sentence for Tsarnaev. "I prefer the death penalty, because I prefer that people know that if you terrorize our country, you're going to be put to death," he said last year. Experts are split on how the location could influence whether Tsarnaev is sentenced to death. When federal prosecutors announced last year that U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder had decided to seek the death penalty against Tsarnaev, a number of victims and their family members said it was a step in the right direction.
