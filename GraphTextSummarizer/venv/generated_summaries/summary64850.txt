Remota Hotel, Puerto Natales, Chile Designed by Chilean architect Germ√°n del Sol, Remota's rooms feature handmade modern furniture, much of it built on-site using recovered wood. Fishing, hiking, picnicking, golf, and spa access are available either on-site or nearby. Spa packages like the Detox Cleanse promise weight loss and improved heart health, but just unplugging in such a tranquil setting will do wonders for your mental health. With desert horseback excursions (no cell phones allowed), day camp for the little ones, and spa treatments for the adults, you won't even think about your friends' status updates. The lack of televisions encourages guests to tune in to unobstructed views of the sky, the expansive wild grass--covered Patagonian landscape, and looming glaciers.
