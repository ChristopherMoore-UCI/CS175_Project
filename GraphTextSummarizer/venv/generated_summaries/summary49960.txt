We also know that 49 senators voted against the amendment saying climate change is, in fact, caused by human emissions of greenhouse gases. They're the climate scientists, who have been saying for years that the climate is changing, that human emissions of greenhouse gases are the driving cause, and that we need to act urgently to cut emissions. "Climate is changing, and climate has always changed, and always will, there's archaeological evidence of that, there's biblical evidence of that," Inhofe said on the Senate floor, according to Bloomberg News and others. Forty-nine senators (full list here) voted on Wednesday against an amendment that said climate change is happening and, crucially, that it's actually-for-real caused by human emissions. Well, the Senate says climate change isn't a hoax.
