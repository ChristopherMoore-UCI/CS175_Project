The scientists said such harvesting could be combined with fuel cells to create a mobile electric generator fueled simply by hydrogen present in air. Flexible, transparent and able to conduct electricity even better than copper, the ground-breaking substance is set to revolutionize everything from smartphones and wearable technology to green technology and medicine. Solar cells made with graphene could offer 60% solar cell efficiency -- double the widely-regarded maximum efficiency of silicon cells. According to a study published in the journal Nature, graphene membranes could be used to sieve hydrogen gas from the atmosphere -- a development that could pave the way for electric generators powered by air. Fuel cells work by using oxygen and hydrogen as a fuel, converting the chemical energy produced by its input directly into electricity.
