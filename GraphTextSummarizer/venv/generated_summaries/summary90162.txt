The vote came the same day Pakistan's Supreme Court ordered Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani to face a contempt of court hearing this week, a notice related to the government's failure to reopen thousands of corruption cases against politicians and bureaucrats, including President Asif Ali Zardari. That party is part of the governing coalition led by Gilani's Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP). Two days earlier, the embattled Pakistani president, Zardari, met with Army Chief General Ashfaq Pervez Kayani -- a sign, some say, that shows tensions between Pakistan's civilian and military leadership are cooling down. "The army and the judiciary, they both have to protect democracy in Pakistan," Gilani said in a speech Monday night, after the vote. A second meeting between civilian and military leadership took place afterward, as Gilani convened the Cabinet's defense committee.
