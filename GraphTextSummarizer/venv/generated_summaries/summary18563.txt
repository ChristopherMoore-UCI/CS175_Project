In his absence, Bolton have continued to battle against relegation, but their hopes of avoiding the drop suffered a major setback as Tottenham won 4-1 with goals from Luka Modric, Rafael van der Vaart and a second half double from Emmanuel Adebayor. Victory left Tottenham in fourth spot in the battle for Champions League places, edging Newcastle on goal difference. Chelsea face Liverpool in the FA Cup final at Wembley Saturday and Bayern Munich in the final of the Champions League on May 19 in a bid for double silverware under interim manager Roberto di Matteo. Bolton equalized soon after the break as Nigel Reo Coker converted with a 51st minute strike, but Tottenham's lead was restored when Dutch international van der Vaart finished off a flowing move. Despite these upcoming big matches, they fielded a strong side at home to Newcastle, but were second best once Papiss Demba Cisse had put the visitors ahead with a stunning first half strike.
