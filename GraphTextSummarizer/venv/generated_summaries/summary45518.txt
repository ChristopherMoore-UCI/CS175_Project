Also Thursday, a 6.3-magnitude earthquake hit northern Chile, the opposite part of the country devastated by last week's quake. In an attempt to reduce confusion, Rosende read aloud the names of 279 Chileans who had been killed and identified by Thursday evening. Bachelet's visits to the hard-hit areas came a few hours after new tremors rocked parts of Chile early Thursday. The death toll in Chile was revised downward Thursday as authorities reviewed discrepancies in the reported number of dead in the Maule region. Bachelet toured devastated parts of central and southern Chile on Thursday, five days after the 8.8-magnitude earthquake.
