-- A convicted sex offender won a landmark legal ruling Friday that ordered Facebook to take down a page set up to monitor pedophiles in Northern Ireland. A Belfast High Court judge Friday ruled that some of the contents on the Facebook page -- 'Keeping Our Kids Safe From Predators' -- amounted to harassment of the man and risked infringing on his human rights. Facebook was given 72 hours to remove the page, and it was taken down by Friday afternoon. Facebook removed the man's photograph and corresponding comments, but lawyers for the company argued in court that it was neither necessary nor proportionate to remove a page used by 4,000 people. The judge added: "He has been punished by incarceration and he is subject to substantial daily restrictions on his lifestyle."
