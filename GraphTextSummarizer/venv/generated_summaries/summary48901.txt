Corbett, from Montrose, California, was charged Tuesday with felony counts of residential burglary, stalking and possession of a machine gun, according to Deputy District Attorney Wendy Segall. Corbett allegedly climbed a chain-link fence topped with barbed wire to enter Bullock's West Los Angeles property and enter her home at about 5 a.m. Sunday, according to Segall. -- A man arrested at Sandra Bullock's Los Angeles home allegedly was inside for more than an hour before police were called early Sunday. Los Angeles police said they were not called to the home until 6:30 a.m., suggesting that the alleged burglar was inside for more than an hour while the actress slept. Joshua James Corbett, 39, also owned an illegal machine gun, although he did not have it with him when he allegedly broke into the actress's home, a Los Angeles prosecutor said Tuesday.
