"It's a big victory for Mrs. Villegas," said Elliott Ozment, her attorney, about the Thursday ruling from U.S. District Judge William Haynes Jr. Ozment said his client -- a Mexican national -- will pursue a U-visa, a status that can be given to victims of crimes who are in the country illegally. According to court documents, Villegas was taken to Nashville General Hospital where she was placed on a gurney with her hands and feet shackled. -- An undocumented immigrant who was shackled during labor will be allowed to seek legal status under a special visa that can be conferred to crime victims, a federal judge ruled this week. Juana Villegas, who previously won $200,000 in a lawsuit against the Tennessee sheriff's office involved in the incident, was also awarded $1.1 million in lawyers' fees and other expenses. Early last year, Judge Haynes ruled in favor of Villegas, and after a three-day trial in August, the jury set the $200,000 award.
