Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu showed these plans in his address to the United Nations last year, calling on the world to stop Iran in its nuclear ambitions and President Ahmedinejad in his Holocaust denial. In Israel, there's an exhibit about the Holocaust; that name refers to the time during World War II when Nazis killed millions of people, including six million Jews. But he also focused on some of the areas, especially when it comes to the economy, where Republicans and Democrats don't see eye to eye. Last night, the Republican response was given by newly-elected Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell. These architectural plans for the Nazi concentration camp Auschwitz-Birkenau are now on display in Israel, chilling proof of the planning behind the Holocaust.
