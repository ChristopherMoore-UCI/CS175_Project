"We are glad to be the first sports federation of Iraq to host official international matches of national teams at home after the war," Saeed told the AFC Web site. Citing successful organization of friendly games against Palestine as an example of a safe and secure Iraq, the Asian Cup holders will now host home matches for the national team and club teams in the city of Arbil. Iraq fan Sadiq Alwohal believes it was a poignant moment in the history of the game in the country. He now runs the Football for Change program which, among other projects, has set up soccer schools in post-war Iraq. " The impact of the organization of the match though has not been lost on the Asian Football Confederation who have subsequently approved a proposal by Iraq Football Association president Hussein Saeed to lift the sanction imposed on it from hosting the international games.
