The S-300 system will help "ensure the security" of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, another breakaway territory in Georgia, Russian Air Force Commander Col. Alexander Zelin told journalists Wednesday, the Russian Air Force told CNN. Russia has deployed a surface-to-air missile system in the breakaway Georgian territory of Abkhazia, the Russian air force commander said Wednesday. The following day, Russian tanks, troops, and armored vehicles poured into both South Ossetia and Abkhazia and soon advanced into Georgian cities outside the rebel regions. Moscow has since recognized South Ossetia and Abkhazia as independent regions. It is also designed to protect the Russian military base in Abkhazia, a Russian-backed territory, he said.
