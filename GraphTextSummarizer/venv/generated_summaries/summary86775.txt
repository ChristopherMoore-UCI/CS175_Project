Watch Wells' rueful admission Â» Wells now says he never spoke with the judge about the Polanski case, as he had claimed in the documentary. David Wells told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Thursday that he "buttered up" his role in the Polanski case for the documentary crew. -- A retired prosecutor whose comments in a 2008 HBO documentary threatened to derail a 31-year-old sex case against film director Roman Polanski now says he lied. Rittenband, who died in 1993, had a fascination with celebrity cases, and was so publicity conscious that he directed his courtroom staff to keep a scrapbook of news clippings, according to court records. Polanski told the girl's mother he was on assignment for French Vogue, according to court records.
