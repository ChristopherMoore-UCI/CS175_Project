"My thoughts and prayers go out to her family, friends and colleagues during this time of mourning." Actors who worked on set with her, notably stars from "The Vampire Diaries," as well as crew members from TV shows "Glee," "Scandal" and "Downton Abbey," are among the hundreds who have shared messages of "RIP Sarah Jones." Jones and others were filming on train tracks at the time of the accident, according to a police report from the Wayne County Sheriff's Office. Last week's death of Sarah Elizabeth Jones rocked the local film community, with many asking who was to blame. "I am so terribly saddened by the news of the tragedy that took the young life of Sarah Elizabeth Jones on the film set," he wrote on his website Saturday.
