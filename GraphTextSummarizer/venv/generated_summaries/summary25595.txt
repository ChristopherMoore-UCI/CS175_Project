Over the past decade, Ferguson's population has changed from majority white to majority black. In the national election in November 2012, the study found, voter turnout between blacks (54%) and whites (55%) was virtually identical. In 2013, Ferguson had the highest number of warrants issued in the state, when you control for size: 3.6 pending arrest warrants per household and 2.2 arrest warrants on average per person. Between the class-action lawsuit and the Department of Justice's involvement, blacks in Ferguson should know the world is watching. Blacks were almost twice as likely to be searched as whites, even though searches of blacks were less likely than whites to result in contraband being found (21% vs. 34%).
