FDA restricts diabetes drug Avandia Results from RECORD "showed no elevated risk of heart attack or death in patients being treated with Avandia when compared to standard-of-care diabetes drugs," the FDA said in a statement Monday. That decision was based on studies showing an increased risk of serious heart problems in patients taking Avandia, most notably a 2007 analysis by Dr. Steven Nissen, a cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic, showing a 43% increase in heart attacks. The Food and Drug Administration said Monday that it was loosening restrictions on the controversial diabetes drug Avandia "to reflect new information regarding the cardiovascular risk."
