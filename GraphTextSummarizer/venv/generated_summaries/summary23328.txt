"We respect his place in the history of our sport," MLE Chairman George Shea told CNN. Takeru Kobayashi, who took home six consecutive titles from 2001 to 2006, will not be participating in the challenge this year because of a dispute with Major League Eating (MLE), the association's president, Richard Shea, said in a statement Monday. Currently ranked third, Kobayashi still holds world records for eating cow brains (17.7 pounds in 15 minutes), lobster rolls (41 in 15 minutes) and rice balls (20 pounds in 30 minutes). "Major League Eating has sought to arrive at an agreement with Kobayashi, but contract negotiations have reached an impasse." Chestnut, who weighs 230 pounds, is currently ranked No. 1 in competitive eating by the MLE.
