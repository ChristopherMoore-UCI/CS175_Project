Authorities said the defendants had considered several targets during a period of several months before settling on the bridge connecting Brecksville and Sagamore Hills in Ohio, not far from Cleveland. The men pleaded guilty in September to charges of conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction, attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction and use of an explosive device to destroy property used in interstate commerce. -- A self-described anarchist who calls himself "Cyco" got an 11-year prison sentence Tuesday for his role in a failed attempt to blow up an Ohio bridge. The men later admitted their roles in a plan to remotely detonate improvised devices containing C-4 explosives. The sentences were announced in federal court in Akron, Ohio.
