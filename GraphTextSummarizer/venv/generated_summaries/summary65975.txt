Covering around 1 million hectares of rainforest in eastern Ecuador's Amazon region, it is home to an abundance of plant and animal life. One of the biggest problems his team faced was spotting the plant life and animals in the deep forests, home to more than 20 threatened or near threatened species. While many species may be barely visible, the biggest unseen threat to the area's survival is from the rich resources of oil buried deep beneath the forest floor. The answer came in 2005 with motion-detecting and heat-sensing cameras, which have captured 28,000 images of many rare animals included curassows, ocelots and pumas. -- Yasuni National Park in Ecuador's Amazon region is thought of as the most biologically diverse forest in the world.
