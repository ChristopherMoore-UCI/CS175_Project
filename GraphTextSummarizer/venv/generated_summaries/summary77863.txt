The newly launched A330-800neo and the A330-900neo (enhanced versions of the A330-200 and  A330--300 models, respectively) will feature several new features, according to Airbus, not the least of which is a vast improvement in fuel efficiency. Airbus will launch the A330neo range, a revamped version of A330 airliner, the company announced Monday at the 2014 Farnborough International Airshow held in England. Rao says that customers will be please with wider seats (18 inches in economy) and an updated in-flight entertainment system that will allow passengers to watch movies in 3D. But not everyone is convinced by Airbus' claims of better fuel efficiency. People were telling us, your aircraft is fantastic, but would be even more fantastic if you could achieve a better level of fuel burn," Fabrice Br√©gier, president and CEO of Airbus, told CNN.
