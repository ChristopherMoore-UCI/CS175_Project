Hiring private companies to provide launch services is a new way of doing business for NASA, one that should be encouraged and continued. The reliability figures for old standby rockets makes it seem that way, but new products have bugs to be worked out. If low Earth orbit launches can be taken care of by the private sector, government funding to NASA can be used in pursuit of more ambitious goals, including human spaceflight. After all, this was only the fifth launch of an Antares rocket, and there is a higher risk of explosion with relatively new rockets than there is with those that have been used for many years, where the bugs have been worked out earlier, often through failures. Antares, as one of several new rockets being commercially developed, signals a new, important way of doing business in space that must be given the chance to mature.
