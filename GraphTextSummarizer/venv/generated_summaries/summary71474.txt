In a victory for whale conservationist group Sea Shepherd, Japan's government said Thursday it is considering canceling the whaling season. Animal rights groups, from Greenpeace to Sea Shepherd, and the governments of Australia and New Zealand, have publicly condemned Japan's hunts. Japan annually hunts whales, despite a worldwide moratorium on whaling, under the auspices it is conducting scientific research. "In response to interference conducted by Sea Shepherd, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries has temporarily halted the whaling hunt in the Antarctic Ocean, considering the crew's safety as a first priority," Hiroshi Kawamura, an official in charge of research whaling, said on Thursday. Sea Shepherd activists in 2005 started a renegade battle in the high seas against Japan's whalers.
