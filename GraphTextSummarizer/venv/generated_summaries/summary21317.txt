The police investigation will include ballistics evidence and analysis of surveillance cameras in the area, Weis said. Scott disclosed in early August that he had been subpoenaed to testify before a federal grand jury investigating how students were chosen for admission to some of Chicago's most elite public schools. "Mr. Scott was a strong advocate for education," Cook County Board President Todd Stroger said in a written statement. Scott's family had reported him missing about midnight, and his body was found about 3:20 a.m., Weis said. Scott's wife told police that it was "very unusual" for him not to be home by midnight, Weis said.
