According to Pavlos Tsimas, a Greek journalist and political commentator, Syriza has corralled not only those angry at austerity, but the youth who may be voting for the first time. Sunday's results were an "enormous success," said Eliana Voutsadakis, a 36-year old architect and Syriza supporter. But Sunday's result -- delivering nearly 27% support for Syriza -- has upended the Greek political landscape, splintering the duopoly which has controlled the country for almost four decades. Syriza can now try to establish themselves as a "true, center-left" party which is "young, radical and clean ... with no skeletons," Tsimas said. "Even if it didn't manage to take the first place, Syriza is now the most basic body representing the average individual, the progressive and the anti-memorandum [anti-bailout] portion of our population," Tsipras said.
