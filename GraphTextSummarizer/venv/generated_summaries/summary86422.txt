Sony's PlayStation Vita has now done exactly that, launching free downloadable Netflix, Twitter and Flickr apps in conjunction with the system's official debut Wednesday (though pre-orderers have had the system for a week now). CNN Tech: Hands-on with the new PlayStation Vita Netflix Netflix is probably the most useful of the apps in the Vita's initial batch. Writing tweets is relatively painless using the Vita's big on-screen keyboard, though I found myself often missing the space bar when I was typing quickly. It's also a bit odd that there's no option to download photos to your Vita to use as home screen wallpapers, though you can use the Vita's screenshot function to approximate this feature. Flickr Flickr rounds out the Vita's initial round of apps, with quite possibly the nicest interface of the bunch.
