The order came from Gen. William Fraser, commander of Air Combat Command, which is based at Langley Air Force Base in Virginia. The U.S. Air Force has grounded its entire F-22 Raptor fleet amidst continuing concern over how the fighter jet provides oxygen to the pilot, according Capt. Jennifer Faerrau, a spokesperson for the Air Force's Air Combat Command. The Air Force is looking at all the systems on this new-generation fighter jet, but one area of focus is the On-Board Oxygen Generating System (OBOGS), according to Ferrau. Flying above that altitude could cause a pilot to black out from lack of oxygen and lose control.
