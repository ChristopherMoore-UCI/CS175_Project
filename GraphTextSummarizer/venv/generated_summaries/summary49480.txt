"I don't really have any plans on going to see her." Anger is one of the many emotions Morgan Heist has gone through since she learned last week that Brenda Heist, the mother she last saw when she was 8, had mysteriously reappeared. Then last week Brenda Heist, 54, turned herself in to authorities in Key Largo, Florida, saying she had just walked away from her family because of stress. Lee Heist even became a suspect though he was eventually cleared. Lee Heist later remarried and said he will learn to forgive his former wife. -- Though her mother has suddenly reappeared after 11 years, don't expect a family reunion any time soon, Morgan Heist says.
