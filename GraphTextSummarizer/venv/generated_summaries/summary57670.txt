"I think Apple is a leading innovator among tech companies â€” but innovation comes from many companies, and it's easy to point to clear examples from many of Apple's competitors," Forrester analyst Charles Golvin told Wired. Reticle Research analyst Ross Rubin notes there are different kinds of innovation, and different companies excel in different areas. Because of Apple's history of innovation, many of us hold higher expectations for Apple than for its competitors. Golvin thinks Apple will continue to be a leader in innovation in the coming years, despite doubts about the company now that Steve Jobs is out of the picture. And then there are companies like Google, whose innovation is largely left to prototypes and concepts, things like Project Glass.
