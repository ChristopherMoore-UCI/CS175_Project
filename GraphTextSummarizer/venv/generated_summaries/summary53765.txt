According to Boston.com, it all started a few weeks ago, when Waring and his wife were shoveling deep snow from their yard in Manchester-by-the-Sea, a coastal suburb north of Boston. "We will not ship snow to any states in the northeast!" says Waring's website, ShipSnowYo.com. Most residents see the huge piles of snow choking their yards and sidewalks as a nuisance, but Waring saw an opportunity. For $89, self-styled entrepreneur Kyle Waring will ship you 6 pounds of Boston-area snow in an insulated Styrofoam box -- enough for 10 to 15 snowballs, he says. His website and social media accounts claim to have filled more than 133 orders for snow -- more than 30 on Tuesday alone, his busiest day yet.
