Gelman, who is unemployed and known to authorities mostly as a graffiti artist, was arrested about 9 a.m. Saturday, about 28 hours after he is alleged to have begun the spree spanning three New York boroughs, Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said Saturday. Soon after, the officers, with aid from off-duty New York police Detective Marcelo Razzo and an unnamed civilian nearby, wrestled Gelman to the ground, police said. Investigators believe Gelman then took the Lexus, drove about a mile away to the home of his ex-girlfriend and stabbed her mother, 56-year-old Anna Bulchenko, 11 times, at about 10:30 a.m. Kelly said Gelman had 10 previous arrests, mostly for drug charges and graffiti, plus one robbery charge. Gelman's former girlfriend found her mother dead on the floor when she returned home at about 4:15 p.m., police said.
