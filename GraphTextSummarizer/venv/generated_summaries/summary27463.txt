Marray, 31, is the first Briton since 1936 to win that title at Wimbledon, an omen perhaps for Andy Murray, who is attempting the same record in terms of years in the men's singles final against Roger Federer Sunday. -- Serena Williams fended off a stirring fightback from Agnieszka Radwanska to win her fifth Wimbledon singles title with a 6-1 5-7 6-2 victory Saturday. Williams spent almost a year on the sidelines, being struck by first injury then serious illness after being laid low by dangerous blood clots. "I have been unlucky here, playing in the wind and the rain, but I still played some great matches." Williams, who wins $1.78 million, is the first woman over 30 to win Wimbledon since Martina Navratilova in 1990 and has now matched the Wimbledon singles tally of her elder sister Venus. Williams has capped her steady return to the top with an emphatic performance on the grass courts, particularly since the quarterfinals where she dispatched reigning champion Petra Kvitova.
