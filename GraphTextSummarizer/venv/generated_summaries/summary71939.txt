The Vatican is warning people who plan to travel to the beatification of Pope John Paul II to look out for scammers claiming to sell tickets for the ceremony. "It is very important to make as clear as possible that no tickets are needed to attend the beatification of John Paul II," said monsignor Guido Marini, master of Papal Liturgical Celebrations, according to Vatican Radio. No tickets are required for the beatification Mass of Pope John Paul II, and any papal events that do require tickets are always free, the Vatican emphasized. Two million pilgrims are expected to flock to the Vatican for the special Mass, which will be presided over by Pope Benedict XVI and take place in St. Peter's Square on May 1 -- the first Sunday after Easter. Pope Benedict XVI dispensed with rules that normally impose a five-year waiting period before beatification can even start.)
