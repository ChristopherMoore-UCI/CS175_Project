Why can't we move to a time where "parent" is an umbrella term that encapsulates a lot of things: discipline, nurturing, sustenance, support and boundaries? For them, it's a given: dad just being a dad, and mom acting the way all the moms act. We cover all the bases in a way that might be in a more traditional family: mom does this, dad does that. There were so many portrayals of the perfect mom and dad on TV, you would think each person would grow up with the idea that this was the kind of mom or dad they wanted to become. There were no portrayals of gay parents.
