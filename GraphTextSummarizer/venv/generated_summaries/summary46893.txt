From playing dodge ball to jumping double Dutch and competing in rock-paper-scissors, adult men and women, from urban nests to rural towns, are reveling in games and activities once thought to be child's play. The childhood sport of dodge ball made a comeback four years ago in this bedroom community among adults in their 20s and 30s -- and even a few players who reached retirement. On the site, groups of adults organize scavenger hunts in Atlanta, Georgia, and action figure discussions in New York City. It's the classic game of dodge ball, but these aren't fifth-graders during PE class in Sparks, Nevada. With players who are trapped in a world of layoffs and job freezes, these adult leagues, contests and tournaments are the equivalent of sandbox time for children.
