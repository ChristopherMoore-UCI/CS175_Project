I know many people might ask: "Why should I care about issues beyond those featured on E!'s 'Chelsea Lately' or TMZ? Her wedding/divorce/possible reconciliation has dominated the cybersphere and Hollywood news shows: "Access Hollywood," "Inside Edition," E!, TMZ. Regardless if you agree or not with tea partiers' stand on political issues, they clearly have impacted U.S. policy. Wouldn't it be great if the universe consisted solely of keeping up with Kim, her sisters, mother and her stepfather, Bruce Jenner, who won an Olympic gold medal for the decathlon and who should also receive a medal for plastic surgery -- his face is as smooth and wrinkle-free as a honeydew melon. -- All the world's a stage for Kim Kardashian, and we are merely players.
