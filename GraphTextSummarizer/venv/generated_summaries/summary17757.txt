"He's wanted to hunt alligators for years," Troy Bielski said of his son, according to a statement from the Texas Parks & Wildlife Department. -- Braxton Bielski didn't have a 5-pound bass on his mind when he recently took his cane pole to a reservoir in south Texas. Braxton, a high school senior, went on his first alligator hunt at Choke Canyon Reservoir in the James E. Daughtrey Wildlife Management Area. Bielski, 18, caught an 800-pound, 14-foot, 3-inch specimen, the largest to be certified in Texas. Actually, the area is relatively new to gator hunting and most are left alone to live to old age.
