"As expected, due to adverse sea conditions, it was not possible to tow Gulliver back to land. Sara Outen tweeted a photo of herself late Saturday from a Japanese hospital where she is undergoing evaluation after the nation's coast guard rescued her when her boat became disabled. "Relieved to be back on land and with friends," Outen tweeted. She was rescued Friday, though rough waters made it impossible for the Japan coast guard to tow her boat Gulliver back to port.
