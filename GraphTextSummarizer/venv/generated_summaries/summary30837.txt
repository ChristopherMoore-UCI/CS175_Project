One reason is the same-old, same-old factor: that the Emmys tend to nominate the same shows (or the same types of shows) every year, says longtime awards watcher Tom O'Neil of Goldderby.com. Goldderby's O'Neil, for one, doesn't expect too many surprises: "Breaking Bad" for best drama, "Modern Family" for best comedy and the usual bunch of trophies for HBO -- which won 20 on Sunday at the Creative Arts Emmys, where many categories were presented. For example, he points out, this year there's only one new show among the 12 nominees for best drama and best comedy, and that's "House of Cards," which came from a non-network, Netflix. However, of the 12 shows nominated for best comedy and best drama, only three are on commercial broadcast networks. Nowadays, there's so much worthwhile programming out there that the Emmys, even when nominating good shows, feel safe and conservative -- and, therefore, somewhat dull.
