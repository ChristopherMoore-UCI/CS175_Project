Learning code is not about numbers and mathematics. Code is the stuff that makes computer programs work -- the list of commands that tells a word processor, a website, a video game, or an airplane navigation system what to do. That's all software is: lines of code, written by people. "Program or be programmed," became my mantra: If you are not a true user of digital technology, then you are likely being used by digital technology. This week, New York's Mayor Michael Bloomberg tweeted his intent to learn computer code by the end of the year.
