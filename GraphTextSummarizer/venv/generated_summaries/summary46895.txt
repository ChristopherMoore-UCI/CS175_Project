Rosekind said alternative safety measures are provided in quiet zones. The test will answer the question: "What could be seen, when, (and) where?" board member Mark Rosekind said. Rosekind said the south traffic light at the grade crossing turned green 21 seconds before the train's arrival at the crossing, as designed, to allow traffic time to clear the crossing. No anomalies have been found in the grade crossing warning system, Rosekind said. The train's emergency brakes were applied five seconds before impact, but it took the train 75 seconds to come to a complete stop, Rosekind said.
