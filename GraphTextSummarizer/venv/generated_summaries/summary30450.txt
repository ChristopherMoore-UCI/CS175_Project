-- NATO's goal of ending combat operations in Afghanistan and leaving security in local hands by the end of 2014 is realistic, British Prime Minister David Cameron said Tuesday on his second visit to the nation in 2010. " Cameron said British forces are ahead of schedule in training the Afghan army. " But Cameron added, "I think you can now see on the ground with 20,000 U.S. Marines, with some 10,000 U.K. forces, you really can see a density of forces that are able to deliver security to the vast majority of the people." Karzai, who said WikiLeaks documents have "some truth and some not so truth in them," replied in a less serious tone. In an October interview with CNN, he said he expects to be able to recommend to U.S. President Barack Obama that the number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan could start being reduced beginning in July 2011. "There are more markets open, more children going to school, local governors providing legitimate governance with the local population rejecting the brutal shadow (of the) Taliban regime," Cameron said during a joint news conference with Afghan President Hamid Karzai.
