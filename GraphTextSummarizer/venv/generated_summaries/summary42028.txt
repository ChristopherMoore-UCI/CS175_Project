A 17-year-old Virginia student has been charged with helping recruit for ISIS, federal law enforcement officials said Wednesday. Two men who have appeared in horrific ISIS propaganda videos could be from the United States or Canada, according to analysts. More than 20,000 foreigners have gone to fight for ISIS, the radical Islamist group that controls portions of Iraq and Syria, experts have told Congress. The other militant is the speaker in ISIS' first propaganda video out of Libya, which ends with the graphic beheading of more than a dozen Egyptian Christians. The adult is believed to have joined ISIS there, a separate law enforcement official said.
