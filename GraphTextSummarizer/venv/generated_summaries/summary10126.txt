Local politicians from the People First Party burned South Korean flags outside Taiwan's Sports Affairs Council in the capital on Thursday, the Taipei Times reported, in protest against World Taekwondo Federation secretary-general Yang Jin-suk. -- Taiwan has rallied behind a taekwondo athlete who was controversially disqualified at the Asian Games in China, setting up Internet support groups and even burning South Korean flags. The DPP criticized Taiwan's Sports Affairs Council -- which on Wednesday threatened to take the matter to an international court -- for failing to stand up for Yang, despite its members being present in China. The Asian Taekwondo Union released a statement accusing gold-medal hopeful Yang of a "shocking act of deception," claiming that she had illegally added two extra sensors to the heel of her socks to help score more points. " Fan pages backing Yang on social networking website Facebook received more than 200,000 responses, according to the Taipei-based Central News Agency.
