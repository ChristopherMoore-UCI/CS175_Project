-- A French Red Cross official abducted by militants in Yemen has been freed, according to a statement from the International Committee of the Red Cross. His return marks the end of many long, hard days, full of anxiety for him and his family, as well as for the team here in Yemen and for his friends," said Eric Marclay, who heads the ICRC operations in Yemen. Kidnappings are common in Yemen, which has been beset by political turbulence for more than a year. Benjamin Malbrancke had been kidnapped the evening of April 21 about 30 kilometers outside the western municipality of Hodeida, while traveling in a Red Cross vehicle. Protests led to the departure of President Ali Abdullah Saleh from office, and the government has battled Islamic militants.
