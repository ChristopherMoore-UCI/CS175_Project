More than 2.5 million people have watched Natalie grow to age 10 on the video, but age progression movies are almost as old as YouTube itself. Now, the video collection that resulted is compressed into one minute, 25 seconds, making it the YouTube era's equivalent of the pencil mark on the kitchen wall every time your child grows an inch -- but much, much cooler. Years ago, British filmmaker Michael Apted began following a group of 7-year-old children and reconnected with them every seven years for his "7 Up" film series. Just over a decade ago, a proud father began taking daily pictures of his newborn daughter. What makes Natalie's case remarkable -- and others less so -- is that you actually see her changing and growing over time in her video.
