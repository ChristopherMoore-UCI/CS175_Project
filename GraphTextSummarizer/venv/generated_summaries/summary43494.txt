-- A New York Police Department helicopter made an emergency landing in the water off Floyd Bennett Field in Brooklyn Wednesday afternoon, according to NYPD Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne. "They  were flying during our coverage of the presidential visit and  were on standby  for that and the United Nations General Assembly," said Browne, referring to President Barack Obama, in New York to speak at the United Nations. "About 30 to 35 yards from the   (landing) field, there was some kind of mechanical difficulty which  caused them  to make an emergency landing on the water, " Browne said, adding that inflatable pontoons on the aircraft deployed around its skids. Browne says there was a pilot and  co-pilot, a crew chief, a crew chief in training, and two scuba  divers on the helicopter. All got out safely but all six suffered minor back and neck injuries, according to Browne.
