Earlier in the day, band members Maria Alyokhina and Nadezhda Tolokonnikova were meeting with journalists when police detained them, according to Tolokonnikova's husband, Petr Verzilov. This month, other band members said Tolokonnikova and Alyokhina were no longer part of the group, which Verzilov said Tuesday was false. Tank called CNN from the police station, complaining about having to wait there with no information from police. "They were put to the floor and beaten and physical force was used to them when they refused to be questioned without the presence of their lawyer, who was on his way to the police department," Verzilov told reporters. "A survey in connection with the theft at the Hotel Adler is completed, there is no claim against those questioned," police said in a prepared statement.
