"The tennis anti-doping rules are likely to be changed in 2014 to say that, where a player refuses or fails to provide a sample (as Mr. Troicki did), the doping control officer should try to offer the player an opportunity to speak to the event supervisor or referee to confirm the player's responsibilities under the program," Stuart Miller, the ITF's anti-doping manager, told CNN. Troicki, who is taking his case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport next week, said in a statement released Tuesday that good friend and world Troicki was hit with the ban after he opted against giving a blood sample at the Monte Carlo Masters in April, citing poor health. Troicki said he was "confident" ahead of his hearing in Lausanne, Switzerland on October 9. " Troicki, a former world No. 12, said other players were "worried" in the wake of his suspension.
