Meanwhile, third-placed Napoli lost more ground on the top two after being held to a goalless draw by lowly Brescia at the San Paolo, with coach Walter Mazzarri sent to the stands in the first half for arguing with the referee. But the defending champions had to come from behind to claim the three points, Genoa leading 1-0 at the break after Rodrigo Palacio fired home following good work from Abdoulay Konko. In other matches, Adrian Mutu scored twice to help Fiorentina to a comfortable 3-0 win over Catania, while an injury time goal from Gaston Ramirez helped Bologna to a 2-2 draw against Cagliari. The Naples side are now eight points off the top and just two points ahead of fourth placed Lazio, who saw off Palermo 2-0 thanks to an early double from Giuseppe Sculli. Goran Pandev made it 4-1 in the 68th minute, after being set-up by Eto'o and Wesley Sneijder, and Yuto Nagatomo netted his first goal for the club to complete the scoring.
