All the time, Obama was feeling heat from immigration activists in his liberal political base  â€” so much so that he made a series of statements to the effect that he couldn't just lash out and fix immigration on his own. When immigration reform died in Congress this year, Obama, like Bush, asked his lawyers if he could change the system on his own. "President Obama has cemented his legacy of lawlessness and squandered what little credibility he had left," Boehner said. Reforming immigration was always on Obama's mind when he took office. In June 2013, when the Senate bill passed, administration insiders thought that the House would put a new law on Obama's desk to sign.
