Campbell's record includes arrests in 2002 for armed robbery, in 2005 for attempted assault on a woman, and in 2006 on a warrant for assault and battery, KOKI reported. Campbell was released from prison in late April after convictions in Oklahoma City for attempted robbery, attempted kidnapping and robbery, and robbery with a dangerous weapon, Jordan said. Jordan said investigators were checking with police in Oklahoma City to see whether Campbell was involved in additional crimes. Jordan said prosecutors were preparing formal charges in the cases -- some of which involved alleged sexual battery, others alleged rapes. The suspect, Demond Campbell, 30, was presented with charges related to seven sexual assaults even though he was in critical condition and unresponsive in a hospital since his car wreck Sunday, Tulsa Police Chief Chuck Jordan said Thursday.
