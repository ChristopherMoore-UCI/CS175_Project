While I cannot definitively say that Cosby is guilty of the crimes of which he is accused, the conversation about him epitomizes some of the most pernicious aspects of rape culture. In all likelihood Cosby saw no connection between this standup routine, which was wildly popular among fans and critics, and rape culture. Still, when such questions are raised, even by victims of sexual assault, we reinforce one of the dominant narratives of rape culture: "If you get raped, it's at least partially your own fault. Jokes about Spanish fly, pro-rape college chants and nearly universal axioms about "not dropping the soap" in prison are all part of a perverted cultural logic that minimizes the immorality, illegality, and trauma of rape. From fans to industry executives to his latest biographer, we all committed to denying the existence of consistent rape allegations throughout Cosby's career.
