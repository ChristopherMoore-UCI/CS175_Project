One man died and dozens more were injured Friday as Israeli forces and Palestinian demonstrators clashed in Gaza and the West Bank during protests to mark Land Day, Palestinian medical sources said. The director of the Palestinian Prisoner Association Club in Jerusalem, Naser Quos, said in a statement that 14 Palestinians, including two children, were arrested by Israeli security forces in East Jerusalem. Protesters hurled rocks as Israeli forces fired rubber bullets, stun grenades and tear gas at the Qalandia checkpoint, separating the West Bank from Jerusalem. Zawahreh said hundreds of Palestinians and international activists had marched toward the Bethlehem checkpoint, trying to walk to Jerusalem peacefully, when they were hit with tear gas, rubber bullets and stun grenades from Israeli forces. Protesters were also injured by Israeli fire in a demonstration near the town of Khan Yunis, in southern Gaza, when they attempted to cross the security fence, Palestinian medical sources said.
