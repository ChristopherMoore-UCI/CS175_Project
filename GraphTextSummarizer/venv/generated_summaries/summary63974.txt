The phone hacking accusations have reverberated through the top levels of British politics and journalism and prompted a parliamentary committee to issue damning criticism of Rupert Murdoch, whose News Corp. owned the News of the World through its UK subsidiary, News International. They were charged in May, along with Brooks' former driver, a security guard and members of News International security staff, with attempting to pervert the course of justice. Brooks, formerly chief executive of News of the World's parent company, News International, part of Murdoch's News Corp. empire, also faces a charge of perverting the course of justice. -- Two former News of the World editors, Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson, were told Wednesday they will face trial in September next year over claims of phone hacking at the now-defunct tabloid newspaper. Brooks, Coulson and fellow former News of the World employees Stuart Kuttner, Greg Miskiw, Ian Edmondson, Neville Thurlbeck and James Weatherup are accused of conspiring between October 3, 2000, and August 9, 2006, "to intercept communications in the course of their transmission, without lawful authority."
