I was called in front of all my peers, recognized for my hard work and awarded an opportunity to attend the Tony Stewart Smoke Show Fantasy Camp at Texas Motor Speedway in Fort Worth the following day. This was the fifth time Stewart has hosted his Smoke Show at Texas Motor Speedway, and in only five years, he has raised more than $1 million for Speedway Children's Charities. On the day of the Tony Stewart Smoke Show, I was able to drive a stock car around the track for a pair of 10-lap sessions as well as a three-lap heat session as a passenger with Stewart driving. Not only does it speak volumes to the character of Stewart as an individual, it goes to the generosity of people in the Dallas/Fort Worth area who donated that money for the charities. Currently, I serve as the public affairs chief for the 4th Sustainment Brigade in Fort Hood, Texas.
