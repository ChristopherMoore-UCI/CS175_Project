Peggy Fleming and Vonetta Flowers were taken to a hospital "as a precaution" after a van in the motorcade was involved in a minor accident, according to Biden spokesman Jay Carney. -- Two members of the U.S. Olympic delegation -- both gold medalists from previous Olympics -- suffered minor injuries Sunday in an accident as they were traveling in Vice President Joe Biden's motorcade, the White House said. Flowers earned gold in the 2002 Salt Lake City, Utah, Olympics in the two-person bobsled competition, according to the IOC. Neither Biden nor anyone else in the motorcade was involved in the incident, Carney said. She was the only American to place first during those games, according to the International Olympic Committee Web site.
