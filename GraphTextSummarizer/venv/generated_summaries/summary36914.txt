-- The three Pakistani cricket players at the center of a betting scandal have been summoned to meet their country's top cricket authorities in London, England, where the alleged fixing took place, team manager Yawar Saeed told CNN on Tuesday. CNN's Melissa Gray in London, England, and Samson Desta in Islamabad, Pakistan, contributed to this report. The alleged scandal came to light Sunday when a British tabloid newspaper reported that two Pakistan players deliberately bowled "no balls" -- fouls -- during their four-day series with England. Let's wait until the case is complete." England beat Pakistan in the four-day match at Lord's Cricket Ground, which ended Sunday afternoon, after the scandal broke. Federal investigators from Pakistan had been expected to arrive in England on Tuesday to look into the alleged scandal, but Pakistani Interior Minister Rehman Malik later said their plans changed.
