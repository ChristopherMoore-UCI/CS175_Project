The lawsuit argues that Long Island Power Authority and National Grid should have shut off power to their neighborhood, in the New York City borough of Queens, before the bad weather hit, as they did with Fire Island, just off the south shore of Long Island. Bloomberg wants to spend billions on storm, climate change "Had LIPA and National Grid acted responsibly in preparing for the storm, my clients would be living in their homes with all of their life's possessions, and these two communities would not look like a war zone," the plaintiffs' attorney, Keith Sullivan, said in a statement released Tuesday. Fueled by hurricane-force winds, the fire quickly spread from home to home, FDNY said in a press release in December. The fire, which destroyed 126 homes and damaged 22 in the Breezy Point neighborhood, began when rising sea water came into contact with the electrical system of a home around 8:30 p.m. on October 29, according to the Fire Department New York. Although the lawsuit does not seek a specific dollar amount, the damages to the area exceeded $80 million, and continue to rise since none of the 120 clients have been able to begin rebuilding, Sullivan said.
