The idea that schizophrenia is not one single disorder is not really new, says Dr. Charles Raison, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Arizona. "In the past, scientists had been looking for associations between individual genes and schizophrenia," co-author Dr. Dragan Svrakic said in the statement. The same could hold true for schizophrenia and other mental health conditions, Raison says. In other words, if study participant Bob had Gene Cluster X, he was 70% more likely to have schizophrenia than study participant Past studies done on twins and families have shown that about 80% of the risk for schizophrenia is inherited, the study authors say.
