Justices of the peace in Louisiana are elected, but the state's high court has jurisdiction over whether they can keep their jobs, Louisiana Supreme Court spokeswoman Valerie Willard said. If Bardwell were brought before the commission and it decided against him, recommended sanctions could include a public censure, suspension with or without pay, or removal. Despite a national uproar and a call by Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal for him to lose his license, Bardwell, 56, said he has no regrets. A state statute says justices of the peace may perform marriage ceremonies, but it does not require such officials to do so, Tammi Arender, a spokeswoman for the Louisiana attorney general, told CNN on Monday. The removal of embattled Justice of the Peace Keith Bardwell lies with the Louisiana Supreme Court.
