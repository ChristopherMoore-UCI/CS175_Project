"There was no criminal behavior detected during this investigation, however, the four officers' conduct was inexcusable and there is zero tolerance for this kind of behavior in the Fort Lauderdale Police Department," Chief Franklin Adderley told reporters. Three Florida police officers were fired and a fourth resigned after exchanging a series of racially offensive text messages and a video that portrayed President Barack Obama in a derogatory way, Fort Lauderdale police said. The men allegedly criticized co-workers, including African-Americans, making crude comments about their grammar, appearance and work ethic. The police department is implementing a mandatory "diversity class" for officers and a screening process for new hires,  said Adderley. "I am very disappointed, disgusted and shocked by this incident," Mayor Jack Seiler said.
