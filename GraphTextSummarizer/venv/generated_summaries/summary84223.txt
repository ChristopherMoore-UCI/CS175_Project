Loughner is accused of opening fire outside a Tucson supermarket where Giffords was meeting with constituents Saturday. Court documents released Sunday show that investigators found a letter from Giffords in a safe at the house where Loughner lived with his parents, thanking him for attending a 2007 event, similar to Saturday's meet-and-greet. -- Rep. Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona remained in critical but stable condition in a Tucson hospital Monday as her alleged would-be assassin made his first appearance in court. Sheriff Dupnik suggested Saturday night that "vitriolic rhetoric" in political debates could have deadly consequences. A law enforcement official said Loughner asked Giffords a question at the 2007 event and was unhappy with her response.
