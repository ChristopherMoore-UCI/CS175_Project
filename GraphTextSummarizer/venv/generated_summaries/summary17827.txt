Pettigrew's wife had also reported him missing, and deputies in Wake County had responded to the couple's Apex, North Carolina, home, authorities said. -- An autopsy has been completed on former Olympian and UNC track coach Antonio Pettigrew, but reports from the examination are pending and the cause of his death has not been released, the North Carolina Office of the Chief Medical Examiner said Wednesday. Pettigrew was in his fourth season at UNC, where he led the university's sprinters, hurdlers and relay teams, according to the UNC Athletics website. "Although we are still learning the circumstances, we are deeply saddened to learn of Antonio's death," UNC athletic director Dick Baddour said Tuesday in a statement on the website. The autopsy was completed Tuesday, said Sharon Artis of the medical examiner's office.
