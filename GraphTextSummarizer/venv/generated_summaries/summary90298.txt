The attack took place on Mount Chaambi, some 300 kilometers south of Tunis, the capital, President Moncef Marzouki said in a statement posted to his Facebook page. The slaying of Mohammed Al-Brahmi and the public's reaction were the latest bout of turmoil striking the North African country that had been seen as a poster child of stability after the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings. Last week, a Tunisian opposition leader was fatally shot outside his home, setting off protests in a nation still raw from the February assassination of a different politician who opposed the Islamist-led governing party. Marzouki blamed Islamic militants and extremists for the violence. -- Eight soldiers were killed in an ambush near the Algerian border, Tunisia's president said Monday.
