Fellow golfers Felipe Aguilar of Chile and Ricardo Gonzalez of Argentina are staying with Zanotti and have pulled out of the event, the Tour said. "The latest report from hospital is that all neurological tests have come back clear," the Tour's tournament director, Miguel Vidaor, told the European Tour's website. Entering Thursday, Zanotti was 27th in the Race to Dubai standings. In a rare occurrence, Paraguay's Fabrizio Zanotti was struck on the head and was taken to hospital as a "precaution," the European Tour said. Zanotti was attended to on site by a doctor and paramedic as a concerned Kaleka looked on before an ambulance transported him to hospital.
