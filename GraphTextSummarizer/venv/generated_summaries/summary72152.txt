But any claim that 32-year-old Zemir Begic's brutal killing had anything to do with this Ferguson uproar "is absolutely unfounded," St. Louis Mayor Francis Slay said Monday on Facebook. The St. Louis metropolitan area remains on edge, a week after a grand jury decided not to indict then-Ferguson police Officer Darren Wilson in the shooting death of unarmed teen Michael Brown. The killing of a 32-year-old man on the streets of St. Louis with a hammer was savage, random and senseless -- but it was not, that city's mayor said, related to what's been happening in nearby Ferguson, Missouri. The mayor made these comments after meeting with the family of Begic, who was beaten to death a hammer around 1:15 a.m. Sunday on a St. Louis street. "There is no evidence that this was a crime occasioned by the race or ethnicity of the victim," Slay wrote in reference to Begic, who was white.
