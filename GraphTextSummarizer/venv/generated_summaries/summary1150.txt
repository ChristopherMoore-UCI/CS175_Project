Over the decades that followed, as the movement against white rule in South Africa began to grow and unrest inside the country became increasingly violent, it became clear to the white government that they could no longer continue to govern without consulting the African National Congress and, in particular, Nelson Mandela. While not only about Nelson Mandela, this fascinating museum recreates what life was like for both black and white South Africans under apartheid. Mandela became president of South Africa in 1994, but he stood for only one term before stepping down and continuing to foster national reconciliation. After spending 27 years in prison, on his release Mandela pursued a policy of reconciliation between black and white in South Africa. Some have criticized Mandela for placing too much emphasis on reconciliation and not transforming the country enough, but the vast majority of South Africans revere his legacy and its meaning in the society they inhabit today.
