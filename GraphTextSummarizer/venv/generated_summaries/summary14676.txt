The "class-action status" of the case means that if you own any of these devices — first through fourth generation Nanos, second and third generation Touches, first through third generation Shuffles, a fifth generation classic iPod or the special edition U2 iPod — you're automatically included in the lawsuit. That's because Apple created an iPod firmware update not too long after the announcement of Harmony, which blocked it and other music services from uploading songs to the iPod. The website ipodlawsuit.com, which details the entire case, explains: "The lawsuit claims that Apple violated federal and state laws by issuing software updates in 2006 for its iPod that prevented iPods from playing songs not purchases on iTunes. It allowed users to play songs downloaded from the RealPlayer music store on Apple's iPod. But as any iPod user knows, songs must be loaded onto iTunes to be played on Apple's devices.
