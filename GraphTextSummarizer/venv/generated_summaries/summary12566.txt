The FBI said the group planned to kill Janssen and bury him at the apartment complex, which is near the federal penitentiary in Atlanta, according to CNN affiliate WXIA. The kidnappers sent demands to Janssen's family "for the benefit" of Kelvin Melton, an inmate at Polk Correctional Institution in Butner, North Carolina, according to an affidavit in support of a search warrant related to criminal complaints against the defendants. Thompson's apprehension marked the sixth arrest in the April 5 abduction of Frank Janssen from his home in Wake Forest, North Carolina. Janssen's daughter, Colleen Janssen, is an assistant district attorney in Wake County and had prosecuted Melton, officials said. Quantavious Thompson, 18, was arrested late Wednesday in Atlanta.
