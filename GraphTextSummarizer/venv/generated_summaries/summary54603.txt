Flea and the rest of Red Hot Chili Peppers will jump on to the stage, compliments of fellow performer Bruno Mars, at next month's Super Bowl halftime show. Michael Jackson's performance at Super Bowl XXVII in 1993 is credited with launching the tradition of blockbuster halftime shows. " Expectations for Super Bowl halftime performances are always high. Mars, a Grammy-winning pop singer, invited the Chili Peppers to join him for the Super Bowl XLVIII festivities on February 2 at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. He is nominated for multiple major categories at this year's show and will launch the second leg of his tour with his band The Hooligans this summer.
