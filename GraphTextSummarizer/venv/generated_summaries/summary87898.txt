Celtel has invested more than $750 million in Africa, as part of a goal to build and operate world-class networks that will keep pace technologically with networks in Europe and North America. In 1998 the company expanded its services to become a mobile telephony operator and now has a series of networks in 15 different African countries, under licenses that cover more than a third of the total population of the continent. The company was acquired by Mobile Telecommunications Company KSC (MTC) in 2005 and at the time, Celtel had 4,000 employees, of which 98% were African. The company began life in 1989 as MSI Cellular Investments, a telecommunications consultancy company based and operating in Africa. In January, 2004 the company changed its name to Celtel International.
