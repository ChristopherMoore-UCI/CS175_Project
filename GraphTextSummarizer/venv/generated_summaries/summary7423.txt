Several media outlets said Martin had left the Dolphins because of bullying, something Incognito denied on Twitter. The Sporting News takes a yearly poll of NFL players, and in 2009 they dubbed Incognito the dirtiest player in the league. Incognito said he didn't want to comment on media reports that he sent line-mate Jonathan Martin voice mails containing racial slurs and threats of physical violence. Richie Incognito, Jonathan Martin, and the NFL's future Cafeteria incident sparked departure Philbin said he met with Martin and also talked with members of his family before Sunday, and the second-year player didn't say anything about player misconduct.
