I would say a few people in Perugia, definitely," Edda Mellas said, referring to the central Italian city where Knox was tried for the 2007 killing of her British roommate Meredith Kercher. Knox, 23, was sentenced in December to 26 years in prison for Kercher's death at the villa the two shared in Perugia, the central Italian town where both were students. Evidence being retested includes a knife found in Sollecito's apartment with Knox's DNA on the handle and what Perugia prosecutors say is Kercher's DNA in a tiny groove on the blade. -- A libel case against the parents of Amanda Knox "feels very personal," the mother of the American student convicted of murder in Italy told CNN. The sample, however, was so small that forensic scientists investigating Kercher's murder were not able to double test it in accordance with international forensic science norms, which Knox's legal team says raises doubts about its validity.
