A police cruiser draped in black banners and topped with a rose sat in front of the Jupiter, Florida, police department Monday morning, paying testament to a 20-year department veteran killed Sunday while helping escort President Barack Obama through Palm Beach County. Jupiter Police Chief Frank Kitzerow said St. Laurent was transported to nearby St. Mary's Medical Center, where he died Sunday. Officer Bruce St. Laurent, 55, was traveling with the presidential motorcade around 4:45 p.m. Sunday southbound on Interstate 95 through West Palm Beach when he pulled his motorcycle onto an on ramp, so he could stop traffic from accessing the highway, according to a statement released Monday by Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Teri Barbera. Morris said motorcycle police often act as escorts and handle intersection control for motorcades. The statement said St. Laurent drove into the path of a 1994 Ford F150 driven by Susan Holloway, 56, of West Palm Beach, as she was accelerating to merge onto the interstate.
