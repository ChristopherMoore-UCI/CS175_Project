The attorney for former Dodgers owner Frank McCourt, meanwhile, countered by claiming Stow was drunk and aggressive at the time of the brawl that left Stow brain-damaged and disabled. -- The lawyer for Bryan Stow, the San Francisco Giants fan severely beaten at a Los Angeles Dodgers game in 2011, argued Thursday that the former owners of the Dodgers went cheap on safety, and that played a factor in his client's debilitating injuries. So went the opening remarks at a civil trial in which Stow is suing the Dodgers and claiming the team had faulty security measure and defective facilities that contributed to the attack. Stow, who uses a wheelchair and lives with his parents in Capitola, California, wasn't in the courtroom, located two miles from Dodgers Stadium. Stow's attorney's, Thomas Girardi, told a jury that McCourt had an irresponsible approach to fan safety.
