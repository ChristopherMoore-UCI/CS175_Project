In second place, Fox's frozen animation Ice Age Continental Drift gathered $13.3 million in its third weekend, lifting its domestic total to $114.8 million — the lowest domestic total ever for an Ice Age movie after 17 days (including the original, which had $116.9 million at the same point), though still quite strong. Step Up Revolution, Summit's $33 million sequel, finished the weekend in fourth place with $11.8 million — by far the lowest for a Step Up movie. Originally titled Neighborhood Watch, Fox was forced to change the film's title and make a marketing about-face in February following the shooting of Trayvon Martin by Florida neighborhood watch officer George Zimmerman. Those patrons issued The Watch a "C+" CinemaScore grade. Fox's other big release, The Watch, debuted in third place with an awful $13 million.
