Cohn's interest in heart surgery dates back to when he was a young boy reading articles about world-renowned heart surgeons Dr. Michael E. Debakey and Dr. Denton Cooley, who developed and played a role in the transplant of the first artificial heart in a human in 1969. Gastrointestinal bleeding and strokes are a high risk for patients on other heart assist devices, he says. Modeled after an Archimedes Screw, a machine that raises water to fill irrigation ditches, the continuous flow LVAD is a pump that helps failing hearts push additional blood through the body with a rapidly spinning impeller. Heart failure is the leading cause of death in men and women, killing more than 600,000 Americans every year. Michael Garippa, CEO of the first-ever FDA approved mechanical artificial heart, the Syncardia, says beating "up the blood in a blender" can activate internal bleeding in other organs.
