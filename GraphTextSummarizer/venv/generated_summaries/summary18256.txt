"Hadi made it clear that the Saleh regime is over and he is seeking to be looked at as a president for a nation and not for a political party," said Abdul Salam Mohammed, director of the Sanaa-based Abaad Strategic Center. The nation has been wracked by unrest, including protests against current President Ali Abdullah Saleh, since early last year, when pro-democratic uprisings spread across the Arab world. The vice president stressed there will be no red lines when it comes to solving Yemen's crises. In a large gathering with hundreds of senior government officials representing all political factions, Hadi said he is seeking a new direction for Yemen. In a move that surprised experts, Hadi did not mention Saleh in his speech.
