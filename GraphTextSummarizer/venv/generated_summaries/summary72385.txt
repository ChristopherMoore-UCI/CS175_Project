The number of people monitoring internet activity to prevent criticism of the government and social unrest has been a subject of discussion for years, said David Bandurski, editor of the University of Hong Kong's China Media Project. "China's biggest engineering project is not the Three Gorges dam but public opinion and Weibo has completely changed the game," Bandurski said. Using keyword searches, their job is to sift the millions of messages being posted on popular social media and microblogging sites such as Sina Weibo, regarded as China's equivalent to Twitter. Bandurski said that the resources China has invested in internet surveillance have increased rapidly since Sina Weibo's emergence in 2010. China has around two million people policing public opinion online, according to a state media report that sheds light on the country's secretive internet surveillance operations.
