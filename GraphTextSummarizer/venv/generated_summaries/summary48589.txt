Choice of route  A skier or snowboarder coming from behind must choose a route in such a way to not endanger skiers or snowboarders ahead. "We have, especially among children, almost 100 percent of skiers wearing helmets on Austrian ski slopes." There are an estimated 200 million skiers in the world, and in the U.S. (one of the few countries to keep reliable data on skiers and ski injuries) an estimated 55 million people ski. Respect for others  A skier or snowboarder must behave in such a way that does not endanger or prejudice others. Control of speed and skiing or snowboarding  A skier or snowboarder must move in control -- adapt speed and manner of skiing or snowboarding to personal ability and to the prevailing conditions of terrain, snow and weather as well as to the density of traffic.
