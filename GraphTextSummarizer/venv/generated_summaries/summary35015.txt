Preventing the spread of Ebola was a major topic of Thursday night's New Hampshire Senate debate, where Brown criticized incumbent Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen for relying on expert advice on how to contain the disease. -- New Hampshire Senate Candidate Scott Brown responded to news that a new case of Ebola has been diagnosed in New York City, calling for "common-sense prevention mechanisms" in a statement released by his campaign Friday. "My opponent and I aren't infectious disease experts," she said, "so we really need to rely on experts. "The way to stop mass infection is by swift and decisive action, including a travel band and quarantining health workers returning from countries where Ebola is prevalent," the release reads. In the debate, Brown repeatedly voiced support for a travel ban to blockade passengers from Ebola-infected African countries to enter the U.S., a strategy medical experts have said would be counterproductive.
