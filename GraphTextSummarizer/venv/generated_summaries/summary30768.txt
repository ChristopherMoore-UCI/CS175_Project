Lucy had become so close to human in most every way that she only found human men, not male chimpanzees, sexually attractive. She wanted human food, human interaction, and to be loved by, what she considered, one of her own kind. She took Lucy and other chimps that had been raised in captivity and lived with them on the island, teaching them skills they would need in the wild, like finding food and climbing trees. It wasn't until Janis stopped living on the island that Lucy was finally able to accept her new life and joined a troupe of chimps. Whenever Janis visited the island, Lucy was still affectionate, still used sign language, but thankfully, she always went back with the chimps into the forest.
