World No. 1 Roger Federer begins his bid for a record-equaling 17th Masters 1000 tournament victory against Ecuador's Nicolas Lapentti on Saturday, while third seed and defending champion Andy Murray takes on American Mardy Fish. The reward for Rochus is a third-round clash with Brazilian 27th seed Tomaz Bellucci, who defeated American James Blake 3-6 6-1 6-2. The Spanish fourth seed -- beaten in the semifinals at Indian Wells by Djokovic's conqueror and eventual champion Ivan Ljubicic -- will next play Argentine wildcard David Nalbandian, who overcame Serbian 30th seed Viktor Troicki 6-3 4-6 6-4. Second seed Caroline Wozniacki came from behind to defeat Bulgarian qualifier Tsvetana Pironkova 3-6 6-3 6-4 and set up a third-round tie with Russia's Maria Kirilenko. Second seed Djokovic, who had a first-round bye, was surprisingly beaten 6-2 6-7 (7-9) 6-4 by Belgian Olivier Rochus on Friday.
