The Associated Press said it will provide "respectful coverage" of the anniversary Saturday, "as we have since Day One of Newtown's tragedy." Many news organizations visited Newtown ahead of the anniversary to conduct reporting to televise and publish on Saturday. In the run-up to the anniversary, Newtown officials said they hoped the press would not descend on the small town, stirring debate about what reporters should and should not do. CNN said in a statement that while it "plans to cover the one-year anniversary across our networks and platforms, we are respecting the wishes of the families, and we are not reporting from Newtown on Saturday. Like the national networks, local television stations in Connecticut have said they will avoid using Newtown as a backdrop for live shots.
