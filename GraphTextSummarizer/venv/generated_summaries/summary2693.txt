The U.S. intelligence community has found no evidence to suggest North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is dead, a senior U.S. official said Friday following posts on China's version of Twitter that claimed Kim had been assassinated while in Beijing. U.S. intelligence officials have been looking into such rumors for more than a week, according to the official, who has direct knowledge of the latest U.S. analysis. Meanwhile, the official added, "there is no evidence of movement of North Korean forces or activity that you would associate with the turmoil of a calculated assassination. Kim Jong Il had ruled the reclusive nation since 1994. " Kim, who is believed to be in his late 20s, assumed the title of "supreme leader" after his father Kim Jong Il's death in December at the age of 69.
