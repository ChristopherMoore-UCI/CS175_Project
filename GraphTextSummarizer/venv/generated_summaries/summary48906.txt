"With all of the discussion about the lack of authority, of the perceived weakness of the office of director of national intelligence, I believe it already does have considerable authority, either explicit in the law... or implicit that can be exerted," Clapper said. Clapper, tapped by President Obama for the Director of National Intelligence job, will oversee the nation's 16 spy agencies. "He is mindful of the importance of independence from the Pentagon, he understands the DNI's responsibility to provide strategic intelligence to policymakers, and he knows that the job entails more than simple coordination." "General Clapper has excellent credentials, and the support of the White House and key intelligence leaders," Feinstein, D-California, said in a statement released after the vote. Acting Director of National Intelligence David Gompert said in a statement after the vote that Clapper was the right person for the job.
