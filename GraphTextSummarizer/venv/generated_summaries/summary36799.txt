Remembering Rebecca Wingo, Aurora victim How to help the victims of the Colorado massacre Driven by personal tragedy, man builds crosses for Aurora victims, thousands of others -- Alex Teves treasured Marvel and DC comics with their Spider-Man and Batman icons, and he was at his best in high school when he wrote about the superhero genre in English class. Alex Teves was a cooperative student with a streak for being fun and funny, says high school math instructor Francoise Dastous, who teaches the statistics class. "If you want to describe Alex in one word, he was just good," says his father, Tom Teves. It is the goodness of humanity that Teves wants the world to know and remember: the virtues of his son -- and the 11 others killed at a midnight premiere of the latest Batman movie, "The Dark Knight Rises," in a cinema in Aurora, Colorado.
