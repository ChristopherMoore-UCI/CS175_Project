-- India's scandal-tainted government has come under fresh attack from opposition parties after a leading newspaper ran a front-page report alleging that auditors had found that the awarding of coal fields to private companies had deprived the treasury of $211 billion. One of the country's most respected dailies, the Times of India cited what it said were the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG)'s draft estimates from the awarding of 155 coal blocks to some 100 firms without auction between 2004 and 2009. "I cannot comment on the basis of newspaper reports, until I have the actual report (of the CAG)," said Coal Minister Sri Prakash Jaiswal. The newspaper said the government had allocated areas for coal production to commercial operators without putting them up for competitive auction. As lawmakers from across the spectrum of opposition parties criticized Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's administration over the Times of India story on Thursday, his office issued excerpts of a letter to him from the federal auditor that described the news report as "exceedingly misleading."
