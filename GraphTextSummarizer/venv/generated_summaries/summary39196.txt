But businesses and the political opposition say government policies, including price controls on basic goods and tight restrictions on foreign currency, are to blame. The lack of toilet paper is apparent in Caracas, where shoppers hurry to buy rolls and make long lines when the bathroom tissues are in stock. Other hygiene products, such as tooth paste and soap, might also be imported in bulk to meet demand, Fleming said. Venezuela's monthly demand for toilet paper is about 125 million rolls a month, Fleming said. Toilet paper is just one of the basic goods and foodstuffs that have been disappearing from store shelves over the past few months, as the government and private companies blame each other for the scarcity.
