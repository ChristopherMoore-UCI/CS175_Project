On Tuesday, jurors are hearing from another doctor in the trial to decide whether concert promoter AEG Live shares blame in Jackson's death with Dr. Conrad Murray. Jackson lawyers will contend that he would have made billions of dollars in his remaining years through several more world tours, merchandizing, recording and movies. Murray was not the "appropriate physician" for AEG to hire as Jackson's tour doctor because he was a cardiologist and  not  trained to treat the singer's special needs, Wohlgelernter testified. Murray's agreement to close down his Las Vegas clinic to work full time for Jackson created a conflict, he said. Jackson's mother and three children are suing AEG Live, contending the company that was promoting his "This Is It" shows was liable for his death because of the negligent hiring, retention and supervision of Murray.
