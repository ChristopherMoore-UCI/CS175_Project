-- Bizarre and suicidal actions of Arizona shooting suspect Jared Lee Loughner have pushed a federal appeals panel to reverse an earlier decision and allow authorities to force him to take anti-psychotic medication. Loughner has also expressed "regret for the circumstances that led to his arrest," prosecutors wrote in court documents. Authorities placed Loughner on suicide watch and prosecutors argued in court documents that he would continue to deteriorate and could become more dangerous if he continues to refuse the drugs. Administering the anti-psychotic drugs was more about restoring his competency for trial rather than dealing with his behavior, his attorneys said in court filings. The three-judge panel for the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals based in San Francisco had ruled on July 12 that Loughner can refuse anti-psychotic medication.
