Samantha Orobator "is facing death by firing squad for drug trafficking," said Clare Algar, executive director of Reprieve, a London-based human rights group. She was alleged to have been carrying just over half a kilogram (1.1 pounds) of heroin, Reprieve lawyer Anna Morris told CNN by phone from Vientiane, the Laotian capital. Reprieve sent Morris from London to Laos to try to help Orobator, Algar said. Samantha Orobator became pregnant in prison, according to a spokeswoman for rights group Reprieve. Reprieve is worried about her health, especially given her pregnancy, Anna Morris said.
