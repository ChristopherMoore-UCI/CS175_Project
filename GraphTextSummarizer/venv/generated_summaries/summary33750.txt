As families grow stronger, schools, churches and communities improve, and Julia's chances for success improve, both for herself and her son. As banal and hackneyed as Julia's life of government dependence may seem, many Americans support it. Notably absent in her story is any relationship with a husband, family, church or community, except a "community" garden where she works post-retirement. Conservatives must make the case that earned success is preferable to government dependency, and that Julia is more likely to achieve success and fulfillment in a good, stable family. But as government grows larger and more intrusive, Julia's personal liberty and opportunities may shrink.
