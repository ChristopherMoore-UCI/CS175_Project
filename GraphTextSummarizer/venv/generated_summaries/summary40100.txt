In 2011, Byaruhanga launched Pamoja, a center working with former street children and vulnerable youth to produce sustainable shoes out of disused tires. A former street child himself, Byaruhanga is well aware of what hundreds of vulnerable kids are being exposed to -- dangers like substance abuse, crime, lack of nutrition, exploitation and stigmatization. Since 2011, Byaruhanga says Pamoja Center has been able to employ and train over 80 former street children and 37 vulnerable community youth aged between 12 to 24 years old. "The biggest challenge that youth and former street children face is unemployment and drug abuse," he explains. "We want to create jobs for the youth, we want to create jobs for former street children, and also the orphans."
