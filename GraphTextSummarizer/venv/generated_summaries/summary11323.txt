I have retired now and have come to appreciate what is good food. CNN.com  readers shared their stories and memories of MREs and C rations. I know real sardines and things of that nature might not sound as appetizing as other foods. The meals spark memories good and bad, for those who ate them in the military and even for some civilians who used them during disasters, when food was not readily available. We had no power for 21 days and the stores were out of food.
