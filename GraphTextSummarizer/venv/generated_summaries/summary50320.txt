But, as he writes in his new book, "Strange Things Happen" (HarperStudio), "We have discovered that we can be good friends -- as long as no one mentions music." Besides, Copeland adds in an interview, both Sting and guitarist Andy Summers "are crap at drums." I grew up surrounded by Arabic music. The central element of Arabic music is the baladi rhythm, which is just Arabic for "country." And it also has the very ornate use of the 16th notes, which are very expressive in Arabic music. Copeland took some time to talk about his relationship with the Police, the importance of percussion and the social niceties of West L.A. private schools.
