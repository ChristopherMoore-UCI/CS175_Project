Gov. Luis Fortuno announced the call-up in his annual state of Puerto Rico speech Monday night, saying the help is needed until more officers can be trained. "I think Fortuno realizes that something has to get done about the violent crime, drug problems, and the police don't seem to be able to get the problem under control," said Bentz, a New Jersey native who has lived in Puerto Rico for six years. In a separate development, Fortuno announced Tuesday that U.S. Attorney Rosa Emilia Rodriguez Velez had reached an agreement with the commonwealth's Justice Department and Puerto Rico Police Department for federal prosecutors to have jurisdiction over a series of major crimes. The National Drug Intelligence Center also notes that Puerto Rico "is a major money-laundering center for drug traffickers operating in the region. A recent Puerto Rico Police Department report documented that more than 60 percent of the slayings on the island were directly related to drug trafficking.
