To create sounds ranging from E.T. talking and breathing to snorting and drunkenly burping, the contributors included Spielberg himself, sound effects creator Ben Burtt's sleeping wife who had a cold, a burp from a University of Southern California film professor, raccoons, sea otters, horses and actress Debra Winger's signature husky voice. Most of E.T.'s voice work was performed by an elderly woman named Pat Welsh, whose two-pack a day smoking habit gave her voice the deep quality Spielberg had envisioned. In the scene where government agents have taken over Elliott's home, real doctors from USC Medical Center were recruited to play the doctors who try to save E.T., because Spielberg felt that actors talking about technical medical matters didn't seem natural. Spielberg gave Winger the "E.T." script and had her record every single one of E.T.'s lines into a tape recorder. It remains the fourth most-successful movie of all time in the U.S. "E.T." even surpassed "Star Wars" as the highest-grossing film of all time and wasn't beat until another Spielberg film came along: 1993's "Jurassic Park."
