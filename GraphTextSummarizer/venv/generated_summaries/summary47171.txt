Fears were perhaps greatest in North Carolina and Virginia and on the slivers of islands that extend off those coastlines, which could start feeling Irene's punch by Friday evening. -- Everyone on the East Coast knew Thursday that monstrous Irene, energizing over bathtub-warm ocean waters, was heading toward them, posing the biggest hurricane threat to the United States in six years. A state of emergency has already been declared in Virginia, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Delaware, Connecticut and parts of North Carolina in anticipation of Irene. The reality is that many folks on the East Coast were still in a wait-and-see mode Thursday, as Irene -- slowly but surely -- made her way toward them. No sign of Irene yet, but people asked: "What if?" Boat owners in Falmouth Harbor began removing their vessels, according to CNN affiliate WHDH.
