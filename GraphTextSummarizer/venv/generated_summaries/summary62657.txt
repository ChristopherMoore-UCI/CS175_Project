The last of the Kennedy brothers, Senator Edward Kennedy, died this week of brain cancer at age 77. -- For the first time in more than 60 years, America is without a Kennedy on the national stage and it's more than just a sentimental loss to President Barack Obama. "The White House is worried about getting 60 votes," said CNN analyst Gloria Borger. His early endorsement of Barack Obama helped Obama win the White House. "We shouldn't underplay the adverse effect this has on the president's healthcare fight," said Democratic strategist James Carville.
