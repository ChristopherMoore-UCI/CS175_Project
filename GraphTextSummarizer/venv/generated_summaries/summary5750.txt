"For all of its empty talk about Egypt, the government of Iran should allow the Iranian people the same universal right to peacefully assemble, demonstrate and communicate in Tehran that the people are exercising in Cairo," National Security Council spokesman Tommy Vietor said. Abbas Milani, director of Iranian Studies at Stanford University, said the Middle East is at a "crucial tipping point." If democratic voices and a government prevail in Egypt, he told CNN, Iran will feel an uptick in internal pressure to reform. The government -- which Friday said the toppling of President Hosni Mubarak in Egypt "joyfully" coincided with the anniversary of Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution -- has rounded up activists after Iran's two leading opposition figures called for a rally Monday in support of the uprisings in North Africa and the Middle East. "With recent events in Egypt, we see another round of repression in Iran aimed at silencing a people frustrated and dissatisfied by the denial of their human rights." Observers point to an interesting synergy between protests in Iran and Egypt. They are waiting to see if what's transpired in Egypt will ignite a substantial renewal of protests in Iran.
