LZ Granderson: Mourning Joe Paterno, a flawed hero The College Football Hall of Fame, which inducted Paterno in 2007, says in his biography, "No coach has been as synonymous with one school as has Penn State's Joe Paterno." Despite scandal, Penn State raises more than $200 million The probe found that Paterno "reported what he was told about the 2001 incident to Penn State authorities" -- meaning Curley, Schultz, and Spanier -- "and he believed it would be fully investigated," the family wrote.

Paterno remembered at public memorial "At the very least, Mr. Paterno could have alerted the entire football staff, in order to prevent Sandusky from bringing another child into the Lasch Building," where the incident took place.
