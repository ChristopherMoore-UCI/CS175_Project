Among the oddest item is a chocolate bar stamped "Lisa Marie and Michael" to commemorate Jackson's marriage to Lisa Marie Presley. Julien said there's another significant item tied to a fedora Jackson wore at the 1995 MTV Music Video Awards. The hat was auctioned at a charity event that same year and the letter of verification is signed "Lisa Marie Presley Jackson." "To my knowledge, there were not a lot of letters that she signed with her full name," Julien said. The auction is being handled by Julien's, the same company that had planned to sell about 2,000 items from Jackson's Neverland Ranch in April. For more than 30 years, Betty Alonso has held on to a glittery concert scarf Michael Jackson sent her when she was 12 after the two met face-to-face after a concert in Caracas, Venezuela.
