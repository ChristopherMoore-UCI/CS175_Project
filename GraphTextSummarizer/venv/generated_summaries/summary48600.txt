" The company completed upgrades to the stadium's electrical equipment on December 21, but that may have had nothing to do with Sunday night's problem, said Entergy spokesman Philip Allison. A piece of equipment in the substation "detected some abnormalities and it did what it was supposed to do -- it opened a switch, basically a breaker, which shunted the power that we were receiving from Entergy and de-energized the building." " NFL Executive Vice President Eric Grubman praised the fans for remaining calm. "We're going to work very closely with SMG to get to the root of the problem," said Charles Rice, president of Entergy New Orleans Inc., referring to the company that manages the dome. The halftime presentation was run on generated power, "which means it was not on our power grid at all," he said.
