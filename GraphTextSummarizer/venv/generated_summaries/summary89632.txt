Froome completed Wednesday's 32-kilometer time trial in 51 minutes 33 seconds, nine seconds ahead of Spain's Alberto Contador with his compatriot Joaquim Rodriguez Oliver finishing a further second behind in third. "I couldn't believe it when I got over the line and saw I had the fastest time," Froome said after his third stage win of this year's tour. Contador's Saxo-Tinkoff teammate Roman Kreuziger is now third and trails Froome by four minutes and 51 seconds. " On mountainous terrain along a frequently twisting route most of the riders opted for their traditional road bikes over the more aerodynamic machines used in time trials. But Froome opted to use both on the stage, switching to a time trial model for the final 12-kilometer descent.
