They calculated time on task and found that physicians spent less time on interrupted tasks than on uninterrupted tasks. "It appears that in busy interrupt-driven clinical environments, clinicians reduce the time they spend on clinical tasks if they experience interruptions, and may delay or fail to return to a significant portion of interrupted tasks," concluded the authors, who were led by Johanna Westbrook, director of the health informatics research and evaluation unit on the Faculty of Health Sciences at the University of Sydney. "Task shortening may occur because interrupted tasks are truncated to 'catch up' for lost time, which may have significant implications for patient safety. "Further, interruptions add significantly to cognitive load, increase stress and anxiety, inhibit decision-making performance and increase task errors," they said. The researchers, from the University of Sydney and the University of New South Wales, found that interruptions led emergency department doctors to spend less time on the tasks they were working on and, in nearly a fifth of cases, to give up on the task altogether.
