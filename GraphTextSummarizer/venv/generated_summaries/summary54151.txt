And the police, instead of bringing children home, they're handing them over to child services and arresting the parents. I have to wonder if my mom, who I think was a wonderful mother, would face criminal charges if she were alive and raising children in today's world -- if she raised them the way she raised my brothers and sisters and me. In our post-recession economy, good jobs are hard to come by and child care is expensive. It sounds as though she is suggesting that having some unqualified person to stay home alone with the daughter would somehow be better than letting her play in the park, surrounded by other children and parents. Elsewhere other children are being taken from their parents, and families are being torn apart.
