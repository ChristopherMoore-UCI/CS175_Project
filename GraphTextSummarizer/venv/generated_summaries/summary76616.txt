Lessing has never forgotten the importance of reading as a way to educate yourself  ("you know there are some people in the world who still do") and feels strongly about helping people in developing countries to gain access to books. In her acceptance speech on receiving the Nobel Prize, she painted moving pictures of the desperate struggle for knowledge people in some developing countries still endure: "Not long ago a friend who had been in Zimbabwe told me about a village where people had not eaten for three days, but they were still talking about books and how to get them, about education. People brought up on books are "infinitely better informed, better educated" than those who don't have a genuine passion for reading instilled in them, says Lessing. " She strongly advocates storytelling as an essential part of childhood, and claims there is a distinguishable difference between the attitudes of people who grew up reading books, and that of those who grew up with television and whose parents feel television and the Internet are satisfactory substitutes. In large parts of Africa for example, you find them begging for books."
