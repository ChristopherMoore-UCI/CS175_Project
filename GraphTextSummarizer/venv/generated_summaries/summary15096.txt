-- Maria Shriver cited "irreconcilable differences" in a petition filed Friday to dissolve her 25-year marriage to former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. It was confirmed several days later that a son fathered by Schwarzenegger with his housekeeper was born less than a week after Shriver gave birth to Schwarzenegger's son, Christopher, who is now 13. The filing did not detail the assets to be divided between Shriver and Schwarzenegger "There are community and quasi-community assets and obligations of the parties, the exact nature and extent of which are unknown to petitioner at this time," Shriver's petition said. Shriver's petition proposed that she and Schwarzenegger share joint custody of their two minor sons, Patrick, 17, and Christopher. It became clear a week later that the split was triggered by Schwarzenegger's revelation to his wife that he had fathered a child with his housekeeper.
