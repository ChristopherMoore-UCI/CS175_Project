Born in 1915 in Swansea, Wales, Lilian May Davies was a Vogue model and married to British actor Ivan Craig when she first met Prince Bertil, the current king's uncle, in 1943. With a strong possibility that Prince Bertil would have to act as Regent to the present King Carl XVI Gustaf, who was less than a year old when his father was killed, the couple did not marry. Prince Bertil's two brothers had already renounced their right to the throne by marrying commoners and the only heir, his older brother Crown Prince Gustaf Adolph, died in a plane crash in 1947. Prince Bertil was popular in Sweden where he was dubbed "Prince Charming" by the media for his long romance with Lilian. By the time King Carl XVI Gustaf took the throne in 1973, times had changed.
