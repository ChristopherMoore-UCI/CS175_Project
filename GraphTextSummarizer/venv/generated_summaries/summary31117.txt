-- Bayern Munich playmaker Franck Ribery will miss the Champions League final against Inter Milan this month after failing in his appeal against suspension on Wednesday. "Franck Ribery, as well as our in-house counsel Dr Gerlinger, have in my view put an impressive case to the court that we are not dealing with violent conduct but merely a foul," Rummenigge said in a statement. That was extended by another two games by UEFA's control and disciplinary panel on April 28, meaning the 27-year-old had to miss the final as well as the second leg, plus the first Champions League match of next season. We will continue to fight for justice so that Franck Ribery, despite the confirmation of the ban, can still play in the Champions League final. " Coach Louis Van Gaal's Bayern players are seeking to win three trophies this season, leading the domestic Bundesliga title race by three points going into Saturday's final match at bottom club Hertha Berlin and having also qualified for the German Cup final.
