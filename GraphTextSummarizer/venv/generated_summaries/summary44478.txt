Margaret McCollom was taken by helicopter to Atlanta Medical Center, where she was listed in critical condition, according to a statement from police spokesman Lt. Mark Brown. McCollom was named the police chief in October after being interim chief for three months, reported CNN affiliate WSB. The man tasked with keeping the peace in Peachtree City, Police Chief William McCollom, was being investigated in a shooting that left his wife in critical condition. Brown said Peachtree City officers were called to the home at 4:17 a.m. and immediately realized it was their boss's house. Authorities aren't revealing many details, but they said McCollom shot Margaret McCollom with his service Glock 9mm a few hours before dawn inside the couple's bedroom.
