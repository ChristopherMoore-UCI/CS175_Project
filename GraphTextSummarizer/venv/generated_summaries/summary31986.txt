But colleges routinely reject credits earned at other colleges, suggesting that even though they use credit hours themselves, they know they are not a reliable measure of how much students have learned. So we have two problems: Students who have earned credits -- at great expense in time and money-- can't use or transfer them. And Louisiana students aren't alone; transfer students across the country lose credits, which lengthens their time to get a degree. State and federal governments add to the problem, because while they spend hundreds of billions on higher education each year, most of it is for time served, in the form of credit hours, rather than learning achieved. As higher education becomes increasingly necessary and expensive, measuring time rather than learning is a luxury that students, taxpayers and the nation can no longer afford.
