The report by the U.N. Assistance Mission to Afghanistan (UNAMA) credits the decline to: -- fewer suicide bombings -- a decline in aerial attacks -- less ground fighting between pro-government and militant forces -- care taken by those pro-government forces to minimize harm to civilians. Civilians in the cross hairs Despite the overall decrease in casualties -- deaths plus injuries -- militants increasingly targeted civilians throughout the country and carried out attacks without regard for human life, the report said. Afghanistan's future: 5 burning questions Deaths down, injuries up slightly "The decrease in civilian casualties UNAMA documented in 2012 is very much welcome," said Jan Kubis, a U.N. special representative for Afghanistan. "I welcome strong statements by the Taliban leadership urging its fighters to protect civilians but without enforcing these directives on the ground all that remains are only words," said Kubis who called on, "all Taliban fighters to protect civilians ... and stop using suicide bombers. "The number of Afghan women and girls killed and injured in the conflict increased by 20% in 2012," said Georgette Gagnon, director of human rights for UNAMA.
