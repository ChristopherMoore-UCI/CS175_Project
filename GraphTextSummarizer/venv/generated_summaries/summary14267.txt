Last week the NBA suspended Clippers owner Donald Sterling for life and fined him a league-maximum $2.5 million for racist remarks that were recorded and made public. In his role as president he was running the team's day-to-day operations with Sterling suspended. Los Angeles Clippers President Andy Roeser on Tuesday began an indefinite leave as the team and the National Basketball Association search for a new chief executive officer for the franchise. NBA spokesman Mike Bass said in a written statement: "This will provide an opportunity for a new CEO to begin on a clean slate and for the team to stabilize under difficult circumstances." Roeser joined the Clippers franchise in 1984 and become president in 2007.
