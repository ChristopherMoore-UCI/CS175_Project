-- A flight attendant with a pilot's license ditched her normal duties and stepped in for a sick copilot of an American Airlines flight before the plane landed in Chicago, Illinois, airline officials said. The first officer had become sick with "flulike" symptoms Monday, according to Tim Wagner, a spokesman for American Airlines. One of the five flight attendants on board flight 1612 from San Francisco, California, told the captain that she is a commercial pilot, and she immediately took over the first officer's responsibilities, Wagner said. My first question to the captain was, 'Where are the brakes?'" The plane, carrying 225 passengers and seven crew members, landed safely at O'Hare International Airport at 4:24 p.m. Monday. He was treated and released and was resting Tuesday, Wagner said.
