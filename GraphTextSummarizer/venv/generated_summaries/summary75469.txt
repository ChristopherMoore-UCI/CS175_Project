Much of our reaction to cases like this one is built on what we assume other people are like, regardless of what we know about them as individuals. The verdict by itself says very little about race in America. But few have gotten as much attention as that of George Zimmerman, who shot and killed young Trayvon Martin 17 months ago in Sanford, Florida. Opinion: When blacks killed by non-blacks, justice rarely served Trayvon Martin couldn't give his side of the story, leaving ample room for reasonable doubt. -- Many trials in recent years have implicated our ongoing national struggles with race.
