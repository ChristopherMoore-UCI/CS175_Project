The IAEA lists no other nuclear plants under construction in the region, though several other Middle Eastern countries have taken steps toward nuclear power. -- Iran plans a ceremony to launch a controversial nuclear power plant Monday, the country's government-backed Press TV reported, making it the first nation in the Middle East to put a civilian nuclear power plant online. Iran's Foreign Minister, Ali Akbar Salehi, said Sunday that Iran was committed to nuclear non-proliferation and international atomic energy standards, Press TV reported. Days before the plant was connected to the grid, the IAEA cited increasing concerns that Iran may be developing nuclear weapons. Iran denies that it aims to build nuclear weapons.
