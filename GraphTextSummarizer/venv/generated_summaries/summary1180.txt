-- A South Carolina high school student was arrested Monday morning after school employees found a revolver, knives, axes and dozens of rounds of ammunition in his car, police said. "However, bringing weapons on school grounds violates state law, and the school district has a zero-tolerance policy towards weapons on school grounds," the district said. The junior was arrested after a concerned student told school workers that someone had weapons in a vehicle outside the school of roughly 1,600 students, police said. "He told school officials he uses the stuff for hunting, and he just forgot to take it out of the car," Tollison said. But the student was charged with possession of a firearm on school property.
