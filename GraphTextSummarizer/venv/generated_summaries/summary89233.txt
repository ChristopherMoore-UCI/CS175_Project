Concerns about the vessel running aground and spilling oil subsided Saturday, said Gary Folley of the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation. The state and U.S. Coast Guard are conducting a risk assessment of rescue operations in the region, said Folley. -- A giant freighter disabled in high and frigid seas near Alaska's remote Aleutian Islands could be under tow by late Saturday, officials said. A tow vessel were expected to arrive late Saturday and the Coast Guard cutter Alex Haley will be on scene Sunday morning. If it goes as planned, the Golden Seas could reach port by Monday morning.
