"But if somebody's saying there's some kid who's got pot in the house, I think it's a little crazy to have this war on drugs gone so far." Paul has actively sought to reduce mandatory sentences for nonviolent drug offenders, as well as restore voting rights for nonviolent felons who've completed their sentences. Fresh off his Senate floor speech against arming Syrian rebels, Sen. Rand Paul shifted gears Thursday night to lambast the current state of police militarization in the United States, especially when it comes to the war on drugs. "But if someone's got some pot, you want to break down the door at two in the morning with masks and gas and concussion grenades?" Paul was speaking to the Liberty Political Action Conference, where moments before his speech he was on stage with his father, former Rep. Ron Paul, to deliver a scholarship award. On militarization, Rand Paul said the public may never really know what happened to Michael Brown, the unarmed 18-year-old shot dead by police in Ferguson, Missouri last month, and he didn't weigh in on the still unfolding controversy. Paul made headlines last month with a commentary that called for the demilitarization of police.
