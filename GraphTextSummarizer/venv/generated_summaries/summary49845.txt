Don't forget to sprinkle that seasoning over all the sugary buzz surrounding Christie, who was emphatically reelected as New Jersey governor this week. And the way the media works these days, a big win for a governor like Christie makes him the odds-on favorite to be the Republican nominee for president in 2016, three years from now. "He accepted, I'll say it, the position of gay marriage existing in New Jersey," said Rep. Steve King, a Republican from the key state of Iowa. "I know that if we can do this in Trenton, New Jersey, then maybe the folks in Washington, D.C., should tune in their TVs right now and see how it's done," he said during his victory speech, suggesting he had found the right mix to work together with Democrats and rise above partisan rancor. The Christie narrative goes like this: The dynamic New Jersey Republican has flourished as a red governor in a blue state.
