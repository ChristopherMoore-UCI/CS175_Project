" Goffin stunned Czech 23rd seed Radek Stepanek in the first round proper, then beat more experienced opposition in veteran Frenchman Arnaud Clement -- playing his home tournament for the last time -- and Poland's Lukasz Kubot. Nadal ready for first real test at Roland Garros Djokovic will next take on either French fifth seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga or Swiss No. 18 Stanislas  Wawrinka, having reached the last eight of a grand slam for the 12th consecutive time. Since then he has added a third Australian Open to his collection, but his form in 2012 has not reached the stunning heights of last year -- when his 43-match winning run was ended by the Swiss veteran in the semifinals at Roland Garros. Novak Djokovic came from two sets down on Court Philippe Chatrier on Sunday to salvage his hopes of becoming the first man since Rod Laver in 1969 to hold all four grand slam titles. He won his first two qualifiers but was beaten in the third before a late reprieve after home hope Gael Monfils pulled out due to injury.
