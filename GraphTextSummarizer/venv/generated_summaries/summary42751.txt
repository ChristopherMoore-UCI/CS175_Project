"No one should have to endure an attack like Christin Howard did ... pride celebrations offer people in our communities an opportunity to feel safe in expressing our authentic selves," said Yvnoone Siferd, director of victim services for Equality Michigan. Christin Howard, a 20-year-old hair dresser, was attacked by a group of men on Detroit's Riverwalk during the Motor City Pride event on Sunday. David Wait, chair of Motor City Pride, called the incident troubling, adding that he'd noticed "record attendance on Sunday and we took steps to increase security." Other advocates for the LGBT community in Michigan say this attack means there is more work to do. As for Howard, he is on the fence about returning to the festival next year.
