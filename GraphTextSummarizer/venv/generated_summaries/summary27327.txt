Israel and the West have accused Iran of secretly working to develop a nuclear weapons program, an allegation that Tehran has vehemently denied. -- Iran will not dismantle any of its nuclear facilities as part of an effort to reach a long-term agreement to limit its nuclear development, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said in an interview published Friday in The Financial Times. Even though it's only a short-term agreement, world leaders hope it'll pave the way to a long-term guarantee that Iran won't produce nuclear weapons. But he also told the newspaper how much uranium is enriched by Iran will "depend on our needs for nuclear fuel. Asked during the interview if dismantling Iran's nuclear facilities was a "red line," Rouhani said: "100 percent."
