A history of U.S. policy toward Latin America that asserted American dominance over the region made Kerry's phrase stinging to some. "We deny the baseless allegations made by the Bolivian government," State Department spokesman Patrick Ventrell said of the accusations that the agency meddled in Bolivian affairs. The move is also in protest of a comment made by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry at a hearing in Washington last month, Morales said. After Morales' announcement Wednesday, Bolivia's foreign minister called the U.S. Embassy in La Paz to inform officials of the decision and said USAID would be given a "reasonable" amount of time to end operations, which employ nine Americans and 37 Bolivians, Ventrell said. Bolivian President Evo Morales said he is expelling the U.S. Agency for International Development from his country for allegedly meddling and conspiring against the government.
