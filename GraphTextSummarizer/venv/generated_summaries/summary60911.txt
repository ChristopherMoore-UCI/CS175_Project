There was also footage of Red Shirt movement leader Maj. Gen. Khattiya Sawasdipol lying on the ground, dressed in camouflage, as frantic protesters attempted to move him and get help. Spokesman Panitan said continuing protests by Red Shirts would affect the proposed election date of November 14. Violence erupted during anti-government protests in Thailand on Thursday as one demonstrator was killed and the key protest leader was shot in the head while being interviewed by journalists. It was not immediately clear whether they stemmed from Red Shirt retaliation. The Thursday incident is under investigation, said Col. Sansern Kaewkumnerd, an Army spokesman.
