"On every single street corner in Kabul you will find stray dogs," said Pen Farthing, a former Royal Marine sergeant who founded the nonprofit. Last year, Caba and fellow soldiers were reunited in New York with the puppies for which they had cared. That's when Caba was connected with Nowzad Dogs. Today, Nowzad Dogs also works to promote animal welfare in the country. The group spays/neuters street dogs and cats and vaccinates them against rabies to reduce the stray animal population.
