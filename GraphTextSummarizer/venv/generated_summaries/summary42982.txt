Optimistic and engaging, Danson is a board member of Oceana, a group committed to ocean and marine-life protection, that he helped establish in 1987. As well as spearheading campaigns for Oceana and lending his voice to narrate the 2009 documentary film "The End of the Line," he's in the process of co-authoring a book on ocean conservation. -- Actor, activist and environmentalist, Ted Danson isn't afraid to tackle any number of roles. Perhaps best known for his part as likeable barman Sam Malone in "Cheers" for 12 years, he more recently recast himself as an unscrupulous billionaire in "Damages." But away from his on-screen heroes and villains, Ted's most enduring real-life role has been as a committed environmentalist working to conserve the oceans.
