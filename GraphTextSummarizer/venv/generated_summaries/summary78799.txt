Twenty-nine people in the northwest Alabama town of nearly 1,600 residents died, according to Marion County Sheriff Kevin Williams. "Everything is gone, and I am not exaggerating," said city Police Chief Kenny Hallmark, 40. Although there were shelters, townspeople were taking caring of their own, Hallmark told CNN. Most of the dead, Williams said, were found in residences. The state's official update Friday night listed seven people as still missing in Marion County.
