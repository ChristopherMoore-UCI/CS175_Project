At least three different parole officers spotted Dugard at the home of Phillip Garrido, a convicted rapist who had been under California state supervision since 1999, according to a June memo from the California attorney general's office. She said the news "re-triggers my anger" because she had gone to federal authorities -- who initially handled his parole -- to warn that he had approached her after his release, and "I don't think they believed me." Responsibilty for Garrido's parole was transferred to California authorities in 1999. A November 2009 investigation found parole officers failed to follow utility wires running from Garrido's house toward the shed where Dugard was held, didn't check out the presence of a 12-year-old girl during a visit or act on information that indicated Garrido had violated the terms of his release. -- Parole officers saw and spoke to Jaycee Dugard during visits to the home of the man accused of holding her captive for 18 years, but they never questioned why she was there, California officials disclose in newly released documents. "First, it is a virtual certainty that Ms. Dugard and her daughters will require counseling for the remainder of their lives, with varying degrees of intensity at different time periods," it states.
