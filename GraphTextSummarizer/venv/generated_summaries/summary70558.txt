-- Inmates at a prison in Cuba have made a set of hidden-camera videos to expose the conditions there, publicizing the filth and decrepitude of the facilities despite the risk of retribution. But this month's visit to Cuba by the pope may shield them from retribution, at least in the short term, he said. "Unlike in many other countries in the region," said spokesman Steven Anderson, "the ICRC does not have access to prisons in Cuba. The prisoners who made the tapes may be in danger of retribution, according to Frank Calzon, a Castro critic who is executive director of the Center for a Free Cuba. CNN cannot verify the authenticity of the videos, obtained through Dania Virgen Garcia, a dissident journalist in Cuba whose blog is called Cuba por Dentro.
