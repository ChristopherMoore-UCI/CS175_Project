He's the first to arrive on the island and the others will be introduced gradually, if all goes according to plan, zoo spokeswoman Juliane Gunkel told CNN. Bieber had better slow down, neighbors say The zoo contacted the pop star's management to tell it about Mally's new home but did not receive a response, Gunkel said. Justin Bieber's capuchin monkey -- famously seized by German customs officials after the singer brought it on tour without the right paperwork -- is now out of quarantine and about to join a new "family" in a German zoo. Bieber had until May 7 to present the right paperwork to reclaim his pet -- who's now 27 weeks old and weighs a little less than three pounds -- but failed to do so, Gunkel said. The young monkey, Mally, was taken to a Munich animal shelter after he was confiscated at the end of March as Bieber arrived in Germany on tour.
