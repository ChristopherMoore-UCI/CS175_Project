But, unlike most of the longtime guests, who remain fiercely loyal to "their" lodge, never venturing steps away to check out another, I'm curious and leave Didi a few nights later for Alta's Rustler Lodge, where things are a tad more civilized (read: pricey). "Alta just swallows you up," says Craig Dillon, Didi's ski shop crush, who, it turns out, is 41 and has lived here half his life. As the mountain motto goes, Alta is for skiers. Without a convenient tram to Alta's best terrain, the limited number of skiers allowed uphill work for every turn with an almost perverse pleasure. I press on, inspired by the unspoken camaraderie on the traverse toward Devil's Castle -- a wide-open bowl and depository of powder -- and the shared anticipation among strangers bound by a passion for Alta's almost guaranteed fresh tracks.
