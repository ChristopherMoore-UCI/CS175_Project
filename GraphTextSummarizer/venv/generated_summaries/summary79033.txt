This is the real scandal: President Obama said in his second inaugural address that failing to act on climate change would "betray future generations." The Keystone XL pipeline will bring dirty fuel through America, not to America. If President Obama buys these myths, he should embrace this project publicly. I also do not mean the investigations of The Associated Press or Fox News reporter James Rosen. Keystone XL is not just another pipeline moving "oil."
