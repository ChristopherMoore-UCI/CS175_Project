"It was a breakthrough for Japanese racehorses racing overseas and now the standard of Japanese trained horses is very competitive all over the world," Goda says. "All Japanese racing fans are very excited about having three Japanese-trained horses in this year's Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe -- this is the biggest number that we have sent to France," Japanese horse racing journalist and TV presenter Naohiro Goda told CNN. "Before then, the standard of Japanese horses was not so high," Goda explains, while also noting two landmark victories in Grade One Stakes races the previous year. So near, yet so far has been the story of recent times, with Japanese horses finishing second three times in the last four seasons -- Orfevre was the unlucky runner-up in 2012 and 2013, while Nakayama Festa missed out by a whisker in 2010. That battle may have been lost but it signaled the start of Japanese horses gaining a foothold on the international stage.
