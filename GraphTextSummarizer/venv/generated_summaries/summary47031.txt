"This has been an intensive investigation, and after numerous interviews we have determined that there is no evidence that state laws have been violated," said State Police Superintendent Col. Mike Edmonson. The investigation began in April after ESPN, citing anonymous sources, reported that Saints General Manager Mickey Loomis had a device in his Superdome suite that was wired to allow him to hear members of the opposing coaching staff from 2002 to 2004. -- Louisiana State Police investigating wiretapping allegations against the New Orleans Saints football team said Monday they found no evidence any state laws were broken. In March, the NFL penalized the Saints and members of its coaching staff for the team's bounty program. During this time, players were purportedly offered payments if they managed to hurt opposing players and knock them out of a game.
