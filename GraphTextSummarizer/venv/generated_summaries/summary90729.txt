-- Hezbollah's spiritual leader, Grand Ayatollah Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, has been hospitalized in Lebanon and is in "critical condition," a source in his office told CNN. The hospitalization comes after widespread rumors circulating in Beirut that Lebanon's top Shiite leader has been ill and may not live much longer. The Shiite group is a major provider of social services in Lebanon but also operates a militant wing. The subsequent American policies have contributed to the loss of the Palestinian cause, despite the ratification of many Security Council resolutions." Fadlallah was born in 1935 in the Shiite holy city of Najaf, Iraq, and completed his Quranic studies there, according to his website.
