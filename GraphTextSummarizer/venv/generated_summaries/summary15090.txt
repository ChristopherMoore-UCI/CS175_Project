Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky questioned the safety of vaccines when he said he had "heard of many tragic cases of walking, talking, normal children who wound up with profound mental disorders after vaccines. The issue has become political, despite the fact that claims like vaccines leading to childhood autism have been debunked by scientific research. Obama said the science was "inconclusive," while Clinton wrote in an anti-vaccine questionnaire that she was "committed to make investments to find the causes of autism, including possible environmental causes like vaccine. " Both Obama and Clinton have altered their opinions on this issue, though, because during the 2008 presidential nomination fight, the two left the door open to vaccines causing autism and other issues. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, when asked about the issue, said that he choose to vaccinate his children, but added, "Parents need to have some measure of choice in things as well, so that's the balance that the government has to decide." Parents: What is your message to parents who don't vaccinate their kids?
