The Justice Department subpoenaed and subsequently obtained two months of AP phone records as part of an investigation of its May 2012 coverage of a foiled airline bomb plot in Yemen. "Some of our long-trusted sources have become nervous and anxious about talking to us -- even on stories that aren't about national security," AP Chief Executive and President Gary Pruitt said at the National Press Club. Journalists from other news organizations have personally told me (the DOJ's seizing of AP's phone records) has intimidated sources from speaking to them," he said. Holder has launched a review of Justice Department guidelines on investigations involving the press, and has met with media executives about it. The Justice Department defended its scrutiny, saying previously that it followed its own regulations in acquiring subpoenas and exhausted other methods to find out who might have leaked the information before seeking phone records.
