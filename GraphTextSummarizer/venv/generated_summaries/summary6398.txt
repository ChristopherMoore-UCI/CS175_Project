Scores of pilgrims -- who make the journey on foot -- have been killed and wounded in recent days in attacks that have been blamed on Sunni extremists, who have routinely targeted the pilgrims. In Latifiya, a roadside bomb detonated near Shiite pilgrims walking to the southern city of Karbala, killing at least one pilgrim and wounding six others, the ministry said. -- Iraqi forces have tightened security in and around the Shiite holy city of Karbala as tens of thousands of pilgrims pour in ahead of this weekend's culmination of a revered mourning period. Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki ordered security tightened following a series of attacks on pilgrims. Hussein was killed during a battle near Karbala for control of the Muslim nation following Mohammed's death in 632.
