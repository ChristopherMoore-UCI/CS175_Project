As of Wednesday, 176 South Koreans and one Chinese person remained in the Kaesong complex, according to South Korean authorities. -- South Korea on Thursday warned North Korea of serious consequences if it rejects an offer to hold talks about the dire situation at their shared manufacturing zone where Pyongyang has halted activity amid recent tensions. Since the North started preventing people from entering the zone from the South Korean side, the number of non-North Koreans in there has steadily dwindled from more than 800 before the crisis began. Earlier this month, during a frenzy of fiery rhetoric directed at South Korea and the United States, the North began blocking South Koreans from entering the complex across the heavily fortified border. Seen as the last major symbol of cooperation between the two countries, the Kaesong complex is a joint economic zone on the North's side of the border that houses the operations of more than 120 South Korean companies.
