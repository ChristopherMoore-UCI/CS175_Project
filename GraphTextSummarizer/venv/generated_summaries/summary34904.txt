"She represented this (the abducted baby) as her child." Witnesses said Kala Golden, 28, who was shot outside a Houston-area pediatrician's office Tuesday, screamed and attempted to chase after the car with her son inside, CNN affiliate KTRK reported. Keegan was initially taken into the custody of Texas Child Protective Services, CNN affiliate KHOU reported. "The defendant confronted Mrs. Golden and shot her multiple times in the parking lot," then took the baby and left, the report said. "She admitted to shooting Mrs. Golden and taking her baby," the arrest report said. McClain is accused of killing Golden and taking 3-day-old Keegan Schuchardt.
