Opinion: Sports bar Biden vs. seminar Ryan -- Vice President Joe Biden and Republican Paul Ryan, the man who wants his job, exchanged fire over taxes, Medicare, national security and some animated facial expressions in their only debate before Election Day. "I think Congressman Ryan was out of his depth and showed clearly the ticket is not ready for prime time on foreign policy, and I think that was a decisive difference between the two sides," said Obama campaign manager Jim Messina. According to Google, the other top searches during the debate were "Biden," "conflating," "Who is winning the debate" and "How old is Paul Ryan." We expected Ryan, not Biden, to bring a three-ring binder full of facts and figures to the debate.
