Issues included tardy election workers and blackouts at the end of the day despite extended vote hours, said Nzeza, who visited polling stations in the capital. In polling stations that opened on time, election workers were counting the votes. "Some had traveled for days using motorcycle taxis and bicycles to reach polling stations," said Herman Nzeza, the Congo representative of FreeFair DRC, a nonpartisan group that raises awareness of the election. Despite Congo's vast resources including cobalt, gold, copper and tantalum, the fledgling democracy is mired in poverty and conflict especially in its eastern region, a hot spot for the so-called "conflict minerals" that activists say are used to fund rebel movements in the area. We should respect the rights of the Congolese to have good elections, and our country does not have the facilities -- even roads -- to do that," he said.
