In reality, in performing its foreign intelligence mission, NSA treats PRISM as just another SIGAD, SIGINT Activity Designator, an admittedly new and particularly valuable collection point, but still one among many designed to acquire foreign communications of foreign intelligence value. Rushing against deadline, some outlets reported (inaccurately) that NSA had direct and free access to the servers of American Internet service providers, or ISPs, and it was a short step from there to near libelous accusations that the agency was routinely rummaging through the e-mails of ordinary Americans. Actually, if Greenwald's description of the tools themselves is correct, they are the product of a decade-plus effort at NSA to improve the analytic and collection means available to its work force, to allow NSA analysts at all levels--analysts trained annually in how to protect American privacy--to make a single query to access all relevant information across agency databases and to assign tasking across various SIGADs. Put another way, NSA can more readily connect dots (dots comprised of lawfully collected foreign intelligence) and coordinate tasking (of legitimately targeted foreign communications) than at any other time in the agency's history. Mike McConnell, Congress amended FISA in 2008 to allow NSA more speedy and effective access to these kinds of communications.
