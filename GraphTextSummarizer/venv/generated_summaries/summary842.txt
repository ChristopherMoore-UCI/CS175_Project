Michele Savoia, 55, was last seen leaving a well-known Manhattan club called Marquee around 4 a.m. on Thursday, police said. The designer and owner of the boutique House of Savoia has reportedly dressed Robert DeNiro, Matt Dillon and other notables. Savoia's body was found at 1:30 p.m. ET on Sunday in the water near his house boat, which docks at Pier 59 on the west side of Manhattan. According to police, there is no apparent foul play, and the medical examiner will determine the cause of death. Savoia was described as a "tattooed, needle-wielding daredevil" in an article by Fashion Week Daily in 2011.
