In my case, I stayed, co-parenting with my husband, setting rules and attending basketball games and dance shows and parent teacher conferences, and keeping a close, loving relationship with my children. And I am still the woman everyone refers to when they are talking about mothers who leave. I have heard from women who were escaping bad relationships, women who had to move for work, women who had been swallowed up in caregiving and enabling. If we listen when they speak, we might notice that most women live in the unacknowledged space between "stellar mom and wife extraordinaire" and "human garbage." I know because I have heard from hundreds of women who also left.
