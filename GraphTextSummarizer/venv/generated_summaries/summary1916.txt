"Jonathan Trott is an incredibly talented cricketer who has proven himself time and again for England," said managing director England cricket Hugh Morris. " At one point in the match when James Anderson faced Johnson television stump microphones picked up Australian captain Michael Clarke telling the England bowler to "get ready for a broken f****** arm." Just ask cricketer Jonathan Trott, who has pulled out of England's tour of Australia because of a stress-related illness. England lost the first Ashes test against Australia -- one of sport's great rivalries -- with batsman Trott scoring 19 runs in two innings when he struggled against Mitchell Johnson's fast bowling. "Feeling for Jonathan Trott," tweeted former Australian bowler Shane Warne.
