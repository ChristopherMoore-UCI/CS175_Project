Two doses of the unlicensed vaccine -- called Bexsero and made by Novartis -- are required to protect individuals against meningitis B. Princeton hopes to make the first two doses of the vaccine available in early December, and the second in February. -- An eighth case of meningitis has been reported at Princeton University, the school said Friday, the latest in a string of cases reported this year. Also this week, the University of California, Santa Barbara, reported that three students were being treated for meningococcal disease, and that their cases were caused by type B bacteria -- the same bacteria strain causing the Princeton outbreak. All seven other cases of meningitis found at Princeton since March were caused by a rare meningococcal bacteria known as serotype B. Princeton said Monday that the school was preparing to provide a vaccine to protect against this strain of meningitis, pending final approval from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. "Health officials will be conducting tests to determine if this latest case is related to the seven cases of meningitis associated with the University since March," university spokesman Martin Mbugua said in an e-mail.
