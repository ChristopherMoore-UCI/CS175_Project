Dole, who turns 87 this month, is at Walter Reed for rehabilitation connected to knee replacement surgery. The servicemembers said that when Dole comes to physical therapy, he always talks to everyone in the room, including family members who are always by their side -- just like his mother was there for him 65 years ago. " As a veteran-turned-lawmaker, Dole has advocated for the nation's veterans throughout his career, including serving as co-chair of a 2007 presidential commission that investigated shoddy conditions at Walter Reed, but he has nothing but praise for the medical care he has seen. Former Sen. Bob Dole was so badly wounded 65 years ago that he almost didn't make it off the battlefield. Dole is even willing to take a few jabs at himself and his failed run for president in 1996.
