Ruth and Harold Knapke met when they were students at the same elementary school in Ohio but were separated when Harold's family moved several towns away, according to Carol Romie, another daughter of the Knapkes. " Harold Knapke, 91, and his wife, Ruth, 89, died August 11 at the Versailles Health Care Center nursing home in Russia, Ohio, spokeswoman Teresa Pohlmon said. "Dad was a year ahead of Mom and I remember Mom would tell us, 'I had a crush on your dad when I was in the third grade,'" Margaret Knapke said. "Mom knew who he was right away," Margaret Knapke said of her mother's reaction to the letter. Ruth's brother-in-law Steve, who was also serving, overheard that Harold was from the same county in Ohio as Ruth and suggested that Harold write to her.
