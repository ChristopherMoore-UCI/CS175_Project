Social media has transformed communication, media, and the transmission of information, but it still takes people on the ground to pull people out of the rubble or to fight for freedom. We need to understand what social media really is in order to use it effectively for social good. Still, social media for social good is becoming more effective with each crisis. Just like the Iran election crisis, those events are causing people to reassess the impact of social media on the world. In the end though, social media didn't topple any governments, although it has helped shift the political climate in Iran.
