Supreme Court justices appeared divided Tuesday during historic arguments over the constitutionality of gay marriage, with Justice Anthony Kennedy returning to a familiar role as the court's pivotal vote. RELATED: How a Cincinnati judge could shape the gay marriage case Many questions on Tuesday centered around the definition of marriage and whether the decision to authorize or ban gay marriage should be left to voters in individual states or decided by the judicial system. U.S. Solicitor General Donald Verrilli, who represented the Obama administration's views, also presented arguments in favor of same-sex marriage, focusing on equal protection under the 14th amendment and likening bans on same-sex marriage to handing second-class status to gay Americans. "If you support gay marriage you will burn in hell," the protester shouted before police quickly detained the man and dragged him out of the courtroom while he continued to scream. " "I think," Kennedy said, "the argument cuts quite against you." He also brought up the fact that marriage "bestows dignity."
