The Swedish tabloid Expressen reported Wednesday that Libya's former justice minister has accused Moammar Gadhafi of ordering the 1988 bombing of a jet over Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed 270 people. The tabloid said the interview lasted about 40 minutes and was carried out Wednesday by Expressen reporter Kassem Hamade in Libya "in the local parliament in a major city. But he was released in 2009 on compassionate grounds after being diagnosed the previous year with what was characterized as terminal cancer. "I have evidence that Gadhafi ordered the Lockerbie," Mustafa Abdul Jalil is reported to have told the newspaper, though the article cited no specifics. According to Mustafa Abdul Jalil, who reportedly has quit his job recently to join the protesters, Gadhafi did everything he could to secure Megrahi's release to hide his own involvement.
