In a letter sent to school officials, American Civil Liberties Union Executive Director Marjorie R. Esman said the policy "is based on the archaic and pernicious stereotype that a girl's pregnancy sets a 'bad example' for her peers -- i.e., that in having engaged in sexual activity, she has transgressed acceptable norms of feminine behavior." -- A Louisiana charter school is changing a policy that required pregnant students to be removed from class and home-schooled, pending board approval, a school official said Thursday. In cases where a test determines that one of the school's approximately 700 students is pregnant, "the student will not be permitted to attend classes on the campus of Delhi Charter School." If home study opportunities are not acceptable, the student will be counseled to seek other educational opportunities," it said. Broussard said the law firm Davenport, Files and Kelly helped revise the policy to make it compliant with federal law, after it came under intense criticism from rights groups.
