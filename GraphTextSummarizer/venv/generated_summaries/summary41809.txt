-- Melbourne airport was hit with a power outage on Wednesday, temporarily grounding outgoing flights and bringing other airport services to a halt. Aside from flight delays, customs processing was halted, security gates were closed, and shops could not conduct sales. Passengers on incoming flights were also kept waiting, including ABC News correspondent, Jen King . While the blackout lasted only an hour, according to the Age, it caused chaos in airport procedures and consternation among passengers. Eventually, both security and customs began processing passengers manually, with security staff examining luggage manually.
