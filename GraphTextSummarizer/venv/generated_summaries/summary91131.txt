Turner arrived at a clinic there around 4 a.m. (2 a.m. ET) suffering from acute abdominal pain, according to clinic spokeswoman Paula Redondo. -- CNN and Turner Broadcasting System founder Ted Turner was admitted to a hospital while traveling in South America, his spokesman said Friday. In 1996, Turner sold Turner Broadcasting to Time Warner, though he remained active in the business for several more years. Turner was flown later that morning to the capital of Buenos Aires to have the operation, according to Telam. Soon after graduating from Brown University and serving in the U.S. Coast Guard, Turner took over the family business -- Turner Advertising -- in 1963.
