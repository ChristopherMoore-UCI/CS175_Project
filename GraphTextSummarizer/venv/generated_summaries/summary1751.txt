Experts say that while nuclear power has generally proven relatively safe, it is important to question whether nuclear plants everywhere could cope with a two-fold natural disaster combination like the earthquake and tsunami that rocked Japan on March 11. As Japan moves toward stabilization of the Fukushima Daiichi plant, here are some larger issues to think about in terms of the future of nuclear energy: Balancing risks and benefits It makes sense that the public is frightened as workers continue to tame the situation at Fukushima Daiichi; people want to know that nuclear power is safe, Richter said. The relatively low cost of nuclear fuel and reduced greenhouse gas emissions compared to fossil fuels has made nuclear power popular in Japan, Meshkati said. The decision of sources of power is a country-specific one, but power has to come from somewhere, and dropping nuclear power may force a country to buy additional electricity from another country, said Peter Hosemann, assistant professor of nuclear engineering at the University of California, Berkeley. They may ask for more openness and transparency about where to place nuclear power plants and how to oversee their safety, he said.
