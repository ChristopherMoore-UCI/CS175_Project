From the days when my father, a leading real estate inspector in Chicago, couldn't live in certain areas or shop in certain stores, to today, when I can graduate from a leading university, enter the field of media, and truly believe I have a chance to exceed my dreams, a lot has changed. But I also see others around me who, on the surface, may roll with a similar crowd, listen to the same music, say the right things, but who are also slowly being infected with the American disease of racial bias. Today, any controversial statement, once exposed to the disinfectant of sunlight and mass media, gets met with immediate backlash. Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling learned this firsthand when NBA Commissioner Adam Silver banned him for life. And too often do we go from captivated to uninterested overnight, distracted by the next shiny object or hot Internet meme.
