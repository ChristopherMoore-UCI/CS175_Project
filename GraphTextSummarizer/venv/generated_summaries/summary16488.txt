BP told CNN Friday it doesn't comment on litigation and possible litigation. -- The state of Alabama has filed suit against BP, Transocean and others in the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, according to Alabama Attorney General Troy King. King says BP is selling off assets -- perhaps, to prevent courts from being able to use the assets to satisfy a judgment. Attorney General King pointed out BP is spending millions on public relations and advertising, and is hiring "all the best expert witnesses, not because they need their services, but so the experts will be unable to testify against BP."
