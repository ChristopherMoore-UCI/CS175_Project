"I heard a man say 'Oh no!,' and I heard him fall into the train tracks," witness Danya Guiterez told CNN affiliate WPIX. The blind man, identified by CNN affiliate NY1 as Cecil Williams, was walking on the subway platform with his service dog when witnesses describe him slipping and falling onto the tracks. -- A blind man and his black Lab service dog fell onto subway tracks and escaped injury Tuesday after an alert Metropolitan Transportation Authority employee instructed them to duck ahead of an oncoming train. The MTA employee instructed Williams to lie still between the subway rails and not try and climb out as a northbound "A" train quickly approached the station, according to Baldeo. "It's a miracle," Williams' girlfriend, who only wished to only give her first name, Cynthia, told CNN affiliate NY.
