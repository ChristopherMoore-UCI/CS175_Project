I started reading every book that was available on how dogs think, how they perceive the world, the nature of the relationship between man and dog. Until that point, I wasn't aware that military dogs or police canines or any animal can suffer from PTSD, just like any person. I had read so many different books and articles on how dogs perceive the world -- their sense of smell, how dogs think, why dogs do what they do -- that when I finally was writing from Maggie's point of view it came very naturally. Quite a few of the dogs that come back from Afghanistan or Iraq or police dogs that are involved in violent confrontations where there's gunfire can in fact exhibit the symptoms and suffer from PTSD. At Lackland Air Force Base, they make an effort to retrain military dogs that suffer from PTSD.
