For much of my childhood, playing with mathematical problems, equations and facts was one of my favorite activities; I even went so far as to compete in international high school mathematics competitions, racing to solve tricky sets of problems in a few hours. I still remember the realization in college at Flinders University in Australia that mathematics was not just an abstract game of symbols, but could be used as a tool to analyze and understand the modern world. -- When I was a child in Adelaide, Australia, I loved games with clear, unambiguous rules; puzzles that were tough but fair; and the clean, abstract, simplicity of numbers and symbols. In 1992, when I was 16, I moved to the United States to start working on my Ph.D. at Princeton University in New Jersey. By 2002, I was married to an American -- we were married in the United States -- and last year I became a U.S. citizen (while retaining Australian citizenship).
