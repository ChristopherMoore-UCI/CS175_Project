" A potential switch has been a topic of discussion since Qatar was awarded the World Cup by world governing body FIFA in December 2010. Concerns were also raised for gay fans planning on attending the tournament as homosexuality is illegal in Qatar, with FIFA president Sepp Blatter criticized for suggesting homosexual fans should refrain from sexual activity while visiting the country.
