After their arrests, Lt. Gen. Salvatore Angelella, commander of U.S. forces in Japan, put troops at Okinawa's Kadena Air Base on a curfew and apologized to the victim. -- A Japanese court Friday sentenced two American servicemen to prison for a rape committed last year while they were on duty at a U.S. military base in Okinawa. The incident has prompted a women's group in Okinawa to call for more restrictions on what U.S. military personnel can do when they are off-base. Violent crimes, especially rapes, by U.S. troops in Japan have divided the two countries for decades. The alleged attack took place two months after a U.S. Marine was arrested, accused of assaulting and molesting a woman in Naha, the capital of Okinawa.
