While trees, cheeky holiday decor, and jazzed-up carols have begun to encroach upon this den of depravity and excess, it's still a relatively safe haven for Christmas cranks like me, and the darkness sets in a shade later than it does back home. I come from a family in which Christmas Day e-mails have become an acceptable level of holiday hoopla, but have married into a family heavily invested in the celebration. That may successfully deflect attention from friends and family caught up in holiday chaos, but I am thoroughly unable to force myself into a state of good cheer. I like getting presents and sending Christmas cards and decorating trees and all that, but I'm still not happy. On the ground at Christmas central with the in-laws, my husband and I have taken to getting a hotel room, rather than staying with family.
