She also noted $100 worth of late fees for overdue audio books checked out by Hailey's father, Tony Benoit. Police Chief James A. Pervier said his officers have been asked by library personnel to make similar visits to at least 13 other Charlton households over library late fees. But a Charlton Public Library spokeswoman said that it wasn't just Hailey's overdue books that prompted the police intervention. "She's 5; she didn't understand," said Shannon Benoit of her daughter, Hailey. "Even some things that weren't overdue!" Benoit told CNN that she has since returned the overdue books, making the return trip to the library shortly after the officer's visit.
