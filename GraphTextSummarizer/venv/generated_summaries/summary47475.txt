Authorities have linked him to the other robberies because of certain similarities, said FBI Omaha Special Agent in Charge Thomas Metz. He's already shot a police officer, so anybody who gives him any resistance, he's not afraid to act," Detective Carlos Dominguez, with the Chino, California, police department, told reporters Sunday. The suspect is said to have held up the First Nebraska Bank in Nebraska City, Nebraska, on August 22. The suspect, dubbed the "AK-47 Bandit," stormed the bank in Nebraska with an assault style rifle and a black duffel bag, according to the FBI. He's wanted in connection to a string of other robberies -- in Idaho, Washington and California in 2012 -- including one where he shot a police officer.
