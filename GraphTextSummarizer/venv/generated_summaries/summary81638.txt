Haris had been due home in Indiana on Saturday, his sister Hiba Suleman told reporters Wednesday. He and Haris were wearing "gumby" suits that could help them survive a water landing, Hiba Suleman said. The oldest sibling, a brother, was trying to get from London to American Samoa to pick up Haris' body but there were only a few flights, Hiba Suleman said. Babar Suleman, asked about the inherent risk involved in such a venture, said he put his faith in sound preparations. An aerial endeavor that would take 17-year-old pilot Haris Suleman and his father, Babar, around the world in just 30 days and into the record books.
