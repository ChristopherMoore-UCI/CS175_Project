"Mrs. Witherspoon was resistant but I was able to put handcuffs on her without incident due to Mr. Toth calming her. Witherspoon, who was in Atlanta working on a movie titled "The Good Lie," was charged with interfering with Pyland's arrest of her husband, Hollywood agent James Toth, on a drunken driving charge. That didn't discourage Trooper First Class J. Pyland from writing a very quotable arrest report suitable for national news -- with dialogue worthy of a Witherspoon movie script. "Mrs. Witherspoon began to hang out the window and say that she did not believe that I was a real police officer," Pyland wrote. "You are going to be on national news," Witherspoon allegedly told a Georgia state trooper as he handcuffed her on Atlanta's Peachtree Road early Friday morning.
