"If it is not quiet in southern Israel, it will be very noisy in Gaza," Netanyahu said in Hebrew. Airstrikes, rocket fire Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Liberman told Israeli army radio that "the position of my party Israel Beitanyu is that we support the full occupation of the whole of Gaza in any possible future action." Liberman opposed a response short of full occupation. Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon blamed the attacks on Hamas, which has governed Gaza since 2007, two years after Israel disengaged unilaterally from the area.
