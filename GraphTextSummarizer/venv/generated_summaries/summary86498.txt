It was a transaction within the bank, but the money was passing through a Federal Reserve facility in New Jersey, according to the source, who said it's fairly common, when large sums are transferred, even internally, for them to go through a federal facility, where old bills are exchanged for new ones. The FBI is investigating the theft of $1.2 million from Swiss International Airlines Flight 17, which arrived at New York's JFK International Airport from Zurich, Switzerland, on Saturday afternoon, a spokesman said Tuesday. The Port Authority is declining comment, according to spokesman Steve Coleman. Flight 17 was a passenger flight with air cargo, including a shipment of currency, according to another FBI spokesman, Jim Margolin. Another law enforcement source told CNN the money belonged to a U.S. bank that was transferring currency from offices in Switzerland to the U.S.
