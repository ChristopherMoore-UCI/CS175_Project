CLOUDBREAK, Tavarua, Fiji Best waves: April to October "One of the great surf discoveries ever," said Slater about Cloudbreak, the name given to a surfing reef about two miles off Fiji's island of Tavarua. With more good waves, there's less jockeying among surfers for position. Surfers checking out unique vibes at sites in Australia, Fiji, Tahiti, Hawaii and France are driven by the buzz that comes from exhilarating swells, breaking waves and amazing barrel tubes created by truly awesome forces of nature. There, surfers will discover a pure point break, with waves breaking off cobblestone rocks on the ocean floor. The South Pacific waters off Fiji offer the perfect temperature and a "really good swell window" for timing waves, Slater said.
