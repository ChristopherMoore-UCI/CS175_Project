When a suicide bomber detonated his truck outside Forward Operating Base Marez in Iraq in 2009, it wasn't the first time that type of attack killing U.S. soldiers took place. " Law enforcement officials say 'Isa's role in the network included instructing prospective suicide bombers on leaving their homes without raising suspicion, figuring out the route they should take to enter Iraq and putting them in touch with Iraqi-based terrorists. According to the Department of Justice, this suicide operation, which killed five U.S. soldiers and several Iraqi citizens, was orchestrated from Edmonton, Canada, by Faruq Khalil Muhammad 'Isa, a 36-year-old accused of being member of a global terrorist recruiting cell that funneled foreign fighters into Iraq. In recorded phone and electronic communications with numerous co-conspirators, including would-be suicide bombers and facilitators based in Iraq, 'Isa often referred to carrying out terrorist attacks as getting "married," as in marriage to 70 virgins or "farming," because they "plant metal and harvest metal and flesh," according to the Justice Department's criminal complaint. 'Isa is accused helping at least eight Tunisian foreign fighters cross into Libya, eventually making their way to Mosul, Iraq, via Syria to meet with his network of Iraqi-based facilitator contacts.
