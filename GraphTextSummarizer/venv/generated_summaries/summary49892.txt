Now four years into an expansion, new research from Merrill Lynch and research firm Age Wave suggests that family togetherness remains a powerful trend. Six in 10 Americans past the age of 50 provide financial support to adult family members, according to the Merrill/Age Wave report "Family & Retirement: The Elephant in the Room." So powerful that Merrill is rethinking its approach to serving clients, putting special emphasis on the needs of extended family members and how that factors into long-term financial planning. After a century of being torn apart by industrialization and job mobility, "families are coming back together," says Andy Sieg, head of Global Wealth and Retirement Solutions for Bank of America Merrill Lynch. "We're seeing a new level of generosity and willingness to help family members."
