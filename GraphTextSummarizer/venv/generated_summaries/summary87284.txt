That's why we also look for dynamic organizations -- ones that aren't weighted down by bureaucracy and turf wars, and in particular, ones in which the board and the executive director are working hand in hand. Need doesn't inspire others to follow your example. That's why we've stopped focusing our giving on needs and started focusing it much more on leadership. The truth is, virtually all of the more than 1.5 million nonprofits in America are trying to meet important needs. And I've found that while money is, of course, essential, in the end it has surprisingly little to do with effective philanthropy.
