" Experts studying hate crimes say there is no reliable way to link the growing number of hate groups with an increase in hate crimes, since many of the attacks go unreported. Dr. Alvin F. Poussaint, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School who studied the issue of hate crimes, said people in hate groups can feel paranoid about a specific group of people. Most of the hate groups are located in the South, but the state with the highest number of documented hate groups is California with 84. The center's report, "The Year in Hate,"  found the number of hate groups grew by 54 percent since 2000. What makes this year's report different is that hate groups have found two more things to be angry about --  the nation's first African-American president and an economy that is hemorrhaging jobs.
