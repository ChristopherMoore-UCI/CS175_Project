Michael Tantillo, the Ontario County District Attorney, said the matter will be presented in the "near future." He said New York law precludes him from specifying when the grand jury will meet to decide whether Stewart should be indicted on a criminal charge. The evidence gathered after Tony Stewart's race car struck and killed another driver who was walking on the track will be given soon to a grand jury, a district attorney in upstate New York announced Tuesday. Stewart, a three-time NASCAR top series champion, was driving a dirt-track car when the right rear tire hit Ward, who was walking on the track during an Empire Super Sprints series race August 9 in Canandaigua, New York. Authorities said that the 20-year-old Ward, a New York sprint car driver, died of "massive blunt trauma. Last week, the Ontario County Office of Sheriff announced it had finished its investigation into the death of Kevin Ward Jr., who died from his injuries after he was struck by a race car driven by Stewart during a spring car race in August.
