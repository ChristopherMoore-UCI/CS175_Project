" Pride While United returned to playing at Old Trafford in August 1949, Gibson lived just another two years until he suffered another stroke, passing away in September 1951. Gibson moved quickly, arranging a deal for United to play its home matches at Maine Road, home of local neigbor, Manchester City. From the seeds sown by Gibson, United would go on to flourish with European Cups, FA Cups and league titles galore thanks to the work of Busby and later, Ferguson. Under Busby, United would go on to great triumphs, triumphs of which Gibson would have been so proud. But on that fateful March night, as German bombers blitzed Old Trafford, all Gibson's hard work was undone.
