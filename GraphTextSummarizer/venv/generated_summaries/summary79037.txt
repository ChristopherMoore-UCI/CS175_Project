The separate Citizens United case in 2010 dealt with campaign spending by outside groups seeking to influence federal elections. However, congressional supporters of tougher campaign finance laws expressed concern about more private money influencing elections. "I am concerned that today's ruling may represent the latest step in an effort by a majority of the court to dismantle entirely the longstanding structure of campaign finance law erected to limit the undue influence of special interests on American politics," said Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona, a longtime proponent of campaign finance reform. In effect, it expands the loosening of campaign finance laws that occurred with the high court's Citizens United decision in 2010 that eased campaign spending by outside groups. While most people lack the money to make such a large total donation to election campaigns, the ruling clears the way for more private money to enter the system.
