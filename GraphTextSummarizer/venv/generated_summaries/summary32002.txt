The picture was apparently uploaded on Imgur a few days ago and has caught fire thanks to a post on the website 9gag.com. Of course, where there's public debate, there are advertisers waiting to take advantage of the situation. That's the trending question on social media, thanks to a photo of a cat coming down some stairs. (And you thought you were done with this kind of optical illusion free-for-all after #TheDress.) (Nobody has mentioned that some cats we could name would be more likely to stop in the middle of the steps and play with a mousie.)
