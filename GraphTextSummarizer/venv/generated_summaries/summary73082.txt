" Manchester City moved up to second place, but Liverpool and Arsenal could trim Chelsea's lead to four points on Sunday with victories in crunch clashes against rivals Manchester United and Tottenham respectively. Mourinho was also sent to the stands at Villa Park, following second-half red cards to Chelsea midfielders Willian and Ramires. Referee Chris Foy has now issued six red cards to Chelsea players in the last eight of the club's matches in which he has officiated -- and Mourinho was fighting to keep his feelings hidden afterwards in fear of being punished by the authorities. It was a difficult start to a big week for Chelsea, whose European Champions League hopes will be tested by Tuesday's visit of Galatasaray ahead of next weekend's home clash with Arsenal. Saturday's controversial defeat at Aston Villa allowed Manchester City to close to within six points, with three games in hand on the London club and a vastly superior goal difference.
