-- MotoGP leader Jorge Lorenzo hopes he can overturn Honda's qualifying dominance for Saturday's Assen TT race after setting the third fastest time behind Casey Stoner and Dani Pedrosa. As far as race pace goes, we're still struggling and we need to work on this and make some decisions before the race." World champion Stoner recovered from a morning crash to deny Honda Repsol teammate Pedrosa first place on the grid. Lorenzo's teammate Ben Spies won the race last year, but will start sixth on the grid on Saturday. "I tried my best in the last lap of qualifying but I made a little mistake in the last chicane on braking and lost a few tenths," 2010 world champion Lorenzo said on the MotoGP website.
