Read more: George Zimmerman defense releases new photo "NBC saw the death of Trayvon Martin not as a tragedy but as an opportunity to increase ratings, and so set about to create the myth that George Zimmerman was a racist and predatory villain," the lawsuit says. At the time of the incident with Martin, Zimmerman was living in a community known as The Retreat at Twin Lakes in Sanford, Florida, court papers say. "There was no intent to portray Mr. Zimmerman unfairly," the company said in a prepared statement. The lawsuit accuses NBC of falsely claiming that Zimmerman said "f------ coons" on the February 26 call. The edited recordings included multiple deletions, removed intervening dialogue between Zimmerman and the dispatcher, and juxtaposed unrelated content "to make it appear that Zimmerman was a racist, and that he was racially profiling Trayvon Martin," the lawsuit says.
