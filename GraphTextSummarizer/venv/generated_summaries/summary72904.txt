Lady Gaga, considered by many to be this year's biggest breakout act, was ruled ineligible because she had a song released and nominated last year. Prince Michael and Paris, along with several cousins, wore black suits with red stripes on their pants, and red armbands. Daddy was going to perform last year. The win gave the Kings of Leon three Grammys out of four nominations this year, all thanks to last year's "Only by the Night" album. The same album gave them three nominations last year, one of which they won.
