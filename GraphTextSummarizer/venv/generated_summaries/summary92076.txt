-- Four months after a criminal investigation began into the disappearance of an Oregon boy, officials continue to ask the public for leads and tips. In divorce filings, her ex-husband, Kaine Horman, said he believes that Terri Horman "is involved" in the boy's disappearance. Meanwhile, Skyline Elementary began its first day of classes for the year on Tuesday with additional security measures to protect the children and staff. His stepmother, Terri Horman, said she dropped him off at Skyline Elementary School on the morning of June 4. Desiree Young, Kyron's biological mother, said she will celebrate the birthday by releasing red balloons outside a church in Medford, Oregon.
