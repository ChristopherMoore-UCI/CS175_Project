After years of being outgunned in the battle for job applicants by corporations who could pay bigger salaries, hundreds of thousands of job seekers are applying for FBI positions. "In years past it was often difficult to find people with the science and technology background or chemistry background or a biology background because we were competing with the private sector," said FBI Assistant Director John Raucci. Raucci said the average starting salary at the FBI is about $35,000 per year. The FBI said about 70,000 people seek positions in a normal year. She'll have to undergo an FBI background check and take polygraph and drug tests.
