In issuing the ruling, Magistrate Judge John Facciola turned down a request by government prosecutors for Oscar Ortega-Hernandez to undergo more mental evaluation. -- A 21-year-old Idaho man charged with trying to assassinate President Obama by firing a rifle at the White House is competent to stand trial, a federal judge ruled Friday. Prosecutors say there is videotape showing Ortega-Hernandez shopping at a Walmart store in Fairfax, Virginia, two hours after he said he was robbed in Washington.
