Big parts are coming off a former U.S. Navy minesweeper that became stuck on a Philippine reef in January. Navy officials said in January that the U.S. National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, which prepares the digital navigation charts used by the Navy, has reported the location of the reef was misplaced on a chart by nine miles. That vessel, currently in Bahrain, will be ferried by a heavy transport ship to the U.S. naval base in Sasebo, Japan, where the Guardian's crew will take over its operation, according to a Navy statement. The Guardian grounded on Tubbataha Reef, a UNESCO World Heritage site, on January 17. Another minesweeper, the USS Warrior, is being moved to the Pacific to replace the Guardian, the Navy said.
