The late sheikh was a brother of the ruler of Abu Dhabi and president of the UAE, Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan. The sovereign-wealth fund, which was established in 1976, is owned by the government of Abu Dhabi. "We prefer to be seen simply as a globally diversified investment institution, with the difference being that our owner is the government of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi," he said. "ADIA's sole mission, which has not changed in over 30 years, is to secure and maintain the current and future welfare of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi." The remains are being transported back to the Emirates from Morocco and are expected to be buried Wednesday, Abu Dhabi TV reported.
