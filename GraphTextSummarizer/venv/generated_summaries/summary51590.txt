Actor Shia LaBeouf has settled charges related to his summer meltdown on Broadway by agreeing to get more alcohol abuse treatment. The sentence requires LaBeouf, who has been getting outpatient alcohol treatment since his arrest, to continue treatment for another three months. The "Transformers" actor was initially arrested by New York police on June 26 "for refusing to leave a theatrical performance when asked, for creating unreasonable noise and using obscene language outside of Studio 54, and for spitting at a police officer at the Midtown North police precinct," Assistant District Attorney Alyssa Russell said in court Wednesday. The criminal complaint said LaBeouf was sitting in the audience in a theater at Studio 54, watching a performance of "Cabaret," when he yelled "loudly at the actors onstage" and refused to leave. LaBeouf must return to court on November 12 to prove he has completed the alcohol treatment.
