He's linking up with UK Prime Minister David Cameron at an event promoting British trade and is visiting New Jersey to see an area devastated by Hurricane Sandy. He'll be accompanied by New Jersey Governor Chris Christie who is grateful to Prince Harry for putting Sandy back on the news agenda, according to a person close to the Prince on this tour. He managed it in spectacular fashion during his tour of the Caribbean last year but then let himself down (his own words) in Las Vegas when naked pictures of him emerged. On Tuesday, Prince Harry will view a roller coaster, boardwalk and pier at Seaside Heights that were swept into the ocean during the storm. He's aware that getting involved in events and showing his character makes for good coverage.
