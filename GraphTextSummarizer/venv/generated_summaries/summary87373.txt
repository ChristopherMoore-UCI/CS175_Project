-- A 19-year-old Detroit woman who was shot and killed on the front porch of a home was not shot at close range, according to an autopsy report. As reported by the Detroit News, McBride's autopsy left many questions unanswered. "There was an entrance shotgun wound to the face, with no evidence of close range discharge of a firearm noted on the skin surrounding this wound," said the autopsy report, which ruled her death a homicide. It confirmed that McBride had been shot in the face, but revealed little about how the early morning incident on November 2 unfolded. Lawyers for McBride say she was simply looking for help after a car crash, while those representing the homeowner say the 54-year-old was justified in his actions.
