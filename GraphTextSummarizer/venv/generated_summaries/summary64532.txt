In tough economic times, hope makes planning easier and defense reductions more palatable. The nation's leadership needs a Plan B so that a heroic assumption -- or hope -- about the unlikelihood of future wars does not inadvertently lead to strategic disaster. Military dictatorships emerged in response to turbulent times and soon threatened British security. Although the Ten Year Rule saved the British much money in the short term, the calculated risk turned into dashed hopes in the 1930s. As long as the planning assumption held, the government could assume strategic risk by reducing the military's size, deferring its modernization programs and delaying improvements to base protection.
