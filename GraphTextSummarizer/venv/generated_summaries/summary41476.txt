German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Fran√ßois Hollande gave a common press conference, met with students, answered their questions and went for lunch. " With a combined total of 40% of the eurozone GDP, 33% of the entire EU's population and 31% of its budget, France and Germany are the locomotive of the European Union and remain so even when their respective heads of state are at odds.

Both countries have gone from hereditary hatred, to hereditary friendship.
