As many as 250 sheriff's deputies, Covington police officers, Louisiana State police and corrections officials were involved in the search overnight, using dogs, two helicopters and thermal-imaging equipment loaned from Livingston Parish, Bonnett said. He said the escape was not discovered until a resident and Covington police reported seeing what appeared to be inmates in jail uniforms walking down a street. At large is Timothy Murray, 29, who is charged with murder, Bonnett said. Buras is a murder suspect and Gainey has been convicted of murder, Bonnett said. He said the means of escape was under investigation, but it has been determined that their escape wasn't due to human error.
