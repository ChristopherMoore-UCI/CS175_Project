-- Lebanon says it deployed troops near its border with Syria Sunday after artillery shells hit a Lebanese border village. The war in Syria has been raging since March 2011 when protesters, partly inspired by Arab Spring uprisings in the region, began demonstrating for more freedom. Lebanon's National News Agency reported that a 13-year-old was killed when rockets from Syria hit the region Sunday. At least 124 people were killed in violence throughout Syria on Sunday, the Local Coordination Committees opposition network said. Lebanese President Michel Suleiman condemned the violence, saying in a statement on his website that rockets had fallen near Qasr's mosque.
