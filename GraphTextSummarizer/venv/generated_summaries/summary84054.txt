The storm comes on the heels of Typhoon Phanfone, which swept over southern Japan last week, washing three U.S. airmen out to sea off Okinawa. -- The latest and strongest in a string of powerful storms to hit Japan -- Vongfong -- slammed into Kyushu, the southernmost of the country's four main islands, Monday morning as it continued its destructive path across the country. Japan was previously saturated by storms Halong, Neoguri and Nakri. Vongfong first made landfall in Japan in Okinawa early Sunday. Police in Shizuoka said one man remained missing after three people were swept into water on Sunday at the city's port.
