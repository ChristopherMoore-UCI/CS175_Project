Kraby also responded to questions about the revelation by police Thursday that Breivik had made two calls to the police while on Utoya island on July 22. According to a police transcript of the calls, Breivik said: "Hello, my name is commander Anders Behring Breivik of the Norwegian anti-communist resistance movement." Police chief Sissel Hammer on Thursday confirmed that Breivik had made two calls, one to Nordre Buskerud district and another to Sondre Buskerud Police district. Breivik appeared in court to hear the arguments but the session was not open to the public or media. He said several survivors of the Utoya massacres had wanted to be present at the court hearing, but that the police had decided it was too risky in case they unwittingly revealed details of the case that would enable Breivik to alter his explanations.
