When he does, Pakistani officials said, Musharraf will be arrested in connection with the 2007 assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. Bhutto's assassination turned public opinion strongly against Musharraf in 2008 and led to his resignation and self-exile in London. "President Musharraf told me that although the possibility of arrest is there -- there is no way of knowing what will happen, and how dangerous the situation is, until one jumps into the situation head first," he said. Elections are set to take place in Pakistan next year; Musharraf intends to run. "I am coming, Pakistan," Musharraf told thousands of supporters via video link in the southern city of Karachi.
