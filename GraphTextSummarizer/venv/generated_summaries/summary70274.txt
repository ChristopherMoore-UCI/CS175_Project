A 50th-minute goal from striker Robert Vittek in Rustenburg had seemed set to settle a clash between two of the tournament's smaller nations -- Slovakia has a population of around 5.4 million; New Zealand has about 4.3 million people. New Zealand next play Italy in Nelspruit on Sunday, when Slovakia face Paraguay at Ellis Park in Johannesburg. -- New Zealand scored a last-gasp equalizer to deny Slovakia a victorious World Cup debut in South Africa on Tuesday. But a stubborn New Zealand side, returning to soccer's biggest stage for the first time since their debut in 1982, hit back in the third minute of time added on to secure the nation's first-ever point from their fourth World Cup finals game. Reid made a goal-saving challenge on Vittek in the 69th minute, and Slovakia's failure to capitalize on their possession gave New Zealand the chance to mount a late assault.
