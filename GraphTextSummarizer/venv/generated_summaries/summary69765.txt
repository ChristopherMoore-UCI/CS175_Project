"Reform is primarily focused on health care coverage and reducing health care costs, and even optimistic estimates predict that any proposal on the table will still leave millions without access to affordable care," said Rachel Ward, one of the authors of the "Deadly Delivery" report. "Obstacles to care are widespread, even though the USA spends more on health care than any other country and more on pregnancy and childbirth-related hospital costs, $86 billion, than any other type of hospital care," the rights group said. "This country's extraordinary record of medical advancement makes its haphazard approach to maternal care all the more scandalous and disgraceful," said Larry Cox, executive director of Amnesty International USA. Furthermore, Amnesty International said, one in four women do not receive adequate prenatal care, starting in the first trimester. In 2008, 64 million people were living in "shortage areas" for primary care, Amnesty International said.
