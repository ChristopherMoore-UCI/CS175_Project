Amer Deghayes, now 20, is the eldest of four Brighton youths known to have gone to fight in Syria. Washington says the targets it hit in Idlib belonged to a hardcore al Qaeda cell known as the "Khorosan Group." Deghayes, however, said his friend Kamara was, like him, a gunman in the al Qaeda-affiliated al-Nusra Front -- a rebel faction battling the Syrian regime but also designated a "terrorist" organization by the U.S. News of Kamara's death was just the latest chapter in the tale of four Brighton youngsters, who, fresh out of school, headed to war. Then, as last week with Kamara's death, it fell to the eldest of the Brighton jihadis Amer Deghayes to report back with the news. As the Skype signal with Amer Deghayes began to fade, he offered another detail to try and comfort Khadija Kamara, the mother of his fallen friend. She says she reported her son's trip to Brighton police but officers said they could not help coax him back.
