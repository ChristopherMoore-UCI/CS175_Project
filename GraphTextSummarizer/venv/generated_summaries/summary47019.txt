-- Mexico issued a hurricane warning for the southern Baja California peninsula Monday in preparation for Hurricane Jimena, a powerful Category 4 storm with winds near 155 mph (250 kph), the U.S. National Hurricane Center said. Forecasters expect Hurricane Jimena to approach the southwestern tip of Baja California's peninsula Tuesday. "It's not expected to change in strength very much during the next day or so," said Daniel Brown, a hurricane specialist at the center. Forecasters expect the storm to continue in a northwest motion and approach the southwestern tip of Baja California Tuesday, forecasters said. A hurricane warning means hurricane conditions are expected within 24 hours.
