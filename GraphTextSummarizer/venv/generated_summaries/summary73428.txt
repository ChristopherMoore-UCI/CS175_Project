To that end, Uhrman said 7,000 developers have signed up for Ouya accounts, from big publishers who create multi-million-selling titles like "Halo" down to the smaller independents. Others, some of whom have never made games before using Android, are crafting new titles, she said. Increasingly, gaming consoles are becoming all-in-one entertainment hubs for the living room, and Ouya will try to compete in that arena as well. During the hour-long interview, Topolsky pushed Uhrman on whether the Ouya, which will have 1GB of RAM and run on an Nvidia Tegra 3 chip, will be powerful enough to run the kind of immersive, expansive shooters that have made big gaming releases as lucrative as blockbuster movies. "The TV is the best screen for playing games," Uhrman said in an interview-style keynote with editor Joshua Topolsky of tech blog The Verge.
