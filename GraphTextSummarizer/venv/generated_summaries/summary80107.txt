-- Truck driver Kevin Roper has been charged with death by auto and four counts of assault by auto in connection with the crash last weekend that killed comedian James McNair and injured comedian Tracy Morgan. It's interesting that criminal statutes define culpability in part by the injuries suffered, but in this case, the "seriousness" of the bodily injury -- Tracy Morgan was left in critical condition, for example -- is apparent, which is why the state has charged Roper with a fourth-degree offense. Ultimately, for both assault and death by auto, the prosecution must prove reckless behavior beyond a reasonable doubt. Assault by auto also has the recklessness standard, but here the seriousness of injury also guides the degree of the crime charged. Homicide Roper has been charged with "death by auto" in connection with the killing of James McNair.
