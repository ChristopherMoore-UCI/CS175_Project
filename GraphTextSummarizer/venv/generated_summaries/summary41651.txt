" Mike blames the culture of cruise ships, and not Disney or the Bahamian police, for the lack of action over Rebecca's disappearance. While millions of people around the world take cruises every year, at least 168 people have vanished from cruise ships and ferries in international waters since 1995, according to the International Cruise Victims Association. In the early hours of March 22 this year, cruise ship worker Rebecca Coriam made a mysterious phonecall. Rebecca's parents are demanding new regulations similar to a new U.S. law which allows the FBI and U.S. Coast Guard to investigate cases of missing U.S. citizens regardless of where the ship is registered. "The law we want is what President Barack Obama signed up to last year in the U.S.," said Mike.
