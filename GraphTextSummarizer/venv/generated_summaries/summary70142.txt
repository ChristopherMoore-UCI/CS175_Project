The 50-year old Kagan has come under criticism from Republican senators who say that as dean of Harvard Law School, she actively tried to block military recruiters because of the Pentagon's "don't ask, don't tell" policy that bars openly gay and lesbians from military service. As Harvard Law School dean, Kagan supported other schools challenging a federal law -- known as the Solomon Amendment -- requiring that recruiters be given equal access or face the loss of federal funding. Pete Hegseth of the Army National Guard said Kagan "encouraged students to oppose and protest the presence of military recruiters on campus." Her outreach and graciousness "made a big difference in the lives of the small group of us veterans," said White, who was critical of other military members that opposed Kagan's nomination. -- Supreme Court nominee Elena Kagan's confirmation hearing by the Senate Judiciary Committee concluded Thursday with witnesses for and against the solicitor general, including former military members who slammed her handling of military recruiters on the Harvard University campus.
