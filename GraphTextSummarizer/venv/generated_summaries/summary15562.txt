Any concerns brought to our attention are thoroughly reviewed in accordance with institutional policies and applicable regulations." Stem cell breakthrough may be simple, fast, cheap The thriving science of stem cell research seeks to develop therapies to repair bodily damage and cure disease by being able to insert cells that can grow into whatever tissues or organs are needed. Before the technique described in Nature, the leading candidates for creating stem cells artificially were those derived from embryos and stem cells from adult cells that require the insertion of DNA to become reprogrammable. Increasing acidity was one of the most effective methods of turning mouse blood cells into STAP cells. He noted that induced pluripotent stem cells are already being explored in Japan in humans and the same "platforms" could be used for STAP cells. -- Scientists hailed a new method of making stem cells as a breakthrough.
