In a two-year mission likely to start in May, New Zealand personnel will  train Iraq security forces at the Taji Military Complex north of Baghdad, Key said. New Zealand has become the latest nation to join the international coalition fighting ISIS, with Prime Minister John Key telling lawmakers Tuesday 143 military personnel were deploying to Iraq in a non-combat role. Key said ISIS -- also known as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) --  posed a threat to stability in regions beyond the Middle East and New Zealand had "an obligation" to help support the rule of law internationally. New Zealand First leader Winston Peters said Key had made a "giant turnaround" since ruling out  a troop deployment. "There is definitely a risk in joining the international effort and that risk is first of all that New Zealand personnel in the region will become a more identifiable target," he told CNN.
