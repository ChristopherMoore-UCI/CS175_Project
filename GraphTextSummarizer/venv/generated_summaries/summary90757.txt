Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah is due to address a large rally Friday in the southern Lebanon town of Aita al Shaab, close to the border with Israel. There was a heightened security presence Friday in Beirut and other areas of Lebanon, but tensions appeared lower than on Thursday evening. Hezbollah's involvement in the Syrian conflict has angered some in Lebanon, and many Lebanese fear that the group could be the target of more attacks in future.

The explosion came about a month after a car bomb injured dozens of people in the pro-Hezbollah neighborhood of Bir El Abed in a southern Beirut suburb.
