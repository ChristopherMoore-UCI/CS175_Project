"I rowed across the Indian Ocean in 2009 and it was then that I thought up this journey (the London to London trip). She will then take a break for around six weeks before setting out across North America and onwards towards the finishing line on the banks of the River Thames in London. She has trained hard to build up her core strength and stamina as well as bracing herself for potential hazards along the way such as boat capsizes, shark attacks and extreme weather events like hurricanes. Outen is undertaking the 4,500 nautical mile challenge from the east coast of Japan to the west coast of Canada, as part of a larger voyage that will see her circumnavigate the globe without the aid of any mechanical engines.
