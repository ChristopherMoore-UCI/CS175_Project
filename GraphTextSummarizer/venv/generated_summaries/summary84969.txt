While her future husband was winning gold, Graf had the disappointment of sitting out the 1996 Olympics with a knee injury she aggravated while winning her seventh Wimbledon title earlier in the summer. " By the time the 2000 Olympics in Sydney came around, Graf had retired from tennis and a year later she married Agassi. It was his French Open triumph in 1999 that enabled Agassi to complete his own "Golden Grand Slam" -- one of only two men, Rafael Nadal is the other -- to win all the four majors and Olympic gold. Graf won singles gold for Germany when tennis was an exhibition event in Los Angeles in 1984 then followed it up with "official" gold at Seoul four years years later. The German also won a bronze in the women's doubles and completed a full set of Olympic medals after losing the gold medal match against Jennifer Capriati of the United States on the clay of Barcelona in the 1992 Olympics.
