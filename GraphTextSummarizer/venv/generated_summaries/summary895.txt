-- The Catholic Church is on the verge of declaring late Pope John Paul II a saint, a Vatican source familiar with the process told CNN on Tuesday. He was fast-tracked to beatification when he died in 2005, and became "the blessed" John Paul II barely six years after his death -- the fastest beatification in centuries. John Paul was pope from 1978 until his death in 2005. The committee that considers candidates for sainthood voted Tuesday to credit the late pope with a second miracle, the source said, asking not to be named discussing internal Vatican deliberations. Pope Benedict, now pope emeritus, ruled in 2010 that John Paul II had miraculously cured a French nun of Parkinson's disease.
