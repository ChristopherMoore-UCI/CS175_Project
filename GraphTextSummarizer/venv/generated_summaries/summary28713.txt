"This election demonstrates the progress that Sierra Leone has made in strengthening its democratic institutions since the end of the civil war in 2002," White House spokesman Jay Carney said in a statement. -- Sierra Leone's incumbent president won re-election and was sworn in for a second term, pledging to boost the economy of the nation scarred by years of civil war. Sierra Leone's economy was gutted by an 11-year civil war that ultimately left 50,000 dead or missing During the brutal war, which was funded using the so-called "blood diamonds," teenagers were placed under the influence of drugs to provoke violent behavior such as killing, raping and plundering. Supporters have credited him with improving infrastructure while critics have said he has not addressed rampant corruption. "Let us, as we celebrate, be mindful that the work starts today and every Sierra Leonean from all political parties, regions, ethnic group, age and religion is central to our agenda for prosperity," the president said.
