A 10-count indictment charges James Timothy Turner with conspiracy to defraud the United States, attempting to pay taxes with fictitious financial instruments, attempting to obstruct the Internal Revenue Service, failure to file federal tax returns and giving false testimony in a bankruptcy proceeding. According to the indictment, Turner allegedly tried to pay his 2008 taxes with a $300 million fake bond and assisted others trying to pay taxes with up to $100 billion dollars in fraudulent bonds. Prosecutors also said Turner gave seminars teaching others how to defraud the IRS and to file retaliatory liens against government officials. Mark Potok of the Southern Poverty Law Center said Turner's sovereign citizens group rejects the authority of the government and its ability to enforce laws and collect taxes. A well known leader of an anti-government "sovereign citizens" group was indicted Tuesday in Montgomery, Alabama, for tax crimes, the Justice Department announced.
