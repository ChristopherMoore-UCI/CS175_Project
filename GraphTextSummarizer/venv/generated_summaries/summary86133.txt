-- British Formula One team Williams will have an all-South American line-up next year, with Pastor Maldonado signing up to drive alongside Rubens Barrichello. "Since then, he has regularly reminded us of his unquestionable talent with some skilful wins, particularly during this year's GP2 championship," team principal Frank Williams said. "Of course, we already know Pastor from the time he spent with the team at the Abu Dhabi test, but we are very much looking forward to developing his talent over the winter and a fruitful season with him next year." Maldonado will be the first Venezuelan since Johnny Cecotto in 1984 to drive an F1 car when he lines up alongside Brazilian veteran Barrichello at the Bahrain Grand prix in March. Maldonado won the GP2 Series title this year, becoming the first driver to win six successive races, and tested for Williams in Abu Dhabi.
