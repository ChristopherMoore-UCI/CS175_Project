"I am not happy about house arrest," Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Stephanie Saunter said during a hearing last week. The actress, who turns 25 on July 2, has managed to avoid more than a few days in jail despite two drunken-driving convictions, a long list of probation violations and the recent theft conviction. " "It would appear that the defendant's criminal conduct is increasing in seriousness and severity," the probation report said, yet it suggested she serve her sentence on probation and not in jail. The electronic monitoring bracelet was removed from Lohan's ankle about 40 minutes before she was officially freed, spokesman Steve Whitmore said. The actress was sentenced last month to 120 days in jail after she entered a guilty plea to stealing a necklace from a jewelry store in January.
