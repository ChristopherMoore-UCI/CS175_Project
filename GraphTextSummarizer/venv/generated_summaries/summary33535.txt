Brown's sentence was stiffer because his driver's license was suspended after he pleaded no contest last summer to another charge of driving under the influence, Los Angeles city attorney's spokesman Frank Mateljan said. Although the judge sentenced Brown to 55 days behind bars for his second conviction in a year for driving under the influence, he will likely be free in eight or nine days, according to Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department spokesman Steve Whitmore. A Los Angeles police officer smelled "a strong scent of alcohol" when he approached Brown during the Ventura Boulevard traffic stop last October, a police spokesman said. A lawyer for the singer said he has accepted responsibility, and is committed to his sobriety. Good behavior rules and jail overcrowding guidelines add up to a sharp reduction in actual time served for county inmates, Whitmore said.
