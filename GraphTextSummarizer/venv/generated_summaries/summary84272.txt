-- Dozens of African Union soldiers have been killed in two weeks of fierce fighting in Somali capital of Mogadishu, clashes that resulted in significant gains against local and foreign extremists, according to an African Union official familiar with the scale of those losses. One U.N. humanitarian official said on Friday voiced urgent concern about the "increased displacement" caused by the fighting and the effects of drought there, said Valerie Amos, under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs . "I again urge all parties to the conflict and AMISOM (the African Union peacekeeping mission in Somalia) to comply with international humanitarian law in order to minimize harm to the civilians," Amos said. "This loss of life comes in an intently meaningful and honorable victory, one which will ensure that many more lives will be saved in the long run," Wafula Wamunyinyi, a senior AMISOM official, told reporters in Nairobi, Kenya. " On February 23, Burundian forces successfully took two key Al-Shabaab positions in fierce fighting -- the former Ministry of Defense buildings (known as Gashindiga) and the former milk factory, according to Mugisha.
