The bill, originally introduced December 10, would "prohibit, as an unfair and deceptive act or practice, the promotion, marketing, and advertising of any post-season NCAA Division I football game as a national championship game unless such game is the culmination of a fair and equitable playoff system." Barton said Thursday that those watching the championship game are being "bamboozled." "This year's BCS failure proves once again that it's time for college football to come up with a fair way to determine its champion," he said in a statement. When the BCS computer system put Florida and Oklahoma in this year's national championship game, the annual back-and-forth over whether to have a college football playoff system was reignited. Florida came out on top over Oklahoma in Thursday night's BCS championship game. "We need a playoff," Obama told reporters after being asked about Florida's 24-14 victory over Oklahoma in Thursday night's BCS championship game.
