Fans honor Paul Walker Heisserer, too, was left in shock by Walker's death. Eric Heisserer: It started with (a) short story born out of my time in Houston. "He had gushed to me about the new offers he was getting from people who'd seen his performance," says Eric Heisserer, the first-time director of "Hours," which opens Friday. The "Hours" writer and director, his voice frequently quivering with emotion during a 20-minute phone interview, talked with CNN about working with Walker and the making of the film. He had gushed to me about the new offers he was getting from people who'd seen his performance in "Hours," and his career was finally going in a direction that he was excited about for the first time in many years.
