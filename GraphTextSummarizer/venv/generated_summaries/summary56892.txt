Trailing 7-6 4-3, China's Peng -- in her maiden grand slam singles semifinal -- retired and it gave Denmark's Caroline Wozniacki a place in the final against Serena Williams. Peng couldn't serve out the first set and also led by a break early in the second against Wozniacki, who revealed that she had been bed ridden herself the last couple of days. Peng, who underwent heart surgery as a young junior, had to lean against the backboard on center court for support when she was first overcome by the pain while holding a break point in the final game of the match. "You have to feel for Peng Shuai, being in her first grand slam semifiinal and having to leave the court like that," 2013 Wimbledon champion Marion Bartoli, acting as a pundit for Britain's Sky Sports, said. A victory for Williams and she would tie legends Martina Navratilova and Chris Evert in grand slam singles titles.
