"It is very, very sad," said zoo director Dag Encke. Polar bears are known to eat their young if they sense any danger or interference. They saw the bears' mother, Vera, nudging the dead bear with her nose and observing it -- and as of Wednesday, they said, the dead bear was nowhere to be seen. "We have to worry more about the surviving young animal and take care that the polar bear with her baby is not disturbed," Encke said. -- Concerns were growing Wednesday for a polar bear born last month at a German zoo after its twin died and was possibly eaten by its mother.
