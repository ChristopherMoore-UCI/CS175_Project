The 15-year-old stunned 12th seed Dominica Cibulkova with a 6-1 4-6 6-4 triumph in her first grand slam match, becoming the youngest winner of a U.S. Open tie since Anna Kournikova in 1996. As is the custom for breakout U.S. sport stars, a talk show appearance is likely to be never far away -- and Bellis knows which host she wants to be sat opposite. The San Francisco-born Bellis shone on the big stage, brushing Australian Open finalist Cibulkova aside in the opening set before battling back from a break down to clinch the decider. A first round win at this year's U.S. Open comes with a check for $60,000, not that Bellis will be able to cash in. Next up for Bellis is a second round contest with Kazakhstan's Zarina Diyas.
