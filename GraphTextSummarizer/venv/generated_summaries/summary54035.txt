Not surprisingly, last month, an editorial comment in the largest English newspaper in India, The Times of India, announced: "Barack's got a bee in his bonnet about India - the current president does go on a bit about India being, ahem, a threat to American professionals, Indian children studying maths earnestly while the Yankees doodle their days away, the US getting 'Bangalored', supposedly losing jobs to harder-working Indians. The subsequent collapse of the arranged marriage between Obama's administration and Pakistan's military leadership, is viewed in Delhi as a good development for India's security. When Obama visited India for the very first time, in 2010, a senior politician personally supervised the design of the new uniform that the Parliament's security officers were to wear, and she also briefed the members of the parliament how they should behave in Obama's presence so that they looked elegant. But the scholarly view in Delhi has long been different: Democrats may be handsome and clever, but Republican presidents suit India better. Indian national elections, which are due in 2014, unless the government lead by the Indian National Congress falls before its time, is a festive circus of dozens of parties, most of which are actually family businesses which will be transferred by the elders to their children.
