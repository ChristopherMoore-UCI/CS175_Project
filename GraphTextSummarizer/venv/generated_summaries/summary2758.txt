" "Religion has played a negative role in U.S. foreign policy in the past, especially in relations with the Muslim world," notes Thomas Wright, executive director of studies for the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and the report's project director. The report, "Engaging Religious Communities Abroad: A New Imperative for U.S. Foreign Policy," finds the key challenge for America internationally is to "understand the role of religion in world affairs and to constructively engage with religious communities around the world. " The report notes the speech "set the stage for a new departure in U.S. foreign policy toward Muslim communities" but "the scope must be much broader." "Engaging Islam is only one very crucial component of a larger challenge ... engaging the multitude of religious communities across the world as an integral part of our foreign policy." But citing President Obama's Cairo speech to the Muslim world in June 2009, Wright said "the United States has greatly improved its capacity to understand religious dynamics in world affairs. Without "more serious and thoughtful engagement" with religion, the report says, "U.S. foreign policy will miss important opportunities."
