The initial response to Haiyan as the international aid effort ramped up was a success -- no outbreak of disease, no widespread breakdown in law and order and enough supplies of emergency food and clean water. Half a year on Coming back, almost seven months later, I was prepared for the worst and half expecting to see a city still in shock, lacking the basics of food, water and housing. What was left was a landscape of rubble, rain and mud, stripped and torn-down trees, smashed vehicles and isolated concrete shells that had been homes. New accommodation must be able to withstand Haiyan-like wind speeds, and be built on ground not vulnerable to storm surges and landslides. The main commercial district is very much open for business, the roads are cleared and busy and the power companies are restoring supply.
