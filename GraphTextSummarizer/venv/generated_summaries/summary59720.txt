The band's lead singer, Antonis Antoniou, says that in his view music and art can help to heal old wounds: "We strongly believe that art and music can reconcile and reunite people ... especially in parts of the world where problems are between neighboring countries. For instance, here in Cyprus, the two communities share the same culture, and people used to live happily together listening to the same songs -- in many cases sung in both Greek and Turkish. "The Green Line gives the city a strange energy ... in a good way," says Eleni Xenou, a writer who lives in city. Many younger people in Nicosia see hope for the city and believe that reconciliation, while difficult, is certainly possible. In the old town of Cyprus's capital Nicosia, something subtle and unexpected is happening.
