How they did the study Valley and colleagues reported on a different crystal from early Earth in 2001 from the same Jack Hills area. They determined that age to be 4.4 billion years old. "Although incredibly laborious, their analytical technique can be applied to not only additional terrestrial zircons but also to zircons from meteorites and lunar samples, to perhaps tease out a detailed thermal history of magmatism and impacts," Samuel Bowring, professor of geology at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, wrote in an accompanying article in Nature Geoscience. The first rocks that have been found deposited by water are about 3.8 billion years old, Valley said. " A brief history of Earth Our planet is thought to be about 4.5 billion years old, but the oldest fossils are about 3.5 billion years old. "What we've learned is that the Earth cooled much more quickly that people had thought," Valley said.
