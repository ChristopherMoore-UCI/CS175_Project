It is a controversial decision for President Francois Hollande's Socialist Party, which attacked former President Nicolas Sarkozy when his party dismantled Roma camps around France in 2010. -- Citing "unsanitary and unsecure living conditions," French Interior Minister Manuel Valls ordered police early Monday to dismantle a Roma camp set up along suburban railway tracks in Evry, south of Paris, and expel 72 inhabitants, including 19 children. " During his presidential campaign this year, Hollande sent a letter to Roma support groups saying that when camps were dismantled, alternative solutions would be proposed. The European Commission investigated Sarkozy's government for abuses after the dismantling and destruction of Roma camps in 2010. At the time, Roma who voluntarily left France were given 300 euros in cash per adult and 150 euros per child.
