Tens of thousands of Bangladeshi students and armed forces held up red and green colored placards in Dhaka's National Parade Ground last month to create the huge Bangladeshi national symbol. -- Bangladesh has smashed a record set by Pakistan last year by forming the world's largest human flag, Guinness World Records has confirmed. On December 16, a total of 27,117 people held the flag together for at least five minutes, following instructions provided by Guinness World Records. An accounting firm oversaw the record-breaking attempt and submitted materials to Guinness World Records, which verified the record. The formation broke a record set in October 2012, in Pakistan, when 24,000 people assembled a flag in the city of Lahore.
