Online travel giants Expedia, Travelocity and Orbitz are all offering sales on Hawaii flights, hotels and activities, and some luxury hotels have rooms for less than $150 a night. Now with the administration of President Obama, who spent part of his childhood in Hawaii, there is a renewed interest for tourists to visit, travel experts say. Traditionally, economical travelers shy away from Hawaii because of the high flight cost, travel experts said. In the meantime, Hawaii tourism groups want to change American and international travelers' impression that a trip there is too expensive. "We might have done something on the mainland, something more low-key, but the fact that it was inexpensive was a big factor for us to go again," said Stetson, who is taking his wife and two young boys in May. Outdoor enthusiasts, lovebirds and families prudently resisting the urge to visit Hawaii, say aloha to majorly discounted airfares and hotel rates -- many hitting rock-bottom prices -- this year.
