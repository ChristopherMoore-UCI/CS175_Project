Sentenced to life in prison, man hopes new clemency rules will get him out Rules change means more drug offenders eligible for clemency The attorney general, who has said he wants to stay in office until late this year, is seeking to reduce prison population and loosen mandatory sentencing rules for nonviolent drug crimes. The Justice Department proposal, set to be voted on next month, would reduce sentences by about 23 months on average for those already in prison and who qualify. The commission voted in April to reduce drug sentences for future nonviolent offenders. The department made its pitch Tuesday before the U.S. Sentencing Commission to make some current prisoners retroactively eligible for reduced sentences.
