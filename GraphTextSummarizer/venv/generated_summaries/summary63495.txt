Sam has recently tasted the flip side of stardom as well -- as a number of people, among them current and former NFL players, took to Twitter to rip ESPN for airing footage of him kissing his boyfriend, Vito Cammisano, right after he got the call from the Rams. Yet the fact that Sam was the only player at the podium a few minutes later speaks to the fact that he was extraordinary, even among NFL draftees. As a selection in the seventh and last round in the NFL draft, Sam playing for the Rams or any other NFL team this upcoming season is hardly a lock. " Kevin Demoff, the St. Louis Rams chief operating officer, said the organization discussed the ramifications of picking a man who could become the NFL's first openly gay player. And with standouts like Chris Long and Kendall Langford, the fact that St. Louis boasts one of the league's best defensive lines -- the place where Sam starred at the University of Missouri -- makes his task even harder.
