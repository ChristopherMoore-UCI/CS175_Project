It's not easy to squeeze 40 years of show into one anniversary special, but "Saturday Night Live" gave it a go on Sunday night. Betty White makes out with Bradley Cooper "The Californians" skit was already pretty awesome, with Taylor Swift and Kerry Washington joining cast members past and present (Laraine Newman even showed up!), but then 93-year-old White locked lips with 40-year-old Cooper. Will Ferrell as Alex Trebek is always at his best when paired with Darrell Hammond's borderline-NSFW Sean Connery, but this episode also gave us the delight that is Kate McKinnon as Justin Bieber and Alec Baldwin as Tony Bennett. That was the perfect segue into No. 5: "Kanye, sit down," a reference to the artist's recent lament that Beck should not have beat out Beyonce for best album at the 2015 Grammys. Why 'Saturday Night Live' is still awesome
