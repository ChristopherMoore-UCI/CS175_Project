Castle Of Brest Once owned by King Richard II of England, the impressive medieval fortress is the city's most important landmark that, by sheer fortune, was spared from destruction during the heavy bombing of World War II. " From July 13, Brest will be transformed into five "villages," representing this year's five honorary countries: Mexico, Norway, Indonesia, Morocco and Russia -- all of whom are sending a minor flotilla of historical boats. Brest was sadly all but destroyed in the "Battle of Brest" during World War II. "There is no other festival quite like it if you like classic boats," said Adam Purser, who has sailed from England to Brest three times since 2000. Oceanopolis For years Brest has been the European capital of oceanography.
