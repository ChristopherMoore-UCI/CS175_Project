The Lille prosecutor's stance on the case -- in which investigators argued that Strauss-Kahn organized or encouraged sex parties involving prostitutes -- isn't new. "I don't consider myself as the organizer of any party whatsoever," he said last week, adding that he had never asked anyone to organize parties for him. Former International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn should be acquitted of aggravated pimping charges because of insufficient evidence, a prosecutor told a French criminal court Tuesday at the trial of the onetime potential contender for the French presidency. Before that scandal erupted, he had been on track to run for the French presidency -- an election that his Socialist Party later won with Francois Hollande as its candidate. In testimony last week, he acknowledged that the sexual encounters were organized in such a way that they could fit his agenda, but he denied organizing the parties or knowing that the women involved in the parties were prostitutes.
