Heavy rains caused the landslide, which buried about 16 homes in the city of Manizales early Saturday morning, Red Cross spokesman Leandro Soto said. -- Rescuers searched for survivors Sunday after a landslide in northwestern Colombia killed at least 18 people and trapped dozens of others, Red Cross officials said. Thirteen people have been rescued from the rubble, Soto said, including five whom crews pulled out Saturday night, 15 hours after the landslide. Workers were manually removing rubble as rescue dogs searched for signs of life, said Cesar Uruena, national relief director for the Colombian Red Cross. We are still hoping to find more people alive," Soto said.
