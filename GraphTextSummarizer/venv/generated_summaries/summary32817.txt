" Many Americans know of Pacquiao from the ring or his Hewlett-Packard commercials or his appearances singing on late night TV. Pacquiao, 33, will earn many millions for this fight against Marquez, an often overlooked superstar who is rated by Ring as the fifth-best fighter pound-for-pound. It's not unusual for a boxer to think he won a close match, but after a fight against Michael Katsidis last year, Marquez wore a shirt that said on the front, "Marquez beat Pacquiao twice!!" And earlier this week Pacquiao said Marquez had disrespected him and he was out to prove who was better, not for a huge payday. And Marquez catches him after that when Pacquiao is off balance."
