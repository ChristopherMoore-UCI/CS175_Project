" House Speaker John Boehner also sounded off on the jobs report, knocking Democrats for refusing to vote on "dozens of good jobs bills" that Republicans passed in his chamber. Boehner also accused President Barack Obama and Senate Democrats of presiding "over a new normal of flat wages, higher prices, and too many part-time jobs." " Unemployment falls below 6% for first time since 2008 While Democrats as well said there was more work to be done, the Obama administration championed the better-than-expected jobs numbers. " "Slow job growth may be good enough for Democrats, but Republicans know we can do better," Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said in a statement. Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer pointed out the jobs numbers in a statement and said he was "disappointed" with House Republican obstructionism.
