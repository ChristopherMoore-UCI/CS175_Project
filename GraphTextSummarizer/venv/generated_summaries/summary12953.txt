Read more about CNN Hero Liz McCartney and her efforts in St. Bernard Parish For McCartney, that means helping to address the housing needs of thousands of families still living in Federal Emergency Management Agency trailers or temporary housing. Watch how McCartney's organization helped one St. Bernard resident move home Caserta and her 17-year-old son signed up to volunteer with the graveyard shift because "it will give us a chance to help another family out and give them the hope that I feel." Like countless other residents from St. Bernard Parish, a community just east of New Orleans, Caserta lost everything in the storm. And thanks to her organization's efforts to bring the community back, Caserta and many other St. Bernard Parish families are optimistic, too. Liz McCartney runs the St. Bernard Project, which helps families rebuild in a parish hit by Hurricane Katrina.
