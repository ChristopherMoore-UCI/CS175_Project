It is the bane of America and Americans that too often, those who best grasp the language of hatred and fear are those who are most likely to lead. But we cannot allow our emotions to be ignited by hidden messages of fear and hatred. Gingrich says his words were misinterpreted, that anybody who criticizes his characterization of President Obama is attacking the very fiber of American democracy. Hatred and fear have deep roots in the American heart. But where literary poets speak of love and loss, the lawyer vindicates and the politician aims to take the reins of power.
