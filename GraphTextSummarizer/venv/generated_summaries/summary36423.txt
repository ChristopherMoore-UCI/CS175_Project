According to Israeli sources, more than 40,000 Bedouins would have been affected by the plan; Bedouin elders estimate the total at more than 70,000. The Prawer Plan was based on an effort to better integrate Israel's Bedouin population into Israeli society. The Cabinet also approved more economic development in the Bedouin sector of the Negev, the government said at the time. The controversial plan would have involved destroying "unrecognized" villages in the Negev, and resettling the displaced Bedouin citizens into "recognized" villages. In a statement Thursday, Begin said he has suggested that the law be halted, but efforts to develop the Bedouin communities in the Negev continue.
