Like most people who use computers, the information in your private message or Web search is being sold to an advertiser. My friend Jim Trammell, a college professor in High Point, North Carolina, who is happily married to a woman, once wrote a paper about how homosexual Christians are covered in evangelical magazines, which required online research. " Alyssa Richter, a magazine editor in Lexington, Kentucky, was recently looking for baby shower gifts for a pregnant friend. "I felt like I was getting ads about gay-friendly vacations and dating services for months," he told me. Right on cue, her Web browser became flooded with neverending ads for parenting magazines and onesies.
