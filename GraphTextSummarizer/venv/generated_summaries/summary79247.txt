Before the attack, Kravetz took a bus from Olympia to Montesano, CNN affiliate KOMO reported. Steven D. Kravetz, 34, was arrested at his mother's home in Olympia without incident, Undersheriff Rick Scott with the Grays Harbor County Sheriff's Department said. Scott said the man gave his name as Michael Thomas when the officer approached him shortly after noon Friday inside the Grays Harbor County Courthouse in Montesano. The poster said Kravetz could be with Roberta Dougherty, whom CNN affiliates in the Seattle area identified as Kravetz's mother. CNN's Phil Gast, Deanna Proeller, Greg Morrison and Maria P. White contributed to this report.
