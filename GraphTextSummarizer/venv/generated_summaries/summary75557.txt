"Aaron had an unbeatable combination of political insight, technical skill, and intelligence about people and issues," wrote his friend Cory Doctorow, co-editor of tech blog Boing Boing. Meanwhile, by Monday afternoon scores of people had posted tributes to Swartz on Reddit and on a memorial site, Remember Aaron Swartz. The suicide of Internet activist Aaron Swartz continued to send shock waves Monday through the hacker community, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the larger online world. Swartz, 26, faced allegations that he stole millions of online documents -- mostly scholarly papers -- from MIT through the university's computer network. Using the hashtag #pdftribute, hundreds of academic researchers also posted their papers online via Twitter Sunday and Monday to honor Swartz's memory.
