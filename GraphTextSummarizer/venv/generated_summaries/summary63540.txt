All 468 New York City subway stations have been searched, and aviation, harbor and canine officers are mobilized and deployed periodically, the New York Police Department said. Avonte Oquendo, 14, was last seen on surveillance video running out of Center Boulevard School in Long Island City on the afternoon of October 4. Police say Avonte was last seen wearing a gray-striped shirt, black jeans and black sneakers. David Perecman, the Oquendo family's attorney, told CNN last week that he is looking into how Avonte was able to leave school grounds unsupervised. -- The reward for the safe return of an autistic New York teen grew to $77,500 Monday as divers joined hundreds of officers who have been searching for him nonstop for more than a week.
