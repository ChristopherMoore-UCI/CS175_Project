The Alabama law is one of a number of several state laws aiming to crack down on illegal immigration, and has become part of a nationwide skirmish between state federal officials over who controls immigration enforcement. A federal appeals court has blocked some components, however, including one requiring Alabama officials to check the immigration status of children in public schools. Cox, of the ACLU, said the biggest problem of the new bill was the requirement that the Alabama Department of Homeland Security post online the names of illegal immigrants that appear in state courts. The state's governor will have the final say, with the power to sign the bill into law or veto it. The center is one of the plaintiffs in a federal lawsuit against Alabama's immigration law.
