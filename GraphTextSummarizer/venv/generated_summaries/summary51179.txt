-- West Virginia Gov. Joe Manchin will announce on Friday his pick to temporarily fill the U.S. Senate seat left vacant by the death of Democratic Sen. Robert Byrd. Byrd was the longest serving member ever in Congressional history. Manchin, a popular two-term Democratic governor, told reporters this month that he "would highly consider" seeking the seat himself -- not surprising given Manchin was thought to be interested in running for the Senate in 2012, when the election is currently scheduled. The GOP needs to re-take 10 Senate seats to regain the majority. If the contest is held this November, it would add another possible Senate pick up potential for the Republicans and would help their odds at possibly retaking control of the chamber.
