Elisabeth Fritzl and all but three of her children lived in the specially designed cellar beneath her father's home in Amstetten, Austria, west of Vienna. Fritzl explained Elisabeth's disappearance in 1984 by saying the 18-year-old girl had run away from home. State Prosecutor Gerhard Sedlacek said Michael Fritzl died from lack of medical care. Elisabeth told police the infant was one of twins who died a few days after birth. Fritzl, 73, was charged in November with incest and the repeated rape of his daughter, Elisabeth, for 24 years.
