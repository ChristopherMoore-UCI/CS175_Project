It is unfortunate that our medical system pays doctors handsomely to do medical procedures, but does not reimburse well for talking to, counseling and spending time with patients. My greatest concern is many doctors and patients fail to comprehend just how complicated medicine can be. Patients need to take an interest in their own health. This is often due to a lack of communication during the consenting process -- when doctors explain the possible outcomes or side effects -- and can lead to patient anger when things go badly. The survey found that although two-thirds of doctors agree they should share serious medical errors with their patients, one-third did not completely agree.
