-- Libyan prosecutors have gathered "great evidence" against the son of former dictator Moammar Gadhafi, International Criminal Court chief prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo said Thursday, reopening the controversial question of where Saif al-Islam Gadhafi will be tried. Drawing a contrast with the regime under Moammar Gadhafi, El-Keib said Libya had "definitely changed tremendously -- it's 180 degrees (different) when it comes to human rights and respecting human rights. Libyan interim Prime Minister Abdurrahim El-Keib told CNN in an exclusive interview that Gadhafi could "absolutely" get a fair trial in Libya and that he should face justice there. "The brutal death of Moammar Gadhafi deprived the Libyan people of their right to justice and their right to the truth. Saif al-Islam Gadhafi was facing an arrest warrant from the court for alleged crimes against humanity at the time fighters from the Libyan city of Zintan captured him.
