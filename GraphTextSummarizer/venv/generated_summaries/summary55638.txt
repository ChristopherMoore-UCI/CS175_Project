"Mr. Buchanan is a very selfish person, and in my opinion people who go to Congress have got to do good for the people they represent," Kazran says. "In short it said that Mr. Buchanan had nothing to do with it." Kazran's lawyer, Robert Stok, says it was clearly an effort to lean on Kazran when he was vulnerable. Salvatore Rosa, a former chief financial officer for Buchanan's business interests for five years, said in a recent deposition conducted by Buchanan's attorney that he submitted a federal whistle-blower complaintÂ to the IRS with allegations that Buchanan violated federal tax laws, including tax evasion, fraud and conspiracy to commit tax evasion. " Kazran took his detailed allegations to the Federal Elections Commission, which was already looking into Buchanan's campaign finances. People who never gave money to campaigns were suddenly writing big checks to Buchanan for Congress and, according to Kazran, getting reimbursed from the dealership.
