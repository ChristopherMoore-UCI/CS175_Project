As of last month, the Times' app for Apple devices had been downloaded 7.8 million times, she said. The Times erected a pay wall on its site March 28, forcing readers to subscribe if they wanted to click on more than 20 articles per month. The venerable news outlet announced that 100,000 people had signed up for digital subscriptions in the first month since they were offered.

Daley believes that Web-only subscription rate could be hard for the Times to sustain and grow.
