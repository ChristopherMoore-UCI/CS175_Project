One of the busiest freeways in the country, the 405 is one of two mountain passes in the heart of Los Angeles and is the major coastal artery connecting southern California with the rest of the state. That's because southern California is notorious for its love affair with the car and its reluctance to embrace public transportation. The project also calls for adding a car-pool lane in each direction, creating "the largest HOV system in the world" at 48.6 miles in length between the San Fernando Valley and Orange County, said Mike Miles, the California Department of Transportation's director for Los Angeles and Ventura counties. Los Angeles International Airport is urging travelers to get there by public transit, especially rail, or to stay at nearby hotels for early morning flights. -- Los Angeles' Interstate 405 will reopen as soon as 11:30 a.m. (2:30 p.m. ET) Sunday, more than 17 hours ahead of schedule, Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa said Sunday.
