" McDaniel, a conservative who has the grassroots support of the tea party, the Club for Growth and Sarah Palin among others, is challenging Cochran, a septuagenarian, who has the backing of such groups as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Mississippi Conservatives, a super PAC headed by the nephew of former Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour. Tea party conservatives -- who were dealt setbacks in Republican primaries in Kentucky and other states in the spring -- are banking on Mississippi as the best chance to eject another "establishment" Republican. Native son McDaniel is the grandson of country music star Luke McDaniel, who went by the stage name "Jeff Daniels." He eventually earned a law degree from Ole Miss and married Jill, an educator and former beauty pageant queen who was once "Miss Mississippi." Such things are important to folks in McDaniel's hometown of Ellisville, Mississippi, population: 4,448.
