The record will be Wilco's first on their own label, dBpm -- shorthand for decibels per minute -- and Tweedy's third set of new songs with his longest-running lineup: bassist John Stirratt, guitarist Nels Cline, drummer Glenn Kotche, keyboard player Mikael Jorgenson and multi-instrumentalist Pat Sansome. There are also two country-flavored songs, the spectral ballad "Black Moon" and the jauntier "Whole Love." "Whole Love" grew out of "a chord progression I found interesting," he notes. The group has recorded more than 20 songs, Tweedy says, "out of the things I had coming in, which was somewhere in the fifties and sixties. After Wilco finished touring last year, "we took a little more time off the road than we normally do," says Tweedy.
