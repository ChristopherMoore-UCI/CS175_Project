Action man of climate change: Horn is hoping to inspire a new generation of leaders. It's a knowledge he said he has gained through hard experience; he lost the tips of fingers to frost bite in the Arctic and claims to have narrowly avoided execution at the hands of militia in DR Congo. -- "The Earth is just too small," sighed South African adventurer Mike Horn, one of the few people on the planet who can get away with saying such a statement. That something else is pursuing a different type of adventure: motivating a new generation to take action to conserve the planet in the face of climate change. He's equally tired of adventures or projects that just raise awareness of climate change.
