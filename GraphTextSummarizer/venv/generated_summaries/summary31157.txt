The International Energy Agency estimates CCS could reduce carbon dioxide emissions from power plants by more than 85 percent. In principle that's possible because the government will receive the income from dirty power plants who will have to buy their emissions. "The problem is that the price of maybe €35 ($54) or €40 ($62) per ton of carbon dioxide will not be enough to fund the gap in the extra estimated cost of these new power plants," explains Professor Haszeldine. Burning coal contributes half of the excess carbon dioxide (CO2) polluting the earth's atmosphere, a statistic not lost on the hundreds of climate change protesters camping in a grassy field near Kingsnorth power station in Kent, England this week. Depleted oil and gas reservoirs are currently the most practical place to store large volumes of carbon emissions.
