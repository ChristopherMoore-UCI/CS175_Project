Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan visited the Van region Saturday, as a heavy snowstorm hampered rescue efforts. On Thursday, tensions boiled over just yards from the rescue operation near the rubble of the Bayram Hotel, when a small crowd of protesters confronted Turkish government officials, demanding the resignation of the Van governor. " Frustration from earthquake survivors is palpable on the streets of Van, where almost all of the shops are closed after the earthquakes. The death toll from Wednesday's 5.6-magnitude earthquake in eastern Turkey has risen to 40, the government said Sunday. For decades, the region has been the main battlefield of a long-running guerrilla war between Kurdish separatist rebels from the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) and Turkish security forces.
