CNN affiliate KTLA-TV in Los Angeles, citing a U.S. Forest Service official, reported the fire began when a car caught fire. Authorities evacuated the canyon Sunday after the fire broke out in Angeles National Forest, an urban recreation area near Los Angeles that is popular with hikers, campers and off-road vehicle enthusiasts. The U.S. Forest Service in California said on its Twitter feed it expected a "very active" fire because of low humidity and high temperatures. Inciweb said the cause of the fire was under investigation. Between 10,000 and 12,000 people use the area during an average holiday weekend, according to Inciweb, the government fire-tracking website.
