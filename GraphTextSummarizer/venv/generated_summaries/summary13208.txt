Just days after the webcam incident in 2010, Clementi committed suicide by jumping off the George Washington Bridge, which connects New Jersey and Manhattan. The proposed law would require schools that receive federal student aid "to create policies prohibiting the harassment of any student," said Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-New Jersey. -- The man with whom Tyler Clementi had a sexual encounter is soon expected to take the stand in the trial of a former Rutgers University student accused of spying on Clementi. Ravi, 20, now faces a 15-count indictment in Clementi's death that includes hate crime charges, charges of invasion of privacy, bias intimidation, tampering with physical evidence, witness tampering and hindering apprehension or prosecution. The deal offered by Middlesex County prosecutors would have required the former student to undergo 600 hours of community service, counseling and to dispose of any information that could identify the man who appeared in the web video with Clementi.
