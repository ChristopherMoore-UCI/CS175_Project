"The high number of new amphibian species found is a sign of hope, even with the serious threat of extinction that this animal group faces in many other regions of the country and the world, " says Jose Vicente Rodriguez Mahecha, Scientific Director of CI-Colombia, who was part of the team that discovered the new species. The sensitivity of these species to low level environmental threats can also act as a barometer for human health. The new species were discovered as part of a CI program aimed at assessing the ecological health of a given area. A recent scientific expedition in Colombia's mountainous Darien region has unearthed 10 new species of amphibians, an environmental organization said. The region is, however, not immune to modern threats.
