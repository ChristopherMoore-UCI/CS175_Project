The actress was ordered to serve 90 days in jail for missing alcohol counseling sessions in violation of her probation. Actress Lindsay Lohan showed little emotion as a deputy put her in handcuffs in a Beverly Hills, California, courtroom Tuesday morning to take her to jail to begin what it expected to be a two-week stay. Lohan should be released from jail after between 13 to 15 days "unless something unusual happens," Whitmore said. Revel ordered that Lohan not be allowed to leave jail on a work-release or house-release program or with electronic monitoring during her sentence. Lohan must enter a substance-abuse rehabilitation program within 24 hours of leaving jail, Revel said.
