" The President's comments come one week after a Dallas man who recently returned from a trip to West Africa became the first person diagnosed with Ebola in the United States. After meeting with health and national security aides, Obama told reporters the White House is developing protocols to screen airline passengers "both at the source and here in the United States," an indication that tougher restrictions on those who have visited West Africa are coming after an infected Dallas man entered the country on a commercial flight. President Barack Obama plans to heap "a lot of pressure" on foreign leaders to do more to fight the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, he said Monday. A nurse in Spain on Monday became the first woman to contract Ebola outside Africa. Obama downplayed the chances of Ebola spreading within the United States, calling the odds of an epidemic here "extremely low."
