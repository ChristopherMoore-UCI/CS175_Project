-- Two U.S. lawmakers have urged U.S. Army Secretary Peter Geren to recognize 350 American soldiers held as slaves by Nazi Germany during World War II, saying "these heroes have not received the recognition and honor they deserve. "More of our men died, so fast that you couldn't keep track of their numbers," Acevedo wrote on April 19, 1945, four days before he was liberated by advancing U.S. troops. Both congressmen have pushed for a congressional resolution to honor the 350 soldiers held at Berga an der Elster, a subcamp of Buchenwald where dozens of American soldiers were beaten, starved and killed. He says he was unable to keep track of the dead in the final days because soldiers were dying too fast.
