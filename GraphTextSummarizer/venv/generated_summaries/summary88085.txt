Hiring a car from Kuwait he drove into Iraq during the war there in 2003 to rescue animals from Baghdad zoo. He prepared a document that was presented to the United Nations as a draft resolution to make all wildlife parks and conservation areas protected in times of war and their abuse classified as a war crime. He admits it was more naivete rather than bravery, but once he had managed to get the zoo under some sort of control (which had only around 30 animals left), he ventured out to save even more animals. Creating relationships with people has been just as important as cultivating refuges for animals. After years of negotiation with the local chief of the land next to Anthony's reserve, he was able to persuade the local community to convert their own land into conservation areas, so they too could benefit from eco-tourism.
