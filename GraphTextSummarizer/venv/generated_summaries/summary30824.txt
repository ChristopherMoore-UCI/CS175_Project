It means you have the support of fiscal conservatives (Coast and Upstate), social conservatives (Upstate and all around), transplanted retirees (Upstate and Coastal Low Country), business owners (Statewide) and veterans (Midlands and Coast). Rick Perry and Newt Gingrich are doing their best to recover from missteps and misstatements, and, well, Ron Paul is Ron Paul. But I would be lying if I said the majority of South Carolina GOP voters are strongly anti-government. Either way, South Carolina Republicans will most likely continue their tradition of picking the candidate who turns out to be the GOP nominee, something they have done since 1980. Those seven pit the Upstate social conservatives against the laissez-faire crowd along the Coast.
