-- A new operation will begin next year to find the debris of Air France Flight 447, which mysteriously crashed into the southern Atlantic Ocean last year, French officials said. Oxygen masks were not deployed, indicating that the cabin did not depressurize, the BEA revealed in a report last year. The Air France plane went down in stormy weather, and most of the bodies were never recovered. France's air accident investigation agency, the BEA, will give details of the searches that will take place in the coming weeks in a meeting with families of the victims, the French Transport Ministry said. Investigators have not yet established what caused the crash, and large parts of the plane -- including both flight recorders -- have never been found, despite an extensive search operation that included a French navy submarine.
