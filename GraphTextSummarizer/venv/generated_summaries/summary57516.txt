Sen. Webb was also reimbursed $4,100 in travel expenses tied to an August 2014 trip to Iowa to campaign for candidates and meet prospective key supporters in the key primary state. And the payments to Webb's family amount to nearly 10% of all contributions the PAC received and only about 20% of donations to the PAC went to political candidates or groups, Business Insider reported. A political action committee headed by Former Sen. Jim Webb, the Democrat who launched a presidential exploratory committee last month, has paid more than $90,000 to his wife and daughter since late 2006 -- with close to half of that amount doled out in 2014 alone, according to FEC filings. Sen. Webb's wife, Hong Le Webb, made $13,800 in 2014 for "website services," which included "vetting design consultants, negotiating contracts and content management," Webb's spokesperson said. Webb's daughter, Amy Webb Hogan, drew most of the disbursements, charging her father's PAC $24,000 in 2014 alone for "administrative consulting services," which included administering, managing and designing the PAC's website, Sen. Webb's personal site and creating the Webb2016 website.
