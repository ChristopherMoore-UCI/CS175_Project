From early on, we've educated Ellie's brothers about Down syndrome and what that means for her -- "Ellie can do everything you can do; it just may take her longer or require extra help, but she'll get there eventually." A prenatal screen pegged the odds of Ellie having Down syndrome at less than one in 3,000, so we like to think Ellie has defied expectations from the very beginning. Recently, we asked Ellie's older brother, "Do you remember what it means for Ellie to have Down syndrome?" -- "You've probably seen them bagging groceries," said the geneticist attempting to explain to my wife and me that our 1-day-old daughter, Ellie, had Down syndrome and what that meant for her future. In the nearly five years since Ellie's birth, we've experienced vast misunderstandings about the potential for individuals with Down syndrome.
