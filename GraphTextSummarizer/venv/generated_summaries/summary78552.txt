Ohio, like many states, was forced to find new execution drugs after European-based manufacturers banned U.S. prisons from using their drugs in executions -- among them, Danish-based Lundbeck, which manufactures pentobarbital. Ohio will add thiopental sodium, a drug the state used for lethal injections from 1999-2011, the department said. Ohio is changing the drugs used in lethal injections, a move that will delay at least one execution scheduled for next month, the Ohio Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation said Thursday. The release said the the February 11 execution of Ronald Phillips, and possibly others, will be postponed while Ohio secures a supply of pentobarbital and thiopental sodium. CNN is trying to reach Ohio officials for details about their decision.
