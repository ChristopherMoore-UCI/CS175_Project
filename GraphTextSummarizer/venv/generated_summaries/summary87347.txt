The composer of "Free Nelson Mandela," Jerry Dammers -- the founder of the multiracial English ska-punk band The Specials, later renamed The Special AKA -- admits he knew little about Mandela before he attended an anti-apartheid concert in London in 1983, which gave him the idea for the song. The keyboardist, who also wrote "Ghost Town," the seminal Specials song against the policies of Great Britain's prime minister at the time, Margaret Thatcher, may not have known much about the imprisoned anti-apartheid figurehead, but his lyrics brought Mandela's struggle to the attention of a wider audience. "Free Nelson Mandela" was a Top 10 hit in the United Kingdom for The Special AKA in 1984, and it instantly became the unofficial anthem and slogan for the international anti-apartheid movement. " As the impact of the concert rippled around the world, the South African government was secretly holding talks with Mandela. "I'd never actually heard of Nelson Mandela although I knew a lot about the anti-apartheid movement and he was becoming a figurehead for the whole movement," Dammers told CNN.
