"Over the years we've had so many hurricanes that devastate this country, you know we kinda get primed for being ready and responsive to it," said Rear Adm. Kevin Scott, commander of Amphibious Task Force 26, a unit that was created to be more prepared for hurricane response than any other Navy unit. The ship also brought a group of Seabees, Navy engineers who are trained in disaster response. -- -- Even before Hurricane Irene started thrashing the U.S. East Coast, the Navy prepared for what it could do if the disaster was even more catastrophic than it proved to be. This time, as bad as Irene was, state and local officials, as well as non-military federal agencies like the Federal Emergency Management Agency, were able to respond without calling in the Navy. As Irene strengthened and bore down on the United States, the Navy ordered 27 warships to sail out of its massive naval station in Norfolk, Virginia.
