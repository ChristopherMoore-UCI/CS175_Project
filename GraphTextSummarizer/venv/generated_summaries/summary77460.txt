I'd say there has been a tendency that vessels have been built bigger and more energy efficient as years have gone by The places that have facilities that can handle vessels of this size are indeed in Asia and in Europe. When the first Triple E Class cargo vessel sails out of the Daewoo Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering yard in Okpo, South Korea, on July 2, an intriguing new age of container shipping will commence. For us it is much more important to have vessels that optimize cost efficiency rather than something that is the largest in the world. but I don't think we will see container vessels becoming any larger for quite a long time.
