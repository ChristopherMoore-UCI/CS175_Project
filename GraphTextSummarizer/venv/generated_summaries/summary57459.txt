But it will only be so if the administration and the Congress restore critical disaster preparedness funding and, simultaneously, restore the confidence of the American public that deserves better than what we saw in the weeks following Duncan's arrival in Dallas. Second, while there may be some notable exceptions, like in New York and Los Angeles, severe funding cutbacks have put the vast majority of the nation's public health agencies in a state of serious fragility, truly lacking sufficient capacity to surge up at a time of a major public health crisis. I wish I could be confident that a similar set of problems would not have occurred elsewhere, but there is ample reason to believe that some version of the Dallas story could have happened in many other cities around the nation. The purpose of this program is to bolster hospital readiness to deal with major disasters, including serious epidemics. First, we need to restore -- if not increase -- federal funding for the Hospital Preparedness Program.
