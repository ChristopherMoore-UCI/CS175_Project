Prince Alwaleed's office reacted angrily to the "completely unsupported and biased allegation based on rumours that stock manipulation 'is the national sport' in Saudi Arabia", describing it on Tuesday night as an insult to Saudi regulators. Kingdom said it had had no disputes with Ernst & Young and noted that Saudi Arabia requires public companies to change auditor every three years. Bloomberg, which launched a competing billionaires ranking last year, puts the prince's net worth at $28bn. Almost all of the gap, it said, stems from a starkly lower assessment of his 95 per cent stake in Kingdom Holding, which houses his investments in assets including Four Seasons hotels, Citigroup and News Corp. Noting steep jumps in the stock before publication of the last four Forbes lists, the magazine said Kingdom's valuation "rises and falls based on factors that, coincidentally, seem more tied to the Forbes billionaires list than fundamentals". Scrutiny of Kingdom could be the first test for the new head of the CMA, Mohammed bin Abdulmalik Al-Sheikh, a former lawyer who was appointed president of the regulator last month.
