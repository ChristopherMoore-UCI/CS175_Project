"As soon as you hear the title 'Shaft' people think 'blaxploitation' and that is absolutely unfair because that film was made before the term even existed." White, the star and co-writer of the new movie "Black Dynamite," would rather people focus on what he views as the positives of the genre of 1970s urban action films starring African-American actors. White said he wishes there were more action films starring black actors these days. "When the blaxploitation films came out in the '70s, black audiences had never had action film heroes they could identify with," he said. And while "blaxploitation" is a convenient moniker to lump in films that may not have always had the best production value, Potts said they were a testament to an era. " White, best known for his roles in the films "Spawn" and Tyler Perry's "Why Did I Get Married," said he is a huge fan of blaxploitation films and views his movie as a loving send-up.
