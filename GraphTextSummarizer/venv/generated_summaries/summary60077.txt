The asterisk being that I won't yet call anyone who opposes marriage equality a bigot simply because they believe marriage should be between a man and woman. But in 1967 when the U.S. Supreme Court in Loving v. Virginia struck down state laws prohibiting interracial marriage, 73% of Americans still supported them. -- If someone today argued for laws to legally bar interracial marriage that person would universally be labeled a bigot. She also posed the thought-provoking question: Would we would have called President Obama a bigot a year ago before he embraced marriage equality? Is it fair to label a person a bigot simply for arguing that marriage should only be between a man and a woman?
