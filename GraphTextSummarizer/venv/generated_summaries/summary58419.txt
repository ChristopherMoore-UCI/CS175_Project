Real winger Angel Di Maria hit the post in the fifth minute, but Ozil finally broke the deadlock with eight to play as he rounded goalkeeper Jari Varas after a defense-splitting pass from fellow Germany midfielder Sami Khedira. But Mourinho's men bounced back to beat 10-man Sevilla with second-half goals from Mesut Ozil and new signing Emmanuel Adebayor. The Togo international, signed on loan until the end of this season from English club Manchester City, controlled a cross from fellow replacement Lassana Diarra on his chest and smashed a volley into the net. Sevilla had defender Sergio Sanchez sent off soon after for his second booking after a challenge on substitute Adebayor, who marked his home debut with a goal in the fourth minute of time added on. With key players such as Lionel Messi, Andres Iniesta, Xavi, Gerard Pique and Pedro Rodriguez all rested at Almeria, Barca still cruised with goals from Adriano, Thiago Alcantara and Ibrahim Afellay.
