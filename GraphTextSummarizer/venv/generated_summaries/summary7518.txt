A spokesman for Indonesia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said last month that the nation's policy on drug offenses is clear. The boy's attorney, Mohammad Rifan, said last month he hoped to avoid a prison sentence for his client and have him released to undergo drug rehabilitation. The case has drawn international attention, prompting Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard to speak to the teenager on the phone, the Australian Broadcasting Corp. said last month. The 14-year old, whose name was not publicly released, has been held since his arrest last month in Bali while on holiday with his parents. "I believe everybody should know by now that illegal drugs in Indonesia will face a really severe penalty," Michael Tene said.
