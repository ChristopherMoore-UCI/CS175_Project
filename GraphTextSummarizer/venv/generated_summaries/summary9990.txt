-- UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown was under mounting criticism on Tuesday over his perceived casual attitude towards soldiers killed in Afghanistan as support for the mission collapses. Attacks over equipment shortages for British troops in Afghanistan, his failure to bow at a war memorial, and his misspellings in a condolence letter to a soldier's grieving mother all led one commentator to ask: "Can't Gordon Brown do anything right?" The latest embarrassment for the prime minister emerged Monday, when The Sun newspaper told the story of Jacqui Janes, who received the condolence letter from Brown after her 20-year-old son was killed by a bomb in Afghanistan. The somber day and the days of criticisms led The Guardian's Meltzer to write, "Can't Gordon Brown do anything right?" Roy Greenslade, a media columnist for The Guardian, said no -- not because Brown is doing things wrong, but because the press gives him little slack. " Brown has already come under repeated criticism for the level of equipment for the 9,000 British troops in Afghanistan, which some have said is too low.
