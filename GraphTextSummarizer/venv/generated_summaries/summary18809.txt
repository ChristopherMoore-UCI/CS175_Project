"It is rare to see so many anchovy abutting the surf zone," said Professor Dave Checkley of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO). Schools of anchovy can range from hundreds to millions of fish, said Checkley, who gave this school "a very rough estimate" of between 1 million and 100 million anchovies. "Human beach-goers and surfers similarly [were happy], enjoying a rare sight of an abundance of schooling fish within easy swimming distance," said Checkley. The North Pacific is currently transitioning into a cooler state, which is favorable to anchovies, said Checkley. Anchovy influx leads to shark run in "In my approximately 30 years at the SIO starting in 1970, I've not seen this before," Checkley said.
