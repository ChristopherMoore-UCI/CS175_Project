Aaron Bassler was wearing black clothing and carrying a large backpack, a fanny-pack and assault rifle when three Sacramento sheriffs spotted him early Saturday, Mendocino County Sheriff Tom Allman said. Allman said Saturday that DNA evidence linked him to Coleman's death. Authorities wanted Bassler for the killing of Jere Melo on August 27 just east of Fort Bragg on the northern California coast 10 miles north of Mendocino. Allman said Bassler didn't fire a shot, and there was no verbal exchange between the parties. "I do have some feelings for the Bassler family, they suffered a loss today," Allman said.
