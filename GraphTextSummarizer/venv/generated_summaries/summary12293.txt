"Words can never express our emotions when an officer falls in the line of duty," said Department of Corrections Secretary Walt McNeil. -- A Florida corrections officer assisting in a manhunt died Wednesday in an exchange of gunfire with a murder suspect, who also died, authorities said. The Holmes County sheriff had not yet responded to a message left by CNN Wednesday afternoon. Col. Greg Malloy, 44, was mortally wounded, the Florida Department of Corrections said in a statement. Malloy was working as part of the Holmes Correctional Institution's K-9 tracking team, which was assisting the Holmes County Sheriff's Office in the search for Wade Williams.
