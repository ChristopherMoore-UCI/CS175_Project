The Playboy gig was a rare moneymaking opportunity for Lohan, whose acting career has been hampered in the past two years by frequent trips to court, probation restrictions, extended drug rehab stints and several visits to jail. CNN calls to a dozen newsstands in Los Angeles, Chicago, New York and Atlanta Sunday found just one that is sold out of the issue, and that store expected more to arrive Monday. -- Lindsay Lohan's nude photo spread for Playboy is helping the men's magazine break sales records, according to Playboy founder Hugh Hefner. "The Lindsay Lohan January-February Double Issue is breaking sales records," Hefner said in a message posted on his Twitter account Sunday. A Playboy spokesman would not give sales numbers, but the official did say it was selling "very well."
