-- Iran's moderate former president will not challenge President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in the upcoming presidential election, the state-run Fars news agency said Monday. But the real power in Iran rests in the hands of the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. But he now says he will instead support moderate candidate Mir Hossein Moussavi, Fars reported Monday. Mohammad Khatami, in a photo from February, will not run for president of Iran, the state news agency says. His frequent and well-publicized visits to Iran's provinces are part of an effort to reach out to the Iranian people.
