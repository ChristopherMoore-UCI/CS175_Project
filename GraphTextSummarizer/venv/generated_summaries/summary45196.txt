The London club, seeking to become the first to win the trophy three years in a row, were held 1-1 at home in the fourth-round replay despite going ahead in extra-time through England midfielder Frank Lampard. A historic first victory in Europe's top club competition seems like Chelsea's only real hopes of winning a trophy this season, with the Blues languishing in fifth place in their Premier League defense. Earlier, Premier League teams Stoke and Birmingham moved into the quarterfinals with 3-0 victories over third division Brighton and Sheffield Wednesday respectively. -- Chelsea's attempt to make FA Cup history came to a halt on Saturday when the holders were eliminated from England's top knockout competition in a penalty shootout by Premier League rivals Everton. Stoke went through with first-half goals from strikers John Carew and Jon Walters and defender Ryan Shawcross.
