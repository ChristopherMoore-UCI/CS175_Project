Marana police Chief Terry Rozema was asked Wednesday on CNN's "New Day" whether police were fortunate that Valencia didn't die. "As Mario Valencia briskly walked towards Sargent Controls (local manufacturer), Officer Michael Rapiejko uses his marked police car to stop the dangerous situation Mario Valencia created," Brunenkant wrote. Video from Officer Michael Rapiejko's camera shows Rapiejko's vehicle running into Valencia, with the windshield smashing as the car hits the wall. " CNN affiliate KOLD reported Valencia was in serious condition when he was taken to the hospital and was released into police custody two days later. A little more than an hour later, police said, Valencia set a fire at a church for which he was charged with arson of an occupied structure.
