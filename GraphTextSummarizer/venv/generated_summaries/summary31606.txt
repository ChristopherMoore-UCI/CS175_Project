The airline's website advised passengers on other flights scheduled for Tuesday to check for confirmed departure times before traveling to the airport. Passengers on several other flights also posted Twitter messages complaining they were stuck on the tarmac at JFK overnight. "We also had four flights come into LaGuardia, but because they were domestic flights we were able to get them off," said Port Authority spokesman Steve Coleman. The Airline Passengers Bill of Rights, which prohibits airlines from letting passengers stay on grounded planes for more than three hours, doesn't apply in these situations. -- Airline passengers who spent 11 hours stuck on the tarmac at John F. Kennedy International Airport were unloaded Tuesday afternoon in the latest example of the frustrating effects of a massive blizzard that delayed thousands of would-be holiday travelers.
