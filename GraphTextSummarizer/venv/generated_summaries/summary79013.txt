Roger Federer handed his fellow Swiss Stan Wawrinka a tough three-set loss in the semifinals of the World Tour Finals on Saturday. Indeed the Swiss team might be out of sorts come the final, since the Federer-Wawrinka encounter Saturday -- when Federer saved four match points -- became ill-tempered at times. Wawrinka crunched a backhand at Federer when the latter was at the net and also, at one stage, Wawrinka jawed at the Federer camp, seemingly unhappy with something that was said to him. "I tried all year to be ready for the ATP World Tour Finals, and I didn't want it to end this way," Federer stated to the crowd. Federer pulled out of the final against Novak Djokovic on Sunday, marking just the third time in his career he gave his opponent a walkover.
