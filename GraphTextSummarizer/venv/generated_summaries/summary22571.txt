"Merlin is quite curious, like most dolphins, and he showed complete willingness to examine the iPad." The young two-year-old Merlin (not the first two-year-old to enjoy the device!) is reportedly able to use his snout to touch photos of objects on the iPad's touchscreen after being shown their real-world counterparts. It seems that yet another member of the animal kingdom has taken a liking to the iPad -- dolphins. Researcher Jack Kassewitz of SpeakDolphin is working on using the Apple tablet device as a language interface for marine mammals. Cats love it and dogs aren't so sure, but apparently a bottlenose dolphin named Merlin is now an iPad enthusiast.
