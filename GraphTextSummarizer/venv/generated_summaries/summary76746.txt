And DePinho believes this can happen sooner rather later for patients suffering from the following five types of cancer: -- lung cancer -- melanoma -- triple negative breast cancer and ovarian cancer (which are very similar on the molecular level) -- prostate cancer -- acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome & chronic lymphocytic leukemia (blood cancers) These types of cancers were chosen by a panel of 25 experts from within and outside MD Anderson based on what's known about prevention, treatment and survivorship as well as the likelihood of reducing the number of deaths. The cancer center calls the program "an unprecedented effort to dramatically accelerate the pace of converting scientific discoveries into clinical advances that reduce cancer deaths. Skin cancer, meanwhile, is the most common form of cancer, but it's usually not fatal, except for the 5% who are diagnosed with the deadliest form: melanoma. On Friday, Houston's MD Anderson Cancer Center is announcing its own "Moon Shots Program," aimed at significantly reducing the number of deaths from a handful of cancers by the end of this decade. " "The Moon Shots Program signals our confidence that the path to curing cancer is in clearer sight than at any other time in history," DePinho says.
