By the end of last year, Gambia had at least 42 people on death row, including two women, according to human rights activists. -- A top human rights advocacy group on Friday denounced what it claimed were the overnight executions of nine prisoners in Gambia, calling President Yahya Jammeh's stated intent to clear death row after a decades-long moratorium "a step back." In 2010, British human rights group Reprieve said Gambia introduced the death penalty for those found with more than 250 grams of cocaine or heroin. "We strongly denounce the executions of the nine and see this as a step back for the country," Amnesty spokesman Alex Edwards told CNN on Friday. The reports of the executions were the first since the Gambian president announced several days ago that he wanted all inmates sentenced to death to be executed by mid-September.
