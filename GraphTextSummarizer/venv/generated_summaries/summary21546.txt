On Monday, CUNY students, faculty and other activists, led by the newly formed Ad Hoc Committee Against the Militarization of CUNY, used signs and chants to protest Petraeus' arrival at Macaulay Honors College. In a prepared statement, Dr. Ann Kirschner, dean of Macaulay Honors College, said that the university must strive to connect students with "remarkable leaders and thinkers" and that complex issues and points of view should be respected. A flier from the committee lists several student groups and professors who support banning "this mass murderer" from teaching at the CUNY school. Hunter College adjunct professor Sandor John, who teaches Latin American history and helped organize Monday's protest, says it should come as no surprise that so many diverse groups support the committee's effort to oust Petraeus. -- City University of New York students and faculty plan to continue protesting the arrival of retired four-star Army Gen. David Petraeus, who is a visiting professor at the school, said a professor who helped form a committee aiming to oust the former CIA director.
