Elder al-Assad was careful with U.S. In Syria, analysts say, there were more than 20 successful and unsuccessful coups between 1949 and 1970, when Hafez al-Assad took power. Hafez had been born into a poor family from the Alawite mountains in northwestern Syria. "I think at the moment, what's likely to happen is that the Assad family will rule over part of Syria for the foreseeable future," says Tabler. "But they're never going to rule over all of geographic Syria again." The Alawites had often been looked down upon by the wealthier, majority Sunnis in Syria, and Hafez al-Assad was determined to break the mold.
