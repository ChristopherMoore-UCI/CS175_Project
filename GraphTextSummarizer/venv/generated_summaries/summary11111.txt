A strong service sector, accelerated growth of the industry sector and better than expected agricultural output led grow, Socio-Economic Planning Secretary Arsenio Balisacan told reporters Wednesday. The stronger-than-expected growth brings more good news for the administration of President Benigno Aquino III, who last month signed a landmark peace deal with Muslim rebel leaders that moves to end the long-running insurgency in the nation's troubled south. "There is no denying it, the Philippines is having a fantastic year despite strong global headwinds," HSBC said in a research note Wednesday. The Philippine economy grew 7.1% last quarter -- the fastest growth in two years and the fastest pace in Asia next to China -- a strong sign that the Southeast Asian economy is building domestic-growth rather than relying on exports. The 7.1% year-on-year growth in the third quarter was up from 6% growth in the second quarter.
