Spain has a "presumed consent" law, where individuals are automatically considered an organ donor unless they opt out, but Watson said that is not the only factor that explains the country's high level of organ donation. Spain leads the world in organ donation, with 33 deceased donors per million people, compared with 12 donors per million in the UK, according to Watson. The case highlighted the fact that with a desperate shortage of donors, surgeons are often forced to transplant imperfect organs. Watson told CNN that organs are thoroughly tested for suitability before they are transplanted. He told CNN that Spain has a well-developed infrastructure for managing patients in intensive care and dedicated donor coordinators who are able to counsel the families of the deceased and discuss their consent to organ donation.
