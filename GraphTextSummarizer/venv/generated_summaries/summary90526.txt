Kennedy family members have since purchased some 50 plots surrounding the grave, including plots reserved for all six of Mary and Robert Kennedy Jr.'s children, he said. The decision to move her grave in St. Francis Xavier Cemetery was made because the original plot was closely surrounded by other graves with no room for expansion, Kennedy family spokesman Ken Sunshine said. Kennedy, who had been battling depression, was found dead May 16 in Bedford, New York, a small town north of New York City where she lived. -- The body of Mary Kennedy, the estranged wife of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., was moved to "a sunny hillside" in a separate section of the Cape Cod, Massachusetts, cemetery where she was originally interred two months ago, her family said. Kerry Kennedy, Mary's best friend and sister-in-law, and two of Mary's children selected the new gravesite last week, he said.
