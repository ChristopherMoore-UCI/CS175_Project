How to Super Bowl #LikeAGirl Jim Higley, a father of three and a radio host, writer and founder of Bobblehead Dad and spokesman for the Dove Men+Care brand, said there remains a "big gap" between what men see on the screen and how they feel in real life. In conversations with dads, mainly through email, about the new ads, including Toyota's campaign showcasing former football players talking about the role their fathers played in their lives, they applauded the move by brands and talked about the larger impact especially on boys and young men. Other brands getting high marks from fathers craving a realistic portrayal of dads today include Nissan, which released a preview clip of its ad -- its first Super Bowl commercial in 18 years. Doug French, co-founder of the Dad 2.0 Summit, one of the largest gatherings of parenting writers, dad bloggers and online personalities and now in its fourth year, says brands are increasingly realizing that dads are consumers and caregivers too. Kimmel was hired by Dove Men+Care as an adviser to help analyze and build on research that the brand conducted last year on how men view masculinity.
