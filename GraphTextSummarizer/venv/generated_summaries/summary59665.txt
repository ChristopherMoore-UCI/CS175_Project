Dugard lived for several years there by herself. "You could walk through the backyard and never know there was another set of living circumstances," said Fred Kollar, undersheriff of El Dorado County. -- From the time she was an 11-year-old, blue-eyed, freckle-faced blonde until she was a 29-year-old woman with two children, Jaycee Dugard was kept locked away in a backyard compound of sheds and tarps by a couple who police say abducted her. It also held a vehicle that matched the description of the car used in Dugard's kidnapping, Kollar said. "They are all in good health," Kollar said in response to a question about how Dugard and her children are doing.
