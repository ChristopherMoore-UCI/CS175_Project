Former members of the colony have admitted that human rights violations and sexual abuse of children occurred there, saying in a 2006 letter published in a leading Chilean newspaper that they were led by Schaefer's influence. The commune in southern Chile, also called Villa Baviera, was created as a place to safeguard Germanic traditions. Schaefer had been in prison since 2006 when he was extradited to Chile from Argentina, where he had been living in hiding. Schaefer was serving a 20-year sentence at the national penitentiary in Santiago for sexually abusing children at the notorious commune known as Colonia Dignidad (The Dignity Colony). -- Paul Schaefer, a former Nazi who fled Germany in 1961 and founded a cult-like commune in Chile, died Saturday in a prison hospital.
