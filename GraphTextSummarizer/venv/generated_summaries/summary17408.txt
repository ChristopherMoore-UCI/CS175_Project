These attacks on public education, educators and neighborhood schools have unfortunately become the norm. The information from this new DPE survey could and should be used as a roadmap for those who want to speak out loud and clear in support of neighborhood schools and public education. And there isn't a profession out there that wouldn't love to have the kind of favorability numbers enjoyed by local public schools and teachers in this survey. And since one of the biggest challenges in public education these days is teacher retention and recruitment, abolishing tenure could be incredibly harmful. It's no surprise that voters of all stripes are fed up with GOP cuts to education across the country hurting children and neighborhood schools.
