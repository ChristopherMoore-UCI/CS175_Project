Patrice Mallet told CNN that Ouattara supporters attacked Radiodiffusion-Television-Ivoirienne (RTI), calling it a "tool" used by disputed President Laurent Gbagbo "to spread hate and xenophobia." Mallet also accused Gbagbo's armed youth league, known as the Young Patriots, along with armed forces loyal to Gbagbo, of committing "gross human rights violations" over the past week and a half during fighting that has left the commercial capital, Abidjan, in an increasingly lawless situation. Mallet said other rights abuses include using heavy artillery and rocket-launched grenades against protesters, the destruction of mosques, denial of medical care for Ouattara loyalists and the use of rape and sexual assault as a tactic. Gbagbo is also tracking down Ouattara backers on social networks and chat rooms, Mallet said. But Ouattara loyalists have secured the border with Liberia to keep mercenaries out of the country, Mallet said. There have also been clashes between Gbagbo and Ouattara supporters in the central cities, Yamoussoukro and Daoukro, in addition to ongoing fighting in Abidjan.
