Russian President Vladimir Putin plans to pardon jailed oligarch and Kremlin opponent Mikhail Khodorkovsky, he said Thursday. " Khodorkovsky's son told CNN Thursday that he was not able to substantiate Kremlin assertions that there is a planned pardon for his father. Speaking to reporters after a news conference, Putin said Khodorkovsky had written a letter appealing for a pardon, citing humanitarian factors. He has said his prosecution was part of a Kremlin campaign to destroy him and take control of the company he built from privatization deals of the 1990s. "With Putin things are always personal," he said.
