Stripping is hardly a new profession, but the Internet has allowed women who work in it to more easily access large groups of men congregating for leisure or for business: sporting events like the Super Bowl or Final Four championships, even political events like the Republican National Convention. Strip clubs have reputations for being havens for drugs and sex trafficking for a reason -- pimps have been known to force women to work as strippers. During the course of shooting this episode, I met many different kinds of women, but one thing was present in all of them: ambition. For some of the women, stripping allows them to make more money than other day jobs. At many clubs, they are independent contractors who pay a percentage to the clubs for allowing them to dance there, but the rest of what they make goes into their pockets.
