In July 2012, Holmes opened fire at a midnight showing of "The Dark Knight Rises" at the Century Aurora 16 Multiplex Theater, in Aurora, just outside Denver. -- The trial of James Holmes, the gunman in the massacre at a Colorado theater last year, will no longer begin in February. Judge Carlos Samour vacated the trial date at a hearing Thursday. He pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. A hearing is scheduled for December 11.
