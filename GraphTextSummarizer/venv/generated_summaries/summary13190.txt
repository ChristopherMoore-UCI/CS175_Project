"It" was the ill-conceived decision by GOP presidential hopeful Rick Perry to hitch his wagon to the clownish Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, an opportunist who in recent years has taken to rounding up illegal immigrants and parading them outside his jail to catch the attention of television cameras. But just because most illegal immigrants are Latino doesn't mean that most Latinos are illegal immigrants. Just because a media hungry lawman is hunting for illegal immigrants doesn't mean he can single out Latinos -- including the U.S.-born, some of whose families have lived on this side of the border much longer than Arpaio's ancestors have lived on this side of the Atlantic. Those who defend Arpaio and brush aside concerns over racial profiling will likely say that it's appropriate for law enforcement officers to put extra scrutiny on Latinos since most illegal immigrants in the United States are Latino. "The federal government has failed on border crime and border enforcement, and no candidate for president has done more to secure the border than Governor Rick Perry," Arpaio said in a statement.
