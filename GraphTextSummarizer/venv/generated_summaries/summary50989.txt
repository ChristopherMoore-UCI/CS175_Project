Hue, 35, has spent most of his career with Jamaica's Harbour View but had brief stints with the Kansas City Wizards of the MLS and Sweden's Mjallby. The two were provisionally banned in August after Hue tested positive following Jamaica's World Cup qualifier at Honduras in June. Former world-record holder in the 100 meters, Asafa Powell, and Sherone Simpson admitted to testing positive for banned substances in July, a month after double 200-meter Olympic gold medalist Veronica Campbell-Brown received a provisional ban. According to a report in the Jamaica Observer in August, Fraser was a personal friend of the late Bob Marley and also treated the reggae great. But a stiffer penalty was given to the team doctor, Carlton Fraser.
