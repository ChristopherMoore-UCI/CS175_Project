While the $75,000 she raised was enough to record her new album, "California Years," it didn't include money for a makeup artist or hair stylist. So Jill, your next record that's coming out in April ("California Years") was funded entirely by fans. Jill Sobule raised $75,000 from fans through a Web site to fund her latest album. A $100 donation meant a T-shirt from Sobule with the words "Junior Executive Producer" emblazoned on it. Singer-songwriter Jill Sobule has both in spades.
