Prior to the announcement of his death, a message purportedly from ISIS had presented an ultimatum to Jordan: Bring convicted terrorist Sajida al-Rishawi to the Turkish border by sunset January 29 or the pilot will die. The plight of Moath al-Kasasbeh resonated with King Abdullah, who has been a pillar of the international effort against ISIS and is himself a former helicopter pilot. Reeling with shock at how the pilot was murdered, Jordanian officials were said to be considering a military response to ISIS's claims. One of eight children, Moath al-Kasasbeh came from Karak governorate in Jordan and graduated from King Hussein Air College, the newspaper said. From the start, Jordan has played a pivotal part in the U.S.-led coalition against ISIS, but it was not a popular war within Jordan, which only added to the pressure on the authorities to secure al-Kasasbeh's release.
