Along with the fraudulent auto loan checks, Nida stole U.S. Treasury checks, "retirement checks issued to Delta Airlines employees, and checks in the names of real people that were owed unclaimed property from various state and federal government agencies," the complaint said. Apollo Nida, husband of "Real Housewives of Atlanta" co-star Phaedra Parks, is headed to prison for eight years on fraud charges. "Today's sentencing exemplifies impartial justice regardless of economic class or perceived celebrity status," U.S. Secret Service Special Agent Reginald Moore said. It will be the second prison stint for Nida, who previously served five years in a federal prison for auto title fraud before marrying Parks in 2009. Agents recorded phone calls St. Julien made to Nida during which he discussed details of pending fraudulent auto loans and "details of future auto loan checks that he was expecting to receive any day now from in the mail," the affidavit said.
