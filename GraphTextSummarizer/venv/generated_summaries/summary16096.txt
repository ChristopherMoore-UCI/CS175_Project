Al-Shabaab banned foreign aid organizations from operating in the country in 2009, accusing them of being anti-Muslim. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said that the U.S. was "very concerned" about the drought and resulting food shortages. The United Nations estimates 2.8 million Somalis need emergency aid. The U.S. wants to test claims by Somalia's al Qaeda-linked group Al-Shabaab that it will lift the ban on relief organizations to avoid a humanitarian disaster caused by drought in the Horn of Africa nation, the State Department said Wednesday. There are currently about 1.5 million internally displaced people, and the drought conditions have driven thousands of Somalis over the border into Kenya and Ethiopia.
