Indeed, Danedream has become something of an unofficial ambassador for German racing. Thanks to his association with Danedream, Starke's trophy cabinet contains such silverware as few German jockeys have ever dreamed of, including the Arc and the King George, which was presented to him by British monarch Queen Elizabeth II. If the secret was out in German racing circles, few outside of Germany knew about the little bay filly with the incredible lengthening stride. But it was on her return to Germany that Danedream firmly buried her detractors once and for all, winning the Grosser Preis von Berlin by five lengths and the Grosser Preis von Baden by seven lengths. Although she boasts impeccable bloodlines (her sire Lomitas is a former German Horse of the Year and one of the most prominent stallions in Germany; her mother, Danedrop, though unraced, carries the blood of great sire Danehill in her veins), Danedream was backward as a yearling and eventually consigned by her breeders, Gestut Brummerhof, as a two-year-old.
