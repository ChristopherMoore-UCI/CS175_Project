-- Acclaimed director Clint Eastwood and singer Beyonce Knowles may team up in a remake of "A Star Is Born," a Warner Bros. official said. She starred in the movie "Dreamgirls" in 2006 and portrayed legendary singer Etta James in the 2008 film "Cadillac Records." Eastwood, the entertainment icon known for his gruff portrayals, is in talks to direct the 1937 classic, a Warner Bros. spokeswoman said. Judy Garland and James Mason starred in a remake in 1954. There has been no date set for the launch of the movie which explores the relationship between a Hollywood starlet and an older aging actor.
