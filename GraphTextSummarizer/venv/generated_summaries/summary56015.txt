The international agreement banning commercial whaling allows whale killing "for the purposes of scientific research." And at roughly 10 times the price of chicken, no people will starve if they don't eat whale meat. It ordered Japan to revoke its "scientific research" permits to all its ships, effectively tying Japan's fleet to the dock and silencing the cannons and exploding bombs that are the way whales die nowadays. Authorities and whalers seem committed to killing whales first and finding a rationale second, and it would be no surprise if the program were tweaked in some meaningless way so they could excuse continued hunting. Come with me to three faraway places and you might see why I feel deeply and strongly about whales.
