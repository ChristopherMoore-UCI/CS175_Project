For more than a decade, former leaders on the security front have tried to step forward to consolidate Israeli politics toward the middle. It is a sign of the weakness of Israeli politics that so many of Israel's same problems persist and so many coalitions remain fragile. Tensions between religious Jews and secular Jews, European Jews and Oriental Jews, and Jews and Arabs simmered for decades. It is a sign of the vibrancy of Israeli political life that authoritative voices can come out and critique government policy. For Israelis, the roiling debate on Iran is just another example of the way Israeli politics work.
