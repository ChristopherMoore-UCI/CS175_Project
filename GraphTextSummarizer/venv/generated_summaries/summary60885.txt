The government crackdown and arrests are part of an effort to stop thousands of people who have been demonstrating in Bahrain since last month. "Wounds, especially those inflicted by distinctive police and military gunfire, are used to identify people for arrest, and the denial of medical care is being used by Bahraini authorities to deter people from protesting," said Latifa Ayada, the organization's medical coordinator. The protests in Bahrain are part of a wave of unrest that has spread through northern Africa and the Middle East as demonstrators rose up against their rulers. Doctors Without Borders has accused Bahraini forces of raiding medical facilities to crack down on protesters, prompting injured people to avoid going to hospitals. The Bahrain Center for Human Rights reported last week that more than 400 people had been jailed or have gone missing since the government of Bahrain imposed a state of "national safety."
