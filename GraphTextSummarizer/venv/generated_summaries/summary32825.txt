Health.com: 10 ways you increase your flu risk (without realizing it) Women may be more likely than men to end up in the hospital with severe flu symptoms, notes Sabra Klein, an assistant professor of molecular microbiology and immunology at Johns Hopkins University who researches sex differences in infectious disease. So if a co-worker shows up complaining about aches and pains, or you notice someone wheezing next to you on the bus or in line at Target, you should stay at least 10 feet away, if possible -- "15 feet if the person's really sick," says Philip Tierno, director of clinical microbiology and immunology at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York. The vaccine is at least 60% effective -- no, not 100%, but "even if you do get the flu after being vaccinated, your symptoms will likely be less severe because of the partial immunity you've built up," says Dr. Cornelia Dekker, a professor of pediatric infectious diseases at Stanford Medical School. Just wash your hands more than usual and avoid kissing and sharing drinks or utensils with family members; they can shed live viruses for five days after symptoms are gone. At the very least, have one at every meal or snack -- "especially orange, yellow-orange, and deep green produce, which are highest in the symptom-beating antioxidants you need now: vitamin C, E, and beta-carotene," says Dr. Melina Jampolis, a Los Angeles internist, CNN diet and fitness expert and author of The Calendar Diet.
