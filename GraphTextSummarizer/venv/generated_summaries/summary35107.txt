The food aid agency suspended work in southern Somalia in January, saying rising attacks and unacceptable demands from armed groups had made it impossible to work in the region. Al-Shabaab, the al Qaeda proxy in the country, controls much of southern Somalia. Somalia has not had a stable government since 1991, and fighting between the rebels and government troops has escalated the humanitarian crisis in the famine-ravaged country. Al-Shabaab released a statement to the media Sunday, accusing the World Food Programme of distributing expired food and undermining local farmers, said Peter Smerdon, a WFP spokesman. However, a statement on the WFP Web site says it continues to deliver food to other parts of the country, including the volatile capital, Mogadishu.
