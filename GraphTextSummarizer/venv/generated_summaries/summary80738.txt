In the English Premier League, Tottenham Hotspur maintained their push for a Champions League spot with a 1-0 home win over Cardiff City to close up in fifth spot. City could return to Wembley in the FA Cup, having reached the quarterfinals and have been strongly challenging for the English Premier League title. "The first half was not up to standard, but the second half was brilliant," was the verdict of captain Vincent Kompany as his team eye a treble in England after years of domination by neighbors Manchester United. Manchester City's last trip to Wembley had ended in bitter disappointment in last season's English FA Cup final and the sack for Roberto Mancini. Fabio Borini gave the underdogs a deserved early lead until second half goals from Yaya Toure, Samir Nasri and Jesus Navas settled an exciting final.
