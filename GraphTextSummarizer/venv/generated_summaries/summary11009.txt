Among more than 900 attendees were Florida Gov. Rick Scott, U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio and former Florida Gov. Charlie Crist. Sotloff's family accuses ISIS leader of violating Islam with execution Sotloff grew up in South Florida with his mother, father and younger sister. Passages from two letters written by Sotloff during his captivity and smuggled out of Syria were read aloud before hundreds of relatives, friends, colleagues and officials who packed the public service at Temple Beth Am in Pinecrest, Florida, outside Miami. In the program for Friday's service, Sotloff's sister shared lyrics from Pink Floyd's "Wish You Were Here," which the family said stirred their memories of Sotloff. On Tuesday, ISIS posted a video online showing one of its members beheading Sotloff. It is not clear how Sotloff's letters, read by his relatives, made it into his family's hands.
