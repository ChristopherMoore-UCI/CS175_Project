Consider the airport bike path, an increasingly popular feature at airports around the world. Some allow travelers to pedal right up to their plane, while others skirt airport perimeters, permitting cyclists a closeup view of the behemoths of the sky. An official airport map has a range of cycling options, including cycle lanes adjoining roads and shared pathways, with no fewer than five sets of bike parking racks scattered between the terminals. At just more than the 15 miles long, the traffic-free loop circumnavigates Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi Airport (sometimes referred to as Bangkok International Airport). There are a range of traffic-free bike lanes all the way from the city to airport terminal buildings, and you can leave your bike directly outside the airport, assuming there's space (lots of airport employee ride to work).
