In 1967, riots in Detroit prompted baseball officials to move games between the Tigers and the Orioles to Baltimore. Fans with tickets for those games and Wednesday's contest can swap their tickets for future games, based on the dollar amount of the ticket. The Orioles said tickets from Monday's postponed game can be used for admittance on May 28. Fans with tickets for Tuesday's game must exchange them for tickets for any remaining home game, including May 28. According to MLB.com, games have been postponed in the past because of security concerns.
