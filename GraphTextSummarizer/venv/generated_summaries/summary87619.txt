One gust in Westchester County was recorded at 55 mph, the National Weather Service in New York said on Twitter. "(I) was just sitting and waiting, and not knowing (how much snow would fall) was the worst," Steven Crouch told CNN affiliate WIS. Runners at the New York City Marathon are used to chilly temps, but the wind was terrible Sunday, with many gusts of more than 40 mph. The good news is, the cold spell should be short, CNN meteorologist Todd Borek said. The earliest-ever snow in Columbia and that area of the Palmetto State had traffic backed up for hours in several spots.
