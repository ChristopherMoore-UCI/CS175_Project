-- Amanda Knox should receive a 30-year sentence for the 2007 killing of British exchange student Meredith Kercher, an Italian prosecutor said at her retrial Tuesday. Sollecito and Knox were convicted in 2009 of killing Kercher, 21, who was found stabbed in November 2007 in the villa that she and Knox rented in the central Italian university town of Perugia. On Monday, Crini recapped the evidence against Knox and Sollecito and highlighted what he said was suspicious behavior by Knox after Kercher's killing. Knox has not been in court for the retrial. The slander charge relates to Patrick Lumumba, a Congolese bartender whom Knox originally accused of Kercher's murder.
