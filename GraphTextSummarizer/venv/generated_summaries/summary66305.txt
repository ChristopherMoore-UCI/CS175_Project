But the 38-year-old Atlanta singer, who rose to worldwide fame with the hit songs "Forget You" and "Crazy," will not face sexual assault charges after prosecutors concluded there wasn't enough evidence to take that accusation to court, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office said in a statement released Monday. Green "will responsibly address" the drug charge in court and is pleased prosecutors decided not to proceed with the sex assault charge, his attorney, Blair Berk, said in a statement issued Monday. According to prosecutors, Green slipped the drug to a 33-year-old woman while they were having dinner on July 13 or July 14, 2012. But in their statement Monday, prosecutors said they had declined to file a charge of rape of an intoxicated person, citing insufficient evidence. CeeLo Green, a singer who is a coach on the television singing competition "The Voice," has pleaded not guilty to a felony charge of giving the drug Ecstasy to a woman who also accused him of sexually assaulting her last year, according to prosecutors.
