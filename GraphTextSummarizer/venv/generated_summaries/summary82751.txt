In 2011: Haiti cholera victims demand U.N. compensation "The way we understand disease transmission today, there is no other good explanation for how a (cholera) strain that was present only in the northeastern region of the Indian subcontinent traveled 9,000 miles to Haiti and happened to end up in a river next to a base with U.N. peacekeepers from Nepal, said Jonathan Katz, a former Associated Press reporter who was one of the first journalists to investigate the source of outbreak in 2010. How women are lifting up Haiti U.N. spokesman Farhan Haq expressed to CNN "it is not the United Nations' practice to discuss in public claims filed against the Organization." Katz, who further investigated the U.N.'s response to the outbreak in his book "The Big Truck That Went By: How the World Came to Save Haiti and Left Behind a Disaster," accused the United Nations of covering up its responsibility for the cholera epidemic. "The claims are that the U.N. engaged in reckless and gross negligence and misconduct bringing cholera to Haiti," said Ira Kurzban, a lawyer and board member with the Boston-based Institute for Justice and Development in Haiti.
