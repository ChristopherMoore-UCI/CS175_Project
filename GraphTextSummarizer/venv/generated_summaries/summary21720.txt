Residents in Gary have not had trash pick-up since July 12, when Mayor Rudy Clay ordered garbage collections halted as part of an ongoing dispute between City Council and his attempts to outsource the job to sanitation giant Allied Waste. The group filed suit against the city last November on two counts: it claimed the contract with Allied was not submitted for public bids, and the trash fee may not be levied without City Council approval. As Mayor Clay spoke, in front of the bags of trash, a scrolling sign on the City Hall property flashed "Keep Gary Clean. Defending his $5 million contract with Allied on the steps of city hall Monday morning, the mayor said, "The old system cost the tax payers $9 million a year and received 40 to 50 complaints a day." The saga came to a head on Monday morning when dozens of protesters, with full trash bags in hand, arrived at city hall to criticize the mayor.
