Egyptian police dispersed protests organized by supporters of former President Mohamed Morsy in various cities, arresting a number of protesters. Police said they confiscated knives and images of "the four-fingered sign" from protesters, a reference to the image of a yellow hand used by many Morsy supporters. In Ain Shams in eastern Cairo, Al-Ahram Arabic news website reported clashes on Friday afternoon between about 300 Morsy supporters and riot police. Attacks targeting police and the army have spiked since the military ousted Morsy last summer amid massive nationwide protests against his rule. Security forces fired tear gas at dozens of pro-Morsy protesters gathering in the northeastern Cairo district of Nasr City and in Giza's Haram district.
