"The standard government-controlled networks are not the only way of communication -- there are also satellite phones and Internet connection and landline phones," York says. -- Late last month in Aleppo, Syria, civilians who have cell phone subscriptions received a foreboding text message in Arabic: "Game over." "In Egypt, you could say no one would have expected that." Last month, the network was down for 10 days in Aleppo, the current focal point of the fighting, with activists and rebels communicating largely by satellite phone until service was restored September 20. "Since it's state telecom that provides access, it's safe to say the government could turn the Internet off at any point," says Doug Madory, senior analyst at Renesys, a firm which tracks Internet data and intelligence and has been monitoring the situation in Syria. It also triggered an increase in violence in the decimated city, where rebels Tuesday continued to advance with the seizing of Maaret al-Numan, a key strategic town on the road between Aleppo and Damascus.
