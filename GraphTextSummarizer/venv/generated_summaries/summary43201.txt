"We are looking at a deteriorating humanitarian situation in the areas out of which the refugees in neighboring South Sudan and Ethiopia have fled," Peter de Clercq, the United Nations' acting humanitarian coordinator in Sudan, said this month. Fighting erupted between Sudan's army and South Sudan rebels in Southern Kordofan even before independence was formalized. Amigo said among the new arrivals at Alfuj refugee camp was a 70-year-old woman who was brought in a donkey cart. But just a few months later, refugee camps are filling to the brim as fighting in the border states of Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile has intensified and displaced more than 400,000 people. South Sudan is independent now, Amigo said, but not free from crisis.
