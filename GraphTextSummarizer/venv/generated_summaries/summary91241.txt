"The shooting appears to be accidental," said a statement by Sheriff Ben Wolfinger and Lt. Stu Miller. The shooting occurred about 10:20 a.m. "A very sad incident happened in our store in Hayden, Idaho, that involved a female customer," said Walmart spokesperson Brooke Buchanan. Detectives were investigating the scene and Walmart officials immediately shuttered the store in Hayden, said the Kootenai County Sheriff's Office. A 29-year-old mother was fatally shot Tuesday in an Idaho Walmart when her 2-year-old son in the shopping cart grabbed a gun that was in her purse and shot her in an apparent accident, authorities said. At a press conference, Miller said the mother was shopping at the back of the store in the electronics department.
