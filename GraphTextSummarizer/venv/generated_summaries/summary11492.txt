Meanwhile on the European Tour, U.S. Open champion Martin Kaymer also disappointed in his first outing since his triumph at Pinehurst. While he struggled, there was a four-way tie at the top with Australians Marc Leishman and Oliver Goss and American pair Ricky Barnes and Patrick Reed all on six-under. Kaymer shot a one-over 73 at the BMW International in his native Germany to miss the cut on level par. The former world number one briefly raised hopes that he could survive for the weekend when he birdied the ninth and 10th around the turn, but his hopes nosedived with four straight bogeys on the back nine. -- Tiger Woods may need to reappraise his schedule after his hopes of getting in four rounds of competitive golf ahead of the British Open were dashed Friday.
