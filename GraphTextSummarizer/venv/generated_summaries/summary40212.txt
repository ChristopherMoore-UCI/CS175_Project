She couldn't make bond and she had to spend the night in jail," said Stewart County Sheriff Larry Jones. Wells called police on April 26 because she thought there was a prowler on her property in west Georgia, her attorney, Gary Parker said. -- A Lumpkin, Georgia police officer who repeatedly tasered a 57-year-old woman violated police policy but resigned before he could be fired, a city attorney said Thursday.
