-- Teams from across the globe will soon learn whether their green designs will take top prize at Solar Decathlon Europe 2012 -- a competition that challenges collegiate designers to build houses powered exclusively by the sun. During their final days on display, the houses accumulate points through a series of 10 mini-contests, each measuring specific parameters like architecture, engineering, energy efficiency and market viability. A team from RWTH Aachen University in Germany, which designed the Counter Entropy House, found several innovative ways to incorporate items normally thought of as unusable: melted CDs were used to build plastic panels for the house's facade, and salvaged beams and wood from the university's stadium also served as building material. Like several of the other houses, Ecolar uses vertical, semi-transparent solar panels on the house's faÃ§ade, which lets in natural light while helping to supply energy.
