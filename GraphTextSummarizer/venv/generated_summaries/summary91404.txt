A grand jury investigation determined that health and licensing officials had received repeated reports about Gosnell's practices for two decades, but had taken no action, even after learning that women died during routine abortions, Williams has said. -- Philadelphia prosecutors say they may seek the death penalty against abortion doctor Kermit Gosnell, who is charged with murder after allegedly performing illegal late-term abortions at a dirty facility. Gosnell's defense attorney, Jack McMahon, appeared in court Wednesday for the formal arraignments. The circumstances in this case are the deaths of people under age 12 and multiple murder charges Gosnell, 70, faces eight counts of murder in the deaths of seven babies and a 41-year-old woman. All had some role at the Women's Medical Society clinic, which was run by Gosnell and served mostly low-income minority women, Williams said.
