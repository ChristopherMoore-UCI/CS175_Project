Is there tremendous value in fraternities, sororities, bands and student organizations? There must be a zero tolerance attitude from every state official, administrator, student leader and organization member. Hazing will only be brought to a close when members of organizations make it clear the vile hazing traditions will not go forward. Yet because of the natural turnover in student organizations, that mindset has to be created and passed on for it to succeed. Yet because of that, we weren't always as accepted by other fraternity members at other campuses.
