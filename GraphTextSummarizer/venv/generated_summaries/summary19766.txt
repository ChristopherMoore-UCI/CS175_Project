In a campaign replete with marketing genius and every cliche you can think of, Hasbro is encouraging fans of a special Facebook page to vote daily until February 5 for the token they want to save and for the one they want added. According to Hasbro, which bought the company, more than 1 billion people have played the game in its various versions. "Fans who would still like to play with the classic eight tokens have a limited time to pick up the existing version of the game," said Hasbro.
