Watch Hanna lash Turks and Caicos Islands Three hours later, it was downgraded to a tropical storm as winds fell below the 74 mph threshold for hurricane status. The storm called Hanna weakened from a hurricane to a tropical storm Tuesday morning as maximum sustained winds eased down to 70 mph, the National Hurricane Center said. Hanna's path and strength remain uncertain, but the latest forecast map from the National Hurricane Center predicts it still could make landfall as a major hurricane on the southeastern U.S. coast by Friday evening. Hanna's path early Tuesday appeared to be a "meandering" loop across Turks and Caicos, but atmospheric changes over the western Atlantic are expected to steer the storm northwestward over the next two or three days, according to forecasters. It could return to hurricane status later Tuesday or on Wednesday, forecasters said.
