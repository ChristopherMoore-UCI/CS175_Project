An online petition demanding that Kickstarter remove the project garnered nearly 30,000 signatures by Wednesday evening. People turned to Twitter and other social media to criticize not just Hoinsky's project, but also Kickstarter for having hosted it. "It is a guide for men to get better with women," he explains in a video on the crowd-funding website Kickstarter, which he used to raise funds. But Kickstarter says it will not delete Hoinsky's crowd-funding project. According to his Kickstarter page, because he raised much more than his stated fund-raising goal, Hoinsky is going to take his theories on the road.
