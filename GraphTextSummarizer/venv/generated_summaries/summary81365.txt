The particular form of racism found in Tiririca's song has been tolerated for a long time in songs and jokes, said Twine, who has written a book about race in Brazil. The song, about a black woman's hair, led civil rights organizations to sue Sony not just because it is offensive but because such pejoratives remain common in Brazil. "This case is a real step forward for Brazil, and Brazil is changing," said France Winddance Twine, a sociology professor at the University of California at Santa Barbara. An appeals court in Rio de Janeiro ruled December 15 that Sony must pay nearly 1.3 million reais (U.S. $723,000) for publishing "Veja os Cabelos Dela," or "Look at Her Hair," by the singer and comedian Tiririca. A recent court ruling ordered Sony Music Brazil to pay a hefty fine for a song with racist lyrics.
