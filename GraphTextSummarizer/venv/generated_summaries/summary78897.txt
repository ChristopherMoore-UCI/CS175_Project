-- Cornell William Brooks, hailed as a "pioneering lawyer and civil rights leader," has been selected as the new president and CEO of the NAACP, the civil rights organization announced Saturday. "Mr. Brooks is a pioneering lawyer and civil rights leader, who brings a wealth of knowledge and experience to the Association," NAACP Board Chairman Roslyn M. Brock said in a statement. Jealous was a prominent voice against laws that the NAACP argued made it harder to vote, such as voter ID laws passed in numerous states in the past several years, and was outspoken over the February 2012 killing of Trayvon Martin, the Florida teen shot to death by George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer. "In our fight to ensure voting rights, economic equality, health equity, and an end to racial discrimination for all people, there is much work to do. Last year, Benjamin Todd Jealous stepped down as president of the NAACP after five years.
