It's a place where gladiators once prepared for battle and lions and tigers were caged before entertaining a bloodthirsty public, architect Barbara Nazzaro of the office of the Rome Archaeology Superintendent told CNN. In the underground maze of tunnels, the Romans kept "every type of exotic animal that they were able to bring here," including rhinos and snakes, Nazzaro said. It was constructed with enough stone to build a 15-story building, though less than half of the structure now remains, said Nazzaro. The more gore and blood, the happier and more involved people became, Nazzaro said. For more than 400 years, wealthy and poor alike attended ultra-violent spectacles in the Colosseum, including executions which often concluded with fights between Roman warriors.
