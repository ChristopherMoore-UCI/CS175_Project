"That's what you need right now in America," said the brother of former President George W. Bush and son of former President George H.W. Bush. Bush also admitted it's been "kind of fun" to go back and look back at previous campaigns to remind himself that it's possible to "move the needle" if you run with big ideas. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush said on Sunday he will release 250,000 emails from his two terms in office and write an eBook outlining his governing philosophy. The book comes as Bush's finances -- including overseas investment and his work for venture capital firms -- have come under scrutiny. By controlling the release of the emails and writing a book to accompany them, Bush has the opportunity to frame potential controversial subjects, like his support of the Common Core education policy and immigration reform.
