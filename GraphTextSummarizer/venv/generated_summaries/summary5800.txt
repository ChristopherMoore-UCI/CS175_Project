"There really are few things for families in the time between now and then," says Dave Hollis, Disney's Executive Vice President of Domestic Distribution, who cites DreamWorks' "Rise of the Guardians" and Disney's own 3-D re-release of "Monsters, Inc." as the only animated competition for the rest of 2012. Disney's "Tangled" opened with a whopping $48.8 million over the more lucrative Thanksgiving weekend in 2010, so "Wreck-It Ralph's" slightly larger bow (and its hefty $13,086 per theater average) should be viewed as a major victory for the Mouse House. The Robert Zemeckis-directed drama "Flight" soared in second place with $25 million from just 1,884 theaters, giving the $31 million Paramount film the strongest per theater average in the Top 20, with $13,275. "Wreck-It Ralph" earned an "A" CinemaScore grade from polled audiences, and very positive reactions will help the film hold up even better than a typical family film would anyway. The martial arts picture "The Man with the Iron Fists" debuted in fourth place with $8.2 million â€” certainly not a knockout result, but in line with studio expectations considering American audiences have never consistently taken to flying daggers and karate chops.
