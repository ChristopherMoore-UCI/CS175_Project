Louisiana State Police shot and killed Fuaed Abdo Ahmed as they stormed the Tensas State Bank, just before midnight local time, according to Col. Michael Edmonson. Born in California, Ahmed moved with his family to northeastern Louisiana, where his family owns a convenience store, Edmonson said. Ahmed told hostage negotiators that he heard voices and wanted to have a device removed from his head. The Mississippi River community of St. Joseph is about 35 miles south of Tallulah, Louisiana, and 35 miles north of Natchez, Mississippi. The two hostages -- a man and a woman -- were both shot by Ahmed as the police SWAT team entered the bank, Edmonson said.
