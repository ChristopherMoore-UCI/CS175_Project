Critics question smart meter accuracy and whether the devices will really save energy in the long run. Soon, when power goes out in a neighborhood with smart meters, utilities won't have to wait for customers to report outages -- the smart meters will alert utilities automatically. It was last July's Eastern heat wave and Consolidated Edison was responding to scattered power outages as electricity usage neared record highs. For example, a project to help Queens' Flushing neighborhood will "give us the capability to remotely control up to 26 underground switches," said Con Ed smart grid manager Thomas Magee. One advantage of smart grid technology may be jobs.
