" The 33-year-old said a feeling that attitudes in tennis had progressed had helped to make up her mind, citing the prompt action taken by the Women's Tennis Association and United States Tennis Association when she and Venus were victims of racist and sexist comments made by a Russian official last year. World No.1 Williams, who won the Australian Open with victory over Maria Sharapova in Melbourne last month, announced her decision -- explained in an exclusive interview with TIME magazine -- on Twitter. She said it had been "difficult for me to forget spending hours crying in the Indian Wells locker room after winning in 2001, driving back to Los Angeles feeling as if I had lost the biggest game ever -- not a mere tennis game but a bigger fight for equality. Back in 2001, age 19, she lifted her second Indian Wells trophy by beating Kim Clijsters -- but she and her family were racially abused by some members of the crowd after sister Venus withdrew from their semifinal with an injury. Her decision was welcomed by tournament CEO Raymond Moore, who confirmed that she had accepted a wild card for the event.
