Watch Foxworthy comment on joke Â» But Foxworthy's rebuke of the joke was gentle in tone, and he showed empathy for Letterman as well as the Palin family. King asked what advice he'd give Sarah Palin if she received an invitation to appear on Letterman's "Late Show." Foxworthy said he'd encourage the Alaska governor to accept it. And Foxworthy agreed: "I don't think any kind of joke about someone having sex with a teenage girl is funny." Jeff Foxworthy, the father of two teenage daughters, says David Letterman's joke was flawed.
