Watch Rachel's story Rachel's original campaign site Donate now: Rachel's mom carries on her legacy Mikey Carraway Mikey Carraway was diagnosed with liver failure when he was 11. For her 9th birthday, Rachel Beckwith asked that people donate to charity: water instead of buying her gifts. To honor Hernandez's memory -- and to raise awareness about organ donation -- Mikey feeds the homeless through his organization, Mikey's Meals. She wanted to raise $300 to help provide clean water for people in need. Through Casas por Cristo, he was able to accomplish a remarkable goal: building 18 homes for people by his 18th birthday.
