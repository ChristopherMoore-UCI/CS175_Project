The Nebraska Medical Center is investigating the death Wednesday of 23-month-old Almariah Duque, said hospital spokesman Paul Baltes. The girl, who lived with her parents in Dallas, Texas, was born with a birth defect and in December had undergone a transplant at the hospital of her small intestine, pancreas and liver, Baltes said. "It appears an overdose of the blood thinner heparin may have contributed," said the statement, which called the death "a deeply troubling and emotional incident" for hospital personnel. The medical center is paying for funeral and travel expenses for the girl's parents, Greg and Kenya Duque, who have no other children, Baltes said. "The medical center strives to provide the highest level of care and will use this tragic event to continue to improve and find ways to prevent errors in the delivery of complex health care," the statement said.
