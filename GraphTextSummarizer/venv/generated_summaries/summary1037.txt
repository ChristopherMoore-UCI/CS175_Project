Four passengers helped subdue him and tried to put out the fire, Tukel said, and AbdulMutallab was escorted up to first class. Pointing to AbdulMutallab, Tukel said, "His sole reason for being on Flight 253 was to kill all of the passengers and himself. He thought he'd end up in heaven." After taking numerous trips to the bathroom, AbdulMutallab went back to the bathroom about an hour before the plane was to land, "to purify himself to die," Tukel said. AbdulMutallab did not eat or drink on the plane, a fast that was part of ritual purification, Tukel said. A witness testified that AbdulMutallab was in the bathroom for about 15 to 20 minutes, which seemed long to the passenger, Tukel said.
