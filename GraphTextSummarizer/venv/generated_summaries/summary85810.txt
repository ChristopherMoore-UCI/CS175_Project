The CNN investigation revealed that military veterans are dying needlessly because of long waits and delayed care at U.S. veterans hospitals. "We offer our sincerest condolences to veterans affected by delays in GI care and families who have lost a loved one." CNN learned from documents and interviews that other VA facilities have been under scrutiny by officials over possible delays in treatment or diagnoses. In an  interview Thursday with CNN, Hamilton said the hospital had looked back at dozens of patients records out of concern for possible delays in care or treatment. Shortly before CNN published its report Tuesday, the VA acknowledged that there have been concerns about delay of care at some of its other facilities.
