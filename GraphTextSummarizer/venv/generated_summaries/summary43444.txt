" South Africa's Oosthuizen shot 69 at St. Andrews to be one ahead of Northern Ireland's reigning U.S. Open champion Rory McIlroy. The 32-year-old will take a three-shot lead from 2010 U.S. Open champion Graeme McDowell as he seeks the biggest win of his career, and third European Tour title overall in the pro-am event played over three seaside courses. Donald fired a flawless nine-birdie round of 63 to tie McIlroy's 2010 course record at St. Andrews, as did Simon Dyson, with both Englishmen in final-day contention five shots behind Hoey. Masters champion Charl Schwartzel was tied for 11th after a 66 at St. Andrews, while world No. 2 Lee Westwood was another shot back on 205 after a 68 at the same course. Northern Ireland's current British Open champion Darren Clarke this week admitted he is struggling for motivation following his breakthrough major triumph in July, and that languor continued as he carded 70 at St. Andrews to be 19 shots off Hoey's pace.
