Deloitte's Alan Switzer commented: "Despite this increase in wage costs, Premier League clubs improved their wages/revenue ratio to 62 percent and generated record operating profits in 2007/08 of Â£185 million ($303 million). -- European football clubs are bucking the trend of the worldwide recession, with England's Premier League leading the way after posting $3.4 billion in revenues for the 2007-08 season. "Revenue increased by 26 percent in 2007/08 and Premier League clubs generated $1.3 million more revenue than their nearest rivals from the other 'big 5' leagues. Meanwhile, Premier League clubs' spending on player transfers in both the summer 2008 and January 2009 transfer windows reached new record levels with an estimated $1.1 billion paid out. "However lower revenue growth in forthcoming seasons means clubs will have to focus on improving cost control -- both wages and other operating costs -- if profits are to be maintained.
