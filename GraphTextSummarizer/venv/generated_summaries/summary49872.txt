Amos, the top U.N. humanitarian official, pointed Thursday morning to a continuing litany of needs -- such as clean water, hygiene kits, hospital supplies, tents and other shelters. A Philippines senator said she's learned of reports of rapes and other crimes against women, some allegedly perpetrated by convicts who escaped prison in the typhoon's aftermath, the state-run Philippines News Agency reported. A week after Typhoon Haiyan tore through the Philippines, the adrenaline-fueled response to the storm and its aftermath have faded from the streets of Tacloban. Other reports suggested the toll could be far higher, with thousands feared dead in Tacloban alone. But when Haiyan slammed into the Tacloban naval station where he's based, he and other sailors clung to rafters in their barracks.
