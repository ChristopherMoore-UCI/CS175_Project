The possibly lost e-mails are from a period in which the United States decided to go to war with Iraq, White House officials leaked the identity of CIA officer Valerie Plame and the Justice Department started a criminal investigation into who leaked the information. "The Bush administration is using the legal system to prevent the American people from discovering the truth about the millions of missing White House e-mails," said Melanie Sloan, the organization's executive director. -- The White House Office of Administration is not required to turn over records about a trove of possibly missing e-mails, a federal judge ruled Monday. That system developed problems that may have caused millions of White House e-mails to be unaccounted for. The White House has denied any evidence, including e-mails, have been destroyed.
