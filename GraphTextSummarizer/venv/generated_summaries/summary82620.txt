In the region, 20 civil society, human rights and religious groups in areas affected by LRA violence (Congo, South Sudan, and the Central African Republic) have welcomed the advisers, and they hope the United States will fulfill its promises. Increased radio programming should be used to encourage defections and to sensitize communities so that LRA combatants who do defect no longer have to fear being attacked by local populations. As seen in the recent spike in LRA attacks in Congo, Kinshasa's insistence that the Ugandan army no longer operate there is causing the country to become a safe haven for the LRA. Therefore, the United States needs to lead the international community in developing and implementing a defection strategy that encourages LRA commanders, including senior and mid-ranking commanders, and rank-and-file fighters to leave the group. The LRA, which began as a rebel group in Uganda, evolved into a brutal renegade force that has abducted tens of thousands of civilians, forcing them to serve as soldiers or sex slaves, has killed tens of thousands and has displaced more than 2 million in four African nations: Uganda, newly independent South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic.
