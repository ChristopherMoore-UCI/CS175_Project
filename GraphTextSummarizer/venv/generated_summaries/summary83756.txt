"He blames himself," Ryan said of Lashaun, who told her he only learned to swim last year. The sole survivor in Tuesday's tragic incident was 10-year-old Lashaun Armstrong, who escaped the sinking vehicle where his mother Lashonda Armstrong, 25, as well as his siblings -- an 11-month-old girl, a 2-year-old boy and a 5-year-old boy -- all died. Lashaun was waving his arms and calling out "Help me, help me, help me," Ryan said. Lashaun said his mother "just went crazy," according to Ryan. "She just speeded up and went into the water," Ryan added, recounting what Lashaun had told her.
