On his Facebook page, Hicks reportedly showed his support for "anti-theism," the active opposition of religious belief. But that in and of itself doesn't make Hicks an equal opportunist when it comes to his choice of alleged victims. Still, although the killings of these three young Muslims should not be attributed to a lack of belief in God, they were allegedly committed by a man with an active contempt for belief in God. But when we consider Hicks' own comments and postings on social media in the context of much of the anti-Muslim rhetoric we see in the media and elsewhere, it is hard to see Tuesday's tragedy as a genuinely random incident. In a move familiar to many Muslim organizations that are called upon to denounce the actions of a violent co-religionist, the American Atheists organization issued a statement condemning the murders of the three Muslim students.
