CNN affiliate KXAN reported officials said they have already sent letters and made phone calls to people in advance of Wednesday's deadline. Texas gave the duo and other toll scofflaws until Wednesday to pay up or else. Sixteen drivers owe more than $100,000, The state says all told it is owed $27 million from across the state -- at least 28,000 drivers owe more than $100 in unpaid tolls. Texas also says if violators are pulled over for a traffic violation, they can have their cars impounded. And the state really, really wants them to pay their bill -- $236,026.32 -- for the unpaid tolls and fines (the fines always get you).
