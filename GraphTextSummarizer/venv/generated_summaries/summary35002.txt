Last year, former Mayor Oscar Hernandez, former Vice Mayor Teresa Jacobo and former council members George Mirabal, Victor Bello and George Cole were convicted by a jury on several counts of misappropriation of public funds, prosecutors said. In October, Rizzo pleaded no contest to 69 felony counts of public corruption, 46 counts of misappropriation of public funds, 10 counts of falsification of public records, six counts of perjury and six counts of conflict of interest, prosecutors said. The former city manager of Bell, California, was sentenced Wednesday to 12 years in state prison in a corruption case in which he and several other former city council members were accused of turning taxpayer money into a personal "piggy bank." Robert Rizzo also was ordered Wednesday to repay $8.8 million in restitution to the city, prosecutors said. The sentences for Rizzo and Spaccia together "represent the longest prison terms for convicted public officials since the Public Integrity Division was established in 2001" in the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office, prosecutors said. Rizzo also "lavished unauthorized loans on himself and city underlings, including Spaccia," prosecutors said.
