-- Pilots of the British business mogul Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic Airways have broken with tradition and voted in favor of the picket line over a pay proposal, a first in the airlines' history. Representatives from the British Airline Pilots Association, the main union for the United Kingdom's commercial pilots, claim Virgin Atlantic pilots have not had a pay increase since 2008. "We value our pilots enormously and that is why we have offered three guaranteed pay rises in the next two and a half years and a share of company profits," Virgin Atlantic said in a written statement. "We are naturally disappointed with the result of the ballot but remain committed to further talks with our pilots' representatives to find a solution," Virgin Atlantic said in a statement issued Tuesday. " Virgin Atlantic representatives said they have made an offer to the pilots union that is double the national average for a UK business.
