-- France and the Netherlands both recorded narrow home victories in warm-up matches ahead of next month's World Cup in South Africa. Coach Bob Bradley cut seven players from his initial roster, namely defenders Chad Marshall and Heath Pearce; midfielders Alejandro Bedoya, Sacha Kljestan and Robbie Rogers; and forwards Brian Ching and Eddie Johnson. The Americans, beaten 4-2 by the Czech Republic on Tuesday, take on England on June 12 in Rustenburg in their opening World Cup match. Tottenham's Giovani Dos Santos had a chance to level the score, but his powerful shot was tipped over the bar by Dutch goalkeeper Maarten Stekelenburg. Costa Rica, who are not going to South Africa after losing a play-off to Uruguay in November, took a surprise lead in the 12th minute when Carlos Hernandez's long-range shot bounced over Steve Mandanda's hands.
