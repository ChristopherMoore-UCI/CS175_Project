But Dr. Deborah Cohan went into her double mastectomy operation with courage and dance moves. Are you with me people?" The UCSF Medical Center at Mount Zion says Cohan was discharged from the hospital on Wednesday. But before the surgery, she and her medical team threw a pre-op dance party in the operating room at the University of California-San Francisco Medical Center at Mount Zion. The dance party was actually orchestrated by Cohan herself, and posted on CaringBridge, a site that connects friends and family together during a health event. "My fantasy is for you to play the song ... and dance wherever you happen to be," Cohan wrote on her CaringBridge site.
