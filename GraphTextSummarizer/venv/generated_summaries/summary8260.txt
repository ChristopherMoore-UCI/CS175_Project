As temperatures warm up Thursday afternoon in Atlanta and the snow and ice melt, Durrant said he expects cancellations to drop. "Some Delta employees and other people (responsible for aircraft security sweeps and cleaning aircraft) are having trouble getting to work on time," said Delta Air Lines spokesman Morgan Durrant. "We are focused on resuming operations in Atlanta right now," said Southwest spokesman Dan Landson via e-mail. That's because the airline still anticipates a small number of cancellations, mostly on Delta Connection regional flights, on Friday. -- Atlanta's airport and airlines there continue to bear the brunt of this week's snowfall that paralyzed parts of the South as their employees struggle to get to work Thursday at the world's busiest airport.
