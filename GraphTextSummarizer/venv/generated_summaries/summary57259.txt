Then three Israelis allegedly killed Palestinian youth Mohammed Abu Khedair, 16, in July out of revenge for the Israeli boys' deaths, Israeli prosecutors said. Israeli police say they are investigating. Khedair's Palestinian-American cousin, Tariq Abu Khdeir, of Florida, received a beating from Israeli police after clashes sometime after the slaying. He rammed the commuters intentionally as an act of terror, Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said. Israeli airstrikes and Gazan rocket fire followed.
