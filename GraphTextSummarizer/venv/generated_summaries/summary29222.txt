And if their own governments can't provide a compelling alternative to the ISIS religious vision of some kind of Islamic caliphate, then how can the United States be expected to? The legitimacy of ISIS, Graeme Wood argues in a must-read piece in The Atlantic, depends on its ability to control territory -- its putative caliphate. This contradiction leads to a second problem -- the idea that a summit in Washington, or indeed anything made in America, will somehow lead to an effective counter narrative that will halt ISIS success at recruitment. In fact, if the President wants to preserve his Sunni Arab coalition against ISIS, he'll have to do the opposite of what he's suggesting -- not push these countries to serious reform. And that means containing and reversing the group's gains through the use of air power, standing up local allies, marshaling a Sunni Arab coalition, and most likely by deploying additional U.S. Special Forces.
