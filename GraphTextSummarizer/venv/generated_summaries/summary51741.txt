The warm water has led fish such as anchovy and other species that live in surface waters to migrate to deeper water toward the south. "Marine resources are fully guaranteed, so we promote consumption and discard the speculation that some people or institutions disseminated irresponsibly," said the deputy minister for strategic development of natural resources, Gabriel Quijandria. "If these oceanographic conditions persist, it is likely that its impact will spread to other areas of the (Peruvian) coast even during the fall, which could make the numbers increase and affect other marine species" said the report. The Peruvian National Center for the Study of El Nino reported earlier this week that since February the Peruvian coast has had an abundance of warm water as a result of marine currents throughout the world's oceans. Warm waters off Peru are to blame in the deaths of more than 5,000 marine birds on the coast, government authorities say.
