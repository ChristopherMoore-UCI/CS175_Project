"They are all in the same boat," said Hoggard, who shed a tear at Hughes' death despite not knowing him. After the impact of the ball severed a vertebral artery, prompting a massive bleed into Hughes' brain, a number of New South Wales players -- Abbott included -- rushed to support the batsman's head after his collapse. According to local ABC media, the South Australian playets had "PH 612" etched on their shirts, in reference to Hughes' South Australian cap number. The Australian players all wore Hughes' Test cap number, 408, on their shirts as well as black armbands. New South Wales players had black armbands on, in memory of Hughes.
