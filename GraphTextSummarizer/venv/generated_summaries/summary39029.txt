-- Police in South Korea have detained a man suspected of abducting a 7-year-old girl from her home and raping her, local police officials said Friday. The police detained a suspect on Friday and took him to the police station in Naju for questioning, said two police officers with knowledge of the case who declined to be identified because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. The parents of the girl realized she was missing at 7 a.m. Thursday and looked for her before reporting it to the police half an hour later in Naju, a city in the southwestern province of South Jeolla, said Kim Il-kyu, head of the criminal investigation department in Naju. The city's police officers called for backup and 160 personnel from nearby police stations joined the search for the girl, he said. "The police should make every effort to restore public order." South Koreans responded with anger on social media to news reports about the case.
