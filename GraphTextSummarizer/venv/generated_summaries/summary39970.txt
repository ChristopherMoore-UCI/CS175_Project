While Jennifer's efforts began in her hometown, they have expanded and today Unite for Sight is hard at work in North America and roughly 10 additional countries. More than 9,500 people who lost their sight to cataracts and other eye disease have had their vision restored through surgeries provided by Unite for Sight volunteers. Jennifer and her army of volunteers (more than 4,000 at last count), have provided vision screening and education to some 500,000 people, free of charge. This compassion followed her to Yale University, where as a sophomore she founded what is now an international non-profit organization -- Unite For Sight. That's vintage Jennifer -- her work is truly inspiring.
