People don't identify as voters: I found it fascinating that many people in Hawaii don't vote at least in part because they don't see themselves as the type of people who participate in civil society. Election laws make it too hard to register: There are plenty of available tools that would make voting easier in Hawaii, including same-day voter registration, which would let people walk into a polling place on election day, register and vote right then; and online registration, which Hawaii plans to implement in 2016. The schools are bad: I heard from many adults in Hawaii that the school system does not do a good job teaching young people about politics and how decisions made by politicians affect their day-to-day lives. What do you think would help increase voter participation in Hawaii? Polling places can't be trusted: That's the feeling at least on the Big Island of Hawaii.
