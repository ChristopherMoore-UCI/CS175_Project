-- British troops will get new camouflage uniforms for the first time in more than 40 years, based on computer modeling of Afghanistan's terrain, the Ministry of Defence announced Sunday. "This new camouflage will help our troops blend into different environments in Helmand Province to stay hidden from the Taliban," Defence Secretary Bob Ainsworth said in a statement. More than 100 British troops have died in Afghanistan in 2009, making it the deadliest for UK troops in many years. It is specifically designed with Afghanistan's Helmand province in mind, the ministry said in a statement. "The colors were fed into a computer and computer modeling was used to represent the Green Zone, deserts and mixed environments in Afghanistan.
