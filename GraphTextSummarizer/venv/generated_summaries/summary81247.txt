Fifty years ago, when the 89th Congress convened in January 1965 following Johnson's landslide election victory against Sen. Barry Goldwater, LBJ was at the height of his political power. We can hear this on a tape with one of Johnson's greatest allies in the Senate, Minority Leader Everett Dirksen. When Johnson told him he was "having hell," including with the situation in Vietnam, President Truman assured him it was fine. But as the new year began other Democrats warned Johnson that he should not make use of this resolution for force. Based on weak evidence about an attack on U.S. Navy destroyers (Johnson admitted that the attack, if it occurred, was a mistake or the result of a decision by a low-level commander), Johnson worked with Arkansas Sen. William Fulbright to convince Democrats to support him with this resolution.
