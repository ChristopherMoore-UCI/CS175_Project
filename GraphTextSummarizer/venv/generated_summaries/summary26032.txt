"Right now, nothing is lost -- no race has been run, no point has been allocated -- but when I listen to some media we are right in the middle of a huge disaster," Vettel told Formula One's official website after the final test event in Bahrain at the weekend as he outlined the case for the Red Bull defense. Despite Red Bull's struggles, Vettel insisted it would be foolish to write off the team's chances ahead of the season-opening Australian Grand Prix on March 16. " Hamilton is anticipating a start similar to the 2012 season -- when seven different drivers won the first seven races of the year -- with a number of teams jostling for early-season honors. The Brazilian set the fastest lap time of the weekend on Saturday, while his rookie teammate Valtteri Bottas was also near the top of the timesheets in fourth position. The German manufacturer, which finished second in the team standings in 2013, had a fruitful time in Bahrain, with 2008 world champion Lewis Hamilton setting the pace on Sunday.
