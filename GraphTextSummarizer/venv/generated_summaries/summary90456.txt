A couple of years ago, Iraq said it would achieve daily production of 12 million barrels a day by 2020. Instead of production sharing agreements (PSAs as they are known) when international oil producers take a percentage of each field, Baghdad went with service contracts -- paying companies only for services such as workers and technical advice. Pipelines have been attacked, some fields missed production targets, and the cost of production has risen. Iraq is earning over $90 billion a year at current production levels, nearly matching the budget for the central government. This is a quick turn of fortunes after Iraq surpassed neighboring Iran as the second largest oil producer within OPEC last year, hitting a peak of 3.4 million according to Standard Chartered Bank in its latest report on the country.
