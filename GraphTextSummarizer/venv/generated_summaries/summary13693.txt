Magic Johnson has some advice for Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling: Sell the team, take the money and enjoy the rest of your life. Opinion: The 5 apology rules that Sterling broke Magic's interest in a basketball team Johnson, whose ownership interests also include the WNBA's Sparks in Los Angeles, denied Sterling's assertion that the former Los Angeles Laker was trying to deceive his way into buying the Clippers. A day after Sterling appeared on CNN slamming the NBA legend's character, his battle with HIV and his community outreach efforts, Johnson said Tuesday that he feels sorry for the 80-year-old billionaire. Johnson told Cooper he is still waiting for an apology from Sterling for getting roped into Sterling's fight with Stiviano, and Johnson called the Monday interview -- in which Sterling directed another tirade at the NBA legend -- "disturbing." "What's really sad is, it's not about me," Johnson said. Johnson noted Sterling's past legal issues with his real estate business where he settled lawsuits brought against him and his wife with out-of-court payments.
