"Jeff was a severe, severe opiate addict with chronic pain, one of the most serious and dangerous combination of problems you could possibly interact with," Dr. Drew Pinsky, an addiction medicine specialist, said during a taping for a May "Dr. Drew" show on HLN. His family surrounded Conaway in his hospital room on May 26 when he was taken off life support, Brock said. Conaway's struggle with alcohol and drug addiction was chronicled in 2008 on the TV reality show "Celebrity Rehab With Dr. Drew." Pneumonia was initially ruled the cause of death, and the doctor who treated him for drug addiction for years said his dependence on prescription painkillers eventually cost him his life. He was in a medically induced coma in an Encino, California, hospital for two weeks, manager Phil Brock said.
