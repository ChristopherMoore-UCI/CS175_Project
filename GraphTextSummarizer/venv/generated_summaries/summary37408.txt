Sidney Police Chief Frank DiFonzo told reporters later Friday that law enforcement officers in North Dakota -- including members of the Williams County Sheriff's Office, Williston police and the North Dakota Criminal Investigation Bureau -- helped arrest the first man, who is 47 years old. Law enforcement officers have taken "one adult male into custody, and another adult male is being questioned" in relation to Arnold's case, the FBI said Friday in a statement. -- Two people have been detained in the death of a 43-year-old Montana schoolteacher last seen six days ago while out on a morning jog, law enforcement agencies said Friday. A massive search effort involved hundreds of volunteers, as well as law enforcement authorities and National Guard members. That man is now being being held in a Williams County, North Dakota, jail.
