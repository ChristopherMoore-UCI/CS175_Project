Illinois and Missouri have called out hundreds of National Guard soldiers to help evacuate communities and protect vacated communities. Heavy rains have pushed the river to near-record levels, putting pressure on a tributary system that began buckling days earlier when a levee failed and flooded a handful of rural towns in southeastern Missouri. Caught in the middle, though, are residents on either side of the river, which threatens to swallow communities in Missouri and Illinois. Engineers have reported sand boils and seepage at a number of levees near the confluence of the Ohio and Mississippi rivers, a condition that Walsh said also threatens the integrity of the Mississippi River and Tributaries Project -- the world's largest flood control project. About 90 families who live in the area have already been evacuated, Missouri officials have said.
