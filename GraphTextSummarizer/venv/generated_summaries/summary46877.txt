The bodies were discovered during an operation by Afghan and NATO-led forces in Paktia province, a volatile region along the border of Pakistan. The U.S. official said it isn't clear whether the dishonor in this case stemmed from accusations of acts such as adultery or even cooperating with NATO forces. The deaths occurred during an operation in Farah province targeting a Taliban commander thought to be responsible for planning suicide attacks, the military said. NATO's International Security Assistance Force said the bodies of two men and two women were found, with the women bound and gagged, and the U.S. official said the people were shot "execution-style." Meanwhile, more than 20 "enemy militants" were killed Friday by Afghan and international forces in the country's western region, NATO's International Security Assistance Force said.
