-- World number one Caroline Wozniacki made a shock exit from the Rogers Cup in Toronto after losing her second round match to Roberta Vinci 6-4 7-5 Wednesday night. Defending champion Wozniacki looked set to force the match into a third and deciding set after building a 5-1 lead in the second, but her Italian opponent rallied to clinch her first victory against a top-five ranked player. Third seed Vera Zvonareva notched up a straight-sets success against Nadia Petrova to set up a third round clash with Poland's Agnieszka Radwanska, who defeated Croat Petra Martic 6-3 6-3. " Vinci will come up against Serb Ana Ivanovic in the third round, after the 23-year-old's second round opponent Iveta Benesova was forced to retire in the third set of their encounter. "I saw she was making a lot of mistakes, especially in the first set; then in the second set I was just focusing on every point when I was down, trying to stay aggressive and hit some slice to her forehand when possible.
