Kara Kopetsky, 17, left school early in Belton, Missouri, on May 4, 2007, and hasn't been seen since. Smith was taken from a store parking lot in Overland Park, Kansas, and her body was found in the Missouri woods, six miles from Kara's home in Belton. Police say there has been no activity on Kara's cell phone since shortly after she walked out of school. About a month after she disappeared, Kara's case was eclipsed by another sensational case -- the abduction and slaying of Kelsey Smith. " When Kara didn't come home from school as usual, her family -- mother Rhonda, stepfather Jim and stepbrother Thomas -- grew worried.
