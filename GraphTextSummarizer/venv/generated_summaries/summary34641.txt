" The quake struck one day after Ohio Department of Natural Resources Director James Zehringer announced that work would be halted on a fluid-injection well in Youngstown, due to fears it could be contributing to a recent apparent spike in seismic activity in the area. That appeared to hold true elsewhere in the eastern Ohio city, based on early post-quake surveys. The well is owned and permitted to North Star Disposal, a Youngstown company, according to the state. There was a lot of shaking "and a rumbling sound," said Jimmy Hughes, a former Youngstown police chief running for sheriff of Mahoning County. The decision came after the state of Ohio invited experts from Columbia University to collect more information about seismic activity in the area.
