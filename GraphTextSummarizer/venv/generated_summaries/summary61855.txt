Rice is a long-time Republican, despite being mentored in international affairs by the Josef Kobel, the father of Democratic Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, who became the first female Secretary of State, according to Albright's State Department biography. The now illegal practice of requiring black voters to answer questions before being permitted to vote, poll tests were "the teeth of Jim Crow," Rice said. All of this happened, Rice said, due to her parents, John and Angelena Rice. A guidance counselor/preacher and school teacher respectively, Mr. And Mrs. Rice never made more than $60,000 annually, Rice said. "Even if I could not have a hamburger at a Woolworth's counter, my mom taught me that I could be President of the United States," Rice said at an author panel during the 10th annual Book Expo America in May.
