"One of the priorities is also to support the independence of Grameen Bank and its founder Professor Yunus, who together were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006, as they have been the target of an ongoing pressure campaign of rumors and misleading information," the group said in a statement. Grameen caught the world's attention by specializing in providing loans to low-income entrepreneurs who were unable to secure money through regular banks. "Normally the retirement age of a bank's managing director in Bangladesh is 65, and Professor Yunus is now 70," Muhith said. Several prominent figures have stepped up in Yunus' defense, including Mary Robinson, the former Irish president and United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, who chairs a newly formed "Friends of Grameen" initiative. The pressure stems from allegations in a television documentary that Yunus illegally diverted Grameen money.
