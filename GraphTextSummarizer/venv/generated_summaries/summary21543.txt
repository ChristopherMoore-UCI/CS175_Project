Captain Francesco Totti opened the scoring in the fifth minute after showing great control to chest down Daniele De Rossi's pass and lob Parma goalkeeper Antonio Mirante. Totti also hit the post 10 minutes into the second half, and then the veteran striker's cross allowed Rodrigo Taddei to head the second goal with 15 minutes left as Parma -- employing four strikers -- pressed to equalize. Brazilian forward Ronaldinho netted the only goal from the penalty spot in the 78th minute after Mario Borriello was fouled, but teammate Massimo Ambrosini was sent off for a second bookable offense with two minutes to go. Totti was also involved as 10th-placed Parma had Luis Jimenez sent off for the third time since his loan arrival from Inter in February, with the Chilean receiving a second yellow card for a foul on the 33-year-old with two minutes left. Milan moved nine points clear of fifth-placed Palermo, who travel to second-bottom Siena on Sunday, needing to win handsomely to redress a nine-goal inferior for-and-against ratio.
