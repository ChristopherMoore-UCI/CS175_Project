And despite needing pain-killing injections ahead of the Japanese and Korean Grands Prix, Webber decided to keep the injury secret from Red Bull principal Christian Horner. The Australian, who was in contention to win his first world championship right up to the final race in Abu Dhabi, sustained the fracture in a mountain bike accident prior to the Japanese Grand Prix in Suzuka in early October.
