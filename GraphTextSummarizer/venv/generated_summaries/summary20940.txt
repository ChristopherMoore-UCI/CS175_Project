Calcio Storico Fiorentino, June 24-28 This traditional game is a testosterone-fueled mix of football and fighting played by young men from the four Florentine quarters: San Giovanni, Santa Maria Novella, Santo Spirito and Santa Croce. An amazing spectacle, especially because it is held in the shadow of the beautiful Santa Croce church in the piazza below. Scoppio del Carro, Easter Sunday Exploding the cart, or "scoppio del carro," at Easter is one of the oldest and most important Florentine traditions. You can buy everything from amber to reindeer skins at the Christmas market (Mercato di natale) in the Piazza Santa Croce from the beginning of December. Christmas in Florence Not only is the city wonderfully deserted at this time of year, but the lights that adorn every shop window give the place an almost magical feeling.
