But Martin Dolan, Chief Commissioner of the Australian Transport Safety Bureau, says that as search teams scour the depths of the Indian Ocean for any sign of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370, he is confident they will find the plane, if the aircraft is in the areas where they are looking. " The current search area is the result of months of analysis and reexamination of satellite data by an international team of experts, combined with aircraft performance factors such as fuel range, speed, and altitude. local time on March 8, 2014, Malaysia Airlines MH370 took off from Kuala Lumpur International Airport, en route to Beijing. The ATSB's Dolan cautioned that search teams have placed equal priority on all areas within the 60,000 square kilometer search zone. If search teams succeed in locating the wreckage of MH370, Australia, which has been leading the search at Malaysia's request, will also lead salvage and recovery efforts, according to the ATSB Chief Commissioner.
