" The Washington Post's report includes emails Emwazi purportedly wrote after British counterterrorism officials detained him and stopped him from flying to Kuwait. Emwazi came to CAGE in 2009 looking for support when he felt that British authorities were -- in Qureshi's words -- "harassing" him. But CAGE, the London advocacy group that worked with him, said if he is the man who's appeared in ISIS videos, it's a sign that British authorities' tactics pushed him to radicalize. There are "striking similarities" between Emwazi and the man known as "Jihadi John," according to Asim Qureshi, CAGE's research director. Qureshi told reporters Thursday that he couldn't be 100% certain that Emwazi is Jihadi John because the man's face is covered in the videos.
