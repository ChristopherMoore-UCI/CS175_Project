The decision aims to quell growing grumblings within the sport over the amount of money being offered to lesser players who are failing to meet rising costs. Growing unrest started at last year's U.S. Open, where Murray and Nadal were particularly vocal about the uneven distribution of prize money. -- They've earned admiration around the world for their on-court prowess, not to mention the enviable sum of more than $160 million in prize money between them. "Wimbledon continues to be successful and we are delighted to share that success with the players by increasing total prize money by 10%, the largest increase since 1993," he said. The largest slice of the cash will go to players making an early exit in late June, with first-round singles losers to each scoop Â£14,500 ($23,400) -- up 26.1% on last year.
