Towers that were on the chopping block operate with contractors, acting under FAA supervision. Friday's announcement completes a near total reversal of plans by the Transportation Department to impose draconian austerity measures on FAA programs in response to the sweeping cuts known as sequester. The controller furloughs ended after that was done and the FAA this week said it would not shut down certain control towers during overnight hours. Dickerson said he believes the administration was swayed by two letters, one signed by 41 senators and one by 83 House members, urging the DOT and FAA to keep the towers open. -- After several weeks of indecision, the Obama administration has decided against closing 149 contractor-run air traffic control towers due to sweeping budget cuts.
