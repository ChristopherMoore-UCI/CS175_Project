Madoff's scheme fell apart with his arrest in December 2008, and he pleaded guilty in federal court in New York in March 2009 to multiple federal counts of running the largest, longest-running Ponzi scheme ever. -- The last of Bernie Madoff's ill-gotten gains that remain in the hands of the U.S. Marshals Service will go on the auction block next week, authorities said Friday. Proceeds from the auction will go into a U.S. Department of Justice fund and be used to compensate the victims of Madoff's Ponzi scheme, described by authorities as the largest in history. Other items will include an English rosewood apothecary; a carved wood bull sculpture; and a John Wootton oil painting, authorities said. Auctioneers in Miami will sell off 276 lots of property taken from the Madoff residences in New York and Palm Beach, Florida, the Marshals Service said.
