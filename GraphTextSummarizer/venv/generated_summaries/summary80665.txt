According to the police report, the incident happened sometime in the spring of 2010, but was not reported to FAMU police until November 2011, and did not reach Tallahassee police until January of this year. Tallahassee police conducted a separate investigation into the allegations against Holloway and Simons, but the case was closed last week after the state of Florida decided it would not pursue criminal charges because it could not prove that hazing occurred and because the statute of limitations likely expired. -- Two music faculty members at Florida A&M University have been placed on administrative leave due to hazing allegations related to the marching band, university officials said. Many students police sought as witnesses refused to cooperate or retained lawyers. Faculty members Diron T. Holloway and Anthony E. Simons III were placed on leave effective Wednesday because of "allegations of misconduct and/or incompetence involving reports and allegations of hazing within the Department of Music and the Marching '100,'" according to the university.
