-- A judge Friday granted police in Northern Ireland permission to hold and question Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams for another two days Long associated with the IRA, once considered the armed wing of Sinn Fein, Adams is a prominent Catholic politician who helped broker peace in Northern Ireland. "While I have never disassociated myself from the IRA and I never will, I am innocent in the abduction, killing or burial of Mrs. McConville," Adams said. The head of the Police Service of Northern Ireland insisted that the police would "conduct a thorough and professional investigation into the murder of Jean McConville," according to a statement from the force Thursday. His arrest threatens the fragile peace in Northern Ireland, a peace Adams is in part credited with bringing about after decades of sectarian tensions.
