While gearing up to take Poison on tour with Def Leppard this summer, Michaels found time to assemble an all-star cast of guests for his new LP, "Bret Michaels and Friends: Get Your Rock On," due out in September. "I think that'd be great to have him come in and put his style on a song that I remade in an over-the-top, punk-metal fashion." Though Michaels says, "This could be the never-ending record," he's focused on finishing the LP and can't help but get excited about the prospects of future collaborations. "And it's such a diverse range of people, from Loretta Lynn and Joe Perry [who play on a reworking of the Poision hit "Every Rose Has Its Thorn"] and Jimmy Buffett to Lil Jon, Michael Anthony, Ace Frehley, all the Skynyrd guys, guys from .38 Special and Blackfoot and Rascal Flatts' "Ace Frehley is the real deal," says Michaels. "Every song on it is a collaboration with other musicians," says Michaels.
