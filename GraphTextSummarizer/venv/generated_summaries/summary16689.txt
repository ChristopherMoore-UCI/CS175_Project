-- Football player Albert Haynesworth has been charged with misdemeanor sexual abuse involving a waitress at a Washington hotel bar. " Earlier this year, Haynesworth also was charged with assaulting a motorist after a traffic incident in Reston, Virginia. An indictment was returned Tuesday by a grand jury in Superior Court of the District of Columbia. A defensive tackle for the Washington Redskins, Haynesworth, 29, allegedly stuck a credit card down the front of a server's dress and fondled her breast, according to prosecutors. Court papers do not identify the waitress but say the incident happened around 2 a.m. on February 13 at a rooftop lounge atop the W Hotel.
