Around 6 a.m. Sunday, Port Authority police arrested Casquejo on the property, according to Pentangelo. According to the Manhattan district attorney's office, Casquejo was released without bail after being arraigned on one count of criminal trespass in the third degree, a misdemeanor punished by up to three months in jail, and one count of trespass, a violation punishable by up to 15 days in jail. According to the criminal complaint, Casquejo told police, "I walked around the construction site and figured out how to access the Freedom Tower rooftop. On the 104th floor, Casquejo encountered an "inattentive" security guard -- a contractor from a security company -- and was able to get past him, according to Joe Pentangelo, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns the trade center site. One World Trade Center is rising in the shadows of the original World Trade Center, where the iconic twin towers were felled by two hijacked airplanes on September 11, 2001, in the deadliest terrorist attack on U.S. soil.
