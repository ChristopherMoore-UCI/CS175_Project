-- The Department of Justice expects to bring fraud charges next week against a major construction firm -- Secaucus, New Jersey-based Schiavone Construction Company -- for its work on two of the biggest government construction projects in the New York region, according to a source with knowledge of the investigation. Schiavone, according to the source, actually received the bulk of such subcontracts for major projects in the New York region and farmed out work to a trucking firm with ties to organized crime. A spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, which is reportedly handling the case, declined comment. The case involves work on upgrades of New York's subway system and the Croton Water Treatment Plant. Austin Campriello, an attorney for Schiavone Construction Company, had no comment.
