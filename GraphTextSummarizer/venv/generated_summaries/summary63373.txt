Dewani is accused of hiring a crew of hitmen to kill his wife, Anni Dewani, 28, during a taxi ride in Cape Town, South Africa, while the couple was on honeymoon last November. -- Britain's Home Secretary Theresa May has signed an order for British businessman Shrien Dewani's extradition to South Africa, the Home Office said in a statement on Wednesday. A court in London ruled last month that Dewani could be extradited to South Africa to face trial. Taxi driver Zola Tongo has confessed that he hired two men to kill Anni Dewani in November last year. In a plea deal with South African authorities, he said he was paid by Shrien Dewani to carry out the hit and to make it look like the two were the victims of a car hijacking as they were driving through a township on the edge of Cape Town.
