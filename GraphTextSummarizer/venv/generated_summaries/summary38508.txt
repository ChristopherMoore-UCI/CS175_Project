No charges have been filed against Cosby, and his attorneys have vehemently denied the allegations of sexual assault against him made by several women. She says the controversy over the allegations against Cosby is an opportunity for communities to help sexual assault victims. The comment came during an otherwise lighthearted moment in his standup show Thursday night in London, Ontario, as a woman near the front row got up to go get a drink and Cosby asked her where she was going. In a rare reference to the sexual assault allegations against him, Bill Cosby told a woman attending his comedy show that, "you have to be careful about drinking around me." Thursday night's performance was the second of three scheduled Canadian performances for Cosby.
