At the MIT Media Lab, Silver studied how to make tools that engage people's creative spirit and help them make things with modern technology. Or that he took the stage at PopTech in a T-shirt, baggy shorts and a surfer cap, looking more like a skateboarder than someone with a Ph.D. from MIT. " Silver's approach -- part engineer, part artist, part curious 5-year-old -- impressed his mentors at MIT. Next up was something with the Silveresque name of MaKey MaKey, an invention kit he developed at MIT with fellow student Eric Rosenbaum. "I think this is one of the most special and also least unique things about all humans: They try everything every way and have very open minds, especially when young." At MIT, Silver became part of a group called Lifelong Kindergarten, which seeks to foster creative adults through a "kindergarten style of learning" that emphasizes designing, experimenting and exploring.
