The subjects of the criminal investigation include Ukrainian Deputy Secretary for National Security Vladimir Sivkovich, Kiev Police Chief Valery Koryak and Kiev Mayor Oleksandr Popov. U.S. Sen. John McCain took in the anti-government protest scene in Kiev's Independence Square, known as the Maidan, on Saturday, snapping pictures with his cell phone as he met with opposition leaders. On Saturday, a pro-government rally was held at nearby European Square, according to the state news agency Ukrinform. The epicenter of the protest has been in the city's central Maidan Square, where protesters have created a giant "revolutionary" Christmas tree decorated with flags and a giant poster of jailed former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko. Kiev police estimated about 57,000 people participated in the rally.
