But Wesley said that shouldn't be a concern because Jupiter functions almost like a celestial vacuum cleaner, sucking up any objects that would be of danger to Earth and its neighbors. Glenn Orton, a JPL scientist, told the magazine New Scientist that it could have been a block of ice from somewhere in Jupiter's neighborhood, or a wandering comet that was too faint for astronomers to have detected before impact. -- Jupiter is sporting a new scar after an unseen object hit the gaseous planet this week, NASA scientists say. This NASA image shows a large impact near Jupiter's southern pole. Jupiter's new spot isn't likely to last long -- probably just one to two weeks, Wesley said.
