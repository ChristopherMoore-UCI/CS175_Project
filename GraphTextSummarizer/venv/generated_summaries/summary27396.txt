Do any countries recognize the killing of Armenians in Ottoman Turkey in 1915 as genocide? Hakura: Turkey is becoming more and more liberal... genocide is no longer a taboo word when it comes to talking about Armenia and things have been progressing, but the population does not like foreign powers defining their history, it generates a lot of misgivings. -- Turkey has reacted angrily to a U.S. congressional panel decision to pass a resolution calling the 1915 killing of Armenians in Ottoman Turkey a genocide. Could this reverse the tentative measures Turkey and Armenia have taken to normalize relations? Turkey recalled its envoy to the United States and condemned the narrow 23-22 vote in favor by the House Foreign Affairs Committee recommending that the US recognize the killings as genocide.
