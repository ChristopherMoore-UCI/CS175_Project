-- Two Baltimore, Maryland, police officers were shot Saturday after a gunman's domestic dispute led to shootings at two locations, a police spokesman told CNN. The rampage began at the home of the suspect's ex-girlfriend, who has a restraining order against him, police spokesman Don Moses said. Crime scene tape cordons off a squad car involved in a chase and shootings Saturday in Baltimore. Moses described to CNN what unfolded next. The officer talked to the suspect on the phone and convinced him to return to west Baltimore, where the girlfriend lived.
