Operation Blessing International has set up a base in Joplin to distribute relief supplies and coordinate volunteers to help local homeowners with repairs and reconstruction. The shelter in Joplin is located at Missouri Southern State University, and the Red Cross is working to provide transportation to the shelter for those in need. The Salvation Army has mobilized four feeding kitchens in impacted areas of Joplin. The greatest destruction was in the city of Joplin, Missouri, where at least 125 people were killed and a quarter of the city's homes and businesses were reportedly damaged. The United Way of Greater St. Louis is accepting donations and volunteers to help those impacted in the Joplin area.
