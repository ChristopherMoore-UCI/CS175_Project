The nightclub where Saturday's shooting happened got a reputation with city officials after a shooting there last year, which Montgomery media reported. Doe B, a 22-year-old Montgomery native whose real name is Glenn Thomas, and Kimbrele Johnson, a 21-year-old college student, died from gunshots, police said. The city had given Centennial Hill repeated warnings, Mayor Todd Strange said in a statement. On the cover of his new album, "Baby Jesus," a baby is pictured dressed like Doe B with the eye patch and with additional bullet wounds on the left arm. A patch over Doe B's right eye became the entertainer's trademark after he was wounded in a previous shooting, according to Billboard magazine.
