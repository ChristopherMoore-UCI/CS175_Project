The blast comes as the United States has put increasing pressure on Islamabad to root out terror groups believed to be running training camps in North Waziristan, a mountainous region of northern Pakistan. U.S. officials have long believed terror groups, such as the Haqqani network, are running training camps in the district. Last week, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, met with Pakistan's president to repair the relationship between the two countries following a U.S. raid that killed Osama bin Laden. The blast occurred in the town of Miran Shah in North Waziristan, said Muhammed Khan, a government official. Clinton said Pakistan has a responsibility to prevent insurgents from waging war in Afghanistan from its territory.
