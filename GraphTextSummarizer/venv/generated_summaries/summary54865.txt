The bad weather also forced the cancellation of 200 flights at the Chicago O'Hare International Airport Saturday morning, according to Karen Pride of the Chicago Department of Aviation. About 50,000 ComEd customers were without electricity Saturday morning after lightning and heavy downpours pummeled the city overnight, said Laura Micheli, a spokeswoman for the utility. CNN affiliate WGN reported more than 5 inches of rain were dumped over some parts of the Chicago area Saturday morning. Pride said there was some airfield flooding at O'Hare Friday night, but flight operations were not affected. The storms caused damage through Chicago suburbs before moving into downtown in the morning, she said.
