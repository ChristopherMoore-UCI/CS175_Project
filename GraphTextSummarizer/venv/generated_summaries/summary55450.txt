-- A body has been discovered in the charred remains of a three-story apartment building in Minneapolis where an explosion and fire injured at least 14 people, fire officials said Thursday. Firefighters discovered the body, which has not been publicly identified, while removing debris from Wednesday's fire, officials said. Most of the injuries suffered were burns or came from falls or jumps from windows, Robert Ball, a spokesman for Hennepin County Emergency Medical Services, said Wednesday. Officials don't know whether people jumped out, fell or were pushed out by the explosion.
