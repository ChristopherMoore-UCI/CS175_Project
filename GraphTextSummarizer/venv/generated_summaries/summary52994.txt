Ex-TSA employee accused of making false threat at LAX on eve of 9/11 anniversary CNN's Dana Ford, Josh Levs, Joe Sutton, Dave Alsup and Rich Phillips contributed to this report. Zeljko Causevic, 39, is charged with one count of making a false report about planting a bomb, and one count of manufacturing, possessing, selling or delivering a "hoax bomb," according to Jacksonville Aviation Authority spokesman Michael Stewart. -- A judge set bond at more than $1 million Wednesday for a man who said, falsely, that he had a bomb at Florida's Jacksonville International Airport. "We erred on the side of caution in terms of doing whatever's necessary to make sure that everybody is safe," said Stewart. The suspect appeared in court Wednesday.
