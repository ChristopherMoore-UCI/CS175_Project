" McCaul still stands by his belief that the school is involved in militancy, saying in a written statement that the "Taliban is known to recruit from Deobandi madrassas, including Jamia Binoria, and train their recruits as terrorists. ... The madrassa the boys attended isn't linked to bin Laden or Muslim radicals; instead, it's one the U.S. State Department says is preferred by Pakistani-Americans for its moderate Islamic teachings and one recently visited by a top U.S. diplomat in Pakistan. The school is home to as many as 500 boys and girls from 29 countries and teaches Sunni Deobandi Islam, a theology that analysts say is associated with some militant groups in Pakistan.

He stands by his depiction of how the madrassa transformed the teens but is re-editing his film to take out the references about bin Laden visiting and the Taliban leaders attending.
