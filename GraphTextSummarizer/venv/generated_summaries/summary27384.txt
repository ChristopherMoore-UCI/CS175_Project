Authorities found financial manager Marcus Schrenker, who they say  parachuted out of a plane while over Alabama, with deep cuts on his wrist at a campsite near Quincy, Florida Tuesday. Marcus Schrenker was taken to a hospital after being found Tuesday near Quincy, Florida, authorities say. Authorities say Schrenker took off alone Sunday night from Anderson, Indiana, in a Piper PA-46 en route to Destin, Florida. Authorities also found a book of campsites -- also with the Alabama and Florida pages ripped out -- near the plane, according to the affidavit. Indiana officials have agreed to allow the federal case against Schrenker to proceed before seeking to have him extradited to Indiana, according to a statement from the U.S. attorney's office in the Northern District of Florida.
