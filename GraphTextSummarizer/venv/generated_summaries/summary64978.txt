U.S. President Barack Obama will travel to Saudi Arabia on Tuesday in order to meet the newly appointed monarch, King Salman, and pay his respects to the family of the late King Abdullah, the White House said Saturday. In line with custom, Abdullah was laid to rest in an unmarked grave in a brief and simple ceremony after funeral prayers in Riyadh's Imam Turki Bin Abdullah Grand Mosque. Funeral services were held Friday for King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz al Saud, who died earlier that day. Vice President Joe Biden was originally set to have led a delegation to Saudi Arabia on Obama's behalf. Like Abdullah, he is one of the dozens of sons of Saudi Arabia's founder, King Abdulaziz.
