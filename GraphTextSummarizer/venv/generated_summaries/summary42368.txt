Read about the passing of cricket 'revolutionary' Greig With Martin-Jenkins' own death, "cricket has lost one of its greatest champions," said England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) Chairman Giles Clarke in a statement Tuesday. His death on New Year's Day comes three days after the passing of another cricket great: former England captain Tony Greig on Saturday of a heart attack while fighting cancer. Among remembrances, Scyld Berry of The Telegraph called Martin-Jenkins' knowledge of cricket "encyclopedic," and Mike Selvey of The Guardian wrote that the initials "CMJ" were "synonymous with the very best in cricket journalism, both spoken and written," and that "the game has lost perhaps the best friend it ever had." Martin-Jenkins, who was born in Peterborough, England, on January 20, 1945, is the author of several books, including "The Complete Who's Who of Test Cricketers." -- Christopher Martin-Jenkins, whose commentary for BBC Radio's Test Match Special for more than four decades made him one of cricket's most respected journalists, died Tuesday of cancer. He also called the last stage of any cancer "hell on earth."
