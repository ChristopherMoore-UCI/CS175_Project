Fenninger overturned a 0.02-second first-run deficit Saturday to follow victories in a giant slalom in Lienz in 2011 and Semmering -- also in Austria -- in 2012. "I was a bit disappointed with my last giant slalom results," said Fenninger, on the podium for the first time in five giant slalom races this season. " Fenninger moved into second place in the overall standings behind Tina Weirather, who was a distant 17th Saturday. "We had a lot of speed events recently and I didn't get much time to train my giant slalom skills. Sweden's Jessica Lindell-Vikarby finished 0.50 seconds behind Fenninger, with reigning slalom champion Mikaela Shiffrin of the U.S. a further 0.01 second adrift.
