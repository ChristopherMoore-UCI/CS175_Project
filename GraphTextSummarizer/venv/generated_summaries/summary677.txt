They can't tell the full story, since they do not include arrests made by Ferguson police. A close look at the official arrest logs of the St. Louis County police, which CNN obtained Friday, shows that while some people did travel to Ferguson to protest the shooting of a black teen by a white police officer, a majority of the people arrested live in the St. Louis area. The unrest started when unarmed black teenager Michael Brown was shot to death August 9 by Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson. By the time the tear gas started to clear in Ferguson, Missouri, at least 212 people had been arrested over nearly two weeks of clashes with police. Anger over the shooting, and the Ferguson police department's initial refusal to identify the officer who shot Brown, set off nightly confrontations between police and protesters.
