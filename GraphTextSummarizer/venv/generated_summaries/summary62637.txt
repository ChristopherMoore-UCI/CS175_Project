The man, who was arrested after he was spotted by an airline employee, told police he was on a jet ski on Jamaica Bay adjacent to the runway and became stranded, according to Port Authority of New York & New Jersey official Anthony Hayes. According to Raytheon's website, the mission of the $100 million system is "to detect, assess and track intruders attempting to gain access into exterior secure areas." The airport is located in Jamaica Bay in the southeast section of Queens County in New York City. The system includes ground surveillance radars, video cameras with motion detection and "smart" fencing, according to Raytheon's website. In a statement, the Port Authority, which oversees the airport, called for "an expedited review of the incident and a complete investigation to determine how Raytheon's perimeter intrusion detection system -- which exceeds federal requirements -- could be improved.
