"In a generation we have gone from extraterrestrial planets being a mainstay of science fiction, to the present, where Kepler has helped turn science fiction into today's reality," said NASA Administrator Charles Bolden. The five Earth-sized planets are orbiting stars cooler and smaller than our sun, and further analysis is still necessary to officially confirm they are planets. The fact that so many planets have been found in the Milky Way galaxy "suggests there are countless planets orbiting sun-like stars in our galaxy," said William Borucki, Kepler's principal investigator. NASA scientists have announced Kepler has spotted five planets about the size of Earth, orbiting stars in our galaxy. The Kepler science team also announced the telescope found six planets, all larger than Earth, orbiting a single sun-like star.
