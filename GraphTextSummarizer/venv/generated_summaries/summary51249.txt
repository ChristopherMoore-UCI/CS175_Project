BA's cabin crew employees, embroiled in an ongoing wage dispute, have now voted to go on strike four times in the past 13 months, according to Len McCluskey, the incoming union chief. -- British Airways cabin crew members voted overwhelmingly Friday to go on strike -- again. It is time for Unite to listen to the majority of crew and to its members in other parts of the airline, who want an end to this dispute." Nearly 79 percent of crew members, who are represented by the union Unite, backed the move. "Surely BA management must now wake up and listen to the voice of its skilled and dedicated employees," McCluskey said.
