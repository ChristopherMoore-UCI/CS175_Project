-- Police are investigating a beauty clinic in Hong Kong after four women were hospitalized with septic shock after receiving a treatment experts say is usually only administered to cancer patients. "Such treatment is only indicated for patients with metastatic cancer and often as salvage therapy when there are no other feasible options," Professor KY Yuen, Chair of Infectious Diseases at the University of Hong Kong's Department of Microbiology said in an email to CNN. In a statement from the health department -- which is investigating the matter -- a spokesman said patients had received what's called a DC-CIK treatment, a procedure that involves, "concentration and processing of blood taken from the person, and subsequent infusion of the mixture back into the patient. In a statement, Hong Kong's Health Department said blood samples taken from one of the women showed the presence of Mycobacterium abscessus, a bacterium that can be found in water, soil and dust, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Dr. Ho said under normal circumstances the bacterium does not pose a danger to healthy people, and is most commonly seen in superficial wound infections.
