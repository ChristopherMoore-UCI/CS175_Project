But to some members of the Ladies Professional Golf Association, choosing Gretzky -- who, yes, is the daughter of hockey great Wayne Gretzky -- means a female pro golfer is getting overlooked. Golf Digest appears to have anticipated the reaction to the cover, as it already has an answer to the question, "What's Paulina Gretzky doing on the cover of Golf Digest?" Golf Digest, which bills itself as "the authority on how to play, what to play and where to play," has explained that as the fianc√©e of PGA Tour pro Dustin Johnson, Gretzky is a major celebrity in the golf world and thereby qualifies the recognition of a cover story. In the Golf Digest piece, Gretzky discusses her involvement in the sport and demonstrates six golf-improvement exercises. "If the answer is men 25 years old through 45 years old, then I guess that's what they have to do," she told USA Today.
