It was not immediately clear what motivated the killing, which happened while Barnette was driving someone else's mail route, said Postal Inspector Frank Schissler. Shortly before 7:30 p.m. ET Saturday, officers were called the scene, where Barnette was pronounced dead from apparent gunshot wounds. -- Authorities are offering rewards totaling up to $125,000 for information about a fatal weekend shooting of a postal worker in Maryland. This tragic incident highlights the need in all operational decisions about how and when mail is delivered to give priority consideration to the safety of these dedicated public servants," he added. We are all deeply saddened," said Fredric Rolando, president of the National Association of Letter Carriers.
