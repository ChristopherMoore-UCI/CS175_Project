"The study does not answer why there were so any records broken last year throughout the U.S." Major snow disappoints with minor moisture Hundreds of U.S. counties labeled disaster areas due to drought 2012 broke U.S. heat records How severe weather affects food supply "Neither ocean states nor human-induced climate change, factors that can provide long-lead predictability, appeared to play significant roles in causing severe rainfall deficits over the major corn-producing regions of central Great Plains," the report summary said. Drought occurred in six Plains states between last May and August because moist Gulf of Mexico air "failed to stream northward in late spring," and summer storms were few and stingy with rainfall, said a report by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. "The analysis failed to take account of the record low snow pack in the Southwest, the development of the drought there and the record high temperatures, the inadequacies of the models used, or why there was no monsoon," said Kevin Trenberth of the National Center for Atmospheric Research, a federally funded facility. "It's highly unlikely that this upcoming May to August will be as dry as last year's," he said, referring to the six states.
