While his family says cell conditions have improved, Tahmooressi's communication with the outside world has been limited in the last week after the prison phone he was using to talk to friends and family broke, limiting his contact, his mother Jill Tahmooressi told CNN. The first two attorneys hired by the family were fired, one after trying to coach Tahmooressi into lying about prior visits to Mexico, his mother told CNN. Within the last week, senior Mexican administration officials and others have met to discuss Tahmooressi's mental health and whether his condition could be cause for his release, the source told CNN. "We continue to provide extensive consular assistance to Mr. Tahmooressi, and will do so until his case is resolved," it said.
