Franklin, 58, was arraigned Thursday on 10 counts of murder with the special-circumstance allegation of multiple murders, said Los Angeles District Attorney Steve Cooley in a written statement. Franklin was arrested and charged with the same counts in July 2010, but the indictment allows the case to move directly to trial instead of a potential lengthy preliminary hearing process, according to Los Angeles District Attorney spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons. In December, Los Angeles detectives disclosed the investigation of two additional homicides that may be related to the suspect. Most of the victims were discovered dumped in South Los Angeles alleys and covered with debris. When detectives announced the arrest, they also revealed that Franklin had, for a time, worked as a garage attendant at a Los Angeles police station and previously had an arrest record although his offenses did not require him to submit a DNA sample.
