Until the purported Syria-related leak, all of the wiretaps seemed to be recordings of phone conversations among Erdogan, his inner circle, government officials and top corporate executives. Disruption to the service began hours after Erdogan threatened to "eradicate" Twitter at a campaign rally on March 20, blaming social media for fueling anti-government rhetoric. The Turkish government said its YouTube block was a response to the leak of a conversation between top government officials purportedly discussing the possibility of going to war with neighboring Syria. Erdogan, of the ruling Justice and Development Party, has called some recordings "immorally edited material," including a conversation in which a man who sounds like the Prime Minister purportedly instructs his son to hide tens of millions of dollars in cash from police investigators. Members of Turkey's political elite have been battered by a campaign of wiretap leaks recorded by unknown operatives and distributed daily on the Internet for more than a month.
