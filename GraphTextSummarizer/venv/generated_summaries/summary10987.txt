"Do they expect us to believe that Mubarak will appear with Adly in two weeks at a court when he has been in Sharm el-Sheikh for six months?" said Noor Noor, an activist and son of presidential candidate Ayman Noor. El Adly and former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak face charges of killing pro-democracy protesters during the revolution that started six months ago. The much anticipated trial of former Egyptian Interior Minister Habib El Adly has been postponed until August 3 -- the same day Egypt's ousted president is scheduled to stand trial. The 83-year-old ex-ruler fell into a coma earlier this month, Mubarak lawyer Farid El Deeb told CNN. This is second time the trial was postponed amid frustrations among protesters in Tahrir Square who demand speedy trials and swift judgments for detained officials from Mubarak's regime.
