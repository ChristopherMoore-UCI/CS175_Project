Officials: Contractor for cable company hit gas line Authorities do not know what caused the leaking gas to ignite, according to Rob Hack, chief operating officer of Missouri Gas Energy. -- The company that was laying cable before an explosion last week at a popular Kansas City, Missouri, restaurant -- a blast that killed one person and injured at least 15 others -- did not have a permit for the excavation, a city official said Monday. A Missouri Gas Energy employee showed up about 20 minutes after the initial call and, after some initial readings on gas-measuring devices, called for backup, Hack said. Those who fail to have such a permit could face a $500 fine and up to six months in jail, Assistant City Manager Patrick Klein said. The contractor called 911 shortly before 5 p.m. to report the gas-line incident, according to Fire Chief Paul Berardi.
