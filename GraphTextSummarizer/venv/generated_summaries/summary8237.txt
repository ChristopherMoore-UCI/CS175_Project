Once in the Dominican Republic -- Haiti's neighbor -- there were delays because of security concerns and a national holiday that meant local help was limited. The drive from Santo Domingo to the Haiti border took about 11 hours because of poor roads and a puncture. Twelve ShelterBoxes are being used to build an emergency field hospital at the airport, said Mark Pearson who is in Haiti for the charity. "If you've lost everything as they have in Haiti, it's all about shelter, warmth, comfort and dignity," says Henderson. The ShelterBox was one of 720 boxes eventually loaded into a four truck convoy in Santa Domingo for a U.N.-escorted drive to Haiti.
