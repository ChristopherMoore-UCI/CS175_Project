According to the California Innocence Project, the woman later admitted that Banks had not kidnapped or raped her during a consensual encounter at Long Beach Polytechnic High School, where Banks was a middle linebacker with a scholarship offer from the University of Southern California. " At age 17, fearing a potentially long sentence, the college football prospect followed the advice of his attorney and pleaded no contest to assaulting a Long Beach, California, high school classmate in 2002. In court last year, an emotional Banks lowered his head and fought back tears when prosecutors said they were moving to have the conviction dismissed. "Justice has been served." Since his exoneration, Banks has spent months in intensive training, attending San Francisco 49ers and Seattle Seahawks minicamps last year. "I know all too well what that is and what it looks like and what it feels like." While serving time in prison, Banks said he was forced to abandon his hopes of playing in the NFL someday.
