-- Brazilian model Mariana Bridi da Costa, whose hands and feet were amputated in a bid to save her from a deadly and little-known illness, died early Saturday, two friends of the model told CNN. Brazilian model Mariana Bridi da Costa died Saturday after undergoing multiple amputations. Simoes told CNN that da Costa woke up from a coma 10 days ago and told him how much she wanted to be alive. Thiago Simoes, da Costa's fiance, said she was on her way to international stardom, signing with prominent model scout Dilson Stein, who brought Brazilian models, including Gisele Bundchen and Luize Altenhofen, to the world stage. The message said they had received "e-mails of solidarity from all corners of the world: Australia, Ukraine, Czech Republic, France, Italy, USA, Russia, etc." CNN's Hilary Whiteman and Helena de Moura contributed to this report.
