Notre Dame turns out football stars the way Hostess turned out Twinkies. You can't make up stories like those. He is a Notre Dame football star. I, myself, once wrote of a Notre Dame football star, Chris Zorich, who played in the Orange Bowl one night, flew home to Chicago the next morning and found his mother dead inside their home. Which at some point Te'o confirmed, although not publicly, not before that January 7 championship game against Alabama.
