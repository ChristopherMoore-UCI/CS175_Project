The deadliest crash involving a Pakistani airline occurred in September 1992, when a Pakistan International Airlines Airbus crashed into a mountain in Nepal, killing all 167 people on board, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported. Pakistan observed a day of mourning Thursday for victims of the accident - the worst passenger plane crash on Pakistani soil. Pakistan is in the midst of the annual monsoon season, when rain sweeps across the subcontinent from June until September. Junaid Amin, the head of Pakistan's Civil Aviation Authority, told CNN the plane's voice and the flight data recorders have been found at the crash site. The U.S. Embassy in Pakistan said two of the people aboard were American citizens.
