-- Spanish police said Tuesday they have arrested five more people in connection with a male prostitution ring involving trafficked men. The websites offered different sexual services in both the brothel or at private homes and hotels, police said Tuesday. One of those trafficked was a 16-year-old Brazilian boy who was found to have performed sexual services for the organization for almost three weeks, Spanish police said Tuesday. The leader of the ring, based in Palma, sent the men to various brothels, gave them cocaine, poppers -- alkyl nitrites that produce a rush when inhaled -- and Viagra, and put them to work as male prostitutes, police said. He was responsible for knowing the situation of each man and obtained their payments through bank transfers, police said Tuesday.
