The pair were stopped early Monday evening at a gate at the base, which houses the headquarters for U.S. troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, Senior Airman Katherine Holt said. The Tampa, Florida, installation houses the headquarters of U.S. Central Command, which runs the U.S. wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, as well as the U.S. Special Operations Command. Earlier, officials said a man and a woman tried to enter the base using fraudulent identifications, Vice Commander Col. David Cohen said at a news conference Tuesday. -- The names of two people who tried Monday to enter MacDill Air Force Base with unauthorized weapons were released by officials Tuesday. All gates at the base reopened Tuesday.
