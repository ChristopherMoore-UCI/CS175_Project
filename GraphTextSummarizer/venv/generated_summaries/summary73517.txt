"It's very difficult to generate any kind of danger when you don't touch the ball," said Uruguay striker Luis Suarez, who scored a superb late consolation with a curling free-kick that matched the one by Italy's Andrea Pirlo against Mexico earlier in the day. " Mexico coach Manuel de la Torre said his players had hoped to play a cautious game and wear down the four-time World Cup winners. His team trailed after 20 minutes of the Group B opener in Recife when Pedro's volley was diverted into the net by captain Diego Lugano, completely wrongfooting goalkeeper Fernando Muslera. The eight-nation tournament is a warm-up for next year's World Cup in Brazil, but on this evidence Vicente del Bosque's team will once again be favored to lift the trophy. With Spain in control, Uruguay's frustrations grew -- and the team which finished fourth at the 2010 World Cup and won the South American title the following year could have gone 3-0 down as Fabregas hit the inside of the post. Suarez, who has been publicly courting a transfer from Liverpool to Real Madrid, showed flashes of the brilliance which made him one of the top scorers in the English Premier League last season.
