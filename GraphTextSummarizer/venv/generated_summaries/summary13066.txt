-- As she began a foot pursuit of a suspect down a dark alley and around a forbidding street corner, Cincinnati police officer Mandy Curfiss radioed to headquarters that she was heading toward a local gas station. Taser International officials said that evidence cannot be altered or erased and that police are the only people with access to it. There are also questions about the chain of evidence captured by AXON cameras. All three devices -- the camera, communications hub and tactical computer -- are connected with one wire. On an overnight ride-along with Cincinnati officer Melissa Cummins in early April, a CNN camera -- and Cummins' AXON camera -- rolled as a man on a street corner ignored her request to throw away an alcoholic beverage.
