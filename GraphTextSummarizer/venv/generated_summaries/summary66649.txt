The highway patrol later opened the northbound lanes, using one for northbound traffic and the other for southbound traffic. At least some of the passengers on the bus were French, said Jacques de Noray, spokesman for the French consulate in San Francisco. The California Highway Patrol said the crash took place at about 3:23 p.m. while the bus was en route from San Francisco to Santa Maria, about 230 miles down the coast. California Highway Patrol spokesman Brian Wiest said. The bus belongs to Orion Pacific, a charter service that provides trips "across the USA and around the world," according to its Web site.
