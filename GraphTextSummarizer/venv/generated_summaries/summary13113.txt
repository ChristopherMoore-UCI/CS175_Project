Like George H.W. Bush in 1992, President Obama seems to be out of ideas. Polls show that many Americans still like President Obama as a person. In August, a USA Today/Gallup poll showed that voters found Obama more likable than Mitt Romney by a staggering 23 points, 54 percent to 31 percent. The same poll found that Romney got the better of Obama when voters were asked who they thought was better able to fix the economy, 52 percent to 43 percent. Civil libertarians winced when Obama emulated George W. Bush's blueprint for fighting the war on terror, everything from suspending habeas corpus for terror suspects to domestic wiretaps to keeping open the military prison at Guantanamo Bay.
