The princess stereotype Alissa Guntren of Bloomington, Indiana, went to Disney World in Florida as a child, but she won't be taking her daughters to Disney theme parks either. "Disney does such a wonderful job of representing American culture, they're almost synonymous with America," said Pettit, who teaches a three-week course, "Disney and American Culture," that includes a Disney World site visit. "We do not enjoy Disney," wrote Mitchell, who went to Disney World as a child, via e-mail. More than $3 billion of that money came from Disney cruises and its 11 theme parks and 43 resorts across North America, Europe and Asia. The Yu family and their two daughters have happily visited Disney theme parks about every two years, and the family has sailed on two Disney cruises.
