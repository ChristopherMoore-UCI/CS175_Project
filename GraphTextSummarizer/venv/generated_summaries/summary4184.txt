As is known, there is a substantial reward out for that violin, and we urge the community to do what it can to develop information and to help us identify, and locate, and recover this priceless instrument," Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn told reporters Wednesday. "We're confident the subjects in custody are the subjects responsible for this," said G.B. Jones, acting special agent in charge with the FBI in Milwaukee. Flynn described the three suspects as a 36-year-old man, a 41-year-man, and a 32-year-old woman, all from Milwaukee. -- Three people have been arrested in connection to the case of a stolen Stradivarius in Milwaukee, but the violin remains missing. He set up shop in Cremona, Italy, where he made violins, harps, guitars, violas and cellos.
