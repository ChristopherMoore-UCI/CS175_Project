Craig Ferguson to leave "The Late Late Show" In a statement, CBS Entertainment Chairman Nina Tassler praised Brit personality Corden as a "rare entertainment force who combines irresistible charm, warmth and originality with a diverse range of creative instincts and performance talent. What James Corden represents for CBS In the meantime, here's what those unfamiliar with Corden should know: 1. Back in August, reports indicated that Corden was being considered as the replacement for current host Craig Ferguson, who announced in April that he plans to depart at the end of the year. As an actor he got his start in the 1997 dramedy "24 7: Twenty Four Seven," and then bounced around between film, the stage and TV, including an appearance on "Doctor Who." In 2008, he won a BAFTA for television comedy performance with the series he co-created and starred in, "Gavin & Stacey." He may not be as well-known Stateside as he is overseas, but The Wrap pointed out in August that Corden has something CBS execs would want: 4.3 million followers on Twitter.
