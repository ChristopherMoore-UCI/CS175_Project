The prosecutor said his office investigated her claim of abuse and found no proof to substantiate her allegations, but European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton said last month that the Ukrainian Ombudsperson's Office confirmed the report. She went on hunger strike last month to draw attention to "violence and lack of rights" in her country after she said she was beaten unconscious in prison. Tymoshenko is serving a seven-year prison sentence after she was convicted last year of abuse of authority. Tymoshenko, who has been on hunger strike since April 20, will be transferred to a hospital in the eastern city of Kharkov by Wednesday, according to spokeswoman Marina Soroka. In October, a Ukrainian court found Tymoshenko guilty of abuse of authority for signing overpriced gas contracts with Russia and sentenced her to the seven-year prison term.
