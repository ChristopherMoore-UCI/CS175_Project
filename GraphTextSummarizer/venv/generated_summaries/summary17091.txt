In its short, sweet first season, Shonda Rhimes' Scandal introduced powerhouse political fixer Olivia Pope (Kerry Washington) and her powerful associates, including President Fitzgerald "Fitz" Grant himself (Tony Goldwyn). Before "Scandal's" Blu-ray/DVD hits stores tomorrow, Washington shared with EW her favorite moments from the D.C. drama, discussed her electrifying chemistry with Goldwyn, and even dished on season 2. Though Washington claimed to love the "dirty work of acting," she clearly prefers watching co-star Guillermo Diaz "torture" another actor rather than the steamy scene she shared with Goldwyn. Washington assured, "I know Tony's still going to be around" when the show resumes filming in July.
