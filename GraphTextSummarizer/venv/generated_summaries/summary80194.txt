About two-thirds of the $24 billion Washington spent on energy subsidies in 2011 went to support energy efficiency and renewable sources such as wind, solar and biofuels. Jenkins said the money needed might not be as much as the peak of spending under the stimulus bill and earlier programs, which was as high as $44 billion in 2009 -- "but I think it needs to be quite a bit higher than the downward slope we see going forward." Among the Republicans who control the House of Representatives, however, there appears to be little support for keeping clean energy programs alive. The research and investments have led to sharply higher electric generating capacity and reduced cost to a point where renewable energy is nearly competitive with natural gas, said Jesse Jenkins, director of energy and climate policy at the Breakthrough Institute. In addition, private investors poured another $48 billion into renewable energy last year, a report from the Pew Charitable Trusts found last week. The report calls for a tripling of energy research and development funding and replacing current federal loan guarantees with programs aimed at helping private companies get low-carbon technologies to market faster.
