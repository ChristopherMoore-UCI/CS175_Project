Working with dozens of community partners, Siskowski's group helps families with unique needs. " According to a 2006 study conducted by Civic Enterprises for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, 22% of high school dropouts in the United States leave school to care for a family member (PDF). "No child in the United States should have to drop out of school because of caregiving," said Siskowski, 65. "We've provided clean-water systems and enlisted the support of community members to build wheelchair ramps or relocate a family from a moldy environment," said Siskowski, whose group relies solely on donations and grants. Others have to care for multiple family members, including siblings.
