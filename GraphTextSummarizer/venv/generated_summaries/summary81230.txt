Hillary Clinton's midterm campaign schedule This is not the first time, either, Clinton has put herself in this position. While it would be impossible for Clinton to only speak to groups that agree with her on everything, speaking to organizations that openly disagree with Democrats on certain issues has proven problematic for Clinton.
