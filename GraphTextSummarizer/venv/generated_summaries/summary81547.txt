The final will take place in Buenos Aires' Estadio Monumental on Sunday. The deadlock was broken seven minutes after the break, when Peru goalkeeper Raul Fernandez could only parry Diego Forlan's shot and Suarez, 24, found the net from an acute angle. Suarez now has three goals in the tournament, which leaves him level with Argentina's Sergio Aguero as the competition's top goal scorer. Peru's misery was complete on 68 minutes with the dismissal of their captain Juan Manuel Vargas for an elbow on defender Sebastian Coates. The second semifinal will take place on Wednesday at the Estadio Malvinas Argentinas in Mendoza.
