Moreover, the terrorists created their own operations center across the border in Pakistan, where they monitored global news broadcasts, online reporting and social media in real time, leveraging the public's photos, videos and social network updates to kill more people. Good people in the world far outnumber those with ill intentions. The criminal underground is highly innovative and often acts as an early adopter of emerging technologies. The lethal innovation was the way that the terrorists used modern information communications technologies, including smartphones, satellite imagery and night-vision goggles to locate additional victims and slaughter them. The future of science and technology sounds so promising.
