The New York Fire Department fielded some 3,700 emergency calls, CNN affiliate WABC reported Monday, and the department took the unusual step of calling in help from neighboring agencies. At least one person has died in Harford County, Maryland, state police spokesman Greg Shipley said. Ice storms hit parts of Connecticut, New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania over the weekend,  prompting the mayor of Danbury, Connecticut, to begin the hashtag #Icezilla. The Hartford Courant reported that the ice contributed to more than 216 car accidents on Sunday, including a fatal crash in New Haven. Winter storm warnings are in effect through the morning for upstate Vermont and portions of New Hampshire, Maine and western Massachusetts.
