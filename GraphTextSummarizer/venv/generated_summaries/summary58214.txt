But Adams, spokesman for Vancouver Coastal Health, clarified and said the free condoms were available not just to athletes and game officials. It's hard to say this conclusively, and judges from other host cities may demand a recount, but Clay Adams of Vancouver Coastal Health said the word on the public health street is that Vancouver is king of the prophylactic winter rings. Some say condoms were snagged as souvenirs, although Adams said they were not branded with Olympic rings. -- The medals have been presented, the caldron extinguished and the crowds dispersed, but there's one record from the 2010 Vancouver Olympics that may have been overlooked: Most condoms distributed at a Winter Games. He said he did hear stories of athletes from countries with inferior condoms stuffing their suitcases with the coveted rubbers.
