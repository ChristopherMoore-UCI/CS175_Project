-- Four months after he was escorted in his pajamas onto a military plane and flown out of the country, ousted Honduran President Jose Manuel Zelaya could return to power within days, analysts said Friday. Micheletti said in an interview Friday evening with CNN en Espa√±ol that he's certain Zelaya will try to prosecute him. Zelaya said Friday his return to the presidency is "imminent" and should occur within days. Negotiators for Zelaya and Roberto Micheletti, the politician who was appointed president hours after Zelaya's June 28 removal, reached an agreement late Thursday to form a government of national reconciliation. Although Zelaya's return to the presidency is not guaranteed in the eight-point pact, several analysts say they expect the congress will approve the measure.
