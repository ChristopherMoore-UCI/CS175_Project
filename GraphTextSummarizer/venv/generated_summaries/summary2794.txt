It occurred to me that the people making these decisions are men -- space science is a field which is 90% men, men men! Ben Hayoun speaks to illustrious space scientists from SETI, NASA's Near Earth Objects (NEO) project and Disaster and Rescue Assistance (DART) including: extra-terrestrial intelligence specialist Dr. Jill Tarter (the inspiration for Jodie Foster's character in the film Contact), and meteor shower expert Dr. Peter Jenniskens. So what do you do in the case of hazardous asteroids or a small NEO (Near Earth Object)? Alternative methods: moving asteroids with lasers, focusing sun energy, changing thermal properties, electro-static pushing and reflecting white paint. Suggest that the source of a serious humanitarian crisis could lie in outer space, however, and many will assume you are talking science fiction.
