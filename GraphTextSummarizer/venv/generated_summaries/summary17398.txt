The Environmental Protection Agency sets a standard for beach water quality, and when water quality tests reveal that pollution has exceeded that standard, the beach is closed. " Pollutants found in beach water are frequently the result of storm water or sewage overflow, and it's not something to take lightly, especially if small children, pregnant women or the elderly are spending time in the surf. Thankfully, not all beaches are polluted equally -- the NRDC hands out five stars to beaches that meet health standards more than 95 per cent of the time and quickly notify beach goers with signs and Internet alerts when there's a potential problem. "Nationwide, 7 percent of beach water samples are so contaminated with human or animal waste that they're not conducive for swimming," said Nancy Stoner, co-director of the NRDC's water program and lead author for the report. In 2008, 13 percent of beach water samples violated public health standards," Stoner said.
