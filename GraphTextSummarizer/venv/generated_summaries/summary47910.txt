Previous al Qaeda No. 3 officials to die on the job in the last decade include: Mohamed Atef (killed in 2001), Khalid Sheikh Mohammed (captured in 2003), Abu Farraj al-Libbi (captured in 2005) and Hamza Rabia (killed in 2005), the U.S. official said. IntelCenter, a think tank that tracks terrorist groups, said Yazid's death was one of the most significant blows against al Qaeda in recent years. Because of its degraded capabilities, al Qaeda has found itself in the position of needing to integrate its efforts with other extremist groups such as the Pakistani Taliban and the Afghan Taliban, the U.S. official said. In the past, Yazid has made numerous statements on jihadist websites and in video releases from al Qaeda's media arm, al Sahab. U.S. intelligence officials said Yazid would brief would-be al Qaeda operatives who came from the United States for attacks abroad.
