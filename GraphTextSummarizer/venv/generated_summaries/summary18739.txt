Ranked 33 at the time and with only one previous top-10 finish at the championship, Cink says he was inspired by fellow American Lucas Glover, who shocked better-known rivals to land the U.S. Open title last year. "I'm disappointed that I will not be able to participate in this year's Open Championship, but unfortunately, it is taking me longer than expected to regain my competitive form," Norman told the Open's official website. -- U.S. golfer Stewart Cink has promised a "fiercely competitive" defense of his British Open title at St Andrews next week. Cink, the world number 34, was a surprise winner of the Claret Jug last season, beating veteran Tom Watson in a play-off to land his first major title. While Watson will be making another bid for his sixth title at St Andrews, another of the sport's legends won't be there.
