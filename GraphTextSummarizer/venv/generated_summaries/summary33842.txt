Meantime, federal authorities have despatched 5,000 additional armed police to Assam, according to state Inspector General S.N. Singh. But on Tuesday they attacked members of non-Assamese tribal people who have lived in the state since before India got independence in 1947, Inspector General S.N. Singh said. On Thursday, Indian Home Minister Rajnath Singh termed the militant strike in Assam a "massacre" as he vowed to pursue what he called a "time-bound action against terror." "The army is going out with full intensity," Lt. Col. Suneet Newton, an Indian military spokesman from Assam, told CNN Friday. As part of anti-insurgent efforts in Assam, India said it was also reaching out to its eastern neighbors for assistance.
