The scientists have recognized a puff of water vapor sprouting 125 miles high above Europa in a special image captured by the Hubble Space Telescope, NASA said Thursday. Europa, which is too far away from the sun to enjoy the warmth of its golden rays, has surface temperatures as low as -328 degrees Fahrenheit, the AGU said. Thursday's announcement was based on images recorded in December of last year, NASA said. "If those plumes are connected with the subsurface water ocean we are confident exists under Europa's crust, then this means that future investigations can directly investigate the chemical makeup of Europa's potentially habitable environment without drilling through layers of ice. They're not quite sure yet, but Saur, a professor at the University of Cologne in Germany, believes that a geyser on Europa's south pole blustered the vapor up from a water source under the moon's surface.
