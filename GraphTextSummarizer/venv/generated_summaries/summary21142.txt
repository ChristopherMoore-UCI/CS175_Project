A rare copy of the first book printed in what is now the United States of America may sell for as much as $30 million when it comes up for auction in November, according to Sotheby's. The copy to be auctioned on November 26 is one of two that come from the collection of Old South Church in Boston. According to Sotheby's, the Puritans wanted a version of the Psalms that was a closer paraphrase of the Hebrew original than the one they brought from England. Members of the church voted last December to put one copy up for auction in order to enhance finances and ministries. The book will be on display at Sotheby's in New York until Sunday.
