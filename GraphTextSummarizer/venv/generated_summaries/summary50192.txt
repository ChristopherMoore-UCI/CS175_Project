Georgia school shooting suspect was arrested in March Henry County court records show that, in addition to three years of probation, he was ordered to attend anger management classes. By the end -- with police themselves having never directly talked to him -- Tuff and the gunman were talking about where he would put his weapon, how he'd empty his pockets and where he'd lie down before authorities could get him. Community members and leaders are offering praise for Tuff and police, as well as gratitude that the story did not turn tragic. School staff regularly train for dangerous situations involving trespassers and emergency protocol, school district spokesman Quinn Hudson said. "Let me tell you something, babe," Tuff tells the dispatcher, Kendra McCray, at the end of the dramatic 911 call that recounts her minutes of valor and terror.
