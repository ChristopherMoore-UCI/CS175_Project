"It could be that the type of couples who have a ... (cheap wedding) are the type that are a perfect match for each other," said Professor Hugo M. Mialon, who co-authored the study with Andrew M. Francis. The authors believe theirs is the first academic study to examine the correlation between wedding expenses and the length of marriages. And couples who spent $1,000 or less on their big day had a lower than average rate of divorce. The study, by two economics professors at Emory University, found a similar correlation between less-expensive engagement rings and lower divorce rates. "This could be evidence of a community effect, i.e., having more support from friends and family may help the couple to get through the challenges of marriage," Francis said.
