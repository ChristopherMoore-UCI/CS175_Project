Already water supplies In Algeria, Egypt, Lebanon, Libya, Malta, Morocco, Syria and Tunisia are at or close to 1,000 cubic meters per person per year, which is widely taken as a benchmark for water scarcity. Many countries in the Mediterranean basin could face a future of significant food and water shortages as climate change bites and deserts spread. Belts of trees and grass can be used to reduce wind velocity and stop sand spreading, and provide a managed resource for local communities. These huge, sky-blackening dust storms sweep across Asia in March and April, bringing with them millions of tons of sand from inner Mongolia and depositing it in China and on across the Korean peninsula to Japan. Scientists also predict that water shortages could increase the risk of supply contamination and associated diseases such as cholera and dysentery.
