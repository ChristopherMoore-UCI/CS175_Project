According to Johns' new memoir, "Sound Man," while traveling with Rolling Stone founder Jann Wenner he ran into Dylan in New York sometime in 1969. Johns had worked with the Beatles in early 1969 on the "Get Back" sessions -- later to become "Let It Be" -- and the Stones on 1968's "Beggars Banquet," so he had recent experience with both. "He said he had this idea to make a record with the Beatles and the Stones," Johns writes. And it was actually proposed, says engineer and producer Glyn Johns, according to a piece in Rolling Stone. The Beatles, Bob and Mick: 50 years since pop culture's youth revolution Johns ran the idea by the bands' members.
