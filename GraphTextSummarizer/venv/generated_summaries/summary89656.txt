Why do American presidents love drone technology? Policies like drone attacks, extrajudicial murders committed by a state, and covert programs like rendition and secret prisons in timid allied states not only kill people -- they decimate any hope for peace. There is growing anti-American sentiment in regions affected by drone attacks and some people are tempted to resort to illegal means when the system does not deliver justice to them. But the U.S. would like to keep its hegemony, and drone technology makes this dream a reality. Both Obama and Romney promised to continue with drone warfare that has targeted northwest Pakistan if elected.
