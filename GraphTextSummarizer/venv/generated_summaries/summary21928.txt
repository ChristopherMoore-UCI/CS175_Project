Dr. Julio Diaz earned that nickname because, according to court records, he was writing prescriptions for massive numbers of pills -- hundreds, even thousands, at a time. Montgomery started seeing Diaz after he injured his back on a construction job. " Montgomery slowly became aware that his son was addicted to oxycodone, and he called Diaz. "I was seeing paperwork with hundreds of oxycodone pills," Montgomery told CNN. "Right now we have more people that are dying from prescription opioids than cocaine and heroin combined," said Robert Hill, a DEA special agent with years of experience on the front lines of the war on drugs.
