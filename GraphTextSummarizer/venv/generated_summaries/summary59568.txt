-- MotoGP will not visit Argentina until 2014 after next year's race was scrapped following a row between Spanish oil firm Repsol and the Spanish and Argentine governments. "Anyhow, Dorna Sports commits itself to include Gran Premio de la República Argentina on the 2014 Calendar and onwards, to be approved by FIM subject to the homologation of the track, which presumably shall take place within the first quarter of 2013. Lorenzo wraps up MotoGP title Dorna Sports, commercial rights holder of the MotoGP™ World Championship, said in a statement: "The Gran Premio de la República Argentina, which was set to take place at the Termas de Rio Hondo circuit early next year, has not been included in the 2013 calendar. Therefore, the celebration of the 2013 Gran Premio de la República Argentina remained under suspension until such recommendation would be kept in force. "On June 20th 2012, the Spanish government recommended that teams and riders sponsored by Repsol should not travel to the República Argentina due to safety reasons.
