Building management told Manhattan apartment residents that it was not consulted before a leaserholder invited former International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn to stay as a guest, according to an e-mail obtained Saturday by CNN. Though hotel staff never found the phone, they followed police orders, telling Strauss-Kahn they had found it and would deliver it to him, the source said. Strauss-Kahn, who is accused of trying to rape a maid last week in his suite at the Sofitel hotel in New York, will stay with his wife, Anne Sinclair. Judelson would not divulge what Sinclair put up as collateral. About an hour before his 4:40 p.m. flight was to take off from John F. Kennedy International Airport for Paris, Strauss-Kahn called the hotel to say he had left his cell phone.
