-- A day after the disheartening loss of its star-studded team in the men's hockey preliminaries, Canada got a warm boost when the pair of Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir won ice dancing gold Monday night. The pair, which has been skating together since 1997, edged the U.S. team of Meryl Davis and Charlie White (215.74). The giant leap made up for the fact that style points were lost due to the awkward landing -- and helped Austria claim a comfortable victory over Germany, who took the silver. A giant leap from Gregor Schlierenzauer gave Austria a sensational gold medal in the men's team ski jumping competition in Whistler on Monday. Along with compatriot Oeystein Pettersen, the Norwegians claimed gold in a time of 19 minutes and one second.
