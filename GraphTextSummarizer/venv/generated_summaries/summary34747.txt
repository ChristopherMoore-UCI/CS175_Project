In a campaign video, Obama campaign manager David Plouffe said a record 632,000 new donors gave to the campaign, with the average contribution under $100. -- Barack Obama's campaign announced Sunday the Democratic presidential candidate raised $150 million in donations in September, setting a new high-water mark in campaign fundraising. Regardless of the stunning haul, Plouffe told supporters the campaign still needed more money because of "the slime that we're getting from the McCain campaign." The McCain campaign accepted $85 million in federal matching funds for the last two months of the campaign. Plouffe cited recent attack ads and automated phone calls in battleground states and said the campaign needed to have every resource to "fight back." "Their campaign is going to descend even more into the gutter," he said.
