Marriage equality is not about religious rights, but the right to equal benefits. If same-sex marriage is about love and religion is about love, then in this debate, love must go both ways. Though my partner and I had a commitment ceremony in 2003, and obtained a marriage license this past July in Washington D.C., we learned that marriage is more than our religious convictions and our commitment, but also about laws that will protect us. Then, it was argued that interracial marriage would hurt families and dismantle societal structures. At the end of 2003, the U.S. Government Accountability Office identified 1,138 federal provisions where marital status is a factor in determining or receiving benefits, rights and privileges.
