CT (8:02 p.m. ET), said Texas Department of Criminal Justice spokeswoman Becky Blanton. The office of Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott stated, on its website, that Garcia -- who had been arrested with gang members in 1992 -- also fired his weapon at the vice principal of a nearby elementary school, hitting the front door of the school. Garza, 49, died first after being shot three times by Garcia, the Texas Department of Criminal Justice said on its website. Garcia was 28 on March 29, 2001, when San Antonio police officer Hector Garza responded to a call about a domestic disturbance at the home Garcia shared with his parents, his wife, Jessica, and their children. During his trial, jurors saw photos from inside Garcia's home showing him and his wife brandishing weapons.
