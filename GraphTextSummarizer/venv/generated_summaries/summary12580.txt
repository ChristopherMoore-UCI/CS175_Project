They both served as guest co-hosts last season. Changes at the talk show commenced in May, when one of its co-creators and original co-host, Barbara Walters, stepped down. Along with Walters, two other co-hosts have stepped down -- Sherri Shepherd and Jenny McCarthy. Wallace was a senior advisor to John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign and communications director for President George W. Bush. They will join comedienne Rosie O'Donnell, whose addition was announced earlier, and Whoopi Goldberg, the only one remaining from the last season of the show.
