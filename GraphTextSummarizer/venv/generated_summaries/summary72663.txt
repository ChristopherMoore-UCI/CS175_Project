35 years on, top Khmer Rouge leaders face justice in Cambodia Trial 'will not bring back the dead' Five faces of Cambodia's Khmer Rouge While our efforts in applying due process in the punishment of genocide and mass atrocities deserve recognition and respect, we should not overlook the paramount need for preventing such crimes before they occur. Time and again, the international community has watched mass atrocities, genocide, and other heinous crimes proceed unchecked. This verdict regarding the two senior Khmer Rouge leaders matters a great deal to me, as should it for all Cambodians, because it gives some closure -- but closure is too little, too late for many. If only the international community would exercise the courage and resolve as the man in prison did for me, the world would need fewer verdicts.
