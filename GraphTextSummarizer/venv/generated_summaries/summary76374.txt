The Gingrich relaunch Romney will be the center of attention on Monday night, but former House Speaker Newt Gingrich might have the most to prove. Thanks to his standing at the top of the most recent horse race polls, his fundraising prowess and his top-flight campaign organization, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney is generally considered the front-runner at this early point in the battle for the GOP nomination. Cain has also made frequent appearances in New Hampshire and he delivered a strong performance last month at a Republican debate in South Carolina, albeit one that lacked Romney and featured just five candidates. Poll: Romney at top of GOP field Because of his front-runner status and nagging questions among conservatives about the health care law he instituted in Massachusetts, expect Romney to have a bull's-eye on his back tonight in the early primary state he needs to win if he hopes to be the nominee. Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin is second with 20%, followed by former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani and the rest of the field.
