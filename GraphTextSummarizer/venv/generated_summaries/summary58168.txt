"Our embassies are the face of the United States overseas," spokeswoman Marie Harf said Wednesday, acknowledging the report but adding that art purchases for the embassy in Pakistan have not been finalized. The State Department defended its Art in Embassies program on Wednesday following a report that it plans to purchase a $400,000 sculpture for the embassy compound under construction in Islamabad. She emphasized the total spent on art at new embassies amounts to just 0.5% of the embassy's total construction budget. Over $300 million worth of art is also on loan to diplomatic facilities by the artists themselves, according to Harf. "Right now, we're still making decisions about what the art will look like specifically in our embassy in Islamabad," said Harf.
