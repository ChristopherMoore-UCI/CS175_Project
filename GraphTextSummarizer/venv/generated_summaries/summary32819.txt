In the Internet age, we have no choice but to entrust our data with private companies: e-mail providers, service providers, retailers, and so on. We're now living in a world where a lot of intimate data is stored in some third-party database somewhere -- the emails and texts we send and receive, our location data from our cell phones, the things we purchase, the Web pages we look at, and the search terms we use. And well before the Internet, people with access to police or medical records occasionally used that power to look up either famous people or people they knew. And while it may be fun for Uber to publish data on riders heading off to one-night stands and hookups with prostitutes (Uber recently deleted both posts), or for OKCupid to publish their users' sexual preferences and habits, this is very intimate information. Companies are starting to analyze our personal data and publish the results, sometimes in an effort to get positive press.
