, the outgoing U.S. ambassador in Zimbabwe, Christopher W. Dell, wrote a valedictory note about the government of President Robert Mugabe. Thabo Mbeki, former president of South Africa, had been trying to mediate in Zimbabwe and had, according to Dell, "the best, albeit very slim, hope of getting there." When considering possible Mugabe successors, Dell is less than impressed with the options. He goes on to lament that the current leadership would "require massive hand-holding and assistance should they ever come to power." Morgan Tsvangirai, prime minister and MDC head, is characterized by Dell as a "brave, committed man" with "star quality." Dell goes on to characterize Mugabe, who has been in power since 1980, as "a brilliant tactician" who is "more clever and more ruthless than any other politician in Zimbabwe." Today, President Mugabe is still in place, though he now heads an uneasy power-sharing government with the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC).
