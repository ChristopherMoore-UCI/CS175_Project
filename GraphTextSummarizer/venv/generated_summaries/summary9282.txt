" Problems in management, analysts say Ron Suskind, who analyzed Obama's leadership style in his book "Confidence Men," said the recent glitches in HealthCare.gov give a glimpse into problems with Obama's management approach. It's plausible that Obama wouldn't know about specific surveillance targets, said CNN National Security Analyst Frances Fragos Townsend, who sits on the CIA external advisory board.
