One Republican, Nebraska Rep. Lee Terry, told CNN that conservative activists had been strongly engaged with House members on the issue in recent weeks. Numerous House Republicans threatened to defeat a temporary spending measure proposed by their leadership because it did not directly link continued government funding with a ban on money for the new health care law. House GOP leaders announced their intention Wednesday to pass a bill this week that would only keep the government running after September 30 if President Barack Obama's health care reform law is fully defunded. "We're going to continue to do everything we can to repeal the president's failed health care law," said House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio. A top Senate Democrat warned House Republicans they were playing a losing hand.
