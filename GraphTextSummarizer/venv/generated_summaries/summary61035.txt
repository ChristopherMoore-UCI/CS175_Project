Lazika will be a new port on Georgia's Black Sea coast and a special economic zone where businesses can operate under UK law. In the marshland just south of the seaside-resort of Anaklia in Western Georgia, the air is often filled with birdsong and the croak of tiny frogs. But added to nature's chorus is the sound of construction, something difficult to escape along Georgia's Black Sea Coast. Georgia's president Mikheil Saakashvili wants to build a whole new city called Lazika. "If we want to be exceptional and if we want to create this hub economy, a place for the rest of the world to come and invest in Georgia, then we have to be creative," says Vera Kobalia, Georgia's 28-year-old economy minister.
