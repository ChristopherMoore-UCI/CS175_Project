Benetton said Italy's major problems are its aging population and high youth unemployment, rather than its ability to repay debt. Political tensions between Germany and countries such as Italy, and Greece, which triggered the crisis, have intensified as the crisis continues to roll on. While Benetton acknowledges southern Europe is not producing as much as its northern counterparts, he said they should not be ignored. The eurozone's debt crisis has exacerbated a split between the strong economies, led by Germany, and those which are struggling, such as Italy. However Alessandro Benetton, deputy executive chairman of the retailer -- which has 6,400 stores across 120 countries -- told CNN: "Germany needs Europe just as much as Europe needs Germany."
