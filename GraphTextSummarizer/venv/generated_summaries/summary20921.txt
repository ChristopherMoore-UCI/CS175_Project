I discovered that many girls do not have books and school supplies, or the time or a place to study after school. Of those 4,500 students entering middle school, only 1,500 will enter high school. I had spent 30 years in and out of many African countries, designing health, education and nutrition programs, and had lived in many places and discovered many cultures. Only if parents can afford private school education will the child be able to continue. In Senegal, if a child fails two successive years in public school he or she is expelled.
