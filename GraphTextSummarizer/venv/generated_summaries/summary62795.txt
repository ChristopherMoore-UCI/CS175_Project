Yemen says al Qaeda was behind a suicide bombing Sunday that killed four South Korean tourists, according to the Daily Yemen Post. The city of Shibam is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The explosion Sunday evening in the city of Shibam also wounded three other tourists, said Hakim Almasmari, editor-in-chief of the English-language newspaper. The tourists were taking pictures of Shibam at sunset, Almasmari said. The old walled city is a United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage Site; sunset is the best time to take pictures of it, he said. Almasmari told CNN Monday that Yemen's Interior Ministry is blaming al Qaeda.
