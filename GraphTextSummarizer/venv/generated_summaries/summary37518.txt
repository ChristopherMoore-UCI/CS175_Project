This animal had been seen before by humans, Helgen said, but it had been "a case of mistaken identity." This animal had been missed by everyone." Even people who live in the Andes had the same confusion about olinguitos being olingos, because humans don't hunt them and the creatures stay in the trees, Helgen said. It turns out, according to Helgen, there are four subspecies of olinguitos, differing in color -- shades of reds, orange and browns -- and size and living in various sections of the Andes. Records indicated to Helgen that such specimens came from the northern Andes about 5,000 to 9,000 feet above sea level, which is much higher than olingo habitats. Previously, scientists had assumed that olinguitos were members of their sister species, the olingos, Helgen said.
