She posted emotional messages in July to counter rumors about how she was dealing with the news of Jackson's death. Her publicist had denied tabloid rumors that her hospitalization was brought on by her grief over the sudden death of her close friend Michael Jackson in June. She opened the account this year at the suggestion of her close friend, author and actress Kathy Ireland, publicist Dick Guttman said. The London-born movie star has won two Academy Awards for best actress: first for "Butterfield 8" in 1961 and then for "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf" in 1967. "Although my grief over Michael could not be any deeper, I am not on suicide watch as some of the cheaper 'rags' would have you believe," Taylor wrote July 5.
