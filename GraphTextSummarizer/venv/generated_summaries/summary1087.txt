" The American Red Cross, the largest national charity dealing with the effects of Sandy has raised $103 million so far for Sandy victims, and that contributions "continue to pour in," according to spokeswoman Anne Marie Borrego. Indiegogo, an international crowd funding site, has more than 32 pages of pleas for cash donations from Sandy victims. "People are going to continue to get duped by unscrupulous claims." Earlier this week, the FBI took time to issue a public warning about scam artists in the wake of devastating storms. -- As the Northeast digs out from a second major storm in little more than a week, experts say Internet scam artists are preying on generous Americans who want to donate to the victims of Superstorm Sandy. In one instance, a website linking Sandy to the damage it caused on the island of Jamaica popped up as news accounts reported the growing intensity of the storm.
