-- This rural community in the southeast corner of Iowa is one of the last places you would expect to find a large number of students who don't speak English, yet English language learners have had a huge effect on the schools there, according to Columbus Community Schools Superintendent Rich Bridenstine. Bridenstine sees a difference between a child who can speak general English and one who has the academic English skills required to get through school. Rural schools in particular have difficulty with English language learners, according to Silva. To help with the language skills, the teachers in Columbus Junction are encouraged to have students explain what they have learned to a student partner using English. A quarter of the Columbus Community School students are English language learners, a large enough number to have an impact on the classrooms.
