The first audio equipment with out-of-the-box support for Apple AirPlay protocol debuted in April. There, Jawbone's Jambox, a small rectangular gadget that uses Bluetooth for wireless transmission instead of AirPlay, is hanging on a wall in the back rather than on display like it is in other Apple Stores. However, for the equipment companies targeting the Apple faithful -- consumers who learn about and buy many of their products at Apple stores -- it's an important venue to occupy. But in other Apple retail locations like the one in Fashion Show Mall in Las Vegas, little space is left over since Apple redesigned its stores to include "personal training" and "personal setup" stations. Apple's proposal to cut back on the supply of dock products it carries was first reported by Twice, a consumer-electronics trade publication.
