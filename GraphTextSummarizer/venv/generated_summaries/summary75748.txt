The couple's two daughters, 17-year-old Hayley Petit and 11-year-old Michaela Petit, died from smoke inhalation. They say the two beat up Dr. William Petit; strangled his 48-year-old wife, Jennifer Hawke-Petit; and set the home ablaze. Steven Hayes was in intensive care, attorney Thomas Ullmann said. Authorities allege that during the Petit home invasion, one of the attackers drove Hawke-Petit to a bank to withdraw money. Superior Court Judge Jon C. Blue said in court Monday that Ullmann told him Hayes was found unconscious in his cell and may be in a medically induced coma.
