-- Music producer and promoter Don Kirshner, who found songs for The Monkees to sing and whose live TV rock show helped wean 1970s audiences off lip-synched programming, died Monday in Boca Raton, Florida, his publicist confirmed Tuesday. A renowned song publisher and rock producer, Kirshner is best known for managing the songwriting talent behind the successful pop music television series "The Monkees," and for his signature TV program, "Don Kirshner's Rock Concert." In September 1973, Kirshner created, produced, and eventually hosted his own syndicated, weekly rock-concert program, "Don Kirshner's Rock Concert." As a producer-promoter, Kirshner was influential in igniting the careers of artists such as Bobby Darin, Neil Diamond and Tony Orlando, as well as discovering rock acts such as Kansas. Within a demanding time frame, he quickly corralled songwriting talent to craft catchy tunes for the show, which became a smash hit among teen audiences.
