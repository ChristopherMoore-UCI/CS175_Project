"The result has highlighted expanding social inequalities and policy issues surrounding official corruption and income distribution," said Wang Xiaolu, who led the research for the CSER, in an article in Caixin Online. "Gray income" can range from illegal cash from kickbacks to unreported income and gifts. "To stop widening income disparity and unfair allocation, in addition to anti-corruption campaigns, there needs to be gradual but firm progress in economic, political and social reform that moves the country closer to the rule of law with public scrutiny over administrative power," he said. The survey found that rich families gain 80% of their wealth from business and on average "have decent gains" in stock markets, whereas most middle and lower income families lose cash in the capital markets, Wang said. Much of the high gray income is linked to the loose credit handed out between 2009 and 2010, Wang wrote, as well as the rapid increase of government investment during the same period.
