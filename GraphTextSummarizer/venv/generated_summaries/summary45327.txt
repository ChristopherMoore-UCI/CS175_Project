In his memoir, "You Have to Pay the Price," legendary Army coach Earl "Red' Blaik wrote, "The primary objective of Army football must be victory over Navy. A knee injury ended his football career and kept him out of the 1912 Army-Navy game, but over the years, Ike maintained his interest in Army football. How far this pressure to win goes is epitomized by the story former Army coach Paul Dietzel tells in his autobiography, "Call Me Coach," of a dinner party at the home of Gen. William Westmoreland, later commander of American troops in Vietnam, who while superintendent of West Point hired Dietzel in 1962 to revive Army's football fortunes. When the Army-Navy game of 1963 was canceled as a result of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, it was played a week later at the request of the Kennedy family, and the coin that President Kennedy would have flipped to decide which team received the opening kickoff was sent as a gift by Secretary of the Army Cyrus Vance to Navy's winning football captain Tom Lynch. As a result Army was trounced 24-0 by a Navy team that had been playing football since 1886.
