In July, the Forensic Science Commission found that arson investigators used flawed science in their probe of the Willingham matter, but were not negligent and did not commit misconduct. Perry has said he's confident Willingham was guilty, while police in Corsicana say other evidence beyond the arson testimony supports the prosecution. The first of those reports was sent to Gov. Rick Perry's office and submitted to appeals courts before Willingham's execution, while the other two came after his death. As governor, he had signed off on Willingham's execution, and critics have accused him of trying to derail a review of that case. He also noted that authorities, ranging from parole boards to the U.S. Supreme Court, had looked into the trial and conviction ahead of Willingham's execution.
