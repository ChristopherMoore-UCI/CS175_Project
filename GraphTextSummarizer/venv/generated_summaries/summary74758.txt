The former vice president pointed to CIA documents, released Monday, that say many captured al Qaeda suspects provided information that led to the arrest of other terrorism suspects. Former Vice President Dick Cheney says documents released Monday support his view that harsh interrogation techniques used on terrorism suspects prevented attacks and yielded crucial information about al Qaeda. "The documents released Monday clearly demonstrated that the individuals subjected to enhanced interrogation techniques provided the bulk of intelligence we gained about al Qaeda," Cheney said in a written statement. Critics say some of the techniques that had been authorized -- such as the use of waterboarding against al-Nashiri, Mohammed and fellow al Qaeda captive Abu Zubayda -- clearly violated international law. Cheney also criticized the Obama administration's decision to ask a federal prosecutor to determine whether U.S. intelligence agents violated the law in interrogations that some have equated to torture.
