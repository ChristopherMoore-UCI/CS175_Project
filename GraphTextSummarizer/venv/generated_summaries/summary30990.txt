Some 21 containers holding a hazardous metal called cryolite -- a by-product of aluminum smelting -- have also slipped off the vessel as it plunged downward, said Maritime New Zealand spokeswoman Michele Poole. -- The stern of a cargo ship that ran aground last year on a reef off the coast of New Zealand has slipped further underwater, officials said Tuesday, spewing nearly 10 more tons of oil into the sea. Between 200 and 300 containers, comprised mostly of wood and milk products, were also lost overboard when the ship broke apart "There is inevitably going to be a lot of mess and disturbance for the next few days while this is cleaned up and we would like people to use common sense and stay well away from the debris -- in some cases this will mean staying out of the water as well as away from material washed up on the beach," National On Scene Commander Alex van Wijngaarden said in a statement. Authorities said six little blue, or korora, penguins have since been recovered after new pockets of oil surfaced later Tuesday, but added that they do not expect a need for a major recovery effort. Should the containers break apart, Poole noted, the metals' toxicity levels would likely be diluted by the surrounding sea water.
