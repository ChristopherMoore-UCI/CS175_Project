The cable also points out that he implied "the longer they remained in effect without any public explanation from the [United States government], the more it was likely to prompt the Saudi Government to re-evaluate areas of cooperation, including counter-terrorism cooperation." The government of Saudi Arabia expressed concerns about American security regulations that included Saudis in a list of nationalities that warranted additional screening at airports. The TSA updated its guidance in April, noting that travelers coming into the United States from abroad might notice enhanced screening and security measures, regardless of country of origin. The countries on the list include those officially designated as supporters of terrorism -- Cuba, Iran, Sudan and Syria -- as well as other countries of interest, including Afghanistan, Algeria, Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, Nigeria, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Somalia and Yemen. Transportation Security Administration regulations included the kingdom in a "limited group of countries for additional airport screening" adopted in the aftermath of the attempted airline bombing December 25, according to a cable published by WikiLeaks.
