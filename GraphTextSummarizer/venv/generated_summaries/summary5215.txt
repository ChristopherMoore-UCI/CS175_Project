The men, dressed in black clothes and black ski masks, split into two groups during the raid on the Grand Casino Basel, Chief Inspector Peter Gill told CNN. Swiss authorities are working closely with French authorities, Gill said. The robbers spoke French and drove vehicles with French license plates. The second group of armed robbers entered the upper level where the roulette and blackjack tables are located and robbed the cashier there, he said. CNN's Andreena Narayan contributed to this report.
