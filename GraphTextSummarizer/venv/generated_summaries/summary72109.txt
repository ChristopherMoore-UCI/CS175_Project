Karol Markowicz's (of the New York Post) opinion that "a mother isn't going to choose to feed her baby formula because she got a free lanyard or tote bag" notwithstanding, the fact is that corporations are, by definition, the opposite of charitable organizations; they vie for access to new moms in-hospital because, a) brand loyalty is not to be underestimated, and b) mothers assume hospitals have their patients' (i.e. the moms and babies they care for) best interests at heart. Prohibit the display and distribution of infant formula advertising or promotional materials in any hospital location What this means is:Nurses must document the dispensing of formula to new moms, citing a medical reason for its necessity. Bloomberg's initiative, along with the recent research pointing to the crucial role that hospitals play in breastfeeding success, will hopefully motivate hospitals to equip themselves with adequate nursing staffs in order to really attend to helping new moms get their bearings -- around breastfeeding, and otherwise. Getting swept up in demonizing him, or in any uproar around this new policy, distracts from what the initiative really means for new moms (more support) and for hospitals (step it up).It's going to be okay! By providing education and support around breastfeeding, and removing formula manufacturers from the picture, hospitals are actually operating with increased professional integrity; they are actually providing the best possible care to patients.
