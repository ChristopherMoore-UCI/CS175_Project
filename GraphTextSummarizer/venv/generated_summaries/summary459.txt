After a day-long massive manhunt for one Boston Marathon bombing suspect that terrorized several cities and riveted a nation, the shouting and applause on the streets of Watertown, Massachusetts, was a welcome sign of victory. "There's always this thing in the back of my head that wonders if all this is a little premature," said Sara Pradziak, 21, who looked on as mostly college-age revelers filled Hemingway Street in downtown Boston. Boston police quickly worked to disperse the expanding group. Residents, once holed up in houses and apartment buildings across the Boston area, poured out onto downtown streets. And yet, several officers smiled as the crowd greeted their slow-moving motorcycle line with enthusiastic cheers and applause.
