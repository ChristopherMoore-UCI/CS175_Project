A court in Jakarta cleared Muchdi Purwopranojo of murder charges in the September 2004 death of Munir Said Thalib, a lawyer heavily involved in human rights work. Muchdi Purwopranojo was accused of plotting the murder of lawyer Munir Said Thalib. Munir's supporters say he was the victim of a conspiracy by Indonesia's national intelligence agency, the BIN. Two other people have been charged and convicted in Munir's death -- a pilot for the national airline Garuda Indonesia who was directly linked to the poisoning, and a former Garuda official who authorized him to be on the same flight. Munir died after being poisoned while on a flight to the Netherlands.
