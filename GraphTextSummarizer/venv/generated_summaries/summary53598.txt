For too long, Congress has been mulling over a Horse Slaughter Prohibition bill (H.R. 503) that would "prohibit the shipping, transporting, moving, delivering, receiving, possessing, purchasing, selling, or donation of horses and other equines to be slaughtered for human consumption, and for other purposes." According to the Humane Society of the United States (HSUS), tens of thousands of live horses are transported every year across the border to slaughterhouses in Mexico and Canada. Ever since, horse slaughter proponents have aggressively campaigned to reopen such plants, despite public revulsion. Horse lovers won a huge victory when America's foreign-owned horse slaughterhouses were shut down several years ago. Many thousands of thoroughbreds end up being slaughtered for horse meat.
