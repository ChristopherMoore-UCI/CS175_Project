"This is the beginning of consumer virtual reality," said Brendan Iribe, CEO of Oculus VR, referring to the company's latest prototype, called "Crescent Bay." We need a new set of experiences that touch on the emotional side, but not too much." Interestingly, Iribe wants the Oculus Rift to be a beautiful object; even though the user does not see it, other people do, he says: "The more beautiful the product is, the more likely you are to buy it. "Imagine a pair of virtual reality sunglasses in the future, and everybody in the world is inside," said Iribe. Faster, lighter and equipped with headphones, the prototype offers the best performance to date, says Iribe, and a convincing peek into the world of virtual reality. Virtual reality (VR) is a serious business, as confirmed by Facebook's acquisition of Oculus VR for $2 billion earlier this year.
