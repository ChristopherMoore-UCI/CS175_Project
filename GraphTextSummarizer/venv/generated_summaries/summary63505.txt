The administration initially proposed to give the authority only to the attorney general, but agreed to add the director of national intelligence after Democrats objected to putting more power into the hands of embattled Attorney General Alberto Gonzales. -- President Bush signed a controversial bill Sunday that temporarily revises federal electronic surveillance laws. Bush sought changes to FISA after a classified ruling by a court set up under the law to hear wiretap requests. But Democrats and the American Civil Liberties Union objected to provisions in the GOP-backed bill that grant the attorney general and the director of national intelligence the authority to approve all wiretaps -- even if one party is in the United States -- with minimal court oversight. The measure updates the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which governs electronic surveillance in intelligence cases.
