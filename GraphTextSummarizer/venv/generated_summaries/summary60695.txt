Witnesses paint violent blow-by-blow picture of FAMU hazing Band members say FAMU drum major gave in to hazing Florida A&M president keeps band on suspension CNN's Adam Reiss contributed to this report. Since then, Julian White has retired as band director, the Florida A&M board of trustees issued a vote of no confidence against Ammons and the marching band has been suspended through the 2012-2013 school year. FAMU said it took steps to eradicate the problem of hazing after Champion's death, and the board of trustees approved an anti-hazing plan that includes an independent panel of experts to investigate hazing allegations. Recommendations for suspension preceded FAMU band death Last month, the school's trustees supported by 8-4 a no-confidence vote over Ammons' performance. "After considerable thought, introspection and conversations with my family, I have decided to resign from my position as president in order to initiate my retirement on October 11, 2012," James H. Ammons wrote in a letter to the chairman of the school's board of trustees, Solomon Badger III.
