"What we're hoping to see as the financial crisis begins to improve is to see members of NATO collaborate more in developing military capabilities, to get more bang for the euro, more bang for the buck," said Alexander Vershbow. The key, he and other NATO officials said, was to make warships "multi-mission" vessels. A team of Spanish special forces troops rappelled down a rope of off a hovering helicopter onto the deck of a ship simulating the rescue of hijacked merchant vessel. "The situation in Syria has not generated the same kind of consensus that we saw in Libya two years ago in favor of international intervention," said deputy secretary general Vershbow. NATO forces have spent the last decade fighting Taliban militants in the arid mountains and deserts of Afghanistan.
