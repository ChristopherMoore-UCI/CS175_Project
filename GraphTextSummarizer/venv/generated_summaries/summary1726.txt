-- One hundred and fifty new full-body scanning machines are set to be placed in airports across the United States as federal authorities work to close security loopholes exposed by the attempted Christmas Day bombing of a U.S.-bound airliner. One former TSA official told CNN that a body scanner could have stopped Umar Farouq AbdulMutallab, the man accused of trying to blow up a December 25 Northwest Airlines flight from Amsterdam, Netherlands, to Detroit, Michigan. It may not have detected it as an explosive, but it certainly would've raised some flags that would have required further detection and a review either by an officer or further scanning." Critics, however, warn that full-body scanners should not be the only answer to continued airport security problems. "Right now the system is not working as effectively as it needs to be," said Geoff Freeman, a representative of the U.S. Travel Association. TSA officials have attempted to address privacy concerns by promising to blur pictures of passengers' faces and delete all images produced.
