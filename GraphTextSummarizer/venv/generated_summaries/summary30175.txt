In its medical examiners guide, the FAA says pilots being treated with four specific antidepressants may receive medical clearance, which would be decided on a case-by-case basis. Unlike pilots, flight attendants are not required to pass medical examinations before they fly, according to the Association of Flight Attendants, a union that does not represent American Airlines workers. "However, flight attendants do have to go through recurrent training each year to refresh their emergency situation skills," said AFA spokeswoman Corey Caldwell. JetBlue follows all FAA pilot requirements, the airline said. All airline pilots are required by the Federal Aviation Administration to have a first-class medical certificate that must be renewed annually for pilots younger than 40 and every six months for pilots 40 and older.
