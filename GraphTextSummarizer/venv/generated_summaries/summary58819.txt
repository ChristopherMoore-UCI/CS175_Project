"This is not a negative thing," Carter publicist Steve Honig told CNN. He acted in more than 400 performances in the off-Broadway cast of "The Fantasticks" last year. He had just $60 cash in his wallet and $917 in his checking account when he signed the petition last month. Carter's expenses are just $2,000 a month since he's living with a relative in Port Richey, Florida, when he's not on the road, it said. "The bulk of the debt is from over 10 years ago when he was a minor and not in control of his finances," Honig said.
