There are other Ebola vaccines being tested by companies in the United States and in Russia. The leading vaccines for Ebola will soon be tested in healthy volunteers in Africa, according to the World Health Organization. At a press conference Friday, Marie-Paule Kieny, who leads the WHO Ebola vaccine work, suggested there has been real promise offered from initial tests of two of the vaccines being studied. Trials of the vaccines in Africa should start soon. No similar side effects were noted in the other vaccine trial.
