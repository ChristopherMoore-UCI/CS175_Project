"Inflation is a very important factor in India, in fact the fortunes of governments depend on the course of inflation particularly food items, so it is predictable that the RBI will take this course," Roy said "but to be honest inflation in India has proven to be insensitive to interest rate hikes. In an attempt to curb runaway inflation, India's central bank raised its benchmark interest rates for the tenth time in sixteen months on Thursday, despite a slowdown in economic growth. Inflation is going up and interest rates are going up." The Reserve Bank of India said in a statement that inflation had reached "uncomfortable levels" and increased the repo rate at which it lends to commercial banks by 25 basis points to 7.5 percent. Analysts say the government's priority is to tame inflation even if its at the expense of economic growth.
