Coming so soon after the closure of the News of the World -- in apparent contrition for its despicable and illegal snooping, but in fact because advertisers had withdrawn their support -- the publication of the new Sunday rag has been widely perceived as an act of breathtaking cynicism. Nonetheless, it still came as a surprise when James resigned from his position Wednesday, congratulating himself on the successful launch of the new Sun on Sunday last weekend. Judging by his evidence to the parliamentary inquiry into the "industrial-scale" hacking of innocent parties' phones by the News of the World and The Sun -- over which he presided, as executive chairman of their publisher, News International -- he appears to have suffered so bad a case of amnesia that it's a miracle he even remembered his own name. "They can feel sympathy for the parents of Milly Dowler [the murdered schoolgirl whose phone was hacked by News of the World investigators], as they can for Charlotte Church [the celebrity singer and another phone hacking victim]. Even the News of the World's ex-lawyer has pointed the finger at him, and it can only be a matter of time until hard proof of his complicity in either the hacking or its coverup becomes apparent.
