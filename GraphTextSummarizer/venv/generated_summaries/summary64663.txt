In fact, the findings showed that people in groups were rated 5.5% more attractive than when viewed on their own. Apparently, it's all about social averaging within a group, where, somehow, the appearance of those who are ugly improves and the appearance of those who are beautiful declines into some sort of perfect middle ground. The results, recently published in the journal Psychological Science, reveal that a good way to boost your overall attractiveness when out in public is to simply surround yourself with other people. Walker explains in the study that, "Average faces are more attractive, likely due to the averaging out of unattractive idiosyncrasies. Perhaps it's like Tolstoy's families: Beautiful people are all alike, but every unattractive person is unattractive in their own way."
