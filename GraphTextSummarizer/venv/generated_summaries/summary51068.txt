Putin and company have made clear for years that they do not intend to leave the scene quietly in 2012 when Medvedev's presidential term expires. It will provoke a temporary burst of indignation from Putin's many critics in the West, some of whom saw in Medvedev a champion of liberalism and civil rights. Despite rumors of disagreements between the two leaders -- or, more often, their aides -- Putin and Medvedev have always worked together as a close-knit team. Seventy-three percent see Medvedev as having continued Putin's policies rather than introducing new ones of his own. Although Putin's -- and Medvedev's -- approval ratings have fallen in the last two years, the decline has been relatively slow.
