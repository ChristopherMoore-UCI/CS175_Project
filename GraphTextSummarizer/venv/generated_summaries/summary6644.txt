Parents Mayumi and Richard Heene discuss the upheaval in their lives Friday on CNN's "American Morning." "We feel it's incumbent on us as an agency to attempt to re-interview them and establish whether this is in fact a hoax or actual event," Larimer County Sheriff James Alderden said at a news conference Friday. Alderden told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Friday that, based on reports that the parents "took these children into potentially dangerous situations" with tornado chases, the experimental balloons and other activities, it would be "appropriate to involve child protection [services] to at least see what the family situation is and whether the children are in a safe condition." Earlier, Alderden told reporters that his department has contacted the child protection officials but asked them not to contact the family until investigators have had a chance to re-interview them. "I'm feeling very, very grateful that Falcon is among us," Richard Heene told CNN's "American Morning" on Friday. Falcon was not in a box as Alderden had originally reported. " On CNN's "Larry King Live" Thursday night, the Heene parents asked Falcon why he had not come out from hiding when they were calling for him.
