"We used songs as a medium of getting out the information to a wide segment of the population, through the best medium available in Liberia -- radio." The center has gone on to release many more songs but Krenn said it used entertainment within a wider communications strategy. "For our traditional people, when somebody die, don't touch the body with your bare hand -- you can call a health worker closer to you to help you to bury the body but wearing protective clothes and gloves," the song continues, saying the message is from Liberia's Ministry of Health and partners. The style of music is a popular form in Liberia known as Hipco and the song has been very successful, playing on radios across the country, Boulierac said. CCP was also involved in Liberia, Krenn said, trying to monitor and help coordinate the communication interventions there.
