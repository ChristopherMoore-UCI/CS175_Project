The world No. 1 was delighted with his performance as he bids to erase the memory of an agonizing five-set defeat to Andy Murray in last year's final. In the men's draw, top seed Novak Djokovic made light work of his fourth round meeting with Spaniard Marcel Granollers. Earlier in the day second seed Victoria Azarenka, beaten by Williams in the 2012 final, won her delayed fourth round match against former world No. 1 Ana Ivanovic. Serena Williams underlined her status as the overwhelming favorite for the women's U.S. Open title with a crushing "double bagel" win over Carla Suarez Navarro in the quarterfinals of the New York grand slam. Defending champion and second seed Murray survived a scare to set up a last eight match with Swiss No. 9 Stanislas Wawrinka.
