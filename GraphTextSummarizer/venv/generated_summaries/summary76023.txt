With temperatures predicted to soar above 100 degrees Fahrenheit on Tuesday, last year's semifinalist Ferrer was glad to have secured a second round meeting with Frenchman Adrian Mannarino. "We speak half English, half German," Djokovic, who has won 22 consecutive matches in Melbourne, told reporters. A winner of the Melbourne grand slam in four of the last six years, top seed Djokovic extended his current winning run to 25 matches with a 6-3 7-6 (7-2) 6-1 defeat of Slovakia's Lukas Lacko. World No. 8 Stanislas Wawrinka benefited from the withdrawal of Kazakhstan's Andrey Golubev. Third seed David Ferrer took advantage of Monday's kinder conditions to dispatch Colombia's Alejandro Gonzalez 6-3 6-4 6-4.
