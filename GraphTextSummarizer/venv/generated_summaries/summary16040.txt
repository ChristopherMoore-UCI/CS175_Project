Porn producers say performers are protected on the job because they have the option of using condoms if they want to. many porn producers and performers are still fighting against mandatory condom use. Council votes for condom mandate in adult films "We support choice for performers, as well as the successful testing system that has been in place since 1998, which have resulted in no on-set transmission of HIV in nine years, nationwide," Diane Duke, the coalition's CEO says on the group's website. In November, Los Angeles County passed an ordinance requiring condom use on porn sets, but industry insiders say the rule is not well enforced and often ignored. He says one solution might be to use a condom that's not made of latex, since some people find those irritating and abrasive, but non-latex condoms are often not available in the larger sizes male performers need.
