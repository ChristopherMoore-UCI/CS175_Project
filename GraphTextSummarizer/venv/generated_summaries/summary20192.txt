Heavy rains were expected over much of the Ohio River Valley and mid-Mississippi River Valley on Sunday, leading to flooding next week of low-lying farmland along the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers and residential areas located along rivers, creeks and streams. Late Friday, the National Weather Service was reporting that heavy rain was possible from the Lower Mississippi Valley to northern New England. Up to 5 inches of rain was expected across a broad area from northeast Texas to eastern New York. An almost stationary front that extended from the Southern High Plains to New England was expected to drop sometimes heavy rains by Sunday over parts of that swath. On Sunday, delays are possible in many key air travel hubs and larger markets, including Chicago, Milwaukee, Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Washington, Charlotte and Atlanta, Morris predicted.
