Garban's resignation follows last week's release of an internal review conducted by former FBI director Louis Freeh that found Penn State's most powerful leader showed "total and consistent disregard" for child sex abuse victims and covered up attacks by former assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky. Two former university administrators are awaiting trial for their role in the scandal, and more charges are possible as the state's Attorney General's Office investigates what Penn State may have known about Sandusky's behavior. Following the release of the report, you also asked each member of the Board to evaluate our individual paths forward," Garban wrote in his resignation letter to board chairwoman Karen Peetz. Freeh's report cast a wide net of blame, from the late famed football coach Joe Paterno to the university trustees, in the scandal. " Garban served as chairman of the Board of Trustees when the scandal broke and stepped down following Sandusky's arrest.
