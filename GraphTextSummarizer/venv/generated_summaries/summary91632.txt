-- A California educator arrested after a former student accused her in a YouTube video of sexual abuse had her arraignment pushed back yet again Friday, meaning she won't formally answer to the charges for another six weeks. Andrea Michelle Cardosa was charged in February with five counts of aggravated sexual assault on a child and 11 counts of lewd acts on a child, the the Riverside County district attorney's office said. Cardosa resigned January 17 from her most recent job as an administrator at Alhambra High School in Southern California after the first accusation was uploaded on YouTube, according to the school district. But Hall, the district attorney's office spokesman, said there is no statute of limitations in California on the most serious charge -- aggravated sexual assault on a child under 14. The charges that Cardosa faces came after a former student, now 28, posted a YouTube video in which she accused the educator of abusing her at age 12.
