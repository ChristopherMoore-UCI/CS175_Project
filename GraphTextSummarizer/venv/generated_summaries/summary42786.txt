He also pleaded guilty in December to 33 state charges related to residential burglaries, identity thefts, a firearm theft, a car theft, attempting to elude a police vehicle and other offenses, according to court documents. The 20-year-old gained notoriety -- including 50,000 Facebook fans and a movie deal -- while leading authorities on a two-year manhunt while eluding capture in stolen boats, cars and planes, often while barefoot, authorities said. -- A federal judge sentenced Colton Harris-Moore, whom authorities dubbed the Barefoot Bandit, to six-and-a-half years in prison on Friday for an infamous string of thefts and burglaries. Harris-Moore pleaded guilty last year to federal charges stealing an airplane, piloting it without a license, burglarizing a bank and possessing a firearm as a fugitive. Prosecutors recommended that Harris-Moore get 78 months in prison on the federal charges, according to court documents.
