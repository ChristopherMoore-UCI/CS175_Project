Data released on Wednesday showed economic growth for the quarter to the end of December slowed to an annualised 6.1 per cent, weighed on by two years of progressive monetary tightening, a retreat of foreign capital and a weakening local currency. They'll be lucky to have growth hit 6.5 per cent in 2012," said Glenn Levine, senior economist at Moody's Analytics. He said India was on course for 6.8 per cent growth in fiscal year 2013. Rajiv Kumar, the director-general of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry, said that an official target of 6.9 per cent growth for the full year was out of reach and a bounce back next year unlikely. The government, by contrast, has predicted a bounce back to 8.5 per cent next year.
