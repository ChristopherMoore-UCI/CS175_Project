I am 43, and I reside in Atlanta with my husband Peter Thomas and my 11-year-old daughter Noelle Robinson. The school offers classes on modeling, photography, makeup, hair styling, fashion styling and fashion designing. I knew I had arrived when Iman asked me to shoot a spread for Vanity Fair alongside supermodels Naomi Campbell, Tyra Banks and Beverly Johnson. This was the first time that I was photographed by famous photographer Annie Leibovitz. There is a lack of education available at affordable prices for young, aspiring, talented people who are interested in a career in fashion.
