The McStay family disappeared in February 2010, and Patrick McStay has been working tirelessly to figure out what happened to them. Merritt, 57, is charged with four counts of murder in the deaths of the McStay family. Earlier this year, Kaye interviewed Merritt, who was a close friend and business partner of Joseph McStay. Asked what he would like to ask Merritt now, Patrick McStay said he wouldn't ask anything. Dental records confirmed that those graves held the bodies of Joseph McStay, his wife Summer and their two young sons, Gianni and Joseph Jr. Just last week, authorities announced a major break in the case with the arrest of Charles "Chase" Merritt, the man they think is responsible for the deaths.
