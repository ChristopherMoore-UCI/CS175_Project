-- The mother of a college student who died of alcohol poisoning at Cornell University is suing Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity for $25 million in a lawsuit that alleges fraternity pledges bound her son's wrists and ankles and forced him to drink alcohol in a hazing ritual on the night of his death. The wrongful death lawsuit, which was filed by Marie Lourdes Andre in Brooklyn Supreme Court on Monday, alleges he was kidnapped by a group of Sigma Alpha Epsilon pledges and forced to drink alcohol and other substances while being quizzed about the fraternity. The lawsuit cites at least three other alcohol-related deaths of Sigma Alpha Epsilon members or pledges, including, most recently, the 2009 death of University of Kansas pledge Jason Wren. The parents of California Polytechnic State University student Carson Starkey, who died of alcohol poisoning as a Sigma Alpha Epsilon pledge in 2008, settled a similar lawsuit against the fraternity, said their lawyer, Douglas Fierberg. "We want to be clear that Cornell University neither condones nor tolerates hazing or the type of activities that we understand contributed to George's death."
