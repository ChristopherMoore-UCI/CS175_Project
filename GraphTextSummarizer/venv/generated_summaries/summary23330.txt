Aaron Sorkin has confirmed to Bloomberg that the "Dark Knight" actor has been cast in an upcoming biopic about the Apple co-founder. The film is reportedly based on the "Steve Jobs" biography by Walter Isaacson, which the late Jobs sanctioned. Bale -- best known for playing Bruce Wayne/Batman in the "Dark Knight" trilogy -- will next be seen in Ridley Scott's "Exodus: Gods and Kings." Christian Bale is going to give the role of Steve Jobs a go. Jobs died in 2011 following a long battle with pancreatic cancer.
