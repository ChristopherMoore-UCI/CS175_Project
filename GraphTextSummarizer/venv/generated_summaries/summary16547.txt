Nathan Slinkard's mother, Trena, lost custody of her three children following a divorce from husband Steven, and then she and the small children disappeared in October 1995, said Lt. Ted Munden of the Hancock County Sheriff's Department. " Nathan Slinkard has apparently been using English regularly in Mexico because "he speaks very good English as well as very good Spanish," Munden said. Nathan Slinkard and his father weren't available for comment and asked for privacy as the son now stays in his father's home in Greenfield, about a 25-mile drive east of downtown Indianapolis, Munden said. Nathan Slinkard also hugged his aunt, Munden said. "His mother and brother and sister were touchy subjects, and we didn't talk a lot about them," Munden said of his conversations with Nathan Slinkard.
