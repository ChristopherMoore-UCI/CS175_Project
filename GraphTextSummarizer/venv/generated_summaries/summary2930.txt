British officials "are close" to identifying the ISIS militant who beheaded American journalist James Foley, according to Britain's ambassador to the United States, Peter Westmacott. Mourners pack Foley's hometown church Meanwhile Sunday, hundreds of mourners crammed into Foley's hometown church in New Hampshire to attend his memorial Mass. "This moment in our lives is international in scope; crossing all boundaries, yet very personal," Bishop Peter A. Libasci said. The majority of the strikes have been in support of Iraqi forces near the dam, which briefly fell under ISIS control. In the letter, Foley reflects on favorite family memories -- a trip to the mall with his father, a bike ride with his mom -- and gives details of his time in captivity. The following month, over the July 4 weekend, U.S. special operations units were sent into Syria to rescue Foley and other hostages held by Islamist militants, a U.S. official told CNN.
