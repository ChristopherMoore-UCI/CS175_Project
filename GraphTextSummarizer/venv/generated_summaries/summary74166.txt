But Defense Department officials are well aware that Hagel is pressuring to bring everyone back to work next week. If all are returned to work, it would represent about half the number of government civilian and contract employees at risk of furloughs during the government shutdown that began on Tuesday. Language in the law said civilian personnel and contractors will be paid if the secretary of defense "determines" they are providing "support" for the troops and several members of Congress have said that gives Hagel broad authority. It's expected the Defense Department will issue a broad statement from Hagel saying he is authorizing employees back to work followed by detailed memos about the recall would work. But Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel made his view clear while traveling in Japan.
