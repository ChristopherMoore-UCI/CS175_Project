In 2012, Michael estimates Sunshine Daydream earned 25% more than the couple pulled in during their best years working other jobs. In the months leading up to Thanksgiving 2010, Heather branched out into holiday products by offering sets of eight Christmas stockings personalized in Sunshine Daydream's signature style of bright colors, fun font and personalized embroidering, at $10 a stocking on Etsy. She set up the Etsy store and continued looking for other jobs. They are makers of customized holiday stockings, party hats and baby bibs, and their profits come in large waves at Thanksgiving, Easter and Christmas. -- Heather and Michael von Quilich are still adjusting to life without a regular payday.
