A fugitive task force from the FBI joined by local police arrested Exum Speight, 50, in Los Angeles suburb of San Fernando, authorities said. He has been charged in a warrant with one count of murder in the March 29, 1987, death of boxing manager Douglas Stumler, Los Angeles police said. Los Angeles' cold case detectives developed a break in the case after they screened potential forensic leads under a grant from National Institute of Justice's "Solving Cold Cases with DNA" program, authorities said. Stumler was killed in his apartment in the west Los Angeles area and was discovered by a friend who checked on him after Stumler failed to report to his full-time job at the Los Angeles County Housing Authority, police said. A former boxer was arrested Wednesday in the 1987 murder of his manager after investigators developed a break in the case by using DNA evidence, Los Angeles police said.
