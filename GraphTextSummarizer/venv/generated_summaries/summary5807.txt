The U.S. troops have been serving in a mostly advisory role to forces from Uganda, South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic in dismantling the Lord's Resistance Army and hunting Kony. The group has sought to overthrow the Ugandan government and has contributed to instability across the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and South Sudan. For two decades, the group has terrorized central Africa through the abduction of children to serve as soldiers in a campaign of rape, pillage and murder. The Lord's Resistance Army, formed in the late 1980s, is a sectarian military and religious group that operates in northern Uganda and South Sudan. It has benefited from the military experience of former Ugandan military officers and years of combat in Sudan.
