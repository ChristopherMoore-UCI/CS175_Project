It's a partnership between a group called 21st Century Leaders and the staff of CNN and CNN Student News; and what it does is bring about 75 of Georgia's brightest high school students to the Georgia Tech campus, where they spend a week learning about everything from journalism to, of course, leadership skills. Students got to listen to a dinner panel of CNN talent and executives, and they heard a few things about work and life. That project was to pitch a story to a panel of CNN executives, so a little bit intimidating there.
