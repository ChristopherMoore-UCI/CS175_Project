Hunt was speaking with the police officers and was calm and nonconfrontational, according to Utah County Attorney Jeff Buhman. The suit contends that Hunt was shot while he was fleeing, that police used excessive force and that the officers' actions "manifested malicious, reckless, and callous indifference to the rights and very life of Darrien Hunt. "Preliminary evidence suggests that Mr. Hunt brandished the sword and lunged toward the officers with the sword, at which time Mr. Hunt was shot," Taylor said. Prosecutors said that Hunt "lunged" at two officers, Cpl. Matt Schauerhamer and Officer Nicholas Judson and their actions were reasonable. In November, Buhman called the use of deadly force "reasonable" and said that no criminal prosecution would be brought against the officers.
