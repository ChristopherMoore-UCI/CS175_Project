Haim said he wanted California legislators to pass "Corey's law," which he said should prevent doctors from prescribing more than a three-day supply of addictive drugs at one time, his manager said. State investigators know that Haim obtained "massive amounts" of legal drugs "in what looks to me like a questionable manner because of so many doctors," Brown said. Brown said Haim got prescriptions from four or five different doctors in the past three months. The person arrested was not directly connected to Haim but is suspected to be part of the drug ring, Brown spokeswoman Christine Gasparac said. Several prescription drug bottles were taken from Haim's apartment, Deputy Coroner Winter said Friday.
