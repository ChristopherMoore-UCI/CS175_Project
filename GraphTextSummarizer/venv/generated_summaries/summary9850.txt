And is any of this discernible in the dark future offered by Hamas to Arab children, to be suicide bombers or human shields for rockets? That is why we have produced this advertising campaign with Elie Wiesel, to stop the terrorist cowards of Hamas from hiding behind innocent children and pregnant women. " "We all lament the loss of Palestinian life brought about by the murderous Hamas regime," founder Rabbi Shmuley Boteach said, according to the organization's website. The ad campaign appears in some U.S. papers in Chicago, Los Angeles, Miami, New York and Washington, according to This World: The Values Network, a group that says it is committed to "bringing Jewish values to mainstream American culture as a way of healing and strengthening families, diverting society's focus from material greed and inspiring children to emulate caring, compassionate relationships. " Hamas' political leader Khaled Meshaal, who lives in Qatar, presented a very different view of the conflict in an interview with CNN -- and denied that Hamas uses human shields.
