" White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel dismissed Hayden's assertion that releasing the memos had undermined U.S. intelligence efforts by giving al Qaeda critical new information. Hayden said the administration's decision to release the Bush administration memos will make CIA officials less willing to engage in interrogation tactics now sanctioned by the federal government. Michael Hayden, who served as former President Bush's last CIA director from 2006 to 2009, said releasing the memos outlining terror interrogation methods emboldened terrorist groups such as al Qaeda. Former CIA chief Michael Hayden said Sunday it is wrong to make interrogation methods public. McCaskill told "Fox News Sunday" that the United States will be better off in the long run by clearly prohibiting interrogation techniques such as waterboarding.
