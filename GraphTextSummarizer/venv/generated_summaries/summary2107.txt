Woods had another solid day Friday, moving to a tie for the lead with Jim Furyk and David Toms. He had some good shots both Thursday and Friday but was plagued by stretches of bogeys and double bogeys and ended 17 over. -- Some of golf's biggest names failed Friday to make the cut at the U.S. Open, victims of the Olympic Club's unforgiving roughs and slick greens. He carded 75 to be 9 over along with Watson and 20 other players including major winners Lucas Glover, Y.E. Yang and Louis Oosthuizen. Furyk, winner of the 2003 U.S. Open, said he will be ready for the weekend.
