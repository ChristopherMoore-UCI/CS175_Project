Michigan schools were recently affected, with 117 schools still closed in the state, down from more than 240 last week, according to James McCurtis of the Michigan Department of Community Health. The first daughters have gotten it along with other children, and more residents around the nation may soon be able to get the H1N1 flu vaccine as health officials say more is on its way. The CDC had hoped that about 40 million doses of H1N1 -- also know as swine flu -- vaccine would be available by the end of October. According to a statement posted on the White House Web site by Catherine McCormick-Lelyveld, press secretary for first lady Michelle Obama, daughters Sasha and Malia received their H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccines last week. Sens. Joe Lieberman, I-Connecticut, and Susan Collins, R-Maine, expressed "strong concerns" about the distribution of the H1N1 vaccine in a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius.
