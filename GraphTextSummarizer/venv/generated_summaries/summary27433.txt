There are no easy answers to the problem of thousands of desperate children, many unaccompanied minors, fleeing chaos, violence and governmental collapse in Central America. Yet seeing some of my fellow Americans jeering busloads of frightened children and hearing commentators dismiss these children as someone else's problem has left me wondering exactly what kind of country we have turned into, and how quickly we forget our own history. If that is a contradiction, it is the kind of contradiction that animates many American lives. Chaim became a kind of unlikely Jewish mascot of a local gang of non-Jewish teens. I wonder how many people screaming at frightened children in Murrieta, California, have an ancestor with a similar story.
