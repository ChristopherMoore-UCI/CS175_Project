Indeed Russia said that in Sunday's referendum 97% of its participants, mostly ethnic Russians, insisted that to belong to the Great Russia versus Small Russia (Malorossiya, another name for Ukraine) had been their dream for 60 years since the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, my great-grandfather, transferred the peninsula's jurisdiction to Kiev. Putin is not Stalin, of course, not yet, but he sees himself walking in the dictator's shoes: he adds lands to the great Russia, while other sorry leaders like Khrushchev only squandered it away. No stranger to propaganda -- Communism excelled in arguing Soviet superiority over ethnic national pride, Ukrainian or any other, as well as over decadent and dying capitalism -- Khrushchev still would have cringed at Putin's distortions. In his address to Parliament on March 18 announcing the annexation, Putin said that by this Khrushchev action Russia was not "simply robbed, it was plundered." In fact the Crimeans' desire to join Russia is partially based on their trust that Putin will turn them into another Sochi, with posh hotels and pristine beaches.
