The new policy was one of several requested by student journalists and outlined by Red & Black newspaper board members in a meeting Friday with students in Athens, Georgia, said Polina Marinova, who was the paper's top editor until earlier this week. In the memo, board member Ed Stamper detailed responsibilities for the "Editorial Director and the entire professional staff" such as "taking corrective action to replace students that do not follow our standards," setting design mandates and suggesting what types of stories staff should cover, including "more good" and less "bad" news stories that highlight wrongdoing. The Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communication, a division of the university that many of the paper's student staff attend, lauded the board for having "reconfirmed the editorial authority of student journalists" and lamented the "current crisis of leadership at the paper and its effect on students. "We stood up for ourselves, and I think other people saw that." Marinova and Julia Carpenter quit as editor-in-chief and managing editor, respectively, of the Red & Black on Wednesday, with fellow editors, design staff, photo staff and reporters joining them leaving the newspaper's building en masse. The Red & Black is one of a handful of student newspapers nationwide that is independent financially and editorially from its university, said Frank LoMonte, the executive director of the Student Law Press Center, which works with high school and college journalists around the United States.
