Standing in front of his barn, Haggard and his family announced Wednesday that they are starting a church in Colorado Springs, Colorado, called Saint James. In a statement, New Life Church said it "will always be grateful for the many years of dedicated leadership from Ted and Gayle Haggard and we wish their family only the best." -- Ted Haggard, the former megachurch pastor and former National Association of Evangelicals chief whose career was undone by a gay prostitution and drugs scandal in 2006, plans to start a new church. Those statements led the Board of Overseers at New Life Church to fire Haggard as senior pastor. "I was not willing to let the scandal be the last chapter in our lives," Gayle Haggard told reporters.
