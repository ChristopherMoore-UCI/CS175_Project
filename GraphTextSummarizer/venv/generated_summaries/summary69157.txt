Michigan Democrat Carl Levin, who is also not seeking re-election next year, will have 36 years of Senate service to his name when his successor takes office in early 2015. the recent string of Senate retirements has the political class debating whether Republicans have a real shot at taking control of the upper chamber. Democratic Senate aides say a positive outcome of the Senate's changing face is that Americans may now find them more relatable. In recent years, the Senate has lost Edward Kennedy, Robert Byrd, Daniel Inouye and Craig Thomas to death in office. Leadership aides close to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell say that he and some of his staff believe there's more energy in the upper chamber now and more of a willingness to fight for causes.
