In her letters, Jackie Kennedy -- who died in 1994 -- wrote of her feelings of love, her concerns about the flirtatious nature of her husband, President John F. Kennedy, and later, her struggle with faith after Kennedy's assassination in November 1963. The college did not say why it decided to withdraw the letters from auction, according to the Catholic News Service report, but it said it's working with the Kennedy family to determine their fate. The trove of letters to the Rev. Joseph Leonard from a young Jacqueline Bouvier and later a married Jackie Kennedy offers a rare and revealing glimpse of the private thoughts of one of America's most admired first ladies. "Representatives of All Hallows College and the Vincentian Fathers are now exploring with members of Mrs. Kennedy's family how best to preserve and curate this archive for the future," All Hallows College said in a statement provided to the news service. A 1952 letter, written the year before the couple wed, showed her understanding of Kennedy's philandering ways, which continued in the White House.
