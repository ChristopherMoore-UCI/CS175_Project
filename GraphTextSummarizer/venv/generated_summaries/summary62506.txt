Survey indicates troubling trend in military sexual assaults Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Mark Welsh told Congress on Tuesday that Krusinski is a personnel officer by training and had spent the previous 2.5 years working on Air Force staff in policy. Arlington County declined an Air Force request that it allow Krusinski to be prosecuted under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. After taking the position with the sexual assault prevention unit in February, he underwent training aimed at preparing him for his duties, Air Force spokesman Lt. Col. John Dorrian said. -- An Air Force officer who had been in charge of a military unit aimed at preventing sexual assaults made an initial court appearance Thursday on a sexual battery charge but did not enter a plea. Lt. Col. Jeffrey Krusinski, a 1994 graduate of the Air Force Academy who served tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, was arrested Sunday for allegedly grabbing a woman's buttocks and breasts in a parking lot in Arlington County near the Pentagon.
