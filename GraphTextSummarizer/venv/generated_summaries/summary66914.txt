Young is considered the government's star witness against Edwards, a former Democratic senator and presidential candidate from North Carolina who is accused of using hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations to conceal his affair with a campaign videographer without reporting the money to federal authorities. During Friday's testimony, Young recalled a drive he took with Edwards in North Carolina in 2008. He testified that he wrote the book for two reasons: "It had been almost three years since Mr. Edwards promised me he would tell the truth, (and) we also very much needed the money." Edwards had learned that Young had received donations without his knowledge. For example, Young has described a time when Edwards returned home from a trip overseas with a phone purportedly given to him by his mistress, Rielle Hunter.
