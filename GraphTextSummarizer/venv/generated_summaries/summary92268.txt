On the individual side, he would increase taxes on the very wealthiest Americans to pay for tax cuts for lower- and middle-income Americans, including limiting tax benefits of itemized deductions for the best-off Americans, scaling back gigantic tax breaks for capital gains and large estates, and ensuring that hedge-fund managers pay their fair share. President Obama's new budget includes a mixed bag of tax reforms, including progressive proposals to create a fairer income tax, as well as misguided corporate giveaways. In the wake of a titanic debate last year over what should happen to the corporate tax rate, Obama's budget is equally notable for failing to include a comprehensive proposal to eliminate tax giveaways. But on the corporate side, the president's plans actually have a chance of being taken seriously by congressional Republicans â€” possibly because his ideas are more in line with the ideological push for lower corporate tax rates. The goal of corporate tax reform should be raising more revenue, not the same amount.
