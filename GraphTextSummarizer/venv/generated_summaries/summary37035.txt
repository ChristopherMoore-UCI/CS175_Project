Since Obama unexpectedly asked Congress in August to authorize military action in Syria, polls have found that Americans are opposed to such action. Pryor issued a statement Saturday saying Obama and his national security team had not yet made an effective case for taking action against al-Assad's regime and laying out the criteria that had to be met in order for him to support military action in Syria. As President Barack Obama channels his inner salesman to pitch military action in Syria, he shouldn't be surprised when he finds a number of congressional doors already closed. There are currently 148 House members prepared to vote against Obama's call for military action -- with 30 Democrats joining 118 Republicans in their opposition. In order to win passage of the authorization, Obama will have to persuade 270 members to vote "yes" -- a heavy lift, considering there are currently only 25 members who say they plan to vote "yes" on military action, 17 Democrats and eight Republicans.
