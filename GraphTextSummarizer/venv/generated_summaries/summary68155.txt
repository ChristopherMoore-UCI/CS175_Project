She and her sister, who is also adopted from China, attended a Saturday school to learn Chinese language and culture while other children were playing soccer or baseball. "I know that those things will always be a part of me whether I live in China or in America." Today, Stack is a board member of China's Children International -- an organization founded by high school girls to bring together Chinese adoptees around the world. As she grew older, June enjoyed attending Chinese cultural events so much that, at the age of five, she asked her parents if she could visit China. Stack is one of tens of thousands of children -- 95% percent of whom are girls -- who have been adopted from China since its government ratified international adoption in 1992. Amy Cubbage and her husband, Graham Troop, adopted their daughter June from China when she was two years old.
