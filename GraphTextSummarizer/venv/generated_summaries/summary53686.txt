" Suzanne Kolb, the president of E!, praised Handler for adding "a distinct voice to late night with her acerbic wit and fearless commentary." While E! develops a possible new late-night show, it will run "E! News" at 11 p. m. -- Chelsea Handler's late-night television show on E!, "Chelsea Lately," will come to a close in August, freeing the comedian to create a different show elsewhere.

The "Chelsea Lately" finale date, August 26, was announced by the cable channel on Wednesday, capping months of speculation about Handler and E!'s plans to split.
