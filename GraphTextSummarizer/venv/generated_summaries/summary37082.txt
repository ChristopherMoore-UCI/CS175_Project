Most of these had minor damage, in the form of broken glass, torn-off siding or garage door damage, that didn't make their homes uninhabitable. Inspectors know for sure that five cannot, as they are "either gone or will require a demolition." Riggs said he expects authorities will discover more damage, and residents will have to deal with more headaches and heartache in the coming weeks. Two adults were killed, while seven others went to area hospitals, due to the explosion and related fires, said Deputy Chief Kenny Bacon of the Indianapolis Fire Department. Aerial video showed the significant material cost as well, with only the foundations remaining of some homes, others left charred, and dozens more homes like the Wagners' suffering damage of all different sorts. "It was a massive explosion," said Troy Riggs, the city's director of public safety.
