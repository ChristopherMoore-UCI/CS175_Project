As head of the New York chapter of the Organization of Chinese Americans, Gong also organized a SARS (Support Asian RestaurantS) rally in Chinatown, encouraging people to eat at their favorite Chinatown restaurants. Gong had first conceived of bringing comedy to Chinatown during a plane ride months earlier to see his ailing grandmother in Hong Kong. No confirmed cases of SARS were found in New York City, but for Chinatown it was a "double whammy," said Gong, who had served as a tour guide in Chinatown in addition to his job in retail. With friends, Gong started "TakeOut Comedy," a series of shows intended to revitalize nightlife in Chinatown. Heading for Hong Kong - and a new audience Gong left New York to launch Hong Kong's -- and what he says is also Asia's -- first full-time comedy club in 2007.
