FDA spokesperson Stephanie Yao said federal law and FDA regulations prevent the agency from disclosing information about products under development because it's considered confidential. "While the FDA cannot comment on the development of specific medical products," Yao said, "it's important to note that every FDA regulatory decision is based on a risk-benefit assessment of scientific data that includes the context of use for the product and the patient population being studied." In January, a small human trial of TKM-Ebola was put on hold after one volunteer developed moderate gastrointestinal side effects after receiving a high dose of the medication. The drug company said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has authorized expanded use of TKM-Ebola under its Investigational New Drug application rule. "We have worked with the FDA and Health Canada to establish this framework and a treatment protocol allowing us to do what we can to help these patients," Dr. Mark J. Murray, Tekmira's president and CEO, said in a statement.
