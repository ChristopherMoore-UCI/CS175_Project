If Gardner had been prosecuted to the full extent of the law then, he would have been behind bars when Chelsea went for a run on February 25. When Chelsea went running in a San Diego, California, park, it's doubtful she had any idea that another young female runner had been attacked in that very same park just a couple of months before. Chelsea King, 17, was a straight-A student, a high school track star and she loved to volunteer. Police said DNA on Chelsea's underwear led them to 30-year-old John Gardner III. If there had been a sketch of this suspect, or a warning posted, Chelsea might not have gone running alone there.
