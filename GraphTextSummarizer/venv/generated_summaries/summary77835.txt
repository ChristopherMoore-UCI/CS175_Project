Drawing another historical comparison, Lee said he recalled when Kim's father,  Kim Il Sung, died in 1994. When the tearful broadcaster broke the news to North Koreans that their leader, Kim Jong Il, had died, the audience in the hall gasped. North Koreans interviewed on state television thanked Kim for everything, including trains, theaters and even their warm homes. Atran compared the reaction to Kim's death to Spanish dictator Francisco Franco's passing in 1975. The public mourning illustrates the grip of Kim's power, said Scott Atran, director of research and anthropology at the French National Center for Scientific Research and psychology professor at the University of Michigan.
