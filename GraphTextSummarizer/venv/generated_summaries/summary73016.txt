This action follows the draconian voter suppression law -- supporters call it voter protection -- that was passed by the Florida legislature, which was so ridiculous and punitive that the nonpartisan League of Women Voters and Rock the Vote! chose not to register voters out of fear of amassing substantial fines. But because of Florida's voter purge plan, he got a letter saying he had 30 days to prove he was an American or he would be stricken from the voter rolls. Now there is nothing wrong with any state ensuring that those who are eligible to vote are American citizens. In Miami-Dade County, officials sent 1,500 letters to voters saying they were potentially noncitizens, and nearly one-third of them provided proof that they were indeed Americans. T. Christian Herren, chief lawyer in the DOJ's voting rights division, wrote a two-page letter to Florida officials asking why they chose to make this move without consulting the feds, an apparent violation of the Voting Rights Act.
