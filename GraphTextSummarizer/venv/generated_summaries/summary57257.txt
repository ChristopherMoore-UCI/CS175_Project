In the heat of battle, it's best to have your key allies closest to you and European Ryder Cup captain Paul McGinley has certainly done that by naming two close friends as his vice-captains. "It's quite clear a lot of potential further vice captains could more than likely qualify for the team," said McGinley. His decision was eased by knowing that both Sam Torrance and Des Smyth have previously played major roles in leading Europe to victory. McGinley's compatriot Smyth was one of Ian Woosnam's vice captains in 2006 when Europe recorded their largest home victory -- by 18½ points to 9½ -- at the K Club in Ireland. However, he does have the advantage of having known McGinley, now 47, since the Irishman was a teenager.
