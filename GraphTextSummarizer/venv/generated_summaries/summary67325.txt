The American-bred horse who won last year's St Leger -- Encke -- is among seven more horses trained by disgraced Godolphin trainer Mahmood Al Zarooni to test positive for steroids, the British Horseracing Authority (BHA) has announced. After Al Zarooni earned an eight-year suspension when he admitted administering banned drugs to 15 horses in his care, the BHA undertook further extensive testing at his Moulton Paddocks yard. Trainer Saeed bin Suroor, who runs the Stanley House stable in Newmarket, will now take control of Moulton Paddocks, the yard formerly licensed to Al Zarooni. The practice is allowed in Australia and Dubai, where Al Zarooni was based prior to taking control of Moulton Paddocks in 2010. "We welcome the news that Saeed bin Suroor's horses tested negative and this clears the way for him to now take charge of Moulton Paddocks," said Paul Bittar, Chief Executive of BHA.
