She urged the audience to hold Tunisia's new Islamic government to their word to embrace freedom of religion and equal rights for women. In meetings with Tunisia's president, prime minister and young people, Clinton urged patience on economic and political reform and emphasized that the breakdown of economic systems is "recipe for frustration and instability that can be exploited by extremists and criminals around the world." Clinton pledged to put youth issues on the international agenda, just as she did for women's rights. "In every region, responding to the needs and aspirations of young people is a crucial challenge for the future," Clinton said. "Just as you led the way in the revolution here in Tunisia so too must young people lead the way in building vibrant economies," she said.
