On returning from the mall, Al Muhairi discussed the issue with Al Rayes and wrote a message on Twitter, saying "till when will we keep seeing people going against our rules and showing indecent dresses?" Initially, Al Muhairi and Al Rayes had no intention of starting a campaign, just sharing their views with friends. The British Ambassador to the United Arab Emirates, Dominic Jermey, had already made his own plea to visitors before Al Muhairi and Al Rayes began their campaign. Al Muhairi's campaign to persuade expats and tourists to dress more modestly began after she and her friend Hanan Al Rayes saw a young woman in shorts that they considered left little to the imagination. "There are more important issues out there that they could do campaigns about -- sick people, children dying, hungry people, not what people wear in the malls. However, she said she would draw the line at shopping mall security guards giving people extra clothes to cover themselves.
