Senior officials in the administration of U.S. President Barack Obama said that they believe Cano's death will pose a serious challenge to the FARC going forward. They called on authorities in Colombia, and specifically on President Santos, to allow them the opportunity to give Cano a dignified burial. " The military operation that took place Friday in the state of Cauca also killed Cano's communications chief, a female friend and members of his security team, Defense Minister Juan Carlos Pinzon told reporters. -- The leader of Colombia's main leftist rebel group -- the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia -- died in a military operation in the country's southwest, President Juan Manuel Santos said Saturday. "This is an important victory for Colombia and represents a major blow against the largest terrorist organization in this hemisphere," said U.S. State Department spokeswoman Darla Jordan.
