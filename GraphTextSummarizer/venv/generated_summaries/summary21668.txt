" The South China Sea is home to messy mix of rival territorial claims, with China, Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam disputing sovereignty of island chains and nearby waters. -- China has agreed to hold formal talks with its southeast Asian neighbors about establishing a "code of conduct" to ease maritime tensions in the South China Sea, a major step forward in the long-running dispute. Stephanie Kleine-Ahlbrandt, Northeast Asia Director at the International Crisis Group in Beijing, said that it was a "positive development" and a code of conduct was urgently needed as China steps up its law enforcement patrols and military exercises in the South China Sea. " China has previously stated that it wishes to deal bilaterally with disputes in the South China Sea but a multitude of domestic problems, and the headway the U.S. is making in the region as part of its "pivot" to Asia, means China's new leaders have decided that now is not the time to press issue, Kleine-Ahlbrandt added. Ian Storey, senior follow at the Institute for Southeast Asian Studies in Singapore, says a code of conduct is a way to manage, not solve, the dispute and China is likely to drag out talks.
