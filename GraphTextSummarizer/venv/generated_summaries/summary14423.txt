"There has been a pernicious representation of black women even in the riots, and an overall depriving image of black people in general." With few black leaders in Parliament, the lack of representation in the social sphere is becoming more of a concern among black British females who consider themselves future mothers and the cornerstones of their society. In a 2010 study published in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, researchers found that African-American women are more likely than black men, white men and white women to go unnoticed by others in a group or social situation.

" African-American history, Bresi-Ando said, has had a strong impact on black British women in helping them realize the inner strength to band together in social movements and fight for racial and gender equality.
