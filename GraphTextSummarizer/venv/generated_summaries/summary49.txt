Starting in Abu Dhabi later this month, the official Premier League trophy will be at the center of an interactive exhibition which will also go to Dubai, Qatar and Saudi Arabia until the end of April. The schedule starts at Abu Dhabi's The Corniche from March 18-20, then Dubai's Jumeirah Beach Residence on April 1-3, Doha April 16-18 and Riyadh April 28-30. "We are excited about joining long-term partners Barclays to put on our first official trophy tour for fans around the world," Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore said. -- It is already one of the world's most-watched sporting events, but English Premier League officials hope to extend the football competition's popularity with a tour that gives fans the chance to experience it close up. The tour will then head to Hong Kong during the pre-season Barclays Asia Trophy in late July, and in 2012 and 2013 it will visit China, South-East Asia, the United States, India and South Africa.
