In a blatant act of defiance, a group of Mullahs took to the streets of Tehran, to protest election results that returned incumbent President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to power. Throughout all that, some clerics of the Islamic Republic have spoken up against the stifling of people's right to voice their opinion and in support of new elections. Clerics in robes and turbans join rallies to protest the disputed presidential election results in Iran. Iranian opposition at the leadership level and in the streets now has new faces, made up of those who had opposing ideologies before the election. They're loyal only to God and Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
