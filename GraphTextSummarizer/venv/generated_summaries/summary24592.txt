"A Korean delegation to the standing committee meeting of the Ramsar Convention will brief international organization officials about the DMZ peace park plan to seek cooperation," said an official of the Ministry of Unification, the government office responsible for inter-Korean relations, in a Korea Times report. Apart from the thousands of soldiers stationed at the DMZ, the heavily fortified border is home to more than 1,200 varieties of plants and thousands of animal species -- including endangered wildlife like the Asiatic Black Bear and Amur leopard. It's been over six decades since the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) was established, creating a buffer zone between North and South Korea that's often referred to as the world's most tense border. And if South Korea has its way, the DMZ will eventually be transformed into an ecology peace park. "As the southern part of DMZ is under the control of the United Nations Command, it is important for Seoul to gain global support for the DMZ park plan," reports the Korea Times.
