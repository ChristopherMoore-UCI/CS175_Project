-- U.S. authorities have learned more about two Los Angeles-area men claiming in a video to be gang members fighting in Syria: It turns out they are Syrian nationals of Armenian descent who were deported back to that country because of their criminal history. In the video, Madarian identifies himself only as "Creeper" of the Sun Valley GW-13 gang and leaves the false impression that he's a Latino gang member because he sprinkles Spanish words in his fluent English. "This is very unique because these guys are over there, and they are with the pro-Syria forces and pro-Hezbollah forces," said Steven Stalinsky, executive director of the institute.
