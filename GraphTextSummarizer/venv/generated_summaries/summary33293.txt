-- Authorities warned of high temperatures and strong winds Sunday as hundreds of firefighters battle a northern Colorado blaze that has destroyed almost 200 homes. Vilsack toured the Colorado blaze and said it is one of thousands burning nationwide. Elsewhere in Colorado, firefighters are battling an 11,600-acre fire near Pagosa Springs that broke out last month. The blaze has moved through forests and neighborhoods, forcing thousands of evacuations and leaving a trail of destruction. The National Weather Service has issued warnings of high chances of wildfire activity in nine states, including Colorado.
