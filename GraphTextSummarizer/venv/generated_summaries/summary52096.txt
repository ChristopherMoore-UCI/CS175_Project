-- The Tanzanian island of Zanzibar began three official days of mourning Sunday, a day after 200 people died when a ferry jammed with passengers and tons of cargo capsized amid strong waves. In addition to Tanzania, South Africa was sending divers and navy forces to help with recovery efforts, said Mohamed Aboud, the state minister of Zanzibar. President Ali Mohamed Shein of Zanzibar, who ordered the three days of mourning, also called for flags to fly at half staff. "Right now, we are focusing on getting the bodies for the relatives, but you never know, God is God ... "A lot of children are going back to Zanzibar for school, so there were a lot on the ferry," said Ismail Katumba, a resident of Dar es Salaam.
