The Israeli military said it was an operation by the Israel Defense Forces and Israel Security Agency to arrest Hamas operative Hamza Abu Alhija. -- Three Palestinians, including a Hamas operative, were killed and seven were injured during a confrontation with Israeli military forces in a Jenin refugee camp early Saturday, Palestinian security sources said. Abu Alhija was killed in the shooting, Israeli forces said, along with two others. Abu Alhija was wanted for alleged involvement in shooting and bombing attacks against Israel, the Israeli military said. "During the mission, Abu Alhija barricaded himself with other operatives in his house," the Israeli military said.
