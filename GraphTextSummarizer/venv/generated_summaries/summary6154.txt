The singer stars in the new Tyler Perry film "I Can Do Bad All By Myself" alongside Oscar nominee Taraji P. Henson, Perry and Gladys Knight. CNN: What is the link between spirituality and music in the film and in life? Well, I think the link with the spirituality and the music is that we all have a place where we need to go to heal, and most of the time people go to music to heal. I think it takes time for people to heal from whatever wounds they're healing from. CNN spoke with Blige about Tyler Perry, her acting angst and music.
