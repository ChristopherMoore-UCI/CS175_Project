"The chain of events that occurred in this case does not point toward simple negligence and evidence will be presented to support this allegation," said Cobb County Police Chief John House. Police in Cobb County, just outside Atlanta, have been tight-lipped and haven't said if what they found on the computer is one of the reasons they arrested Harris. 'What have I done?' Initially, police seemed sympathetic, describing the death of Cooper Harris on June 18 as the result of tragic absentmindedness. The father, Justin Ross Harris, was charged with murder and second-degree child cruelty. A timeline of events On the day Cooper died, June 18, Harris stopped for breakfast at a fast-food restaurant and afterward strapped his son into a rear-facing child restraint seat on his SUV's backseat, police said.
