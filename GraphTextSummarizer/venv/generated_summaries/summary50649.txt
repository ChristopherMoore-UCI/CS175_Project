-- Marijuana and pain medication were found in the blood of the crane operator at the site of a deadly building collapse, a source at Philadelphia's City Hall with direct knowledge of the investigation told CNN on Friday. "You felt it shake," Jordan McLaughlin told CNN affiliate KYW. This search was called off late Thursday afternoon, by which time prosecutors and city officials had toured the scene. " Searchers climbed over shards of wood, concrete and rebar looking for survivors, like the 61-year-old woman pulled alive from the rubble early Thursday. Six people died and another 13 were injured when a four-story wall of a vacant building being demolished collapsed onto a Salvation Army thrift store in Philadelphia on Wednesday.
