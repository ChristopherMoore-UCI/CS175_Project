When it comes to factory-like genocide, guilt is not to be measured by acts of cruelty or nastiness; guilt follows function. And even when a trial ended in a conviction, what was missing was any sense of moral reckoning, an acknowledgment on the part of the accused of the perversity of genocide. April 24 marks the day that millions mourn the killing of hundreds of thousands of Armenians by the Ottomans during World War I, an event many have described as genocide. For decades German courts held that mere service as a concentration camp -- in the absence of evidence of a personal act of killing -- constituted no crime under German law. But without the court's conviction, Gr√∂ning's important acceptance of moral guilt will remain incomplete.
