Wednesday's return was staged in a hall of a Washington museum filled with other French impressionist works, including some by artists who were inspired by Pissarro. Pissarro painted 24 monotypes and only 12 of them were colored, according to the French ambassador, Francois Delattre. "I love days like this because they are all about the triumph of right over wrong," said ICE Director John Morton before signing the document to return the art. Camille Pissarro's "Le Marche aux Poissons" ("The Fish Market" in English) was handed over to the French ambassador by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Wednesday. It was recognized as stolen art and, after years of legal battling, was forfeited to ICE in November of 2011.
