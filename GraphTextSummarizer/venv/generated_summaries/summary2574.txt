-- Christina Aguilera signed her name to a divorce petition that was filed against husband Jordan Bratman in Los Angeles County Superior Court on Thursday. Aguilera co-stars with Cher in "Burlesque," a major feature film set for a Thanksgiving release. "Although Jordan and I are separated, our commitment to our son Max remains as strong as ever," Aguilera said in a statement released Tuesday through her representative. That agreement called for Jordan to get none of the money Aguilera earned before, during or after their marriage. Aguilera's petition said a prenuptial agreement should dictate how they separate their assets.
