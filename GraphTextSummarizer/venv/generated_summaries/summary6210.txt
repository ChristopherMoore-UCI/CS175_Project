Facing the possibility of Coakley's defeat, Democrats were trying to figure out if they could pass health care reform without that crucial 60th Senate vote. Voters more concerned with the economy were split almost evenly between the two candidates; voters more worried about health care narrowly supported Coakley. A third option would be for Democrats to revisit the idea of trying to push health care through the Senate with only 51 votes -- a simple majority. Senate Democrats needed all 60 votes in their caucus to pass the health care bill, and the loss of one seat imperils generating that support again for a compromise measure worked out with the House. Two Democratic sources in close contact with the White House told CNN on Monday they've urged the administration, in the event of a Brown victory, to push House Democrats to pass the Senate's health care bill as currently written.
