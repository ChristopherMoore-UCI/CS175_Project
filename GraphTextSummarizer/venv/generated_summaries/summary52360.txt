Bibi's lawyer has said that the proceedings might take years because the case is still in high court and may later go to the Supreme court. Parties including the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazal ur Rehman (JUI-F) party will hold the rallies on Christmas Eve, said Moulana Amjad Khan, party spokesman. Zardari has said he would pardon Bibi, but a court has ruled that the president can't act until the sentence is confirmed by a higher court -- a process her lawyer says could take two to three years. The Islamic nation has a population of about 170 million, according to government statistics as religious parties plan Friday rallies to protest possible changes. The government will form a committee of scholars to revisit the law, said Shahbaz Bhatti, the federal minister for minority affairs.
