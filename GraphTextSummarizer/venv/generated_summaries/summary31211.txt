To mark the 25th anniversary of the world's worst industrial disaster, authorities planned to open up the now-dilapidated shell of the Union Carbide fertilizer plant, where in the wee hours of December 3, 1984, 40 tons of methyl isocyanate gas oozed out onto the sleeping city of Bhopal, India. Activists who advocate for Bhopal's victims viewed the plant tours as a publicity stunt for the government. Dhingra said plans to open the plant to the public was disrespectful to Bhopal's gas victims. But the move sparked protests from victim rights groups and environmental activists. For the same reason that a person visits a Nazi concentration camp or ground zero in New York. "Everyone wants to see the world's worst industrial disaster," said S.R. Mohanty, the secretary for the Relief and Rehabilitation Department for the Bhopal gas tragedy.
