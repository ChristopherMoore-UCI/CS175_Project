Radioactive water is leaking, soil is contaminated, and workers must brave dangerous conditions as they try to slowly and painstakingly take the power plant apart -- a process expected to take decades. The true scope of the contamination is a subject of debate, with a research team from Fukushima University recently releasing a study that claims the plant operator Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) grossly underestimated the amount of radioactive poison cesium-137 released into the environment. We pass them as they labor in heavy clothing, braving the heat along the roadside, filling black bags with contaminated soil. After leaving Fukushima Daiichi, I felt great relief as I was scanned for radiation exposure and none was detected. I had to wear layers of protective gear and a Geiger counter, to detect radiation.
