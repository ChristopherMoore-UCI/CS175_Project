And he followed his opening four-under-par 66 with a steady 67 to lie one stroke ahead of Briton Gary Orr (66) and South African James Kingston (68). Kapur finished his first round of Friday, after vandalism to some greens, and heavy rain, forced widespread disruption on Thursday. The Northern Irishman began with a level-par 70, but carded six birdies in his second round for a five-under-par 36-hole total of 135. Of those players still out on the course, Briton Stephen Dodd and joint overnight leader Marcel Siem of Germany head the field on eight-under-par. Dodd only has five holes to play, but Siem still has seven holes remaining in his second round.
