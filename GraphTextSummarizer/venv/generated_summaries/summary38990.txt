Net neutrality regulation is also tantamount to a declaration of surrender on broadband competition and a call to return to the era of public utility-style regulation. If broadband providers ever possessed "gatekeeper" or "bottleneck" power that required regulation, that rationale for regulation no longer exists. As First Amendment attorney Robert Corn-Revere has noted ("The First Amendment, the Internet & Net Neutrality: Be Careful What You Wish For"), "It should not be forgotten that the federal government's initial impulse [in the mid-1990s] was to censor the internet and to subject it to a far lower level of First Amendment protection." He alludes to potential corporate blocking of online products and speech and says, "If that scares you as much as it scares me, then you need to care about net neutrality. For the former, the combination of technological innovation, consumer education, industry best practices and competitive markets all work to blunt the abuses -- real or imagined -- of broadband providers.
