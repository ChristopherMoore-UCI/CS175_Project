Canada's zombie preparedness means one thing for us: Zombies will be driven out of Canada and into the United States. It's just a matter of time until Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York or House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi says zombies should receive government benefits. Patriotic members of the Canadian Parliament stood up to political correctness last week by declaring that Canada will not tolerate an influx of zombies. Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird even went as far as to boldly state that "Canada will never become a safe haven for zombies, ever." Sure, you can point zombies in the direction of Canada and hope they keep walking as a pack over the border, but they're easily distracted.
