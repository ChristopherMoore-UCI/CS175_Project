Kirk will not seek the open seat in January's special election, Patrick said, "but for the next few months, he will carry on the work and the focus of Sen. Kennedy, mindful of his mission and his values and his love of Massachusetts. " The family of Kennedy said Patrick "could not have selected a more outstanding person to serve as Massachusetts's interim senator than Paul Kirk." "Senator Kennedy always said that serving the people of Massachusetts in the United States Senate was the greatest honor of his life. In a statement released Thursday, Obama called Kirk a "distinguished leader, whose long collaboration with Senator Kennedy makes him an excellent, interim choice to carry on his work until the voters make their choice in January. One source said Kennedy's widow, Vicki Kennedy, was among the family members supporting a Kirk appointment. Kirk will fill the U.S. Senate seat left empty by the death of former Sen. Edward M. Kennedy.
