Marosan alleges that college officials gave preferential treatment to gay faculty members in a  small clique dubbed, "the Merry Men." "Trocaire is confident that it will be vindicated when the full facts of  this case are presented in the hearing process," said John A. Vecchio, vice president for institutional advancement. A report from the New York State Division of Human Rights shows that a dean of education allegedly made comments about Marosan's nationality, accent, culture and manner of greeting colleagues. In addition, the report indicates that among a number of sexual harassment complaints made against Marosan, at least one student admitted to having been coached. Dr. Csaba Marosan taught natural Sciences at Trocaire College in Buffalo.
