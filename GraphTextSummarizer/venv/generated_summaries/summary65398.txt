Twelve people were injured in the incident in the Dutch town of Apeldoorn, about 45 miles east of Amsterdam, police spokeswoman Esther Naber told CNN. -- Five people were killed Thursday after a man tried to attack the Dutch royal family during a Queen's Day celebration by crashing his car near the royal family's bus, Dutch police said. Crowds had lined the streets to see Queen Beatrix and her family ride by in an open-top bus during the Netherlands' annual holiday. Queen's Day is a national holiday in the Netherlands, the Netherlands Antilles, and Aruba. The crowds were behind barriers off the road, but security officials and journalists, including many cameramen, were in the road as the car went by.
