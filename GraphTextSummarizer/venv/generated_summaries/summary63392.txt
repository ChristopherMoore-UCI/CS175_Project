Slingshot messages are photo and video only, although users can superimpose bits of text on the images. "When everyone participates, there's less pressure, more creativity and even the little things in life can turn into awesome shared experiences." In fairness, the app is designed not for sending urgent information -- we have texting or even phone calls for that -- but for exchanging spontaneous moments or snippets of creativity. Unlike Snapchat, Slingshot allows users to send, or "sling," messages to multiple friends at once. Slingshot, which leaked briefly last week before Facebook pulled it offline, is the social networking giant's latest attempt to compete with Snapchat, a rival messaging app that is popular with teens and young adults.
