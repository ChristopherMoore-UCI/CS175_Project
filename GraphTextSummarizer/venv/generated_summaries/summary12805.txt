DePetrillo and Graham are so-called "white hat" hackers who investigate and expose security holes that have yet to be plugged by makers of new computer systems. A website is offering a bounty of more than $16,000 in cash and other prizes for the first person to successfully hack the Touch ID fingerprint sensor on the new iPhone 5S. The site, IsTouchIDHackedYet, was created by Nick DePetrillo, an independent computer-security researcher known for demonstrating hacks of smartphones, and Robert David Graham, owner of Errata Security, a cybersecurity firm. The iPhone 5S, which went on sale Friday, has a fingerprint sensor in its Home button for added security. Tech companies generally appreciate being alerted to such security issues, which they can then patch before users' personal information is compromised. The Touch ID system is meant for human fingerprints, of course, but it apparently works with animals, too.
