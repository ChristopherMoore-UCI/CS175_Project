Although the medical examiner has not formally identified the man shot and killed in south Seattle about 2:45 a.m., detectives recognized him as Maurice Clemmons, sought in the killings of four Lakewood, Washington, police officers shot Sunday at a coffee shop, Seattle police said in the written statement. Early Tuesday, a patrol officer saw an unoccupied car in south Seattle that was running and had its hood up, police said. He was not found in the home when investigators moved in Monday morning, Seattle police spokesman Jeff Kappel said. The officer is a four-year member of the Seattle police force and is a military veteran, police said. Clemmons slipped away from a home in Seattle's Leschi neighborhood Sunday night before police surrounded the residence for about 12 hours.
