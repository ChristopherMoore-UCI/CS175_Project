All these things -- from fossils of large bones to a single tooth, from part of a jaw to toes and a claw -- coupled with digital technology could help to learn a great deal about the Dreadnoughtus and other titanosaurs' lived in their era, beyond the fact it had a 37-foot-long neck and 30-foot-long tail. Lacovara thinks the Dreadnoughtus must have had "a life-long obsession with eating," perhaps spending all its waking existence chomping leaves from giant tree after giant tree. It's hard to say how much bigger this or other Dreadnoughtus may have gotten had it fully matured. Its humerus, or upper arm, bone was taller than the Drexel University professor. "Titanosaurs are a remarkable group of dinosaurs, with species ranging from the weight of a cow to the weight of a sperm whale or more," said Matthew Lamanna, a Carnegie Museum of Natural History scholar who was part of the team, in the Drexel piece.
