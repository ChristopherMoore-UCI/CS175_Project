Badaling (close but crowded); Mutianyu (farther away but less crowded and set among gorgeous mountains); and Jinshanling and Simatai (farther away still, but perfect for adventurers). Travel + Leisure It List: World's best new hotels DO visit either Badaling or Mutianyu if you have mobility concerns; they both have aerial cable cars. Most travelers visit one of these sections from their hotel base in Beijing: Juyongguan (closest to Beijing but less interesting than most other sections); DO take a ride on the wild, mile-long toboggan track that leads down from the wall at Mutianyu to the village at the base of the wall. Note: Simatai is currently closed for site improvements.
