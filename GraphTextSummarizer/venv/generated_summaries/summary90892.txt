-- The details of the prisoner-exchange deal announced between Israel and Hamas -- a swap of Gilad Shalit, the Israeli soldier held captive by Hamas since 2006, for more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners -- are not yet fully known. The unrest in the Middle East, and especially in Syria, has been a powerful catalyst for Hamas to capitalize while it can on Israel's desire to bring Shalit home. The unrest in Damascus is forcing the external political leadership of Hamas, led by Khaled Meshaal, to relocate to the Gulf -- further away from the front lines with Israel and a political environment less sympathetic to its radical policies. (In the last stage of the bargaining, held in Cairo since July, Israel's negotiators sat in one room and Hamas in another, and the Egyptians acted as go-between.) Given that Cairo mobs sacked Israel's embassy there just a month ago and that the military rulers of Egypt had to be forced (by the US) to intervene, Israel has good reason to fear that Egypt's ability to facilitate the deal with Hamas might not last forever.
