My earliest memories of life in Cambodia are clouded -- I strain to recall my biological parents. These nighttime images of life in my homeland: Were they real? When I received the award I look up into the crowd and there she was my mom, my coach for life shouting my name. While Yea wiped away tears, she handed me two photos: one of my mother and another of me as a 3-year-old child. I could tell by his hugs and the batting lineup when we played tee ball: "Girls first, Srey first," he told my brothers.
