On Tuesday, a man convicted of blinding another man in an acid attack was himself forcibly blinded in one eye, according to Amnesty International and Tasnim News, a semi-official news website. Amnesty International said punishment has been delayed for another Iranian man in a "retribution in kind" case. "This punishment exposes the utter brutality of Iran's justice system and underlines the Iranian authorities' shocking disregard for basic humanity,"  said Raha Bahreini, Amnesty International's Iran researcher. Amnesty International said the attack occurred in 2009 in the city of Qom. The defendant was blinded in his left eye at Rajai Shahr Prison, but the blinding of his right eye was postponed, Amnesty International said.
