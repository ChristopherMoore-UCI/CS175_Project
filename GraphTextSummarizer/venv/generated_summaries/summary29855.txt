"Voters want government to intervene, but they fear what the government will do if it wades into the important task of ensuring the economic stability of voters," Goeas said. Democrats aimed their midterm message at middle class voters, highlighting policies like a minimum wage hike and fair pay legislation that they said polled well with the middle class. And Democrats had trouble selling the public government solutions for their problems because, the poll found, American voters are still split on whether government can solve them to begin with. Democratic pollster Celinda Lake and Republican pollster Ed Goeas said those were the main takeaways from their final George Washington University Battleground Poll of the cycle, conducted Dec. 7-11 among 1,000 registered voters nationwide. Americans' pessimism about the nation's economic conditions, and skepticism that government can help solve that problem, delivered Democrats their midterm beating this cycle, a team of bipartisan pollsters found in a midterm postmortem survey.
