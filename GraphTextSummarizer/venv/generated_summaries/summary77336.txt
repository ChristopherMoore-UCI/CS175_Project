Baby Lisa was reported missing at 4 a.m. October 4, after Lisa's father, Jeremy Irwin, came home from work to find the door unlocked, the lights on and a window that had been tampered with. I hope it leads to finding baby Lisa," he said. It also said that interviews with people involved in the case "revealed conflicting information" and that Bradley told police she did not initially look for her baby behind the house because she "was afraid of what she might find. Lisa's mother, Deborah Bradley, said she last saw Lisa at 6:40 p.m. the night before.
