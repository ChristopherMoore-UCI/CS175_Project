Dr. Thomas Frieden, the CDC's director, said this month in a congressional hearing that about twice as many elderly people have been hospitalized with flu symptoms than in recent years. "Both estimates indicate moderate vaccine effectiveness in preventing outpatient medical visits due to circulating flu viruses in most of the population," the report said. "It seems that this year's flu vaccine is not nearly as effective as we would like among people over the age of 65 for one particular strain of flu," Frieden said Thursday. Among those over 65, 146 per 100,000 were hospitalized for the flu virus, compared with a rate of 30 per 100,000 last year, the CDC said. "Although it's far from perfect, flu vaccination is by far the best tool we have to protect from the flu."
