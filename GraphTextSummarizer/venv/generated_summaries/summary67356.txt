Kevin Hiatt, a former 737 pilot now with the non-profit Flight Safety Foundation, said it is still unclear what caused the mishap, but credited the Southwest co-pilot for averting potential disaster. Hiatt said Midway airport is one of 35 airports equipped with an surface movement detection system known as ASDE-X to detect potential runway conflicts. When an air traffic controller gave the Southwest plane clearance to turn right on a taxiway that crossed the right runway, the two planes came into potential conflict. As the Southwest plane was decelerating on the center runway, the Learjet was cleared for takeoff on the right. Air traffic control audio tapes, released by LiveATC.net, a website for aviation enthusiasts, captured conversations between the Southwest crew and controllers in the minutes immediately afterward.
