Barrichello is set for a landmark 300th career Grand Prix at Spa this weekend and Schumacher told gathered reporters at his official press conference Thursday about his double gesture. -- Michael Schumacher has apologized by text message to fellow Formula One veteran Rubens Barrichello after their near high-speed crash at the Hungarian Grand Prix. The Mercedes man used his personal website to offer an original apology and, now heading into this weekend's Belgian Grand Prix, has backed it up. One of the main reasons is that it is his 300th Grand Prix and we have quite a lot of history together, so I thought it was appropriate to congratulate him," he said. Schumacher is in ninth place and Williams driver Barrichello 11th.
