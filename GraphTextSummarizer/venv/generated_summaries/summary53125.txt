"We are overwhelmed with gratitude," said Don Meyer, president of Valley Forge Christian College in Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, from where Buchanan was graduated in 2007. Buchanan is a devoted Christian whose passion for helping those less fortunate took her to Africa, Christian-Delker said. According to the Danish Refugee Council, Buchanan and Thisted were kidnapped in the town of Galkayo in central Somalia on October 25 during a visit to a project site in the area. It was a semester of student teaching in Nairobi that opened Buchanan's heart to Africa. Friends reacted with relief and joy Wednesday to the news that 32-year-old aid worker Jessica Buchanan had been freed after three months in captivity in Somalia.
