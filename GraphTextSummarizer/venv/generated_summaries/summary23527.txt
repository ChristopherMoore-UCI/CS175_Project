It's not surprising then that polls rank equal pay for equal work as a top issue for women across the country. On average, working women in the United States can afford 91 fewer weeks of food for their families, 13 fewer months of rent, and more than 3,000 fewer gallons of gas per year as compared to men. This week Congress has an opportunity to go from its standing ovation for equal pay at the State of the Union to really standing up for women. Despite increasing education and greater professional success, women in the aggregate still make less than men: on average, 77 cents on the dollar, and even less if you are black or Latina. This persistent pay gap has real implications for women and their families, especially when 40% of our nation's households with children rely on women as a primary or sole source of income.
