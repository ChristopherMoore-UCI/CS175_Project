-- Haiti reported more cholera deaths Wednesday as chaos reigned in this country's second-largest city, and cases among people who had traveled from Haiti were reported in Florida and the Dominican Republic. Meanwhile, the Clinton Foundation announced Wednesday that it has committed $1.5 million for cholera response in Haiti. But he said cholera was unlikely to spread widely in the United States or in the Dominican Republic, since both countries have public health infrastructures -- i.e., chlorinated drinking water and intact sewage lines -- that are more robust than those in Haiti. Florida, home to about 241,000 Haiti-born residents, has asked local health care providers to watch for people who become sick or show symptoms of cholera after returning from travel to Haiti. "We are very hopeful that the magnitude of the cholera problem in the Dominican Republic will not be on the scale of Haiti," Tappero said.
