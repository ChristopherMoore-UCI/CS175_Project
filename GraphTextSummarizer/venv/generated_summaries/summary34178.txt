Former ICE Director John Morton, speaking in January, touted the success of this raid and subsequent ones -- named Operation Sunflower after the Kansas case -- that rescued 123 children, reminded Americans that while there was good news to report, the dangers that children face online and elsewhere remain. "As satisfying as the arrests in Operation Sunflower have been, today is obviously a day of mixed emotions because this operation is ultimately a tale of the perverse, pervasive and violent exploitation of children - very young children to satisfy the dark pleasures of a group of twisted adults," said Morton. He showed CNN's Freedom Project how Homeland Security Investigations agents chase down child pornographers. In a narrow, windowless office outside Washington, DC, Special Agent Jim Cole sits at a bank of computer screens. " "This Sunflower series [of photos] was being posted by an individual who was looking for information on how best to rape this little girl and get away with it." Cole, who has daughters of his own, says he began scanning the photos being posted online for any clues that might give away their location.
