The court's decision cited a "history of assaultive behavior while in placement facilities," which included at least 11 assaults against her peers and staff during her more than five years in DCF custody. The option to transfer "Jane Doe" was set in motion by DCF Commissioner Joette Katz after the teen's latest assault on a female staff worker during an out-of-state stint at a juvenile facility in Massachusetts. "We are looking at other options for Jane that will better meet her treatment needs," DCF spokesman Kleeblatt said. This week, the teen was moved to a separate facility within the prison with "a bedroom, private bathroom and a programming/recreation area," DCF spokesman Gary Kleeblatt said. Despite the controversy surrounding the DCF commissioner's suggestion to transfer the teen to an adult prison, Katz has received support from Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy, who oversees the agency.
