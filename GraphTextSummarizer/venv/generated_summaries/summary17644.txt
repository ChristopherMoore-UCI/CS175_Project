-- Almost a year to the day after learning he had the deadliest form of brain cancer, Steve Holl was dancing at his daughter Eryn's wedding. It's in the family of brain cancers that claimed the life of Sen. Ted Kennedy. More than a year into the trial, none of the eight patients who have received vaccines made from their tumors has seen cancer return. Fewer than one in three patients with Holl's type of cancer, a glioblastoma, have traditionally survived a year, let alone been well enough to dance. Using a vaccine to fight cancer makes sense to Holl, a biologist who lives in Folsom, California.
