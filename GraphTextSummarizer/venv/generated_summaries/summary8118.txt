Nadal dropped the opening set to fellow Spaniard David Ferrer and trailed 4-2 in the second before mounting a typical comeback to reach the semifinals. Rafael Nadal remained the only one of the "Big Four" still standing Friday after third seed Andy Murray joined Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer in exiting the Madrid Masters. " Nadal will play Pablo Andujar for a place in the final after his fellow Spaniard ended the run of Federer's conqueror Kei Nishikori of Japan in straight sets 6-3 7-5 later Friday. Murray, who will still take over as No.2 from Federer in the new rankings, was a break up in the first set but could not press home his advantage and a single break for the big-hitting Berdych in the second was enough to see him through. Berdych, bidding for a second straight Madrid final, will take on Swiss Stanislas Wawrinka, who put out seventh seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga of France in a three-set late night thriller.
