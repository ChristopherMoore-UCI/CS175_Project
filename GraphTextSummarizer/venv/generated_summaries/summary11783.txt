In Saturday's election, it is hard to underestimate the importance of Landrieu's turnout operation in Orleans Parish, which encompasses the city of New Orleans. As the mayor of New Orleans in the 1970s, Moon Landrieu won the respect of many black voters by desegregating the workforce and opening high-ranking city jobs and contracts to blacks. Landrieu's campaign also partnered with the Democratic Party to register scores of new voters across the state this year, focusing particularly on ushering new black voters into the party. After Hurricane Katrina, Landrieu operatives were vigilant about maintaining their voter dataâ€”scrubbing their voter files to make sure addresses and phone numbers were up to date after each purge of voters who had moved out of state by the Secretary of State's office. "They've always considered Orleans Parish to be their firewall," said Edward Chervenak, director of the Survey Research Center at the University of New Orleans.
