-- The author of a new tell-all book claims she lost her virginity to President John F. Kennedy when she was a 19-year-old White House intern, and that the affair lasted 18 months. In 2003, a Kennedy biographer mentioned "a tall, slender, beautiful 19-year-old college sophomore and White House intern, who worked in the press office" when referencing one of the president's affairs, the publisher's website said. The book, "Once Upon a Secret: My Affair with President John F. Kennedy and Its Aftermath," will be available Wednesday, but CNN was able to buy a copy Monday. The alleged affair began in the summer of 1962, while Mimi Alford worked in the White House press office. Following Kennedy's assassination, Alford "grieved in private, locked her secret away and tried to start her life anew, only to find that her past would cast a long shadow -- and ultimately destroy her relationship with the man she married," Random House said.
