The Southern Association of Colleges and Schools is currently reviewing a scathing report, prepared by former federal prosecutor Ken Wainstein, which showed thousands of UNC students took fraudulent classes, some of them multiple times. The last time SACS investigated the paper classes -- when UNC insisted they existed on a much smaller scale -- the association made UNC offer new classes to students who had been enrolled in the fake ones. His report says paper classes served as "GPA boosters" for athletes who were on the brink of eligibility. UNC fake class scandal and NCAA's response wind their way to Washington Report: Nearly half of 3,100 students were athletes This all comes as no surprise to whistleblower Mary Willingham. All she could think about were the athletes she tutored who she says were terribly unprepared for real classes at UNC.
