Ryanne Mace was 19 when she was killed last year in a shooting rampage at Northern Illinois University. Police records provided to CNN indicate that he had a long history of mental problems, including several suicide attempts. She was one of five NIU students killed on Valentine's Day last year by Steven Kazmierczak, a former NIU student who was attending graduate school at the University of Illinois in Champaign. -- Eric Mace says he thought he was giving his daughter good advice by asking her to sit up front in class. Mace believes that Ryanne was probably one of the first to be killed in the Northern Illinois University shootings a year ago, because she was in the front row in the lecture at Cole Hall.
