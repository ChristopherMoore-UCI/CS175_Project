Christopher Tierney, 31, is listed in serious condition, said Bellevue Hospital spokesman Steven Bohlen. The show, with music and lyrics by U2's Bono and The Edge, is the most expensive in Broadway history, but the production has been beset by cast injuries and technical problems. Reeve Carney is the actor who plays Spider-Man, but nine people perform Spider-Man's stunts when the character is masked, according to show spokesman Jaron Caldwell. Jonathan Dealwis, a tourist from New Zealand who was in the audience, said Tierney fell "about 6 meters," or about 20 feet, Monday night. -- The fall that seriously injured an actor in the stage musical "Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark" was caused by human error, an actors' union said Wednesday.
