-- One of the key aspects to gaining control of the fast-moving cholera outbreak in Haiti is the simplest of human necessities, actor and activist Sean Penn told CNN's "AC360Â°. Penn also told CNN's Anderson Cooper that he was concerned about whether there were enough medical supplies and personnel available in Haiti to treat those infected by the fast-moving outbreak. " People must stop using contaminated water, he said, noting that they will only do that if clean water is provided. "So, whether that's through filtration systems or trucked in water, this is going to be the essential element -- water, water, water," Penn said in an interview that aired Monday. With the help of Oxfam, J/P HRO's camp has chlorinated water, Penn said.
