When the posse stopped the train and found nine black men, they also found the two white women dressed in men's overalls, said Goodman, author of "Stories of Scottsboro" (1994). The case helped reignite the civil rights movement after years of slumber, said Goodman. He added, "Suddenly, white people who just hadn't been paying attention begin to say, 'Holy mackerel, they're going to put nine African-American teenagers in the electric chair?" Much has changed since those days, Goodman said, citing the nation's first black president. The older of the two had already had a brush with the law and, under the terms of her release, was not supposed to cross state lines, Washington said. "It has taken 82 years to clear the names of the Scottsboro Boys," said Sheila Washington, founder and director of the Scottsboro Boys Museum and Cultural Center.
