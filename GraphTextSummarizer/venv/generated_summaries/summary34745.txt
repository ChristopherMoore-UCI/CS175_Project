Philippine military helicopters on Monday fired rockets at Muslim rebels who were holed up in areas of a major city on the southern island of Mindanao. The Philippine armed forces are carrying out an operation to try to "constrict" the rebels, who came ashore last Monday, said military spokesman Lt. Col. Ramon Zagala. The number of people estimated to have been wounded, including rebels, stands at 157. The recent violence has largely paralyzed Zamboanga, a usually bustling trading hub on the southwestern tip of Mindanao, and displaced more than 60,000 people. The rebels now hold one third of the territory they had last week, before the military began its effort to squeeze their positions last Friday, Zagala said.
