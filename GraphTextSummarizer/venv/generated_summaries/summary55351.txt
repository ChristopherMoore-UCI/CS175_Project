-- English Premier League side Liverpool are a "sinking ship" under current coach Rafael Benitez, according to one of their players. Liverpool finished second in the Premier League behind Manchester United last season but the 18-time title winners haven't won a trophy since 2006. You have players these days who complain about managers and I think these players should look at themselves. The club are currently in sixth place, 15 points behind league leaders United, were knocked out of the European Champions League in the group stages and dumped out of the FA Cup by second tier side Reading. " Riera is concerned that his lack of first-team football will affect his chances of going to the World Cup with Spain, and he says he is considering offers from Russian clubs.
