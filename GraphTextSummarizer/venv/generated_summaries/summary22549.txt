Royal commentator Robert Jobson dismissed Mantel's remarks as "a cheap publicity stunt" and questioned whether she had ever met Catherine or seen her at work. In her lecture, Mantel described how Catherine's public image was first defined by her clothes, and then her pregnancy. Mantel was also critical of the public and the media, which, she suggests, place royal women under unhealthy scrutiny, particularly when it comes to producing a royal heir. Before she became a mother-to-be, "I saw Kate becoming a jointed doll on which certain rags are hung," Mantel said, and "a shop-window mannequin, with no personality of her own, entirely defined by what she wore." And Mantel contrasted that with the potential for disaster that Diana, the late Princess of Wales and mother to princes William and Harry, carried with her, saying Kate was "irreproachable: as painfully thin as anyone could wish, without quirks, without oddities, without the risk of the emergence of character.
