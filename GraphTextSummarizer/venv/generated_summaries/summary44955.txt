-- A court in central London this week found itself in the world's spotlight, as a small army of celebrities staked their reputations by turning up to offer support -- and bail money -- to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. However in a post on his Twitter page the previous week, he wrote: "Julian Assange might be guilty of sex crimes. "I am suspicious of the personal charges that have been made against Mr. Assange and hope that this will be properly resolved by the courts. "I think we are entitled to know the dealings of those that govern us." Jemima Khan, British socialite and ex-wife of former Pakistani cricketer Imran Khan, offered a similar amount before releasing the following statement: "I make no judgment of Julian Assange as an individual as I have never met him. Pilger, a long-time critic of U.S. foreign policy, has been particularly vocal in his support for Assange and the work of WikiLeaks.
