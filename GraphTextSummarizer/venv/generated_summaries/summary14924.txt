Penn joins the previously cast Michaela Watkins ("Saturday Night Live") in the ABC pilot. The show is a single camera sitcom from Jackie and Jeff Filgo ("That '70s Show," "The New Adventures of Old Christine") about a lowly cubicle worker named Neil (Penn) who has his identity stolen, only to like the fake life he's been given more than the boring one he was living.
