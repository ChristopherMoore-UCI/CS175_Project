Her ex Tom Cruise -- another tentpole action star with a questionable ability to return on his asking price -- took ninth place, though perhaps December's "Mission: Impossible" -- Ghost Protocol can turn things around for him next year. Eddie Murphy had the unenviable fate of taking second place, though his return ($2.70 for every dollar he's paid) was significantly higher than Barrymore's. A silver lining for Ferrell: He took first place in 2009 and 2010, so dropping to third is actually an improvement. Cage's "Trespass" co-star Nicole Kidman also didn't fare well, landing in tenth place. CLICK HERE to Try 2 RISK FREE issues of Entertainment Weekly Â© 2011 Entertainment Weekly and Time Inc.
