As his trial began behind closed doors Monday Fritzl pleaded guilty to incest and other charges, but denied charges of murder and enslavement -- the most serious charges against him. â€¢ Involvement in slave trade: From 1984 until 2008, prosecutors allege, Fritzl held his daughter, Elisabeth, captive in a dungeon, abused her sexually and treated her as if she were his personal property -- in a situation similar to slavery. Three of the children Fritzl had with Elisabeth were illegally held captive in a dungeon with no daylight or fresh air, according to prosecutors. Fritzl was charged in November with incest and the repeated rape of his daughter, Elisabeth, over a 24-year period. Fritzl explained Elisabeth's disappearance in 1984 by saying the girl, who was then 18, had run away from home.
