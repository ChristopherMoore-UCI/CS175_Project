-- Unfashionable Blackpool will be rubbing shoulders with the likes of Manchester United and Chelsea next season after beating Cardiff City 3-2 in the Championship playoff final at Wembley on Saturday. But backed by Lavtian millionaire Valeri Belokon, Blackpool have climbed from the third flight of English football to the elite in just four years and now stand to see their coffers boosted by Â£90 million ($130 million) in revenues from the lucrative Premier League. For this reason, the Championship playoff is often billed as the richest match in football. Despite having the vast majority of possession, Blackpool fell behind for a second time when Joe Ledley finished off a neat passing move. The club from a famous English seaside resort attract home attendances of less than 10,000 fans to their tiny ground and only sneaked into the playoffs on the final weekend of the regular season.
