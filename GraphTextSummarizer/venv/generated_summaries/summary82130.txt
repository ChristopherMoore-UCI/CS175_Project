Report: States failing to curb prescription abuse "Truth is, it is easier for a doctor to write a prescription than to explore other effective options to combat pain," CNN chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta wrote in an editorial. In September, the FDA took another step to reduce painkiller abuse with new labeling regulations, which are set to go into effect at the end of this year. Almost twice as many people abuse prescription drugs as the number of people abusing cocaine, heroin, hallucinogens and inhalants combined, the DEA says. "When you wonder why your dentist gives you 40 hydrocodone for a toothache, or your knee doctor prescribes far more than he should, that's because they're under the impression that it's not addictive as Percocet," Dr. Andrew Kolodny, president of Physicians for Responsible Opioid Prescribing, told CNN in January when an FDA advisory panel first urged the administration to recommend tighter restrictions. Since 1999, sales of prescription painkillers in the United States have quadrupled.
