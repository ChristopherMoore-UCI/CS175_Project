There are lots of different people who didn't study engineering or design who come up with great ideas. Design is about identifying real needs and desires; solving problems while connecting with people emotionally. Design is about making a positive difference in people lives, which they embrace because of the holistic value it provides. GZ: I think the most common mistake that people make when designing something new is not really understanding the true issues and thinking that design is all about aesthetics. We allow people to work in different ways.
