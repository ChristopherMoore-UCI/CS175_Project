The prosecutor, Robert Parys, said he could not immediately confirm details about those charged, but Poland's official PAP news agency reported the main suspect is a Swedish man, Anders Hoegstroem. Hoegstroem was arrested in February in Stockholm, Sweden, and the Swedish court allowed him to be transferred to Poland in April, PAP said. Prosecutors say Hoegstroem incited two Poles to steal the sign, which sat atop the entrance to the camp, PAP reported. -- Three people have been charged in last year's theft of the famous "Arbeit Macht Frei" sign at the Auschwitz concentration camp in Poland The sign reading "Arbeit Macht Frei" -- German for "Work Sets You Free" -- was emblematic of the Nazi camps of World War II.
