Putin: Gays 'can feel safe' at Sochi Winter Olympics "We have just recently passed a law prohibiting propaganda, and not of homosexuality, but of homosexuality and child abuse, child sexual abuse. -- Days before Russia hosts the world for the Winter Olympics, authorities have acted to punish those they say violated a ban on "gay propaganda," a prohibition derided by activists and defended by conservatives, who say it protects young people. Passed last summer, the "gay propaganda" law makes it illegal to tell children about gay equality. Those penalized include Lena Klimova, the creator of an online support group for Russia's gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender teens, state-run RIA Novosti reported Friday. " Days earlier, on January 17, Russian President Vladimir Putin defended a law that he said was about protecting children, not about banning homosexuality.
