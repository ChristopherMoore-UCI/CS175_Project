The plane was met by a Los Angeles Fire Department emergency response team upon landing, according to LAX spokeswoman Katherine Alvarado. Gordy said air traffic control guided the plane to Los Angeles, moving flights in front of them to open a clear path. "LAFD praises an ER RN that assisted the mother in giving birth prior to our arrival," LAFD spokesman Erik Scott said in a statement. Baby's first flight took on a whole new meaning when a woman gave birth aboard a Southwest Airlines flight in midair Tuesday morning. Mother and child were transported to a local hospital and are "doing fine," according to Alvarado.
