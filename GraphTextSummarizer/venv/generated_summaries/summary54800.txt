If Cuban intelligence didn't do it, then Sen. Robert Menendez's legal team has a list of other theories about who was behind a prostitution smear that surfaced in 2012 as the  powerful senator ran for re-election. The letter from Menendez attorney Stephen Ryan to the Justice Department's public integrity section asks the department to investigate possible "criminal activity intended" to unseat him "and to prevent him from becoming chairman" of the Foreign Relations Committee." Public integrity prosecutors are leading a corruption probe of whether Menendez violated the law in advocating for campaign donors. We don't know who was responsible for the smear against Senator Menendez, but it is my hope that the Justice Department will demonstrate some urgency in getting to the bottom of it. He writes: "We encourage the department to show some sense of outrage that a foreign intelligence agency operated by a government that has every reason to harm Senator Menendez to the U.S. has combined with dirty tricks political operatives to successfully use the Department to accomplish its goals." Menendez, who is of Cuban descent, won reelection and is now chairman of the Foreign Relations panel, which has given him a perch from which to thwart any Obama administration plans to relax economic sanctions to improve ties with the island's communist regime.
