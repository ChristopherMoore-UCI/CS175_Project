The companies listed in the indictment include Family Product USA Inc., H.M. Import USA Corp., ZCY Trading Corp., Zone Import Corp. and ZY Wholesale Inc. "They allegedly retooled their operations many times in order to avoid detection and despite repeated citations by the authorities, they continued to peddle counterfeit toys," Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breur said in a statement Wednesday. Queens residents Chenglan Hu, 51, Hua Fei Zhang, 52, Xiu Lan Zhang, 60, Guan Jun Zhang, 29, and Jun Wu Zhang, 28, were arrested Wednesday. The defendants were charged with importing and trafficking hazardous toys in violation of the Consumer Product Safety Act, importing toys bearing copyright-infringing images and counterfeit trademarks, smuggling and money laundering, according to the indictment. According to the 24-count indictment unsealed in Brooklyn, seizures of merchandise over eight years included knockoff toys featuring popular children's characters such as Winnie the Pooh, Dora the Explorer, SpongeBob SquarePants, Betty Boop, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Power Rangers, Spiderman, Tweety, Mickey Mouse and Pokemon. It was not clear late Wednesday whether they had attorneys.
