Regular physical activity was defined as at least 30 minutes per day of moderate-intensity activity at least five days per week or at least 20 minutes per day of vigorous-intensity activity at least three days per week. Among men, non-Latino whites reported exercising the most (52.3 percent), followed by "other race" (45.7 percent), non-Latino blacks (45.3 percent) and Latinos (41.9 percent). Among women, non-Latina whites were most active (49.6 percent), followed by "other race" women (46.6 percent), Latinas (40.5 percent), and non-Latina blacks (36.1 percent). The study looked at data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, which compared telephone responses from 205,140 people in 2002 with responses from 356,112 in 2005. The CDC's Miles said she is among the minority of Americans who said they engage in regular physical activity but added, "You do have to trust me."
