On Thursday morning, after a small plane crashed into an Austin, Texas, office building, he was breaking them, having rushed into the burning structure to help people escape. "In true Texas form, first responders and everyday citizens responded to today's plane crash with selfless acts of heroism, securing the area, evacuating the building and controlling the fire, and are to be commended," Texas Gov. Rick Perry said in a written statement Thursday. "[Other people who'd gathered] said they needed my ladders on my truck, because there were people stuck on the second floor," Dehaven told CNN's "The Situation Room." Authorities said they believe pilot Joseph Andrew Stack III, 53, of Austin, intentionally crashed the small aircraft into the building, where nearly 200 Internal Revenue Service employees worked. The identities of the dead weren't released as of Thursday evening.
