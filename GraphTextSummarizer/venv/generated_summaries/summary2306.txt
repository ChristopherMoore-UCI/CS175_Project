" Gashaw cites expensive machinery and tracing raw materials as the main challenges for her startup but says that she will continue using fashion to change the lives of women in her community. "'Abugida' means learning something new," says Gashaw, who started her brand at the age of 22, "and with fashion I learn something new every day. Thus, it was no big surprise when in 2012, having already worked as a professional fashion model and after graduating from a top design school, Gashaw took to making her own clothes with the launch of her label, Abugida Fashion. Fusing traditional Ethiopian designs with contemporary Western style, Abugida produces and sells a collection of clothes ranging from women's dresses and scarves to men's designer jackets and children's clothing.
