Blomkamp, who made the respected sci-fi action thriller "District 9" and has a new movie, "Chappie," coming out March 6, posted an Instagram message last week implying his next film will be a new "Alien" project. There's no word about when the film might hit theaters or whether it would bring back characters from the earlier movies -- although star Sigourney Weaver is likely to return. A Blomkamp reboot of "Alien" seems promising (although we haven't seen "Chappie" yet). Chatter about a Blomkamp "Alien" movie began almost two months ago when the South African filmmaker started posting "Alien"-themed concept art to Instagram -- including images of Weaver as her Ripley character. Weaver also has a role in "Chappie" and has gushed about Blomkamp's talent, fueling speculation that the two will work together again.
