"Let it all hang out there." Photos: John & Yoko: A New York love story Ono, Gaga, and Others to Play Los Angeles On October 1 and 2, Ono will revive the Plastic Ono Band, the avant-garde outfit she and Lennon started in 1969, at the Orpheum Theater in L.A. Joining her for renditions of classic POB material will be Iggy Pop, Perry Farrell, Thurston Moore and Kim Gordon of Sonic Youth, and Lady Gaga -- who signed up after recently meeting Sean Lennon in Japan. " "John Lennon Signature Box" As with last year's Beatle reissues, Lennon's solo catalog -- "Plastic Ono Band," "Imagine," "Sometime in New York City," "Mind Games," and "Walls and Bridges,"along with two albums with Yoko Ono, "Double Fantasy" and "Milk and Honey" -- has been remastered, and will be re-released on October 5. Documentary on the New York Years "LENNONYC," which premiered at the New York Film Festival September 25 and will debut on PBS November 22, focuses exclusively on the last decade of Lennon's life, from the time he and Ono moved to New York in 1971 until his death in 1980. Epstein says Ono had to stop and start several times while talking about Lennon's death, but she gave her blessing to the film nonetheless. The show will be dedicated to Lennon, who once asked Ono to turn her conceptual idea for a light tower (from her book "Grapefruit") into an actual sculpture.
