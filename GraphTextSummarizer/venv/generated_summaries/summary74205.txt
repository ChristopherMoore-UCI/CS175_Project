In all, 6,600 firefighters were battling the state's 10 wildfires, and 150 arson investigators also were working, said Cal Fire Director Ken Pimlott. "We are continuing to spend $5 million a day, and there is no estimate for containment for this fire," said Laurence Crabtree, Eldorado National Forest supervisor. " Authorities have said California's ongoing historic drought has helped fuel fires that have plagued areas across the state. "At some point we're going to have to remove this debris," local fire official Koby Johns told KDRV. The blaze has destroyed at least 150 structures, according to Cal Fire, and crews are still assessing the scale of the damage.
