T-Mobile offers an unlimited data plan that costs $100 per month, but throttles users who exceed 5 GB in a single billing cycle. Verizon began throttling users who consume a large amount of data, but didn't initially reveal the policy to the public, describe how it would be implemented or describe if and how users would be notified.
