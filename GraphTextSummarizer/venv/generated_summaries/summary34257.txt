But a couple of years ago, I started getting a lot of submissions from parents, many of whom have parent friends that they find annoying. I've been collecting pet examples for over three years, and I can report that "pet parents" can be just as bad as human parents. Koenig: I've heard from everyone you could possibly imagine being Facebook friends with: friends of friends, co-workers, siblings, old high school acquaintances. It's like a funny field guide to parent overshare, and I think it'll be an essential baby shower gift. For a long time, the majority of submissions came from nonparents, often people who worked with kids, like nannies, baby sitters and teachers.
