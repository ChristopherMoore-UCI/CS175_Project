Muslim Brotherhood candidate Mohamed Morsi huddled with politicians Saturday to stave off what his campaign sees as a return to the policies of longtime President Hosni Mubarak, toppled last year in the country's historic uprising. " Shafik, also a former air force officer with close ties to Egypt's powerful military, is seen as representing the interests of the old guard -- those who lost out when President Mubarak was ousted. If the first-round results in a runoff between Morsi and Shafik, many Egyptians -- particularly liberals and "revolutionaries" -- will be very disappointed, Elgindy said Sabahy has had the backing of many who supported the Cairo's Tahrir Square uprising last year to protest Mubarak's rule. Mubarak led the North African nation for 30 years before being forced out last year amid a popular outcry. A runoff between Morsi and Shafik appears likely, according to unofficial results reported by Egyptian newspaper Al Ahram Online.
