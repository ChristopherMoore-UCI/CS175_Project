Weldon also testified that Brett Seacat had plans to fix up the home, so he was surprised to hear that Seacat was being accused of burning it down. Pants collected from Brett Seacat the morning of the incident weren't placed in the appropriate bag, according to Gene Gietzen, the forensic consultant. Before Weldon could even ask the question, he said, Brett Seacat told him the party was off because the couple was divorcing. Brett Seacat is on trial for the first-degree murder in the death of his wife, Vashti. The Seacats' home in Kingman, Kansas, sits not far from the courthouse where Brett Seacat is standing trial.
