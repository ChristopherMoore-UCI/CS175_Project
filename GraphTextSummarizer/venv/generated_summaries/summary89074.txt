Getting her first post-rehab interview is considered a big scoop, while the series is arguably even bigger â€” Lohan has turned down unscripted project offers for years, preferring to focus on scripted acting roles (though her family participated in an E! docu-series titled Living Lohan in 2008). Lohan recently had guest-star appearances on Fox's Glee and FX's Anger Management, as well as starred as Elizabeth Taylor in Lifetime's biopic Liz & Dick. "OWN will air an exclusive interview with Oprah and Lindsay Lohan that will tape and air in August and an eight-part documentary series with Lindsay for 2014," an OWN spokesperson confirmed. The 27-year-old Lohan is currently serving a 90-day court-ordered stint in a rehabilitation facility that is expected to conclude on July 31. Over the last year on her Oprah's Next Chapter program, Oprah has scored a string of coveted celebrity interviews, including Lance Armstrong's doping-admission interview, Rihanna talking about her turbulent relationship with Chris Brown and an interview with Whitney Houston's family after the singer's death.
