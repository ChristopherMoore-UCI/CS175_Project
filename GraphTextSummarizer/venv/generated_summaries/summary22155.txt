Ssangyong has been battered by the global financial downturn and credit crunch like many other automakers. -- Ssangyong Motor Co., South Korea's fifth largest automaker, filed for bankruptcy Friday, citing the company's worsening finances. Last year vehicle sales at Ssangyong dropped nearly 30 percent, the Yonhap news agency reported. A large portion of the company's profits used to come from SUVs, which was hurt by high gas prices earlier in the year before the credit crunch additionally cut into sales. About 800 unionized workers rally at a Ssangyong Motor plant in Pyeongtaek, South Korea, on December 30.
