-- Al Feldstein, who guided Mad magazine for almost three decades as its editor, has died, according to a Montana funeral home. Today the title is part of the DC Comics group owned by Time Warner, CNN's parent company. (Originally, the company aspired to uplift -- the "EC" initially stood for "Educational Comics.") Feldstein, looking for an angle, suggested to Gaines that the company introduce a line of horror comics. He attracted many of the talents that went on to become legends -- Don Martin, Al Jaffee, Mort Drucker, Sergio Aragones ... to list just a few of the many.
