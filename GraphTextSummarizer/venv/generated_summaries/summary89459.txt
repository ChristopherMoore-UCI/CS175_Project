Common ground Apart from the issue of North Korea, China and South Korea have bonded through their distrust of Japan. Xi is expected to be in South Korea for two days to discuss trade and regional security issues, including North Korea. On Wednesday morning, North Korea launched two short-range rockets off its east coast, according to South Korea. With closer ties between South Korea and China, "North Korea is worried it can be isolated in northeast Asia," said Kim Hankwon, director of the Center for Regional Studies at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul. North Korea has begun talks with Japan and struck economic deals with Russia which could indicate that Kim Jong Un is trying to "reduce dependency on China," he added.
