AMISOM will remain committed to pacifying Somalia," said AMISOM Ambassador Maman S. Sidikou. The attack follows a separate incident Sunday in which three African Union troops died in an ambush in the Lower Shabelle region of Somalia. The terrorist group Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for Monday's attack, which occurred about 8 a.m. in the administrative capital of the autonomous Puntland region, according to the United Nations Assistance Mission in Somalia. UNICEF called the slain workers "an integral part of UNICEF's work in Somalia, dedicated to improving the lives of others.
