Zuckerberg says the app will continue to operate as a product that's independent from Facebook and that people won't have to post Instagram photos to Facebook just because the company owns the app. For more on that, see The Wall Street Journal's recent feature "Selling You on Facebook," which analyzes the info that Facebook apps collect. As the company has grown, some people have come to trust Facebook so little that they're pulling photos from Instagram in advance of the takeover. A year later, mainstream news websites noted the phenomenon of parents and grandparents joining Facebook, scaring off younger people. But people have been writing about Facebook losing its mojo for years now.
