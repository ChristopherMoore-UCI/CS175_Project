All four were assigned to Joint Base Lewis-McChord, not far from the Lakewood sidewalk where police say Geike was accosted as he walked with two friends and fellow soldiers early Saturday. Tevin Geike, police said Monday. But Hill stabbed Geike -- and cut himself in the process -- before they left, authorities said, citing one of Hill's companions who police said they interviewed. That man told investigators that Hill had bear-hugged Geike and pushed him to the ground, and that Hill was covered in blood when he got into the car, police said. Geike, 20, of Summerville, South Carolina, was walking along a Lakewood street with two fellow soldiers after 2 a.m. Saturday when a car carrying five black men passed, with one of the occupants yelling a comment about the three being white, police initially said.
