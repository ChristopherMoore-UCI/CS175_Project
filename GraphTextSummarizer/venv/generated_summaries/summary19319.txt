I can imagine that Mike's sons are having a difficult time understanding why their father is no longer with us, but the power of his spirit will live on, particularly with many other caring fathers. As we go about living our daily lives after Mike Ainsworth gave the ultimate sacrifice, his own life, to protect his neighbor we should think about what we can do to make another person's life better. Thank you Mike Ainsworth for showing us how to love thy neighbor and live our lives as a pillar of strength. Covering the story of Mike Ainsworth this past week has shown me how to open my heart a little wider, feel a little more compassionate and care a little more about others before it's too late. Mike's story should be an inspiration that encourages people to think less about how difficult their days are and more about taking a little bit of extra time to read to their children, answer as many questions as they have and hug them a little longer than they may want.
