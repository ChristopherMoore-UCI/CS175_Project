Americans entered the Olympics with high hopes -- and a quest to redeem themselves after their performance in the last Winter Games in Vancouver in 2010 when they lost the gold-medal game to Canada 3-2 in overtime and went home with a silver medal. The Fins were a formidable team entering the bronze medal game because their two losses came to the two finalists who will be playing in Sunday's gold medal game -- Canada and Sweden -- and because they knocked Russia out of the Games. The Americans appeared Saturday to still be reeling from their loss this week to Canada, 1-0, which meant that the Americans would be relegated to playing for the bronze medal and the Canadian team advancing to Sunday's game for the gold. This week they took a silver medal after they lost the gold medal game to Canada in overtime, 3-2. But the U.S. team then lost to Canada, which will play Sweden on Sunday.
