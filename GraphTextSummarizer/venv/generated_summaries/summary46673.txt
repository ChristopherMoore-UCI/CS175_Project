He may be driving a black 1994 GMC Jimmy pickup truck with Tennessee license plate 360 WLN or a red 1994 Chevrolet S10 pickup with South Carolina license plate EVE 177, according to the FBI. "This guy has made no effort to hide the gun," FBI agent Kevin Keithley said earlier this week, before Schaffner was named a suspect. Chad E. Schaffner, who was released from Indiana's prison system last year following an armed robbery conviction, was identified as the man on the billboards, making him a suspect in the robberies in Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee, the FBI said Thursday. The FBI posted photos of the robberies, occurring from May to last week, on electronic billboards in eight Southern states, in part because the robber made no apparent attempt to cover his face. No one was hurt in the robberies, but Schaffner, who turns 37 on Monday, should be considered armed and dangerous, the FBI said.
