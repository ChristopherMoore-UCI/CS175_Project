The resolution read by Kim at the meeting also called on party organizations to "conduct the organizational and political work in a fresh and viable manner so that the officials, party members and working people may turn out as one with the revolutionary faith, fighting spirit and revolutionary pluck to devotedly carry out the teachings of Kim Jong Il and the party's policies under any condition." After all, Kim Jong Un -- following in the footsteps of his father, Kim Jong Il, dear leader and eternal chief  of the Workers' Party of Korea -- is cracking down. A resolution he read at the meeting of the party's Central Committee on Wednesday reminded party organizations that they must "wage an all-party intensive campaign against abuse of power, bureaucratism, irregularities and corruption," according to the state-run Korean Central News Agency. "Kim Jong Un shows off new trapezoidal hair style, tiny eyebrows," said Allen & Kelley Co. "The Joey Essex haircut goes drastically wrong as it reaches North Korea," tweeted Adam Taylor.
