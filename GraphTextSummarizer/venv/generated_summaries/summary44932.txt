-- Mark Wilson claimed his second PGA Tour win of the season as he beat fellow American Jason Dufner at the second extra hole of a playoff to win the Phoenix Open Monday. Wilson, who took the season-opening Sony Open is riding the crest of the wave with his fourth career PGA Tour win. "I was a little more nervous today than I was expecting," he told the official PGA Tour website. Wilson drained an 10-foot birdie putt to edge out Dufner after both had finished tied on 18-under 266 in regulation play, the tournament held over after frost delayed proceedings Sunday. Wilson closed with a two-under 69 while Dufner went into the playoff after a fine 66 with birdies at the 16th and 18th as he chased his first Tour win.
