The NFL official told CNN alternative dates were offered for last week's review, but they were deemed unacceptable, so the NFL conducted the review without Peterson present. The matter of a Friday review of his case, however, had the NFL and NFL Players Association at odds, as the league claimed Peterson skipped the review, while Peterson called the review arbitrary and said he "can't excuse their refusal to be fair. "As Mr. Peterson was advised, the purpose of the meeting would be to review his case, and would include a group of outside experts who could offer broader expertise on the legal, clinical and football issues involved," the official said in a statement. The NFL was set to hold a grievance hearing Monday that could put running back Adrian Peterson back on the gridiron, but the hearing follows a weekend of debate over whether the league is treating the Minnesota Vikings star fairly. Peterson disputes league claim Peterson's Sunday statement called reports that he backed out of the meeting "not true."
