-- Pre-match handshakes, or the absence of them, overshadowed the eight fixtures in the English Premier League on Saturday as the feud between Queens Park Rangers defender, Anton Ferdinand and Chelsea captain John Terry continued at Loftus Road. The home side had their chances in the second half but Park Ji-Sung squandered a free header while Bobby Zamora couldn't find a shot after rounding keeper Petr Cech. Ferdinand ignored Terry as both sets of players assembled to shake hands before kick-off in what was the first meeting of the two players since the Chelsea defender was acquitted of racially abusing Ferdinand (younger brother of Rio) by a court in July. Lukas Podolski and Theo Walcott were also on target for the Gunners whose total was boosted by two first-half own goals by Southampton's Dutch defender Jos Hooiveld and Nathaniel Clyne. Aston Villa recorded their first victory of the season beating high-flying Swansea City 2-0 at Villa Park.
