They were "10 heavily armed Somali bandits suspected to be al-Shabaab operatives" from Ras Kamboni, across the border in Somalia, Kenyan security minister George Saitoti said in a statement. Meanwhile, he said Kenyan security officials were planning their next move and weighing whether to enter Somalia and attack. -- Kenyan officials sent mediators into Somalia Sunday after captors took a kidnapped French woman there, a Kenyan government official said. "We advise against all but essential travel to coastal areas within 150 km of the Somali border, following two attacks by armed gangs in small boats against beach resorts in the Lamu area on 11 September and 1 October 2011," the statement said. "We have sent mediators to find out what are their requests or what are their issues," Kenyan Tourism Minister Najib Balala told CNN.
