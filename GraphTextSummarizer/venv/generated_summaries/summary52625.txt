-- The mayor of San Diego's goodbye concludes Friday at 5 p.m., when his resignation -- submitted last week after a string of women accused him of sexual impropriety and boorish behavior -- becomes effective. " City Council President Todd Gloria, a fellow Democrat who had called on Filner to resign, is to serve as interim mayor, and a special election is scheduled for November 19. The former nine-term Democratic congressman began what was to have been a four-year term last December, but resigned last week as the accusations grew. The agreement does not affect a lawsuit brought against Filner by Irene McCormack Jackson, Filner's former communications chief. Some of them voiced that view to City Council members last week.
