Officer Thor Soderberg was walking to his vehicle in the parking lot at 61st and Racine on the city's South Side, after completing a shift with the department's Operation Protect Youth program, when he encountered the offender, said James Jackson, assistant superintendent of police operations. -- A Chicago police officer was shot and killed Wednesday afternoon during a struggle with a suspect in a police facility parking lot, police said. "The 24-year-old suspect disarmed the officer and then shot him," Jackson said at a news conference Wednesday night. The department believes the suspect then was involved in an armed robbery a short distance away from the shooting, where he fired additional shots, said Jackson. His injuries are non-life threatening," said Jackson.
