After Thursday's 104-84 loss to the New York Knicks, Jordan is now the owner of the worst team in NBA history. Adding to the irony, Jordan was the leader of a Chicago Bulls team back in the 90s that is the winningest team in NBA history, scoring a 72-10 record. Also the Bobcats were forced to play rookies Kemba Walker and Bismack Biyombo without much practice time because of the lockout-shortened season. Jordan also acknowledged that his six championships and five Most Valuable Player awards, numerous scoring titles and many other accomplishments as a player adds to the scrutiny he gets as an owner. As the Bobcats neared the record this week, Jordan received a chorus of criticism.
