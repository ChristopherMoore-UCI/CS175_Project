Dutschke can be linked to Sadie Holland through her son, Democratic state representative Steve Holland. Before police settled on Dutschke as a suspect, they took into custody a Corinth, Mississippi, man named Paul Kevin Curtis, who makes his living impersonating Elvis, Buddy Holly and Randy Travis. As for Curtis, Sadie Holland presided over a 2004 assault hearing involving Curtis, who says he has been in jail "over 20 times," but never convicted. Federal authorities arrested James Everett Dutschke, 41, on Saturday on charges of possessing and using ricin after initially charging -- and then clearing -- another man with whom Dutschke has sometimes feuded. Curtis vehemently denied sending the letters, said he was framed and identified Dutschke as a potential culprit.
