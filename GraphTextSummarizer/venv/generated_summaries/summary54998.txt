However, more people are using the automatic input mechanisms provided by financial institutions, while only 20% to 30% of Quicken users input manually, according to Wu's research at Intuit. -- Software developer Intuit isn't concerned about which of the two most popular applications for personal finance people choose. Quicken has been around for nearly 30 years, whereas Mint was founded in 2006 and was acquired by Intuit just a couple of years ago. About a third of Quicken customers buy a new version every year, and another third upgrade every three years, said Eddy Wu, an Intuit senior product manager. On the other hand, Mint's website and applications, which can all provide access to a single account's information stored on Intuit's servers, are free with ads for cards, banks and insurance companies tailored to a user's spending habits sprinkled throughout.
