Marshall recorded home movies of Moscow and his friends interacting so Hanks could study their movements: how kids acted, ran, talked, and joked around with one another. Actor David Moscow, who played young Josh, told CNN that he originally auditioned for the role of Josh's best friend, Billy. Months later, when Hanks came aboard, Moscow got a callback. Moscow's hair was dyed slightly darker and he wore green contacts in order to better resemble Hanks. Moscow and Hanks, of course, could not be in any of the same scenes, but Hanks' nice guy reputation was already filmdom lore.
