The latest World Cup craze, currently exploding on social media, pays homage to Netherlands striker Robin van Persie. Spain's captain and goalkeeper, Iker Casillas, was only 40 minutes away from besting legendary Italy goalkeeper Walter Zenga's record of 517 minutes without conceding during World Cup matches. Van Persie nodded delicately over Spain goalkeeper Iker Casillas while seemingly suspended in mid air to register one of the goals of the tournament. It meant Spain conceded more in its opening 90 minutes in Brazil than in its last 10 games at World Cups and European Championships combined. Dutch DJ Armin van Buuren posted his tribute after a thumping win for Louis van Gaal's team, but the craze caught the imagination of both old and young.
