In a statement, McCarthy said Carolinas HealthCare System uses standard methods for disinfecting its equipment, saying that all duodenoscopes that have been tested have shown to be negative for CRE. Eighteen people have contracted carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, or CRE, so far this year, said Kevin McCarthy, spokesman with the Carolinas HealthCare System. In Los Angeles, seven patients contracted CRE after routine endoscopic procedures. The medical center is contacting 179 others who underwent endoscopic procedures between October and January. Some CRE bacteria can resist most antibiotics, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says on its website.
