"Didn't bobble a pass either." Indeed, in his rundown for a Washington-Baltimore-area sports website, writer Barry Barnes said he was struck by the "passion, heart and determination" that Harmon exhibited at the regional combine, where lower-tier players not invited to the national scouting combine pay to be evaluated by the NFL. Harmon put that speed on display at Gwynn Park High School in Prince George's County, Maryland, where he started at fullback. -- When Curtis Harmon III showed up in front of NFL scouting personnel in Baltimore last month, no one was sure what to expect. There's only so many one-handed fullbacks and no-hands running backs coaches in pro football," Speckman said, laughing during a phone interview from Montreal. Harmon took a year off from football before taking the field for Valley Forge Military Academy & College in Wayne, Pennsylvania, in 2009.
