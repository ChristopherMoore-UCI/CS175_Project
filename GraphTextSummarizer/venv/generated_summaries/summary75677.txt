Baradar and Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar are said to have orchestrated the Taliban's military activities from Quetta, Pakistan. Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, the military leader of the Afghan Taliban, was captured recently in Karachi, Pakistan, a development called a major success for the United States and a blow to the Taliban. The U.S. official said Tuesday that Baradar and the rest of the Afghan Taliban leadership in Quetta have provided "overall strategic direction" to their fighters but not "tactical control" over their actions, so there will be little effect on Operation Moshtarak, a major offensive against the Taliban in the Marjah area of Helmand province. -- The arrest of a key Afghan Taliban leader represents a setback for the militant group but won't directly affect the fighting in Afghanistan, a senior U.S. military official said. Authorities have said they hope the seizure could produce information that could help fight the Taliban and possibly lead to key militant figures, such as Omar and bin Laden.
