-- Large swaths of southern New South Wales in Australia were threatened Wednesday by raging flames, the severity of which has surprised even veteran firefighters. Thanks to firefighters like Simpson, the town of Tarcutta in southwestern New South Wales escaped by a whisker the fate suffered by Frith's sheep. Lower temperatures on Wednesday prompted authorities to rescind a "catastrophic warning," but the risk was still deemed "severe" in the northeast section of New South Wales. One firefighter received slight injuries to his hands and face, firefighter Matt Inwood told CNN Wednesday. She said assistance would be available to help residents recover in 37 areas of New South Wales.
