Nares, who lost his son, Emilio, to cancer in 2000, started a program called "Ride With Emilio" to provide transportation for low-income families and their children battling cancer. One of the first children Nares helped was a 1-year-old boy with a brain tumor who required frequent chemotherapy treatments. He will run 700 miles over 30 days, starting in San Francisco and ending in San Diego. Two-year-old Sisi Johnson has neuroblastoma and must travel as much as six times a week to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego. But Nares met many families along the way who didn't have such support: Single moms forced to take leave from jobs without pay, kids having to ride the bus alone to their chemotherapy appointments, siblings left home alone.
