As Jeremiah Owyang of digital advisory firm Altimeter Group wrote recently, store clerks could soon be using facial recognition and online influence scores to help them prioritize who needs help. Thankfully, our overmedicated and undisciplined youth are predicated to thrive in this information overloaded, attention deficit disordered world, so most don't see any problem with more data, features and apps. As "faster than real time" technology capable of predicting our every move is discussed at LeWeb in London this week, it seems prudent to ask whether such developments will actually improve our lives. But tell a politician that his or her score on Klout, the social media influence ranking website, may prioritize the attention they get from a voter -- or even the level of service they receive from a bartender -- and let's see how many injunctions get filed by the end of happy hour. But this notion of "faster-than-real-time," while fascinating, may predict a much darker, more Orwellian future.
