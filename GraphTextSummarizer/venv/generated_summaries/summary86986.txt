Lecour owns a chain of skateboard shops in South Florida and thought his contacts in the skating community would make it easy for him to bring boards to Cuba. The two skaters quickly made plans to skate together and distribute the duffel bags full of boards and gear that Lecour brought with him. Walking into the skateboard area at Havana's Parque Metropolitano, Lecour immediately saw several dozen skaters and realized that he hadn't brought enough equipment to go around. A former DJ whose arms are crisscrossed with tattoos, Lecour put out the word that any board, no matter how worn or weathered, would be welcomed by the Cubans. Lecour; his wife, Yirka; son, Kaya; and family friend Shane were stunned that the Cubans skated the way they did with the sorry gear they had.
