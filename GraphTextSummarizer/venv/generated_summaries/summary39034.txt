He called his mother a private yet persistent woman who believed that if the public had access to good information, they would make good decisions. She left her collection of tapes— her "life's work"— to her only son, Michael Metelits. "I feel confident that maintaining a family connection and supporting the archive to whatever degree we can and working with them, we're helping preserve my mother's legacy," said Metelits, who temporarily moved back to Philadelphia from London before Stokes died. For several years, Stokes and her husband traveled back and forth between houses in Philadelphia and Boston, until finally settling permanently in Philadelphia in the late 1980s. Stokes, a TV producer, librarian and political activist, took it upon herself to preserve hundreds of thousands of hours of televised news in hopes of one day making these tapes a repository of knowledge available to the public.
