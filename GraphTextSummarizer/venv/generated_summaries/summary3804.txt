" Microsoft purposefully split its Xbox One announcement into two parts so it could focus exclusively on games during E3 -- specifically, the 15 exclusive franchises it has promised for the first year of Xbox One. Pete Hines, vice president of public relations and marketing for Bethesda Softworks, said that his company and others must strike a balance between serving their current fan base (with "The Elder Scrolls Online") and developing games such as "Wolfenstein: The New Order" for future consoles. It also is appealing directly to consumers by focusing specifically on its software lineup and letting them play new game demos at select Best Buy stores in North America. "People want to see games, and we are hopefully going to bring a game that people will love," said Eric Osborne, senior writer for "Destiny" and the head of community for Bungie, the game's developer. "We're still developing games for what is essentially a moving target," Hines said.
