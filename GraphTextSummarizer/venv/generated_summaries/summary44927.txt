Starting her cross examination Monday afternoon, Assistant Wayne County Prosecutor Athina Siringas questioned whether Wafer's tears on the stand were genuine and played a lengthy video of his police interview done within hours of the shooting. Wafer is facing charges of second-degree murder and manslaughter for killing 19-year-old Renisha McBride, who prosecutors said was on Wafer's porch in Dearborn Heights seeking help after a car accident. On the stand, Wafer said he thinks of McBride daily. The distance from the muzzle of Wafer's weapon to McBride's face, said Balash, would have been no more than two feet. Wafer's attorneys also called to the stand crime scene reconstructionist David Balash, who testified the screen in Wafer's front door was already damaged and knocked out of its frame when Wafer fired through it.
