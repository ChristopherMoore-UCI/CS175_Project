-- With more than 2,000 heroes, villains and other characters pulled from the DC Comics universe, the latest in the "Scribblenauts" video game franchise has created a unique visual experience for gamers and comic fans alike. Jeremiah Slaczka, creative director at game developer 5TH Cell, said his team wanted to give players the opportunity to imagine any scenario, which meant creating a lot of DC content. "Scribblenauts Unmasked: A DC Comics Adventure" is available now for the Wii U, Nintendo 3DS and Windows PC. The DC characters are drawn in the cartoonish Scribblenauts style but retain the powers and abilities fans will recognize from the books. That's why developers were so meticulous about having as many DC characters available as possible.
