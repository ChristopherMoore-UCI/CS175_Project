Great Falls, Montana, will shiver at 9 below zero on Tuesday night. Nuri is now the strongest known Northern Pacific cyclone on record, according to the National Weather Service Ocean Prediction Center. The stream has whipped south, dragging down frigid air from Canada over the northern Plains and Mountain States and the Upper Midwest, according to the National Weather Service. It is already plunging temperatures below freezing there and will hammer them into the teens and single digits in many places by midweek, even lower in others. The snap is forecast to lay down the first broad layer of wintry snow, flurries, sleet or ice -- long before winter starts -- from Montana down to Nebraska and over to Wisconsin.
