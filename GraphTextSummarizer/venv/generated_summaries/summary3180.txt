China's Xinhua news agency reported that four former national team players and a number of match officials and team owners were also given prison sentences as a match-fixing case, which began over two years ago, drew to a close on Wednesday. French striker Nicolas Anelka swapped English team Chelsea for Shanghai Shenhua in January, while former Argentina coach Sergio Batista was appointed by the club last month as replacement for Jean Tigana. Italy's World Cup winner Marcello Lippi is now coach of Guangzhou Evergrande, who have also recruited highly-paid players such as Argentine playmaker Dario Conca and Paraguay's Lucas Barrios. Former national team midfielder Shen Si, who represented China 39 times between 1995 and 2002, was sentenced to six years, while fellow players Qi Hong, Jiang Jin and Li Ming have been handed five-and-a-half-year terms. Chinese football has seen its profile boosted over the last 12 months, with a number of big-name stars joining the country's Super League.
