His supporters protested for weeks, demanding that Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva dissolve parliament and call new elections. Several symbolic activities were performed by the demonstrators, including tying red robes and forming a giant spider web, lying on the street to represent the dead, and lighting red candles around the area. -- More than 10,000 anti-government demonstrators gathered in the heart of Bangkok's shopping district Sunday to mark the fourth anniversary of a bloodless coup that ousted Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra. Similar activities were held in Chiang Mai, Nong Khai, and in the north and northeastern parts of the country, according to local media. Bangkok and six other provinces remain under emergency rule, which the government imposed in April.
