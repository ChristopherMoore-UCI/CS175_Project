"How can you throw a governor out of office with insufficient and incomplete evidence?" As he did in his television interviews, Blagojevich railed against Senate trial rules that he said unfairly prevented him from presenting witnesses or evidence. Shortly after the vote, newly minted U.S. Sen. Roland Burris, D-Illinois, who was appointed to the seat by Blagojevich, issued a statement saying he stands behind the state Senate's decision to remove the governor from office. Earlier Thursday, Illinois state senators made final deliberations in Blagojevich's impeachment trial. The Illinois Senate on Thursday voted unanimously to remove impeached Gov. Rod Blagojevich from office. At the news conference, Blagojevich thanked Illinoisans, who elected him governor twice after terms as a U.S. representative and state lawmaker.
