World Cup Willie (1966 World Cup, England) Striker (1994 World Cup, United States) The American public, who clearly adore dogs, voted for the loveable animal which, like World Cup Willie, wore the red, white and blue of the hosts. Jerboas (2011 Asian Cup, Qatar) Next year's Asian Cup of Nations in Doha has a whole family of mascots. Critics might say that UEFA and its design company Warner Bros. have hardly displayed originality, because the mascot for Euro 2008, co-hosted by Austria and Switzerland, was twin brothers "Trix and Flix." It's always a problem for co-hosts of tournaments to design mascots or logos which can fit both national identities.
