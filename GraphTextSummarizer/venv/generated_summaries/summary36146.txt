Lonely Planet: Europe's six surprise islands Best for beaches: Crete, Lipsi, Kefallonia, Skiathos, Mykonos Almost every Greek isle has great beaches, but few come with a Venetian castle, like laid-back Frangokastello Beach in southern Crete. Crete is famous for its olive oil and specialties like dakos (rusks topped with tomato, olive oil and cheese) and myzithra (sweet cheese, used in kalitsounia pastries). Best for responsible travel: Zakynthos, Chios, Crete Volunteer to protect endangered wildlife like sea turtles on Zakynthos with the Earth, Sea & Sky Center and Sea Turtle Protection Society. The Zakros-Kato Zakros (a former Minoan palace site) amble in eastern Crete is more relaxed. With more than 2,000 islands, ranging from tiny atolls to the veritable continent that is Crete, maritime Greece is unmatched for sheer variety.
