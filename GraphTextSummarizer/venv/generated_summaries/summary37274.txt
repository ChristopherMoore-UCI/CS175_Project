The original indictment alleges that Haste acted "recklessly" and ultimately killed 18-year-old Ramarley Graham while "acting with intent to cause serious physical injury ... by shooting him. -- A Bronx Supreme Court Judge dismissed on Wednesday the manslaughter indictment against New York Police Officer Richard Haste, who fatally shot an unarmed teenager in 2012. " In dismissing the case against Haste, Barrett said: "In effect the grand jury was told, by both commission and omission, that the communications of the other officers to Officer Haste were not relevant. The charges against Haste stemmed from an incident in the Bronx on February 2, 2012, when, police say, investigators observed a young man now believed to be Graham acting suspiciously.
