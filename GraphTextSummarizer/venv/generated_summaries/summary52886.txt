Tweet-A-Beer, from Portland's tenfour, combines your Twitter and PayPal accounts so you can beer a buddy on the Internet "to ensure that distance, agoraphobia and gang rivalries no longer prevent you from sharing a pint. Well, there are worse places to push the idea than South by Southwest Interactive, the annual gathering known as "spring break for geeks." The Tweet-A-Beer mobile app is rolling out this week at SXSW, the Austin, Texas, festival that has helped launch such social-networking staples as Foursquare and Twitter. Looking to sell the public on your plan to combine Twitter with beer drinking? Once signed up, a user enters the screen name of another Twitter user and the app credits $5 to their PayPal account.
