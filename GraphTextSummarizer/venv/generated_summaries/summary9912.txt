" Campaign songs have always been a tradition with presidential candidates -- "Marching with McKinley" for William McKinley, "He's All Right" for Benjamin Harrison, "Get On a Raft with Taft" for William Howard Taft, "Keep Cool and Keep Coolidge" for Calvin Coolidge -- but only in recent years have songs that are already big hits, and that were not written for a candidate, been made a regular part of campaign playlists. But last week I was able to get in touch with both Kix Brooks and Ronnie Dunn, and in separate conversations we talked about what having their song become the go-to anthem for presidential candidates means. When Brooks & Dunn were filling arenas and stadiums night after night, there would come a moment, midway through "Only in America," when local members of the military invited by the band -- usually four or five of them, from the different branches, always in uniform -- would march in crisp formation onto the stage, and would face the audience, then salute. We are now able to project a winner in the 2012 presidential race: Brooks & Dunn. ..." Brooks & Dunn, after a 20-year career of platinum albums and No. 1 hits, have broken up and no longer perform together.
