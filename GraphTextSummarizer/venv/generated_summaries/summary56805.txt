The sister of another crew member, who has been in regular contact with her brother and asked not to be identified for security reasons, said crew members have heard that the captain was charged with arms trafficking. Crew members on a U.S.-flagged ship learned Friday that their questioning by Venezuelan investigators in an arms trafficking probe has been delayed until Monday. The captain and crew members were all expected to give statements to investigators, the manager said. U.S. State Department spokesman Patrick Ventrell on Friday confirmed the ship and crew's detention. As of Friday night, prosecutors had yet to make a decision on the case, according to a manager of the ship's customs brokers.
