Tea party favorite and potential 2016 presidential candidate Ben Carson gave President Barack Obama some rare praise for his response to the North Korean cyberattack that threatened the release of a Sony Pictures movie. "I am proud of the president of the United States for taking a tough stand on this issue," Carson, a frequent and no-holds-barred critic of Obama, wrote in a Washington Times opinion piece published late Tuesday. " Obama had said that the U.S. would respond proportionally to the cyberattack, which the FBI said North Korea was "responsible" for. Carson has slammed Obama in the past for his policies, most recently his stance on race relations in the wake of incidents in Ferguson and New York, and once criticized the direction of the country with Obama just a few feet away. "The response should go far beyond proportionality, and an example should be made of the perpetrators by using a host of available options to inflict the kind of punishment that will not be easily forgotten," Carson wrote, adding that he believes the U.S. "appears to be a paper tiger" and is less respected and feared around the world.
