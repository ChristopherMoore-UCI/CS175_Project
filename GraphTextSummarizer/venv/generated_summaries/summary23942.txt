-- First-term Illinois Republican Sen. Mark Kirk said "no frickin' way am I retiring" in an interview with Roll Call published Friday morning, instead clearly signaling his intentions to run for reelection in 2016. "It's the only way that Democrats can win in Illinois, is to say, 'Oh, Kirk has health problems, he's going to retire.' "With all this rehab, for me just to walk was a huge effort," Kirk told Roll Call. " Illinois, typically a deep blue state, will likely be a top target for Democrats in 2016 looking to regain Senate seats after suffering big losses across the country earlier this month. His chief of staff Erik Elk has said he will join the private sector, while other top staffers have joined newly elected GOP Gov. Bruce Rauner's team.
