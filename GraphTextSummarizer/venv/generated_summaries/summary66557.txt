Humala's government has made a push for illegal mines and miners in Peru to be formalized and regulated so that risks decrease. The miners had been stuck since Thursday in the wildcat Cabeza de Negro mine in southern Peru. Mining is big business in Peru, which is a major world producer of copper, silver, gold and other minerals. "We are happy that this high-risk operation was successful," said Claudio Saenz, a fire department official with knowledge of the rescue efforts. A cave-in over the weekend slowed rescue efforts.
