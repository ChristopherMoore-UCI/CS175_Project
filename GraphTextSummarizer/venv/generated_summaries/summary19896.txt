" Breul told CNN that the department typically provides escorts for the president of the United States and other dignitaries, but not for private citizens. The information came to light a day after District police announced they would investigate whether reality stars Tareq and Michaele Salahi got a police escort for their limousine to attend a party, as depicted on this week's episode of the reality TV show. " Lisa Bloom, the Salahis' lawyer, concurred that Metropolitan police were not involved in escorting her clients, but didn't know if there was an escort provide by Park Police. "Half Yard Productions reviewed all of the footage from the party in question and the police escort for the Salahi's limo was a Park Police escort," said Bronagh Hanley, a publicist for Half Yard, in an email to CNN. CNN requested comment from Park Police, but has not heard back from the agency.
