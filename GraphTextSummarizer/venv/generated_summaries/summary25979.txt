After a humbling by Barcelona in El Clasico on Sunday, Real were sunk 2-1 away at Sevilla thanks to a brace from Colombian striker Carlos Bacca. Captain Steven Gerrard opened the scoring with a fierce free kick from the edge of the penalty area before England striker Daniel Sturridge grabbed his 20th league goal of the season in the second half. Valdes then departed on a stretcher after landing badly when saving a shot on goal, the club confirming he had torn his cruciate ligament and will have to undergo surgery. Earlier in the evening, Barcelona registered a comfortable 3-0 victory over Celta Vigo largely thanks to their potent strike force but lost goalkeeper Victor Valdes to a serious knee injury. Neymar has struggled to find consistency after his move from Brazilian club Santos but he outscored the Spanish club's record all-time scorer Lionel Messi on the night by grabbing two goals.
