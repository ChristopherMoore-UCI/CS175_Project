Four protesters were arrested and were being questioned for "going off track to what is accepted as peaceful protesting," said Interior Ministry spokesman Alla Mahmoud. " Egypt's Foreign Ministry pledged to protect embassies and warned of the protests' potentially debilitating effects on the Egyptian economy. The statement noted that "the Egyptian government is responsible to protect private and public properties and diplomatic missions in addition to embassy headquarters of various countries" and that "it respects and protects the right of expression and the right to protest peacefully under the law and will firmly oppose any irresponsible attempt to veer off the law." Tuesday, police and Egyptian army personnel formed defensive lines around the U.S. Embassy to prevent demonstrators from advancing, but not before the protesters had affixed a black flag atop a ladder in the American compound.
