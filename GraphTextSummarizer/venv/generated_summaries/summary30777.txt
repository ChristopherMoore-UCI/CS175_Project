The U.S. Forest Service is urging hunters and fishermen to keep their eyes open for marijuana growing operations in Wisconsin's Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest. Wisconsin is targeting illegal marijuana growers because it has millions of acres of remote public land. "If they are protecting $10 million of marijuana plants, that's a lot of money, and there have been gun battles with law enforcement in other states such as California," Spakowicz said. A number of years ago, there would be large multithousand plant fields concentrated in one area, and now they have a couple of hundred plants in one location and then another couple hundred plants a couple hundred yards away which makes aerial detection more difficult," said David Spakowicz, the director of field operations for the Wisconsin Department of Justice's criminal investigation division. By using covert digital cameras, GPS devices and ground and aerial surveillance, law enforcement officials do what they can to apprehend illegal marijuana growers who frequently switch up their patterns to avoid detection.
