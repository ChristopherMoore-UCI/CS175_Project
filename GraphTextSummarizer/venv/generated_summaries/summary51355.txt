-- President Obama told Republican House leaders Tuesday he plans to stand firm on the part of his $825 billion economic recovery plan that calls for tax rebates for nearly all working Americans -- including those who make too little to owe income taxes. "We had a wonderful exchange of ideas, and I continue to be optimistic about our ability to get this recovery package done to put people back to work," Obama said after leaving the meeting with GOP House members. The administration is hoping that LaHood, who once was the host of bipartisan congressional dinners with White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel, will be able to help Obama win at least some Republicans in Congress. The president first met with House Republicans and then with the Senate GOP caucus. " The Republican aides, however, said the vast majority of House Republicans are expected to oppose the package Wednesday but are optimistic they will secure some of the changes they want after the vote -- either through changes the Senate makes or in conference committee after the Senate votes on the stimulus.
