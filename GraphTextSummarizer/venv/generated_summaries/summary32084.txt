The site has become too important to typical teen life to abandon, so  94% of teens on social media have a Facebook account, and the average teen user has 300 friends. That means strangers, and companies collecting data for advertisers and marketing companies, will be able to see select posts. The new setting might help Facebook compete against other social networks that skew younger, and having public data on teens will also help the company appeal to advertisers. Default settings for existing teens with profiles won't change or affect past posts. When new underage users sign up for a Facebook account, their posts will be shown to a more limited audience by default -- only to friends instead of friends of friends.
