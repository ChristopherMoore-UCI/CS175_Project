-- When President Barack Obama steps in front of cameras Wednesday, he'll be addressing a nation that's simultaneously war-weary and ready for more military action against ISIS; critical of Obama's handling of the crisis yet largely supportive of his commitment to keep combat troops out. Those currents of public opinion, however convoluted, will shape how Obama frames his strategy for "degrading and ultimately defeating" the Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria, which Americans now believe pose a real threat and must be combated. The current air campaign in Iraq relies on Obama's ability to order strikes that protect American interests and help alleviate potential humanitarian crises. That puts him in agreement with the nearly three quarters of Americans who say they're ready for a broader air campaign to defeat ISIS in Iraq and Syria.
