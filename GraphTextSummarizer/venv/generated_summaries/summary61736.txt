United Nations agencies also are on standby, activating their assessment teams and contingency planning in Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam, according to the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. In the ancient city of Ayutthara, one of the worst-hit regions, military trucks move slowly down the main street, cutting through a constant river of water, passing out aid to those who can get close. Anyone who has a boat is using it to transport aid or to help neighbors carrying their possessions as water levels rise and engulf homes. Thailand is overwhelmingly Buddhist and many temples, although flooded themselves, have some dry floors on higher ground and have opened their doors to those in need. The U.S. is also sending 26 helicopters to help the relief effort, invaluable as more roads turn to rivers and become impassable.
