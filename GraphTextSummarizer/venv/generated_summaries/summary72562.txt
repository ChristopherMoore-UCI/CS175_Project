The theater had planned to show "Team America" in place of "The Interview," the controversial comedy about a planned assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, Kim Jong Il's son, which was pulled by Sony Pictures Wednesday. According to the Alamo Drafthouse Cinema in Dallas/Forth Worth, a screening of "Team America: World Police" -- a 2004 satiric comedy, written by "South Park's" Trey Parker and Matt Stone, that includes the late North Korean leader Kim Jong Il in a key role -- has been canceled. "Please note: Our Late Shift screening of Team America: World Police has been canceled by Paramount Pictures," Capitol Theatre tweeted Thursday. Two other theaters that also planned to screen "Team America," the Plaza Atlanta Theatre and Cleveland, Ohio's Capitol Theatre, have shared similar statements. Despite speculation the comedy might be released digitally, studio Sony Pictures said in a statement that it "has no further release plans for the film."
