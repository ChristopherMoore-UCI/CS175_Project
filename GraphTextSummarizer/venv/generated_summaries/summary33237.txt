" In Monday's other deadly crash, four U.S. service members were killed when two helicopters apparently collided in the air in southern Afghanistan. The agents were first DEA agents to be killed in Afghanistan. The site was thought to harbor insurgents tied to narcotics trafficking in western Afghanistan. Seven U.S. service members and three U.S. civilians were killed, according to an ISAF statement. The DEA has had a presence in Afghanistan for four years.
