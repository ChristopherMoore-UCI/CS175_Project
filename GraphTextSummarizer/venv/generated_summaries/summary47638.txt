Jorden, a surgeon who had worked at Erie County Medical Center in Buffalo since 2003, was linked to the death of hospital clerk and ex-girlfriend Jacqueline Wisniewski on Wednesday morning, police said. Investigators found Dr. Timothy V. Jorden dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head in a wooded area near his home Friday, according to Buffalo Police Commissioner Daniel Derenda. After piecing together evidence, including surveillance video from Jorden's home and the medical center, police believe that the doctor called Wisniewski Wednesday morning, lured her to a stairwell and shot her five times at close range, Derenda said. Jorden and Wisniewski had broken up after dating for four years, Buffalo Police Chief Patrick Pascall told CNN. The surgeon graduated from the University of Buffalo School of Medicine in 1996, according to Joe Cirillo, a spokesman for Erie County Medical Center.
