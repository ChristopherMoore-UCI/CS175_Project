From President Ronald Reagan announcing the invasion of Grenada to President H.W. Bush announcing the beginning of the Gulf War to President George W. Bush announcing the invasion of Iraq, presidents have chosen to use the visual power of the "Oval." Obama, though, has used that iconic setting for prime-time speeches only twice during his presidency, both within months of each other. When it was time for Obama to make his major military announcement -- the May 2011 death of Osama bin Laden -- he chose to walk down the long White House hallway to his East Room podium, the same setting he used for his Syria speech. -- When President Barack Obama took the podium on Tuesday night, he followed in the footsteps of generations of presidents before him: speaking to the American people about a critical issue facing the United States. "From this desk, seven-and-a-half years ago, President Bush announced the beginning of military operations in Iraq.
