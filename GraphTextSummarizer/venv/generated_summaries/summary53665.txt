The Chicago teachers strike drags into a second week, after a representative group of the Chicago Teachers Union decided over the weekend not to end the walkout even though union leaders and school officials had reached a tentative contract deal. The teachers union says 200 schools will be closed, but Marielle Sainvilus, a spokeswoman for Chicago Public Schools, calls the claim "false," asserting that union leaders said recently that 100 schools would close. How would the length of school days change? How many teachers are in the union and how much do Chicago teachers make? High school students would gain 30 minutes to create a seven-and-a-half-hour school day.
