The consortium is headed by Thomas DiBenedetto, a partner of the New England Sports Ventures group which owns English club Liverpool and U.S. baseball team the Boston Red Sox. He and his cohorts will have a 60% stake, with the remainder held by Italy-based European banking organization UniCredit -- which bought the club when president Rosella Sensi last year decided she wanted to sell up. It capped a miserable week for Inter, whose European Champions League title defense ended with a 7-3 aggregate quarterfinal defeat against Schalke. Sampdoria will drop into the bottom three if Cesena beat bottom club Bari on Sunday, or Brescia win at Genoa. Buoyed by the news, Roma went in Saturday's home match against Palermo in sixth place in the table, 12 points behind leaders AC Milan with six rounds to play.
