When Phoenix Circle K manager Jerimiah Willey was pistol-whipped during a robbery last month, he landed at St. Joseph's Hospital with a head injury that required eight staples. "It's our understanding, that because of the size, we believe there's going to be two more surgeries," his mother-in-law, Rose Gould, told CNN. The surgery has left him partially paralyzed, with slurred speech and some loss of hearing. "They said that had this not been found and soon around the time that it was found, that he probably just would have gone to sleep one night and not been able to wake up," his wife, Alisha Willey, told the affiliate.
