In this one state alone, an estimated $281 million in unnecessary physician costs and more than $1 billion in excessive hospital costs was due to the practice of defensive medicine. It's a well-known fact that family medicine physicians and even obstetrician-gynecologists are giving up the practice of obstetrics because of the excessive cost of malpractice insurance and the fear of potential lawsuits. Not health care dollars or insurance dollars but campaign donation dollars. In a 2009 speech to Congress, Obama stated that he "talked to enough doctors to know that defensive medicine may be contributing to unnecessary costs." It is opposed to malpractice tort reform, for obvious reasons, and I suspect that it may have played a significant role in the absence of malpractice liability reform in the Affordable Care Act.
