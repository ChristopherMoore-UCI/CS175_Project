Three others in Pakistan also have been indicted: Khan's daughter Amina Khan, Khan's grandson Alam Zeb and Ali Rehman. The Pakistani Taliban represent a confederation of Taliban groups in northwestern Pakistan, where they are based, said Bill Roggio, military affairs analyst who is managing editor of The Long War Journal. The two men -- Hafiz Khan and his son Izhar Khan -- were arrested Saturday in South Florida, the Justice Department said. The indictment describes a number of occasions when Hafiz Khan transferred money to Pakistan. Hafiz Khan also built a madrassa in Pakistan's Swat Valley that provided shelter for the terrorist group, the indictment states.
