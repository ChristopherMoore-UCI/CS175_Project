But not for lack of effort on their part: Inspired, perhaps, by the crossover appeal of ''Jagger,'' the group has drafted pop kingpins Max Martin, Benny Blanco, and Ryan Tedder — who regularly deal dope beats to Britney, Katy, Usher, et al. — to thoroughly Top 40-ify their game. Thanks to his role as a throne-swiveling talent scout on NBC's hit singing competition The Voice, Maroon 5 frontman Adam Levine is now a stand-alone star — one who seems awfully pleased to see his every move, from the silly beefs with fellow Voice coach Christina Aguilera to the flings with Victoria's Secret models, get street-fliered across the media landscape.
