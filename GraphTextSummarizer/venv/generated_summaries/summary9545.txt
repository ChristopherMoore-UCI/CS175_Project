According to UK government guidelines, humanitarian workers returning from Ebola-affected countries in West Africa who've been at high risk of exposure are expected to monitor their own health for 21 days after they get home. A woman in the Northwest Highlands of Scotland who'd fallen ill tested negative for Ebola, the Scottish government said Tuesday. A spokesman for the government said the woman had been in West Africa recently, though she had no direct contact with anyone with Ebola. British Airways said it was working closely with health authorities in England and Scotland and would help with any information needed. A British volunteer nurse, William Pooley, was successfully treated in the unit after he was brought home from Sierra Leone in August, having been diagnosed with Ebola there.
