The area where search efforts continue has been enlarged to 200 kilometers (125 miles) from the scene, Russian Transport Minister Igor Levitin said at a briefing Friday. All agencies and organizations involved in tourism must be held accountable, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said at a special government meeting Friday devoted to the accident. -- Divers have completed their search of a Russian cruise ship that sank last weekend with the loss of many lives, the Emergency Situations Ministry told CNN Friday. "This means that not only people who rubber-stamp documents, not only scapegoats, but also organizers of cruises must answer," he said, in comments broadcast by Russian state TV. The vessel was built in 1955 in Czechoslovakia, according to Russian law enforcement officials.
