In enforcing community laws, police officers are given a great deal of responsibility, latitude and discretion. When conflict between police and communities of color occurs, the issues of racism, profiling and bias simmer to the surface. I strongly encourage that police and community members meet to dispel and reduce the anxiety and fear that is on both sides. It is unfortunate that there are communities where citizens feel they can no longer trust their local police officers and other law enforcement agents. Police officers do the very best they can in circumstances that are often unpredictable.
