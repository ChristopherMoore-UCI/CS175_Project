But the United States and Britain have shared intelligence since World War II, and Hague said British law "provides for intelligence-gathering that is authorized, necessary, proportionate and targeted -- targeted on what we really need to know. -- British intelligence hasn't broken any laws in sharing data with its American counterparts in counterterrorism efforts, Foreign Secretary William Hague said Sunday. Britain's the Guardian reported Saturday that GCHQ had access to an American data-mining system known as PRISM, suggesting it could "circumvent the formal legal process" required to seek personal data under British law. "The idea that in GCHQ people (British intelligence) are sitting working out how to circumvent a UK law with another agency in another country is fanciful," Hague told the BBC, referring to Britain's communications intelligence agency. Hague didn't confirm or deny whether British intelligence received information from the American programs.
