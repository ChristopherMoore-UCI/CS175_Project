Whereas Bush couldn't name a single mistake -- not, say, letting Osama bin Laden escape from Tora Bora, or refusing to allow weapons inspectors to ascertain that Saddam had no weapons of mass destruction, or backing economic policies that took the greatest budget surplus in American history and turned it into the biggest deficit in history -- Obama has stepped up. ..." Bush then babbled about how he would not have done anything differently in Afghanistan, how Saddam Hussein was a bad guy and how he was confident the truth would come out about weapons of mass destruction (Well, he was right about that.). Midway through his presidency, George W. Bush was asked by the journalist John Dickerson to name his biggest mistake since 9/11 and what he'd learned from it. One of the biggest reasons Barack Obama is president -- and a Nobel Peace Prize winner -- is that he's not George W. Bush. In taking responsibility, Barack Obama did the right thing for our country and his presidency.
