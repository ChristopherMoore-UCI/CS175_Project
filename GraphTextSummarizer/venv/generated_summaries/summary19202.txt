For reasons of campaign finance law (not tax law), public disclosure of donors is required for political organizations but not for social welfare organizations. Many nonprofit groups do not have much income, would not owe much tax, and so tax exemption is not that much of a "benefit." But the extra scrutiny here is less because of tax exemption and more because of other tax benefits that flow from tax-exempt status, such as the ability to receive tax-deductible contributions. Because the IRS is the cop guarding tax-exempt status, we think that the IRS is supposed to be deciding whether a group should be granted the "privilege" of tax exemption. To be clear: Tax exemption here is not much of a privilege and is not the main issue.
