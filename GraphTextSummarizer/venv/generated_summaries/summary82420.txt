A Democratic Underground blog post points out if one were to zoom in and Photoshop one of its own photos of the American flag, which the site purchased from Getty Images, it would look very much like Zimmerman's painting. As of Wednesday, at least a dozen other listings could be found on eBay with their own takes and variations of Zimmerman's posting, including one with the American flag bearing the words, "Not for a coward to hide behind. Photos were added to the auction Tuesday, including one of a grinning, flannel-clad George Zimmerman holding the painting. So it appears to us that Zimmerman found the image on Google and used it as the basis for his painting," Dave Allsopp said in an e-mail. Zimmerman's brother, Robert Zimmerman Jr., says George painted the piece.
