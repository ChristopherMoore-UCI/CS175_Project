On Sunday, "Thor" co-star Idris Elba let it slip in an interview with the UK's Telegraph that he and Tom Hiddleston will appear in next May's "Avengers" sequel. Elba, 42, has played the Asgard guardian Heimdall in both "Thor" and "Thor: The Dark World," while Hiddleston has portrayed Thor's half-brother, Loki. Elba didn't specify much about his role in "Age of Ultron," but he did mention that the two men will have a scene with Chris Hemsworth's hammer-wielding Thor. "I'm doing a scene with Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston, and they're like, 'Aren't you (meant to be) in Ibiza?' " Of course, Elba stuck it out, and now he's the latest star to watch for in "Avengers: Age of Ultron," which is scheduled to open on May 1.
