She's one of the casualties of what the International Rescue Committee is calling a "regional humanitarian disaster," the widespread displacement caused by nearly two years of civil strife and war in Syria. Of those who have had to leave their homes, about 600,000 have fled, mostly to Jordan, Turkey, Lebanon and Iraq, which border Syria. People have embarked on treacherous journeys to safety outside Syria, scurrying from Homs and Hama to Lebanon, Daraa to Jordan, Aleppo and Idlib to Turkey, and Syrian Kurdish neighborhoods to Iraq. "The Middle East is once again facing a human displacement tragedy," the IRC's commission on Syrian refugees said. The IRC, one of the world's major refugee agencies, issued a chilling report Monday about the plight of refugees and internally displaced people.
