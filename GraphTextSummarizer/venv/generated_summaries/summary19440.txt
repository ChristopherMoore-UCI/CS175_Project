Argentinian authorities charged her with leading a ring of fashion models to smuggle cocaine from South America and into Europe, via Cancun. Interpol had issued an arrest warrant against her in December of the previous year after she was connected to a 21-year-old woman who was arrested just before she was to board a flight to Cancun, Mexico, from Buenos Aires carrying 55 kilograms of cocaine (120 pounds). But Sanclemente's career came to a screeching halt in May of 2010 when she was arrested in Argentina and charged with drug trafficking. Moving to Argentina from Mexico, Sanclemente says in retrospect, was a big mistake. "I regret having taken the flight to Argentina, to be honest with you." Sanclemente had expressed regret once before about making the wrong choices.
