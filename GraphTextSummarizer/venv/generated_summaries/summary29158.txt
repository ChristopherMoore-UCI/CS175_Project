-- Texas brewery Austin Beerworks is doing its part to "keep Austin weird" by releasing the first 99-pack of beer to consumers. Because of the overnight success, the brewery is going to produce another run of the 99-packs soon, according to its Facebook page. "Since you can drink it anytime, you're going to want to have more than a few on hand," the brewery said in a video on its website. To celebrate the "anytime" of their Peacemaker Anytime Ale, the craft brewer decided to release the multipack. The packs measure approximately 7 feet long and weigh in at more than 80 pounds.
