The carcass has since washed up on a beach at Scarborough, a suburb of the city of Perth, apparently drawing sharks with it. -- An Australian man who "surfed" a floating whale carcass surrounded by sharks has admitted that he was an "idiot" to attempt the foolhardy feat. "Out on the boat with the boys and one of my mates thought it'd be pretty funny if I surfed the whale, so I just did it," Williams told CNN affiliate Seven Network. There's sharks there! Authorities said they had closed that beach and two others nearby, with sharks sighted in the vicinity.
