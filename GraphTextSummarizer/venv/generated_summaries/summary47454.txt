Prosecutors said Bujol had been in e-mail communication with al-Awlaki, who was killed in a U.S. drone strike in September, and had asked his advice on how to raise money for the "mujahideen" without drawing police attntion. Barry Walter Bujol Jr., a 30-year-old Hempstead, Texas, resident and former student at Prairie View A&M University, had been convicted in November of attempting to provide material support to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, as well as an aggravated identity theft charge. Bujol was arrested with a fraudulent ID card while trying to sneak into the port of Houston, where he planned to stow away aboard an Algerian-bound ship and make his way to Yemen to fight for al Qeda, prosecutors said. Prosecutors said he had been coordinating his plans with a man he thought was a recruiter for AQAP, but who in reality was a confidential source for law enforcement. -- A Texas man convicted of seeking now-deceased Yemeni-based cleric Anwar al-Awlaki's advice about raising money for jihadists has been sentenced to 20 years in prison, federal prosecutors announced Thursday.
