Taliban have been riding mopeds and motorcycles to attack U.S. forces since the beginning of the war in 2001, said Golembesky. Soon after he left the unit in 2010, Golembesky said Marine special ops in Afghanistan began improvising and bringing motorcycles into their weapons arsenal. The Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency has tapped defense contractor Logos Technologies and motorcycle maker BRD to design the motorbike. But Golembesky said Pentagon motorcycle developers should keep this in mind: "The guys on the ground love to keep it simple. " "Whenever you get a bunch of guys together on motorcycles with firepower, it's basically a gang," Golembesky said.
