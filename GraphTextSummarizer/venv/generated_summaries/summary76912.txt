The law gives women no 'right' to abortion as in most Western democracies -- but, if two doctors certify that it's best for her health and well-being and the pregnancy is less than 24 weeks gestation, abortion is a legal option. Even in Northern Ireland, where abortion remains illegal, it's accepted that women travel to the mainland. Women attending the clinic face a gathering of people praying for them to reject abortion. The problem with the protests is this: the protesters oppose abortion in principle -- but their actions are against women who want to consider abortion -- not in principle -- but as a private medical solution to a personal, individual problem. Abortion, as a back up to birth control, is generally seen as regrettable, but a fact of life.
