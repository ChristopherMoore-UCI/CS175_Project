All of them appear to have been heroin users who instead received a mix of heroin and fentanyl, a powerful narcotic used to treat cancer patients' pain, Williams told CNN. Dr. Karl Williams says he normally sees three or four deaths from drug overdoses in a typical week as the chief medical examiner in Pennsylvania's Allegheny County, which includes Pittsburgh. The deaths Williams has recorded are among nearly two dozen in western Pennsylvania linked to a heroin-fentanyl mix, state Attorney General Kathleen Kane said Monday. "This is pretty clearly somebody manufacturing fentanyl and selling it as heroin," Williams said. Williams said fentanyl can be 10-100 times more potent than morphine, the base molecule in heroin, and it's only distributed as a powder when someone is manufacturing it illegally.
