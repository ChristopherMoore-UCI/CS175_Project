"The economy has had clearly a positive impact," said Kurt Hall, the CEO of National CineMedia, about the trend of Sunday theater rentals, "as churches have found it more difficult to raise money to build their own buildings. (And during normal theater hours, church ads are included in the movie previews.) "Lots of pastors give us feedback that they've seen an increase in church attendance because they're in the movie theater," said Hall from National CineMedia, which has created a team of nine people exclusively focused on church-theater relations. -- People steadily file into movie theater No. 4, but they're not carrying buckets of popcorn or soda -- instead, it's Bibles and coffee. "We see this as a long-term strategy." Four of National Community Church's five locations are movie theaters near subway stops, including the Phoenix Movie Theater on the lower level of Union Station.
