This is another driver for inflation because lower rates drive investment. The declining dollar, surging oil prices, and exploding growth across the Persian Gulf are causing inflation levels to rise. But to soften the blow, U.A.E. and Qatar kept rate cuts to a minimum and Saudi Arabia and Oman decided not to budge at all. In Oman, inflation was running at almost 4 per cent and 2.8 percent in Saudi Arabia. This means prices of imports from non-dollar areas have increased, causing inflation.
