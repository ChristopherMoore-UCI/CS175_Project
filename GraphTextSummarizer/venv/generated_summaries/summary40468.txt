At the Santa Clarita Studios in Valencia, California -- about 30 miles north of Los Angeles -- some staffers weren't able to get to work Monday, due to traffic on area roadways and concern about their homes, according to Variety. A number of upscale Los Angeles-area lodgings, including the Peninsula and Four Seasons hotels in Beverly Hills, reported a flurry of bookings, according to Variety. Gibson and Principal, who live in in different areas of Malibu, were both evacuated early Monday morning. Tori Spelling and Dean McDermott's newly renovated bed and breakfast, Chateau La Rue, in Fallbrook, California, about 100 miles southeast of Los Angeles, was also affected. The two were in Los Angeles to support Spelling's former "Beverly Hills 90210" castmate Jennie Garth on "Dancing With the Stars." Malibu, one of the areas most directly affected by the fires, is the home of a number of celebrities, including Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson, Mel Gibson, Jennifer Aniston, Victoria Principal and Sting.
