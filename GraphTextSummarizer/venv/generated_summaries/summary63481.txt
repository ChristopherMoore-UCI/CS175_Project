At first glance, the UAE seems ill-suited to ice hockey. "I feel so proud, so proud to be representing the country," says Mohamed Aref Al Jachi, a founding member of the UAE's national ice hockey team. For many of the players, ice hockey is, at the moment, a side hobby. Despite the country's many disadvantages in championing the cold-weather sport, in 2010 the UAE became the first Arab nation to play in an International Ice Hockey Federation world championship. "It will take time to teach," admits Lee Becker, the team's equipment manager, who hails from Canada.
