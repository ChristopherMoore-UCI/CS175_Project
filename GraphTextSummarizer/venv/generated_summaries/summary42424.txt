After hours of heavy fighting, Kurdish fighters in Iraq have repelled an assault by ISIS fighters southwest of Irbil, Kurdish officials said. Kurdish commanders say ISIS fighters had threatened to overrun Kurdish defensive positions in the area for a while, and the two sides were so close that airstrikes were not possible. Kurdish fighters battle equipment woes as well as ISIS in northern Iraq Kurdish officials said they were concerned ISIS fighters would break through their lines. A CNN team was in the area less than two weeks ago and was told by fighters at the front that ISIS was making almost daily attempts to infiltrate through Kurdish lines, which are strung out along a stretch of the River Zab. The commanders said about 40 ISIS fighters were killed, and Kurdish forces suffered several casualties.
