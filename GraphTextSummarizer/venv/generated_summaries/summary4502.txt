Video: Peter Travers Reviews Fright Night in "At the Movies With Peter Travers" Jerry can do his undead nasty on Charley's buddy (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) and glamour Charley's girl (Imogen Poots) and still tickle you with terror. He's hot stuff as a vampire named Jerry (really) who moves next door to teenage Charley (Anton Yelchin) and his single mom (Toni Collette). So is David Tennant ("Doctor Who") as Peter Vincent, a tacky Vegas magician Charley enlists to kill Jerry. But the combo clicked in 1985's "Fright Night" (banish the 1988 sequel), and it clicks again in this frisky 3D remake. For that, bow to Colin Farrell.
