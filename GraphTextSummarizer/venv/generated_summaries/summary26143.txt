Halep was winning her third title, but victory from a draw which included Australian Open champion Li Na, was by far the biggest of her career. The Buenos Aires title went to clay court specialist David Ferrer as he beat Fabio Fognini of Italy 6-3 6-4 in the final. On the ATP Tour, Czech Tomas Berdych claimed his first title for 16 months with a 6-4 6-2 victory over Marin Cilic of Croatia in the final. The 22-year-old thrashed sixth seed Angelique Kerber of Germany 6-2 6-3 in just 66 minutes in the final and will rise to ninth in the new world rankings this week. Despite her impressive recent form, Halep did not think she would win the tournament at the start of week.
