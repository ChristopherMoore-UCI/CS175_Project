She is expected to hold a news conference Tuesday to talk about what she calls "political interference in recent EPA decisions" and discuss "apparent contradictions between the sworn testimony" of Johnson and accounts given by other sworn witnesses. The committee's chairman, Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, has asked the inspector general's office to assess the administration's claims of executive privilege as it tries to keep documents related to EPA decisions from Congress. "This cooperation includes providing the OIG full and unrestricted access to EPA documents, records, and personnel," the statement read. Robbi Farrell, chief of staff of the EPA's compliance assurance division, sent the e-mail to 11 managers in the department. "A senior staffer in the enforcement office sent out an e-mail to simply help her office efficiently respond to requests from the press, GAO and EPA's inspector general," Smith told CNN.
