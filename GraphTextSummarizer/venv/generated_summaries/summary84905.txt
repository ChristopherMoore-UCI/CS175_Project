The DOE's decision to terminate the Yucca Mountain program "was made for policy reasons, not technical or safety reasons," the GAO report says. DOE officials believe "there are better solutions that can achieve a broader national consensus to the nation's spent fuel and nuclear waste storage needs than Yucca Mountain," the GAO said. Yucca Mountain -- 100 miles northwest of Las Vegas, Nevada -- was to be the solution to the nuclear waste problem: a final destination for the tons of hazardous nuclear waste accumulating at commercial reactors in 33 states. "The loss of staff with experience at Yucca Mountain could hinder the license review if the process is resumed," the GAO said. The DOE undertook "extensive efforts to preserve data related to its licensing efforts, as well as other scientific information relevant to the storage and disposal of high-level waste and spent nuclear fuel," the GAO said.
