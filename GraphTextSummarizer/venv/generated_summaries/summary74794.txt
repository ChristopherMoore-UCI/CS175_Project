The new Roman Catholic archbishop of Seattle, J. Peter Sartain, was installed Wednesday afternoon with a Mass in the archdiocese's cathedral, amid ongoing controversy over Sartain's ordination of a priest who later pleaded guilty in a molestation case. Sartain replaces Archbishop Alex J. Brunett, 75, who retired last year. "A final word of thanks goes to my friend, Archbishop Brunett," Sartain said, whose remarks drew supportive applause. SNAP describes itself as the world's oldest and largest support group for clergy abuse victims, and the group is asking the church and Illinois prosecutors to provide more information about Sartain's handling of allegations surrounding Flores. For many years to come, we will love our Lord," Sartain told attendees.
