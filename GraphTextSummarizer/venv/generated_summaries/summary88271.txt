Estonia caused a surprise by reaching the playoffs after taking second place in Group C behind Italy, meaning 2010 World Cup qualifiers Serbia and Slovenia missed out. Montenegro, competing for the first time as an independent nation, will also have to overhaul a deficit at home after losing 2-0 in Prague to the Czech Republic -- who finished runners-up on debut in 1996 after the split with Slovakia. The most evenly-poised tie is in Lisbon, where 2004 hosts Portugal take on Bosnia-Herzegovina following Friday's 0-0 draw in Zenica. Ten countries have already qualified, along with co-hosts Poland and Ukraine, for the four-yearly tournament taking place in June and July. World champions Spain will defend their European title, having qualified as group winners along with Germany, Russia, France, the Netherlands, Greece, England and Denmark.
