They are charged with 11 felony counts each in the shooting deaths of 40-year-old Ildiko Freitas and her parents, 69-year-old Janos Volgyesi and 70-year-old Hildegard Volgyesi. According to Patterson's affidavit, Hammer said that Freitas was shot in the head during an argument with Vanpelt over the car. Vanpelt told Patterson that he shot Janos Volgyesi in the back twice, according to the affidavit. "This is nothing short of cold blooded murder," Park County Sheriff Scott A. Steward said in a weekend statement after the two were arrested. Hammer admitted to shooting Hildegard Volgyesi in the basement because she "surprised " him, according to the affidavit.
