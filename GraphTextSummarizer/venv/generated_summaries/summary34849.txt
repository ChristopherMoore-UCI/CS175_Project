Indeed, when it looked like Dimitrov would force a fifth set, the match resembled last year's Wimbledon semifinal between Djokovic and Juan Martin del Potro. On one occasion, Dimitrov and Djokovic took a tumble at almost the same time and faced each other close to the net, much to the crowd's delight. The silky smooth Federer had no such problems with his footing, his court positioning further up than Djokovic and Dimitrov. Staring at a break point at 3-3, Djokovic didn't hit his backhand down the line cleanly, but it went over the net and gave the speedy Dimitrov no chance. "I don't want to sound like I'm not appreciating to play finals of a grand slam," said Djokovic.
