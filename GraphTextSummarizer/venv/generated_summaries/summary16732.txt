Here are some important dates in WDW history: October 1, 1971: Nearly five years after the death of Walt Disney, the resort bearing his name officially opens in an area that used to be swampland, with Magic Kingdom theme park attractions like "It's a Small World," the Haunted Mansion, the Country Bear Jamboree and the Mad Tea Party. For hard-core fans like Corless, Walt Disney World history Walt Disney's vision of the future, EPCOT Center (consisting of Future World and World Showcase), opens with attractions such as Spaceship Earth, The Land's Kitchen Kabaret and World of Motion. New Fantasyland, an expansion of the area in Magic Kingdom, is set to open, replacing Snow White's Scary Adventures with a Seven Dwarfs-themed mine ride, and adding a new version of Dumbo the Flying Elephant, as well as the Beast's castle from "Beauty and the Beast." -- Thomas Corless has been to Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida, 101 times.
