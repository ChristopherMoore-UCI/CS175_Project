"Metallica Through the Never" was directed by Nimrod Antal ("Predators") and intersperses live Metallica concert footage with a fictional narrative about a young roadie named Trip who is sent on a mission during the show. Following the panel, Metallica played the 1,500-capacity venue Spreckels, performing crowd pleasers like "Seek and Destroy," "Enter Sandman" and even the "Star Wars" theme and "Darth Vader's Imperial March." Although the focus for the band is on promoting the film, they are slowly still working on a new album as well, which would be Metallica's first since 2008's "Death Magnetic." Hetfield hinted during the panel that Metallica may eventually bring that stage setup on tour. The front man wouldn't elaborate on the plot any further, but did say that a lot of thought went into creating the exact right film for Metallica.
