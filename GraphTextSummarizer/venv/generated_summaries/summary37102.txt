It can be challenging for any series to go up against the Olympics, Simon said, but "there is the possibility that if there's not compelling storylines for the Olympics, there are some real interesting shows out there (for people to watch). In total, 211 million viewers in the U.S. tuned in to the 2008 Beijing Olympics (with about 27 million people tuning in each day), making it the most-viewed TV event to date, according to Nielsen Media Research. "So You Think You Can Dance" -- not to mention scripted cable dramas such as "Burn Notice" and "The Closer" that often pull in up to 6 million viewers -- other networks could likely draw a substantial audience during the Olympics. "One of TV's first great reality shows," the Olympics used to be one of the few original programs to air during the summer, said Ron Simon, a curator at the Paley Center for Media. Between viewers' fascination with Beijing, the "magical" opening ceremony and compelling personal storylines, the 2008 games had a lot going for it, Simon said.
