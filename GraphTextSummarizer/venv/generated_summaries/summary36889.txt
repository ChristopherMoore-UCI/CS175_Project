Al Quntar is "engaging in unacceptable behavior by seeking to foment, justify or glorify terrorist violence" in order to provoke terrorist acts, the Home Office said. "How could they put Michael Savage in the same league as mass murderers when I have never avowed violence?" Outspoken Kansas Rev. Fred Phelps and his daughter, Shirley Phelps-Roper, are also listed for "engaging in unacceptable behavior and fostering hatred." Phelps and his followers at Westboro Baptist Church oppose homosexuality. Savage is on the list for "seeking to provoke others to serious criminal acts and fostering hatred which might lead to inter-community violence. Eric Gliebe, chairman of the National Alliance, one of the largest neo-Nazi groups in the United States, is on the list for "justifying terrorist violence, provoking others to commit serious crime and fostering racial hatred." Britain's Home Office said it decided to exclude the 22 in the last several months.
