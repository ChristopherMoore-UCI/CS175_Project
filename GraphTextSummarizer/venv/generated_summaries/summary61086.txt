Twitter has experimented with a service that would send links to news articles to users privately. Twitter users can now let any person, company or, presumably, drunken green monster send them private messages on the site. In addition to allowing brands to send personal messages, or receive them, the new feature could be used by media sites to send news alerts. Until now, people could send private messages on Twitter to people who follow them but not to others. Early observations Tuesday of the change, which Twitter has not acknowledged publicly, were focusing on the potential upsides and downsides.
