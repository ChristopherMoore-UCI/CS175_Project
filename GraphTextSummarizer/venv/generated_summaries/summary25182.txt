-- Federal authorities on Friday arrested a man on a weapons charge as he was being released from a Los Angeles County jail a day after he pleaded guilty in the 2011 brutal beating of a Giants fan at Dodgers Stadium and received credit for time served. Norwood was sentenced Thursday to four years in prison immediately after pleading guilty to felony assault by means likely to produce great bodily injury. A co-defendant, Louie Sanchez, 31, also pleaded guilty Thursday to felony mayhem and was sentenced to eight years in prison. Sanchez also faces the same federal charge, said Thom Mrozek, spokesman for federal prosecutors in Los Angeles. In exchange for the guilty pleas, prosecutors dropped other felony charges.
