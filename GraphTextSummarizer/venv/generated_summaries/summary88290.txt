The seven-member Ibrahim Prize Committee is chaired by Salim, the former Prime Minister of Tanzania, and includes global figures such as Graca Machel, wife of Nelson Mandela, and Mary Robinson, former president of Ireland and former U.N. high commissioner for human rights. "The Prize Committee has been greatly impressed by President Pedro Pires's vision in transforming Cape Verde into a model of democracy, stability and increased prosperity," said committee chairman Salim Ahmed Salim. -- A $5 million prize for excellence in African leadership was awarded to former Cape Verde President Pedro Verona Pires in London on Monday. Under Pires' presidency, Cape Verde became the second African country to graduate from the United Nations' list of least developed countries. Previous winners of the award include Botswana ex-President Festus Mogae in 2008 and Mozambique ex-President Joaquim Chissano in 2007.
