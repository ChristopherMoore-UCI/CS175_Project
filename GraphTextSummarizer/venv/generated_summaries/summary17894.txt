CNN: Banksy still hiding in plain sight "Banksy neither produces or profits from the sale of greeting cards, mugs or photo canvases of his work," the site reads. The seller also says that eBay had previously terminated his auction because he was selling an intangible good; the seller is now technically offering for auction a piece of paper containing Banksy's legal name. (Mashable)  -- UK artist Banksy, he of the guerilla techniques and ever-increasing popularity, is about to be unceremoniously identified to the highest bidder in an eBay auction, which ends Wednesday. The party offering Banksy's identity is hardly a power seller, having a fairly sparse but mostly positive record that dates back to 2001. Would you want to know Banksy's identity, or do you think he deserves to live privately and relatively anonymously?
