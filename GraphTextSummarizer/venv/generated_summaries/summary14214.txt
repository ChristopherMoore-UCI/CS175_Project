This week, Maggie and Eli's father, Dr. Tim Jacks, wrote a blog post in which he expressed his feelings to this family. We spoke to Anna Jacks in person because blood tests show she has complete immunity to measles. According to Arizona health officials, the woman at the clinic who put the Jacks children in danger was herself infected by members of a family that doesn't vaccinate and got measles during a visit to Disneyland, where the outbreak began more than a month ago. Out of an abundance of caution we also chose not to meet with Maggie or with Tim Jacks, who has limited immunity to measles. At 10 months old, Eli is too young to get vaccinated and would be especially vulnerable to serious complications of measles, such as deafness and brain damage or even death.
