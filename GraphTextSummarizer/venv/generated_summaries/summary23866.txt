Others who have expressed interest include boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr., ranked by Forbes as one of the highest-paid athletes in the world; former boxing champion Oscar De La Hoya; rapper-producer-entrepreneurs Sean "Diddy" Combs and Dr. Dre; rapper Rick Ross; Rick Caruso, real estate developer and Los Angeles civic leader; and actors Matt Damon, Whoppi Goldberg and Frankie Muniz. -- As new celebrities line up to buy the Los Angeles Clippers, a group of NBA owners will meet by conference call Thursday to talk about what happens next in the uproar surrounding team owner, Donald Sterling. When he abruptly moved the team from San Diego to Los Angeles in 1984 without league permission, the NBA fined him $25 million, but Sterling countersued. Sterling could be forced to sell his team if three-quarters of the owners of the 30 NBA teams agree, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said. The 10-member NBA owners' advisory and finance committee may discuss this question: What will happen if Sterling refuses a league directive to sell the Clippers?
