Toure says Africa 2.0, which will hold its next symposium in Nigeria next year, is not just another initiative that's hung up on endless discussions. Survey: Africa attractive to investors -- but the world still needs convincing World Bank economist Vera Songwe says the initiative is bringing together young Africans who want their continent to achieve growth and are interested in spreading the message that "Africa is a different place to do business." A diverse group of young emerging leaders from all across Africa and the diaspora has come together to promote a unified vision for the continent and devise ways to move it forward. Toure calls Africa 2.0 a social contract between the private sector, civil society and governments. The move comes as Africa undergoes a period of economic transformation, becoming increasingly attractive to international investors -- last year, the continent's economy grew by nearly 5% while six of the 10 fastest-growing economies in the world are currently from Africa.
