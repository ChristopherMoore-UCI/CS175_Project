Algeria and Libya are the final destinations for some travelers, while others seek to reach Europe, said Laura Lungarotti, migrant assistance regional specialist in the organization's west and central Africa office in Senegal. Niger's desert north has become a major transit area for migrants, according to the International Organization for Migration, and many people smugglers operate there. A recent study by the migrant organization found that the majority of migrants are men, although there are growing numbers of unaccompanied minors, she said. -- The government in Niger has declared three days of national mourning for 92 migrants who died from dehydration after their vehicles broke down in the Sahara desert, state media said Friday. Part of the problem is that many would-be migrants are stopped by Algerian or Libyan authorities and are expelled back over the border into Niger's desert, Lungarotti said.
