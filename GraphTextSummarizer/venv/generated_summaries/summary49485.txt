"Major Crimes" is engineered to be as sober as Raydor's dark horn-rim glasses, whereas "The Closer" was as bright and lively as Johnson's trench coats and candy wrappers. Over the years, "The Closer" had become a light-comedy crime show with heavy-handed humor performed not just by Sedgwick but also the supporting cast that has migrated over to "Major Crimes," especially G.W. Bailey, whose slow burns have become endless fuming, and, only by contrast to a lesser extent, Tony Denison, Michael Paul Chan, Raymond Cruz, and Phillip P. Keene. gig In previous guest-star turns, McDonnell's Captain Sharon Raydor has clashed with Johnson and her crew, with her maddeningly (to them) methodical, by-the-book manner. "The Closer" series finale brought closure to Deputy Chief Johnson's career, as she faced off with her long-running arch-nemesis, the serial rapist Philip Stroh (Billy Burke). Then Johnson abruptly accepted a new job (something like chief of bureau of investigations L.A. liason officer in the D.A.'s office -- it sounded like the longest-titled cushy job possible) and lit out, munching a signature bit of junk food.
