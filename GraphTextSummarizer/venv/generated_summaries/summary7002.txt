Coalition airstrikes again pounded ISIS positions in Iraq and Syria on Saturday, including at least a dozen strikes on Mosul, where anti-ISIS forces have been trying to weaken targets ahead of an anticipated fight to wrest Iraq's second largest city from the terror group. ISIS defenses in Mosul could be trigger for U.S. ground troop recommendation Airstrikes also hit ISIS targets near the terror group's de facto capital of Raqqa, Syria, on Saturday, anti-ISIS activists there said. Kurdish forces, which protect a Kurdish autonomous region in northern Iraq, recently have been trying to surround Mosul to cut off ISIS's lines of supply from Syria, setting up what could be an eventual assault to try to expel the terror group from the city. As the coalition's struggle against ISIS continued in northern Iraq, a pair of suicide bombings on Saturday killed at least three dozen people hundreds of kilometers to the south in Iraq's capital, Baghdad, a police source in the city said. U.S. and coalition aircraft conducted 11 airstrikes over Syria and 15 airstrikes over Iraq from 8 a.m. Friday to 8 a.m. Saturday, the U.S. military said.
