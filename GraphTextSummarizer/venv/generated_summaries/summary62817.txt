-- Family, friends, colleagues and fans have been paying tribute to the author, archaeologist and former CNN journalist Paul Sussman, who has died suddenly. On his website he described how after graduating with a history degree from Cambridge University which he represented at boxing, he almost entered Britain's MI6 spy service, then worked as a gravedigger in France, sold cigars in Harrod's and toured Europe acting as Aunt Sponge in a "ground-breakingly execrable production of 'James and the Giant Peach.'" On his return to London, Sussman worked in the advertising department of the Big Issue, a magazine and charity founded to help homeless people. Sussman, who lived in London with his wife Alicky and their two children, Jude and Ezra, had just completed the fourth in a series of novels, based around the exploits of a gritty detective from Cairo, which had been translated into 33 languages and sold two million copies.

His wife, a documentary maker, on Sunday announced Sussman's death from a ruptured aneurysm, adding: "He was a truly unique person - a brilliant Dad and adored husband.
