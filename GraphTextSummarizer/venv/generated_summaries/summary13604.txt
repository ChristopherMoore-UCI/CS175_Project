Another longtime FBI source said up to 80 percent of Fai's public statements are provided by Pakistan's powerful Inter-Services Intelligence agency "to repeat and disseminate verbatim," the document states. The charges specifically link Pakistani funds to two 2004 contributions -- one by Ahmad and one by his nephew as a "straw donor" -- to members of Congress identified only as elected officials A and B. Based on FEC records, "Elected Official A" appears to be GOP Rep. Joe Pitts of Pennsylvania, who received a $2,000 contribution from Ahmad on the date mentioned in the affidavit. Federal campaign contribution records show Fai and Ahmad, also a U.S. citizen, contributed to a number of members of Congress between 1998 and 2008. "For as long as I've known him, Dr. Fai has been either a permanent legal resident of the United States or a citizen and as such, any political contributions I may have received from Dr. Fai over the years are completely legal," Burton said. The KAC director, Syed Ghulam Nabi Fai, "acted at the direction and with the financial support of the government of Pakistan for more than 20 years," an FBI arrest affidavit states.
