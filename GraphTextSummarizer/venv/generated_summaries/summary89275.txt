Many conservatives, upset with what they saw as the morally ambiguous, anti-military tenor of such recent Iraq War films as the Matt Damon thriller "Green Zone," have hailed "American Sniper" as a tribute to an American patriot. While characters in other recent combat movies such as "Zero Dark Thirty" have been loosely based on actual people, "American Sniper" is based on a firsthand account by a Navy SEAL who served four tours in Iraq. "American Sniper," Clint Eastwood's film about Navy SEAL marksman Chris Kyle, stunned just about everyone by earning $107 million over its first weekend in wide release -- an unprecedented haul for a downbeat, R-rated drama released in the middle of winter. It's a human story, not a political one "American Sniper" has no grandstanding politicians or speeches about the folly of war. But Oscar love doesn't always translate to popular success -- "The Hurt Locker," the 2009 best picture winner about a U.S. Army bomb-disposal team in Iraq, earned only $17 million in North America over its entire run.
