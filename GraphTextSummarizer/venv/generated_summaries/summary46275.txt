"I reminded her that she had actually opened the CNN London bureau, our new London offices, back in 2001 and she had a broad smile when I reminded her of that," Amanpour said. Amanpour received a CBE, or Commander in the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire, "for services to journalism." Amanpour said she is especially proud that the award simply recognizes her work in journalism. Amanpour has said she shares the honor with colleagues and friends who believe in the same kind of journalism, as well as those who have died or been hurt reporting from the front lines. The queen bestowed the honor on Amanpour, CNN's chief international correspondent, at a ceremony in the ballroom at Buckingham Palace, London.
