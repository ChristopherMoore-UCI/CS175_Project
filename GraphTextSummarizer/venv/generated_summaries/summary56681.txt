The depression -- the 18th of the 2011 Atlantic hurricane season -- was located off the Nicaragua/Honduras border late Sunday afternoon, forecasters said. A tropical storm watch means tropical storm conditions, including sustained winds of at least 39 mph, are possible within 48 hours. The depression is expected to dump 2 to 4 inches of rain over eastern Honduras, with isolated maximum amounts of 7 inches possible in some spots, according to the center. The depression's maximum sustained winds were at 35 mph, just shy of tropical storm strength, forecasters said. -- A tropical depression formed in the western Caribbean Sea on Sunday, and is likely to become Tropical Storm Rina as it skirts the Honduran coastline
