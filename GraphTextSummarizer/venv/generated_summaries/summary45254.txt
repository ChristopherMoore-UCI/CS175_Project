Manjon, whose son was among the 191 people killed in the 2004 attacks, attended a memorial with union leaders at Madrid's Atocha train station. Protester Rafael Serrano Rodriguez carried a poster showing scissors as he walked through Madrid Sunday, saying he opposed government pension cutbacks. -- Union protesters marched across Spain Sunday as mourners marked the eighth anniversary of the Madrid train bombings. Government officials have argued that the measures will reduce unemployment and give workers more rights, such as an annual 20-hour paid leave for training. Spain's two main unions -- the Socialist-leaning General Workers Union (UGT) and the Communist-leaning Workers Commissions (CCOO) -- said they scheduled the demonstrations on the symbolic day to protest against the new conservative government's labor reforms, which unions say make it cheaper and easier to fire workers.
