-- Senegal President Abdoulaye Wade called rival Macky Sall to concede Sunday's runoff election, which Sall hailed as a "victory of the Senegalese people," state media reported. In the first round of voting last month, Wade was booed by much of one crowd at a polling place in Dakar. Sunday night, Sall's supporters gathered at the candidate's headquarters in Dakar, cheering and dancing to hip-hop songs in the streets. Protesters calling for Wade's ouster have clashed on the streets in recent months. The two survived a field of 14 candidates during the February 27 election, with Wade receiving 32% of the vote and Sall getting 25%.
