"In truth, he does not act with full authority as president of the Republic of Yemen, but in the future, he will practice his full authority," Ahmer said. "The general public in Yemen is seeking a transfer of power to the vice president," Gen. Ali Mohsen al-Ahmer said in an exclusive interview with CNN. According to Ahmer, Hadi can make significant changes in Yemen even though he holds the title of acting president. Vice President Abdu Rabu Mansoor Hadi is the acting leader of Yemen in the absence of Saleh, who was wounded in a June 3 assassination attempt and is getting treatment in Saudi Arabia. In recent weeks, government troops have battled both anti-government tribal forces and Islamic militants, including al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.
