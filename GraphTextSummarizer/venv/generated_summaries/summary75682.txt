Winslow told police he was parked outside the Sandy Springs Funhouse, a north Atlanta "family fun center," waiting for Bieber to emerge Tuesday afternoon when Hesny told him to leave. Bieber failed a series of sobriety tests, including "horizontal gaze," "Romberg balance," "walk and turn," "finger to nose" and "one-leg stand" tests, the Miami Beach police report said. Video of Bieber undergoing a sobriety test inside a Miami Beach police station on January 23 was released to the media Wednesday. "Less than an ounce of suspected marijuana and two large glass smoking pipes containing suspected marijuana residue were found inside the vehicle," the investigation report by a Sandy Springs, Georgia, police officer said. The driver, who was arrested but later released without charges, told police that he was just a driver and knew not to ask his client questions, the arrest report said.
