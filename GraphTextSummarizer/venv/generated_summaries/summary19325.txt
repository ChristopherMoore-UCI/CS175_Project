The game's largest prize to date was $365 million, which was awarded in 2006 to a group of eight co-workers at a Nebraska meat-packing plant. At $320 million, the Powerball pot still has ways to go to catch MegaMillions at the top of the list of U.S. grand prizes. White bought the winning ticket in February in Newport, Rhode Island, after a family member had a craving for rainbow sherbet and brought her to a store where she purchased the ticket. In January, the price increased to $2, with officials saying it would lead to an increased number of large jackpots. Earlier this year, Louise White, an 81-year-old Rhode Island resident, came forward as the winner of a $336.4 million prize, the third largest in the game's history.
