Much like his pet project, the King Abdullah University for Science and Technology -- a coeducational graduate level institution aimed at preparing Saudis to compete in the global economy -- Abdullah's initiatives to empower Saudi women roiled conservative elements, who continue to view any change as inherently destructive. The Saudis have apparently also agreed to train "moderate" Syrian fighters on Saudi soil -- an uncharacteristically forceful and public intensification of its involvement in the Syrian crisis. But many Saudis are likely to think of him as the king who tried to dispel any lingering doubts about the validity of the narrative around which the state was founded: The idea of a Saudi "nation" and its concomitant notion of a unifying Saudi identity. Despite what some considered his "weak" familial ties within the royal family, Abdullah's popularity among Saudis seemed to have been rooted in his realization that the monarch's most important base of support going forward must be the Saudi populace at large. Abdullah convinced many Saudis that they are not merely passive observers but rather stakeholders in a still-ongoing nation-building endeavor.
