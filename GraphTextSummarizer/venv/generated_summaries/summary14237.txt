We are working with disability advocates to incorporate the needs of people with disabilities into emergency communications and public alert systems, evacuations, transportation and medical equipment supply plans. We are improving our disaster housing strategies to ensure that people with disabilities have access to general shelters and temporary housing that meet their needs and to ease their transitions back into the community. But despite her repeated calls to the local transportation system that served people with disabilities, as well as to 911, help never arrived. For years, our nation's emergency management community simply has not done a good enough job planning for and meeting the needs of people with disabilities. Last month, these issues were again highlighted by lawmakers during a congressional hearing at which questions were raised about whether enough funds are being committed to ensure the safety of people with disabilities.
