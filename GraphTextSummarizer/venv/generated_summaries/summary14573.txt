U.S. Marshals joined the search after Harris County authorities determined that Tata had left the Houston area. -- The owner of a Houston day care where four small children perished in a fire will face four counts of murder in those deaths, court records showed Thursday. Tata, who has dual citizenship in the United States and Nigeria, fled to the African nation shortly after the fatal fire at her Houston home in February. After waiving her extradition rights during an appearance in magistrate court, Tata was transported to the Harris County Jail in Texas. Tata's first stop on her return to the United States was Atlanta, where she was booked into the Fulton County Jail.
