The legal wrangling began in April 2011, when Apple launched a lawsuit accusing the South Korean company of "slavishly" copying the interface and design of the iPhone and iPad in Galaxy smartphones and tablets. Apple's sales of 35.1 million iPhones in the first quarter helped lead the company to double first quarter profits, while Nokia's 11.9 million sales January through March was almost half as many as the Finnish firm sold during the same period last year, eroding its smartphone market share to 8.2% from 23.5% in 2011. The record figure -- a 79% rise from a year earlier -- follows a remarkable first quarter performance, which saw the South Korean technology giant overtake rivals Apple and Nokia as the world's biggest phone vendor with 44.5 million handsets sold. Last week, a U.S. judge suspended sales of Samsung's Galaxy Nexus smartphone just days after issuing a similar ruling against its new Galaxy Tab 10.1 tablet computer. In May, Samsung released its new Galaxy S III phone in Europe and has seen brisk sales, which are expected to top 10 million units in July, according to the company's telecoms chief JK Shin.
