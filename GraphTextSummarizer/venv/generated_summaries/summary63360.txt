One bodyguard returned fire in the apparent direction of the shot but had to retreat into the building after coming under further fire from the assassin, the committee said. He was involved in gambling, drug trafficking, illegal arms sales and extraction of mineral resources, it said, and controlled organized crime groups in Moscow and across the country. -- Russian investigators were hunting Thursday for the assassin of a reputed Russian mafia kingpin who was fatally shot by a sniper outside a restaurant in central Moscow. Investigators later found the spot where the killer had waited to take aim, the committee said -- a stairway between the fifth and sixth floors of a nearby building.
