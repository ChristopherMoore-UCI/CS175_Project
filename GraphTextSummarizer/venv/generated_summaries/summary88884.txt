The Derby favorite could just as easily have been called Lucky at Love or Big Chapter but Coburn's pick, California Chrome -- a nod to the white markings that are called chrome by horse racing aficionados -- proved the selection. His recent run of success -- four wins in his last four outings -- has marked California Chrome out as a pre-race favorite for the Kentucky Derby -- the first race in horse racing's coveted Triple Crown, which also includes the Preakness Stakes and the Belmont Stakes -- in the chase for a purse of $2m. Understandably, the horse's value has rocketed, and is now estimated to be around $12m. Coburn and Martin were recently offered $6m for a controlling 51% stake in the horse, which they turned down. His neighbours at Los Alamitos racecourse in Orange County are predominantly quarter horses, named for the quarter mile horse races that are regularly held at the track where California Chrome is exercised at 7.30 am every morning. It could have been a case of first time lucky as their offspring has earned Coburn and Perry more than $1 million in prize money and chalked up illustrious wins at the Santa Anita Derby, San Felipe Stakes and California Cup Derby. If California Chrome wins the Derby he will also become the first California-trained horse to win since Decidedly's success in 1962.
