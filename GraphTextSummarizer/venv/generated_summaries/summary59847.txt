The forecast was unwelcome news for waterlogged Vermont and northern New York, which could receive another 1 to 3 inches of rain with up to 4 inches possible in some spots by Wednesday night. -- The remnants of Tropical Storm Lee settled in over the mid-Atlantic and Northeast on Wednesday, prompting warnings of heavy rain and flash flooding in areas from Washington up to western New England, the National Hurricane Center said. Some eye-popping storm rainfall totals in the Northeast were recorded through 5 p.m. Wednesday in Becket, Massachusetts (8.11 inches); Rockaway, New Jersey (8.43); Phillipsburg, New Jersey (7.9); and Forks, Bethlehem and Dover, Pennsylvania (just over 7 inches). Lee left at least four people dead as it crossed the Southeast, dumping as much as 12 to 15 inches of rain in many places. Earlier Wednesday, the storm caused a series of air traffic delays across the Northeast.
