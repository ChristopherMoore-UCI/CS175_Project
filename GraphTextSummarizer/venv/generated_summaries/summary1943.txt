Residents said the anti-government sentiment is only growing, even after the razing of homes and intimidation of residents. -- Syrian forces are uprooting thousands of people and then demolishing their homes in part of a flashpoint city that has been the center of an anti-government rebellion, according to residents there. Once again, Hama is a stronghold of anti-government activists who have roiled the country for the past 18 months. "So far they have razed 120 buildings," Osamah, a Hama resident who visited the neighborhood on Sunday, told CNN. "The government wants to deny the activists popular support through leveling Meshaa Alarbaeen," Osamah said.
