Desmond Tutu has labelled Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe a "Frankenstein for his people" International military action against Mugabe's regime, however, is unlikely, said Australian Foreign Minister Stephen Smith. Speaking to CNN on Tuesday from the Dutch Embassy in Harare, where he has been granted refuge since Sunday, he said, "This is total war and we cannot be part of that war. " Mugabe's government has denied responsibility for the violence in Zimbabwe, instead blaming supporters of Tsvangirai's own Movement for Democratic Change party. But international military action against Zimbabwe's regime is unlikely, Australian Foreign Minister Stephen Smith told reporters. " Mugabe, 84, has been Zimbabwe's only leader since it gained independence from Britain in 1980.
