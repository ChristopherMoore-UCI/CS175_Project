-- Slathered in a thick coat of sunscreen, Australian endurance swimmer Chloe McCardel leapt into the waters off Havana on Wednesday in her bid to swim the Straits of Florida. McCardel said she thinks her greatest advantage will be a team of scientists who have studied the lessons of previous failed attempts and will be in constant touch with people on the boats accompanying her, supplying weather and ocean current updates. " Despite the technology and people assisting her, McCardel will ultimately be alone with her thoughts in the water as she struggles for hour after hour to reach the Florida Keys. But McCardel, who has completed six solo crossings of the English Channel, said she doesn't think water temperature will be a major factor. McCardel said she would use "a shark shield" device that emits an electromagnetic pulse to keep away hungry predators.
