But the people of San Bruno have changed, according to local police officer Scott Rogge. Off-duty firefighters and police officers who went to schools with their children and families soon learned something horrible had happened in a San Bruno residential neighborhood. South San Francisco firefighter Anthony Ottoboni was at his son's baseball practice when he got the news. "Thank God to the people and citizens of San Bruno who stepped up to provide assistance to me," Guldner said. "We got as close to the flame as we possibly can without getting ourselves burned," said Officer Ken Chetcuti of the South San Francisco Police.
