Advancement Project's report points to three different types of efforts in 23 states that it says will impact eligible Latino voters: efforts to purge rolls of non-citizen voters, proof of citizenship requirements for voter registration and photo ID laws. Campaigns battle over narrow groups of voters It is difficult to calculate exactly how many Latinos could be affected, Katherine Culliton-Gonzalez, director of voter protection for Advancement Project, told reporters in a conference call Monday. The organization has been involved in a number of legal challenges to recent state voting measures, including a high-profile case over Pennsylvania's controversial voter ID law, which requires voters to present a state-issued photo ID. Based on U.S. Census population data of eligible Latino voters in the 23 states with what Advancement Project calls "voter suppression policies," she said, the organization estimates that obstacles could deter or prevent more than 10 million Latino citizens from registering and voting in the 2012 elections. But Marin said voter ID laws were a positive step.
