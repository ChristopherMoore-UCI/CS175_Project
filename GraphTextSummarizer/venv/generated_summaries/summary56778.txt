"I got to be physical with some of the hottest guys in Hollywood," Carano, who tussles with Channing Tatum, Ewan McGregor and Michael Fassbender in the film, told PEOPLE at the BlackBerry-sponsored Cinema Society screening this week. Carano has officially retired from MMA but says she hasn't ruled out a return. " But Tatum, whom she describes as "like a bro," is one actor Carano says she wouldn't want to fight in real life. According to Soderbergh, it was his intention to have Carano -- who is a 5-feet 8-inches tall and 143 pounds. Fassbender, in particular, was the recipient of a vase to the face when the two were filming a fight scene and he accidentally KO'd Carano.
