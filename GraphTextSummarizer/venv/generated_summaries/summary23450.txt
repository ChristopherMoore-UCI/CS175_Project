Under government guidelines published last month, producers of basic products, including foreign companies, must now register with government regulators and disclose how they produce, distribute and market their products, a move that has caused great concern among domestic and international companies operating in Venezuela. Jorge Roig, vice president of Fedecamaras, a Venezuelan association that pulls together businesses, including many producers of basic goods, blames the new government price caps and regulations for the shortages. But consumers shopping at Guaicaipuro complained that prices, even for basic products, had skyrocketed. " Maria de Abreu, another Caracas resident doing her grocery shopping, complained that she couldn't find powdered milk. According to officials, in a raid conducted in November, they found more than 200 tons of powdered milk hidden in a warehouse.
