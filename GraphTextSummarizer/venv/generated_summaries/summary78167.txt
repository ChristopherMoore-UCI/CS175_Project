"We call on the Vatican to distant themselves from Archbishop Boutros' comments which are a libel against the Jewish People and the State of Israel and should not be construed as the Vatican's official position," Ayalon said in his statement. On Sunday, Israel's Ayalon said that "We are especially appalled at the language used by Archbishop Bustros during his press conference. "These outrageous comments should not cast a shadow over the important relationship between the Vatican, the state of Israel and the Jewish people." "We Christians cannot speak of the 'promised land' as an exclusive right for a privileged Jewish people," Archbishop Cyril Salim Bustros, who leads the Greek Melkite Church in the U.S., said at the conference's final press conference on Saturday. Erakat said the synod sent "a clear a message to the government of Israel that it may not claim that Jerusalem is an exclusively Israeli city." "(In) coming weeks we will engage in discussions with the Vatican on ways to further consolidate our fantastic relations," Erakat said.
