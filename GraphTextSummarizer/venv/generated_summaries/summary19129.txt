Quarterback Tom Brady completed a Super Bowl record 37 passes and threw for four touchdowns. The New England Patriots rallied to down the Seattle Seahawks 28-24 Sunday and win Super Bowl XLIX at Glendale, Arizona. Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson shrugged off a slow start to complete 12 of 21 passes for 247 yards, but he threw an interception at the Patriots goal line with 20 seconds to go. The Patriots are the sixth team to win at least four Super Bowl trophies. The Patriots trailed 24-14 before Brady threw two touchdown passes in the fourth quarter.
