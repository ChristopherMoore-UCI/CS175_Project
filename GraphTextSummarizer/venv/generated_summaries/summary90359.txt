The group, which raised more than $60 million for Democratic women in 2014, expects that with Clinton atop the ticket -- and energy among other women candidates to run -- they will easily break through those fundraising numbers. For a group with the chief purpose of helping to get Democratic women elected into higher office, Emily's List enters 2016 closer to the top prize -- the presidency -- than ever before, and with fewer restrictions than what faced political organization the last time Hillary Clinton ran. Feriozzi will take Schriock's seat on the super PAC board, a body that has long been seen as the center of the pro-Clinton world, where leaders from the different organizations can meet and coordinate efforts to help boost Clinton's campaign efforts. Emily's List was very active in the race in 2008 during Clinton's first bid, but election laws have changed vastly since then -- mostly thanks to the Supreme Court's Citizen's United decision in 2010 -- making it possible for the group to play a bigger role. " Stephanie Schriock, the president of Emily's List, has left the Priorities USA board so that she can work closer with the Clinton campaign and still comply with election coordination rules.
