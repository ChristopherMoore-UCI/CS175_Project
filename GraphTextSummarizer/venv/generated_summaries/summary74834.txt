-- A 2004 crash that killed everyone on board -- three crew members and three U.S. troops -- was caused by pilots from a Blackwater plane taking a low-level run through a mountain canyon in Afghanistan, testimony revealed Tuesday. " Prince said investigators concluded the crash in Afghanistan was not due to corporate error, but pilot error. Dispatchers failed to ensure that pilots followed their flight plan and did not adequately track flights in the air. "It seems to me that it's more than pilot error. The account of the crash emerged during a House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing on Blackwater's performance in Iraq and Afghanistan.
