Annan described the communication as "encouraging," but added, "the only promises that count are the promises that are kept." U.S. Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, told CNN that he had little hope for success for the United Nations mission in Syria. -- A small group of observers resumed the United Nations' mission to monitor a truce in Syria that was tenuous from the start and showed signs Wednesday of unraveling as opposition activists again reported widespread violence. The crisis began in March 2011, when the government started cracking down on peaceful protesters calling for the ouster of al- Assad, whose family has ruled Syria for 42 years. One problem is that Damascus is unwilling to allow monitors from any of the 60-plus nations that are part of the "Friends of Syria," a group that aims to find a solution to the crisis. "I am particularly alarmed by reports that government troops entered Hama (Monday) after observers departed, firing automatic weapons and killing a significant number of people," Annan said.
