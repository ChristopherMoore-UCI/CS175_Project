A winter storm warning remained in effect through Monday afternoon for California's Sierra Nevada, from Yosemite to Kings Canyon, according to the National Weather Service. -- Heavy rains prompted the emergency evacuation Monday of nearly 2,000 residents of a flooding Southern California town and the temporary closure of at least two highways because of mudslides. On Monday, Sarah Butner of Orange County, California, was visiting family in Mammoth Lakes in the central part of the state. "Storm totals of 5 to 10 feet above 7,000 feet are likely," the weather service said, and periods of heavy snow will continue through Monday. Peak wind gusts reached 152 mph in Alpine Meadows summit in northern California, the Weather Service reported.
