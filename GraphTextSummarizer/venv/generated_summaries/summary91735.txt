Parliamentarian Isack Mohamed Ali, popularly known as Isack Rino, was killed, and lawmaker Mohamud Abdi-dhuuh was seriously injured, said Mohamed Abdiqadir Mohamed, district commissioner of Mogadishu's Hamarweyne district. Journalist Omar Nor reported from Mogadishu; CNN's Holly Yan wrote from Atlanta. "This cowardly attack will not derail the progress made in Mogadishu and across Somalia. "Somalia has today lost a committed parliamentarian who worked tirelessly to serve the people of Somalia and help rebuild our country," Ahmed said in a statement. Prime Minister Abdiweli Sheikh Ahmed said those behind the "cowardly" attack would be found.
