During the genocide, soldiers and police under Bizimungu's command directed the extermination of tens of thousands of Tutsi civilians who had taken refuge in churches, hospitals and schools, according to Human Rights Watch. The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) found Augustin Bizimungu guilty on six counts of genocide, crimes against humanity for murder, extermination and rape and violations of  the Geneva Conventions. The tribunal also convicted two other senior officers -- Fran√ßois-Xavier Nzuwonemeye and Innocent Sagahutu -- who each got 20 years in prison. -- A war crimes tribunal for Rwanda sentenced the African nation's former army chief to 30 years in prison Tuesday for his part in the 1994 genocide that killed 800,000 people. In all, 800,000 Tutsi men, women, and children -- as well as moderate Hutus -- perished.
