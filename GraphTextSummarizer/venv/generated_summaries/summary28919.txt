Community organization ACORN is fighting back after allegations that it is trying to register voters fraudulently and to swing the presidential election for Democrat Barack Obama. "Even the general counsel of the RNC [Republican National Committee] has acknowledged that he cannot cite a single example of an improper vote having been cast as a result of alleged voter registration fraud," ACORN Executive Director Steve Kest said. " Officials for ACORN -- which stands for Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now -- calls such statements hysteria, but acknowledge that some of their hires have turned in improper voter registrations. Watch ACORN, conservatives spar Â» ACORN contends it tried to help authorities head off election fraud. Simpson said he would favor "expedited discovery" should someone want to pursue "evidence that in Pennsylvania practices of ACORN Outreach Workers can encourage duplicate voter registration."
