Jagger, 70, posted a personal statement about Scott's death on his website last week: "I am still struggling to understand how my lover and best friend could end her life in this tragic way.

"Words of tribute" to Scott, 49, were spoken by Jagger, as well as her brother Randy Bambrough, talent agent Justinian Kfoury, costume designer Ira M. Hammons-Glass and Adam Glassman, creative director of Oprah Winfrey's O Magazine. Jo Wood, the ex-wife of Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood, said the precarious finances of Scott's fashion business may have played a role in the apparent suicide.
