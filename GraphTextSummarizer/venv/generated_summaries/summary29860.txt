But when backup arrived, German was found lying on the ground, suffering from a gunshot wound, according to Polk County authorities. "Words do not exist to express the measure of our sorrow and sadness," Ricke and Connie Goode said in a statement issued Wednesday to CNN affiliates WESH and Central Florida News 13. Upon searching nearby woods, Orange County sheriff's deputies found Brandon Goode and Alex Hollinghurst dead, lying in some brush, from what are believed to be self-inflicted wounds. Windermere police Officer Robert German called for support after witnessing Goode and Hollinghurst -- who had been reported missing -- walking along a street early Saturday. Using cell phone tracking technology, Kissimmee police officers found the two parked in Goode's car.
