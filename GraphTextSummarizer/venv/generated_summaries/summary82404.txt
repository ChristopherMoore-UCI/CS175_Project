English Premier League side West Ham United -- the team of choice of the 44th president of the United States -- has been selected as the preferred occupant for London's Olympic Stadium, the venue which hosted the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games. The London Legacy Development Corporation (LLDC) announced on Wednesday that the east London club -- whose stadium is located near to the former Olympic Park site in Stratford -- had beaten off competition from neighboring third-tier team Leyton Orient, a proposed sports university project and a consortium looking to bring Formula One to the British capital. "The LLDC's board unanimously agreed that West Ham United's bid for a concession to play at the Olympic Stadium should be ranked highest of the bids received, and that negotiations should be held with the club on final commercial terms for them to move to the stadium," read a statement on the organization's website. West Ham had initially tried to buy the stadium and was named the preferred bidder in February 2011, but that deal collapsed in October of that year after threats of court action from rival candidates and an independent review of the process. Reconstruction work on the stadium, including extending the roof and adding retractable seating, will reportedly cost between $210-240 million and will be funded by a mix of public money and a $64 million loan from the local Newham Council.
