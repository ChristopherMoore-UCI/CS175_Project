Dave Chung and Kim Benty share a love of volunteer work in New Orleans. In 2007, Dave Chung and Kim Benty found each other while helping Hurricane Katrina victims in New Orleans, Louisiana. But then it was time for Benty to go back to New York and for Chung to make the long drive to Canada to see his relatives. Meanwhile, Kim Benty, 36, an interpreter for the deaf in the western New York town of Batavia, began a series of trips in July 2007 to work with volunteers in the same area. Benty was smitten after meeting Chung on her first trip, but he merely smiled and went back to work.
