Dominick Wesley Arceneaux was last seen by an aunt Tuesday afternoon in the front yard of a mobile home in Chidester, in south-central Arkansas, authorities said. In a missing-person alert, the FBI described Dominick as 3 feet tall, weighing 38 pounds, with brown hair and eyes. Kimberly Brunell, a special agent with the FBI in Little Rock, said authorities have made "an exhaustive search" of White Oak Lake, close to where the boy was last seen. The FBI is hoping the public can help find 3-year-old Dominick Wesley Arceneaux. They have also found Dominick's father, who lives in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
