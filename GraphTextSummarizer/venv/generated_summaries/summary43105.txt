Devlin is being held in "administrative segregation" from other inmates at Crossroads Correctional Center in Cameron, Cline told CNN. The inmate's 79 convictions include attempted murder, forcible sodomy, attempted forcible sodomy, armed criminal actions and kidnapping. Michael Devlin, 45, received superficial puncture wounds from a homemade weapon, said Chris Cline, spokesman for the Missouri Department of Corrections. Devlin, a former pizzeria manager, has two reported conduct violations since his 2007 incarceration, according to Cline, who would not describe them. The parents of one boy, whom Devlin is accused of abducting in 2002, told Oprah Winfrey in a show that aired in 2007 that they suspected their son was sexually assaulted by Devlin.
