The Green Bay Packers and Pittsburgh Steelers will contest Super Bowl XLV  after securing narrow victories in the NFC and AFC championship games Sunday night. The pair will meet at the Dallas Cowboys Stadium in Texas on Sunday February 6 with the Packers playing their first Super Bowl in 13 years. Rodgers scored a touchdown on the first drive of the game and B.J. Raji later crossed on a 18-yard interception return to put Green Bay 21-7 ahead. The Packers beat the Chicago Bears 21-14 to claim the NFC title, with the Steelers joining them in grid-iron's showpiece game with a later 24-19 defeat of the New York Jets to claim the AFC honors. The Steelers, inspired by quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, later sealed their third visit to the Super Bowl in eight years and eighth overall, but like the Packers had to survive nervous late moments.
