-- The leadership of North Korea appeared to pass to a third generation of the Kim family Monday after the weekend death of Kim Jong Il, who ruled the reclusive Stalinist state since 1994. Kim Jong Il had led North Korea since his father -- the nation's founder, Kim Il Sung -- died at age 82. And South Korea says a North Korean torpedo attack was to blame for the 2010 sinking of the South Korean warship Cheonan, which left 46 Southern sailors dead. Both North Korea and South Korea have shown signs of concession in recent years. Chinese President Hu Jintao visited the North Korean embassy in Beijing Tuesday to offer condolences, according to the Chinese state-run news agency Xinhua. Monday night, Secretary of State Clinton issued a statement acknowledging the "period of national mourning" in North Korea.
