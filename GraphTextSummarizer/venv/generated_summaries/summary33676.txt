-- Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said al Qaeda will fail if it seeks to spread its terror network into his country because Muslims there "will die for India." Al Qaeda announced plans this month to launch a new branch in the Indian subcontinent, in a video message featuring al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri. Al-Zawahiri said that his group would seek support in the Indian states of Assam and Gujarat, and in Kashmir, the disputed region between India and Pakistan -- and that he wants to free Muslims from the "oppression" they face there. They will not want anything bad for India." Asked why so few among India's roughly 170 million Muslims have joined al Qaeda's ranks, Modi suggested the issue was one of a wider fight for principles, rather than a question of nationality. Indian Muslims will live for India. In 2002, Gujarat was wracked with anti-Muslim violence, in which more than 1,000 people, mostly Muslims, were killed.
