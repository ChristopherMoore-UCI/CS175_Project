Smith also professed a love interest in Barbara, one of the former president's twin daughters, according to the complaint filed Friday in U.S. District Court in Manhattan. On Friday, agents found Smith sitting in his car in Manhattan, with a loaded .38-caliber rifle, two boxes of ammunition, a container of gasoline and a machete, according to authorities. During questioning, Smith told Secret Service agents, "I'm divorced and not currently seeing anyone, but I am working on a relationship with Barbara Bush," the complaint said.
