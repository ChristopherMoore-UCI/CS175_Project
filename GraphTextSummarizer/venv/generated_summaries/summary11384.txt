Moscow has been chosen as the venue for this year's international figure skating championship, to take place in April, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin announced Thursday at the start of a Russian cabinet meeting. " "This event wouldn't be expensive, and we could easily handle all the expenses related to it," Putin said Tuesday when first proposing Russia as the venue for the championship. "The more so, that there are millions of figure skating fans (in Russia)," he said. The championship was initially scheduled to take place this week in Tokyo, but was cancelled in the wake of Japan's massive earthquake and subsequent tsunami March 11. The International Skating Union reported on its website Thursday that "after a careful evaluation" it had decided to allot the championship to Russia.
