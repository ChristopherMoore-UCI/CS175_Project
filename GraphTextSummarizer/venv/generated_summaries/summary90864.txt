"The UAE seeks assurances that Brodsky is in no way connected with the murder of Mahmoud al-Mabhouh in Dubai in January of this year," ministry official Abdurahim Al Awadhi said in a statement. The UAE's foreign ministry said it's worried about Brodsky's release on bail and his freedom to return to Israel during the probe, the state-run WAM reported. The United Arab Emirates on Saturday expressed concern about a German court's decision to release an alleged Israeli agent being investigated in connection with a Hamas leader's murder in Dubai. The suspected agent, who often uses the alias Uri Brodsky, is under investigation for helping obtain a false German passport allegedly used by one of the killers in January. Mahmoud al-Mabhouh, a founding member of the Palestinian group Hamas' military wing, was found dead in January in his hotel room in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates.
