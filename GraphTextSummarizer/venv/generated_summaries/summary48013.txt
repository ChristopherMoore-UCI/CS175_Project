"Frankel will have the pick of the best mares when it is time for him to stud, and there is no mare out there at the moment attracting as much attention as Black Caviar," says Johnny McKeever, who has 25 years of experience in buying horses which have gone on to win major Group One meets around the world. Frankel is now rated as the best performer on the flat in the world by race statistics company Timeform -- which since 1948 has been using a mathematical equation comparing race results to the weight of the horse plus distance run to create a hierarchy which is used in many form guides for racegoers and owners. " Bloodstock valuations have come down from the crazy prices of a decade ago, when horses would sell for $10 million as purchasers found it difficult to secure a return on their investment with falling prize money at racecourses around the world. "It seems a shame that his owners do not want to test him at the longer distances, and I think what we are possibly seeing now is a winding down of his attendances with the chance he will be at stud by next year. The cult status achieved by both horses has spawned a lucrative sideline business, with everything from Black Caviar cufflinks priced at $42 to a $15 Frankel coffee mug available through online stores.
