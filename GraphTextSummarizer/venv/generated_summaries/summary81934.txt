The recent drought has ruined millions of acres of farmland in Texas, turning lakes into mud puddles, but in the East Texas city of Nacogdoches, authorities say, the drought may have done something good: NASA says it is a tank that provides power and water for shuttle missions. Authorities say the object was found after the drought caused the waters to recede in Lake Nacogdoches, and they notified representatives from NASA on Friday. The item is full of mud and is in a remote area near a private shoreline, Sowell said. Nacogdoches made headlines in 2003 when debris from the shuttle Columbia disaster was found there.
