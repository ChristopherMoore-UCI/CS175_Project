-- Bee Gees star Robin Gibb is in a coma and has pneumonia, the latest turn in health issues that include a recent battle with colon and liver cancer, according to a message Saturday on his website. Peter Frampton, who like the Bee Gees rose to fame in the 1970s, wrote on Twitter, "My positive thoughts go out to Robin Gibb and all of the Gibb family. Much love 2 U." Others offering their thoughts and prayers online included Julian Lennon, the son of John Lennon, and former Jackson 5 member Jackie Jackson. Diane Warren -- who herself has written and produced dozens of popular songs for a wide range of performers, including Aretha Franklin and Justin Bieber -- described Gibb as "one of the best songwriters of all time." "We are all hoping and praying that he will pull through," said the message on Gibb's website, which noted that reports "are true" about Gibb being in a coma and having contracted pneumonia.
