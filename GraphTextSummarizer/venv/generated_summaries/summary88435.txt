-- English golfer Ross Fisher boosted his Ryder Cup hopes by claiming his fourth European Tour title with a two-shot victory from home hope Padraig Harrington at the Irish Open on Sunday. Meanwhile, American Jeff Overton took a three-shot lead into Sunday's final round of the Greenbrier Classic in West Virginia as he seeks his first PGA Tour title following two runner-up finishes this year. His compatriot D.A. Points moved up to second place on 15 under with a superb 61, while U.S. Ryder Cup player J.B. Holmes went one shot better to be in a four-way tie for fourth on 12 under -- one behind Boo Weekley (67). The 29-year-old jumped up to sixth place in the European team standings ahead of October's clash with the United States as he equaled the tournament record score of 18-under-par 266 in Killarney. Fisher had led by three shots at halfway after a 10-under 61 on Friday, but saw that cut to one stroke by compatriot Chris Wood and Italy's Francesco Molinari after a 71 on Saturday.
