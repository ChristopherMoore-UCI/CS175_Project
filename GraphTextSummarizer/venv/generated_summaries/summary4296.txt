In his own case, genome sequencing revealed Snyder's risk for type II diabetes before his body started showing symptoms. With the new ENCODE information, Snyder could start seeing which variants he has that might affect gene function but don't lie inside the gene; they reside in the control switches. " ENCODE is about interpreting that -- understanding which genetic variants affect biochemical function, and which ones are associated with disease. That means if you got your genome sequenced, there could be as many as 4 million differences between you and the person sitting next to you, Michael Snyder, a Stanford University professor who is the principal investigator for ENCODE, told CNN. Before ENCODE, scientists' knowledge was mostly about the exome, the protein coding sequences that account for about 1.5% of the genome, Snyder said.
