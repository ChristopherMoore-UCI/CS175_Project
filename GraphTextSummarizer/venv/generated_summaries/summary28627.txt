An investigative effort by an alphabet soup of Florida law enforcement agencies, plus tips from the public, helped lead police to Matos and Tristan at the Floridan Palace Hotel in Tampa, about 40 miles from the home in Hudson where the bodies were found. Castor said that investigators who have talked with Tristan report that the boy is unharmed and is cooperating with police. The relationship between Tristan and Matos remained unclear -- some told police they were father and son, and others described Matos as a "father figure" to the boy. Pasco County sheriff's deputies and Tampa police prepared their SWAT teams once the pair was found, but in the end used a less forceful approach to apprehend Matos. "Thank God Tristan is OK," Pasco County Sheriff Chris Nocco said.
