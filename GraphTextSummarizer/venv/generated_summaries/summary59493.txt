I can't imagine that too many people with rational minds think printable guns will add to the serenity of the world. Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-New York, has expressed interest in legislation to block printable guns , so we'll see where it leads. In this sense, to me, printable guns are a step in the wrong direction. Granted, the actual impact of printable guns on societal violence is obviously unknown. Assuming this is no crazy hoax, the ramifications of such a weapon for gun control are potentially profound.
