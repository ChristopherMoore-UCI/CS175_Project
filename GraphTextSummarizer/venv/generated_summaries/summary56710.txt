Ji, who will be riding with the Netherlands-based Giant-Shimano team, has competed in professional European cycling since 2007 and has already completed other top races. It's also attracting the attention of professional cycling teams eager to find untapped talent, and cycling sponsors eying China's potential as a lucrative market. 'Breakaway killer' Ji started his athletic career as a runner in school, but shifted to cycling soon after in part because of the cold weather in Harbin, where winter temperatures get below -4°F (-20°C) and cycling gave him the opportunity to train indoors. He's also competed in the other two highest profile races in competitive cycling: the Vuelta a Espana, in which he raced in 2012 and the Giro d'Italia the following year. China won three medals in women's track cycling at the 2012 London Olympics -- two silvers and a bronze -- but has lagged behind in road cycling.
