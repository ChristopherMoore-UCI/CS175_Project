In January, Moaffak Makhoul and his team of six artists completed a mural made of assorted scrap -- broken mirrors, ceramics pieces, soft-drink cans, pipes, cooking utensils, bicycle wheels and car parts. "We wanted to give a smile to the people, joy to the children, and show people that the Syrian people love life, love beauty, love creativity." The vibrant outdoor artwork has brought people out onto the street, giving them a chance to enjoy art, bringing more sense of normalcy to their life -- and perhaps even easing some pressures. Many people came from war zones to give their house keys or other personal objects to the artists. The violence has also taken toll on the country's infrastructure, economy and urban life.
