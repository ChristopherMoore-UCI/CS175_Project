Blasberg's agent, Chase Callahan of REP 1 Sports Group told the LPGA's official Web site: "We are devastated to learn of the passing of Erica Blasberg. Blasberg has played on the LPGA Tour since 2004, and had recently participated in her first event of 2010 in Mexico where she tied for 44th in the Tres Marias Championship. She lived out her dream of playing professional golf on the highest level on the LPGA Tour, allowing her to help inspire others. A native of California, Blasberg turned professional in 2004 and claimed one victory on the Duramed Futures Tour before qualifying for the LPGA Tour in 2005. Blasberg's best performance was in 2008 when she recorded a joint eighth position at the SBS Open in Hawaii -- a career-best -- and claimed over $113,000 prize money.
