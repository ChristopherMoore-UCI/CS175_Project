Although the "one-drop rule" in many ways serves foundational to black American racial identity, and has functioned to draw borders around the black community as we know it, one drop of "blackness" -- whatever that is -- does not constitute black identity.

What that means, then, is that 30% of the folks who call themselves white have much more than one drop, including white supremacist Craig Cobb. The rhetoric of white supremacy not only argued that the races were distinctly different, but also that the black race specifically was inferior, therefore justifying enslavement.
