-- A federal judge has thrown out a class action lawsuit against the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers over the failure of levees in New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina. U.S. District Judge Stanwood Duval acknowledged Wednesday that the agency failed to properly safeguard the city, but he ruled that the Corps was protected by the Flood Control Act of 1928. " Stanwood called the story of the Corps failure to protect New Orleans "heart-wrenching. Levees failed in several areas, flooding about 80 percent of New Orleans with water up to 20 feet deep. "We're trying to learn from the lessons of Katrina and put the best system in place for the people of New Orleans," he said.
