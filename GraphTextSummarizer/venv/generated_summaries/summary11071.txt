Dorner cheered in some quarters Dorner had vowed to kill police officers to avenge what he called his unfair termination. Although the canisters included pyrotechnic tear gas, which generates heat, "We did not intentionally burn down that cabin to get Mr. Dorner out," McMahon said. Dorner also killed the daughter of a former LAPD captain and her fiance and shot three other officers, including Crain's partner, police say. On Wednesday, police from around the Los Angeles area and beyond gathered to bury Michael Crain, who was among the four people fatally shot, allegedly by the 33-year-old former Navy officer. In a manifesto announcing his planned rampage, Dorner said nothing had changed in the LAPD since its scandals of the 1990s, the Rodney King beating and the Rampart police corruption case.
