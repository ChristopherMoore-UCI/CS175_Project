Despite official instructions to teachers on alternative approaches to child discipline, many children continue to live in fear of violence in schools, the High Court said. "In fact, teachers are not well-trained and they need deftness to understand child psychology and alternative approaches to child discipline," Shafiq Rahman, a banker in Dhaka, told CNN. -- A top court has banned any corporal punishment in schools in Bangladesh, a country where millions of children are exposed to physical abuse, officials said Thursday. A survey conducted by the United Nations Children Fund, or UNICEF, in Dhaka couple of years ago involving nearly 4,000 families found that 91 percent of children experienced physical abuse in schools. A spokesman in the ministry of education said that in response, it had issued a circular asking teachers to stop physical abuse in schools.
