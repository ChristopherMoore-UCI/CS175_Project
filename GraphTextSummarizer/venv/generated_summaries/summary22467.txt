But those now trying to protect his image say Nelson Mandela is also in danger of becoming an exploited brand, emblazoned on clothing, smiling from unauthorized paintings and commemorated in a proliferation of tacky memorabilia. Problems protecting Mandela's image stand in contrast to the 27 years he spent in prison when photographs of him were outlawed, althought this didn't stop him becoming a poster star of overseas anti-apartheid campaigns. "What we don't want is for him to become another Che Guevara, another face on a T-shirt," says Achmed Dangor, head of the Nelson Mandela Foundation, which organizes charitable projects on behalf of the former South African president. Dangor and the Mandela Foundation have been aggressive in clamping down on what they say is an illegal use of Mandela's image. The Foundation says it is aware that Mandela will exist as a brand long after he is gone.
