The four Japanese nationals were sent to China for a Japanese government project to reclaim World War II chemical weapons left by Japan's Imperial Army, their company said Friday. Japan's foreign ministry officials said Friday that China had informed them of the arrests, but they had no information about any charges or why the Japanese nationals had been detained. Fujita's representative in China is on the way to Hebei Province and has reached out to Japan's Foreign Ministry for help, Tsuchiya said. China's Foreign Ministry has said that Japan has "seriously damaged Sino-Japan bilateral relations" with the fishing crew's arrests. But China has had plenty to say about Japan detaining the Chinese fishing captain.
