Whether Mourinho carries out his threat to drop Muntari is open to questions because Sunday's match in the San Siro kicks off after sundown in Italy, leaving the player some time to rehydrate. Inter Milan coach Jose Mourinho is under fire from a Muslim leader in Italy after his criticism of Sulley Muntari for fasting during Ramadan. Mourinho was unhappy with the performance of Muntari and his team on Sunday. Ghana midfielder Muntari was taken off after just half an hour of Inter's disappointing 1-1 home draw against Bari as they began their defense of the Serie A title on Sunday. "Muntari had some problems related to Ramadan, perhaps with this heat it's not good for him to be doing this, " Mourinho told reporters.
