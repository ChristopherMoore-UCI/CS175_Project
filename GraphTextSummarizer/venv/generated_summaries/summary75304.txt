Togo appealed the Confederation of Africa Football's decision to the Sport of Arbitration for Court, with FIFA president Sepp Blatter subsequently brought in to mediate the hearing. -- Togo may be allowed to take part in the next African Nations Cup after world soccer's governing body FIFA stepped in to mediate the row arising from the team's withdrawal from this year's event. "Today marks a victory for the whole football family, particularly for African football. "Considering the emotional circumstances surrounding this case, it was very important for the parties to find a reasonable solution in order to put an end to their dispute," Secretary General Matthieu Reeb said. As a result, the president of the CAF, Issa Hayatou of Cameroon, will ask the African ruling body's executive committee to lift the ban at its next meeting on May 15.
