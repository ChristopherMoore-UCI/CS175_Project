-- After more than three days of deliberations, jurors on Monday convicted Ingmar Guandique of two counts of first-degree murder in the 2001 death of Washington intern Chandra Levy. " Prosecutors argued that Guandique, a reputed member of the Salvadoran gang Mara Salvatrucha, attacked Levy while she was jogging in Washington's Rock Creek Park. Asked what she would say to Susan Levy, juror Linda Norton said, "I think she has to take from this what she will. Her skull was found over a year later, on May 22, 2002, in Washington's Rock Creek Park. As the verdict was read, Levy's mother, Susan, stared intently at Guandique.
