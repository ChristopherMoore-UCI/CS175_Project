A 32-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of terrorism offenses, London's Metropolitan Police said in a statement Saturday. The suspect was detained in Newham, East London, by counterterrorism officers and is being held at a south London police station. He was arrested on suspicion of collecting information which may be useful to somebody who commits or prepares acts of terrorism, of being a member or supporter of ISIS, and of encouraging terrorism. The arrest is the latest in a series by UK police investigating suspected terror-related activities. The United Kingdom last summer raised its terror threat level to severe, the second-highest level.
