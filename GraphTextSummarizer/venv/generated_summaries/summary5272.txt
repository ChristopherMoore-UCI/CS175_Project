At least one person was confirmed dead, Civil Protection chief Fernando Motta Allen said. Search crews were still combing through the rubble hours after the blast, the city's top civil protection official told CNN affiliate FOROtv. At least 42 employees were injured, 11 seriously, according to Efren Matamoros, another Civil Protection official. CNN's Eduardo Aragon, Elwyn Lopez and Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report. Preliminary reports indicate that an oven installed several months ago exploded, Matamoros said.
