The main idea behind allowing poets to upload their own podcasts was to provide a global stage for African writers, an opportunity that Ndlovu says they haven't had in the past. Ndlovu says until now there have not been enough spoken word role models and a lack of documentation of African poets. From South Africa to Somalia to everywhere in between there are more than a hundred pod-casts archived on the site in the hope of redefining the way people think about African poetry. She explains that it is not just for fans of spoken word but also a meeting place for Pan-African poets. -- It began as an annual festival to host local poets in and around Cape Town but thanks to the power of technology the ancient art of African story-telling is spreading around the world.
