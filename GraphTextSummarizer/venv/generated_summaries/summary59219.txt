But they are the latest example of a persistent, and worrisome, trend: attacking scientists who have done key work that demonstrates the human impact on climate. The immediate trigger for the letter Virginia State Attorney General Kenneth T. Cuccinelli's recent demand that climate scientist Michael Mann, director of the Earth System Science Center at Penn State University, produce a large volume of paperwork related to his scientific research and communications with fellow scientists during his years at University of Virginia from 1999 to 2005. It's also made Mann a target for those who don't want to admit that global warming is a real problem. Mann testified about his work in the U.S. Congress in 2003, in hearings sponsored by Sen. James M. Inhofe of Oklahoma, who has called global warming a "hoax." Without any substantive evidence, the group accused Santer of committing "scientific cleansing" of the IPCC's Second Assessment Report by removing mention of uncertainties to make global warming appear more certain than it was.
