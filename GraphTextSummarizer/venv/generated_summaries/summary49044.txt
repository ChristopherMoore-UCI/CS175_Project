According to Google, "Project Loon is a network of balloons traveling on the edge of space, designed to connect people in rural and remote areas, help fill coverage gaps, and bring people back online after disasters. In any case, it may be a while before would-be Internet users elsewhere start connecting via balloon. They are designed to maintain a constant volume and be longer-lasting than weather balloons. The signal will bounce from balloon to balloon, then to the Internet back on Earth. The balloons are equipped with antennas with specialized radio frequency technology, Google says, and each one can provide connectivity to a ground area about 25 miles (40 kilometers) in diameter at speeds comparable to 3G service.
