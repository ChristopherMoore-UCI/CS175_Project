Consider these examples from around the country: The Community Food Pantry in Merrill, Wisconsin, has distributed 12 percent more food this year than last, according to Denis McCarthy, pantry manager. Nearly 11 percent more Texans lived in poverty last year than the year before, including more than one of every four under age 18. Last year, demand at the food bank jumped by about 50 percent and it hasn't declined since, said Hubenthal. Around Thanksgiving -- amid advertising images of tables laden with food -- you can expect the news media to focus attention on those for whom feeding themselves or their families is difficult. Texas food banks distributed nearly 43 million pounds of food in the second quarter of 2010, 14 percent more than in the same period last year.
