"He's stepping into not only a complicated moment in Haitian history but he is also stepping into the wasp's nest of Haitian politics," said Amy Wilentz, author of "The Rainy Season: Haiti Then and Now." Martelly's dreams of leading Haiti were all but dead. " Martelly exuded confidence that he could bring change to Haiti. Irwin Stotzky, a University of Miami lawyer who has studied human rights in Haiti, said Martelly hardly had the credentials to run the country and did not see much hope for the immediate future.
