Thai Prime Minister Samak Sundaravej talks with a market vendor on Monday in Udon Thani province. Samak was already facing charges of corruption, appealing a three-year prison sentence for defaming a deputy governor and dealing with an election commission decision last week that his party committed electoral fraud in the December elections and should be dissolved. Ministers are barred from working for private companies, and Samak's opponents filed the case hoping that a conviction will compel him to step down. In theory, analysts say, Samak can return as prime minister in days -- if the ruling coalition nominates him again and a parliament vote is taken. The 73-year-old Samak continued to appear sporadically on the show "Tasting while Grumbling" after he became prime minister in February.
