Appearing alongside some of Bollywood's biggest stars like Amitabh Bachchan and Aamir Khan is a dream for many aspiring young actors in India. Suraj Pancholi, the 21-year-old son of Bollywood actor Aditya Pancholi, was Khan's boyfriend. Pancholi attended Khan's funeral along with many other Bollywood stars. Driven by ambition and discipline, Khan rose through the ranks of a notoriously cut-throat industry for 10 years, acting in blockbuster films like "Ghajini" and "Housefull." On Monday, Khan's mother gave the police what appears to be Khan's suicide note, police said at a news conference.
