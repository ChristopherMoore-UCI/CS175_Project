Republicans in the House had been hit over the head in their districts by ads run by conservative political action committees (paging Sen. Ted Cruz, who appeared in some). At that moment, Cruz morphed from the Pied Piper of House Republicans into the man on the Most Wanted sign. And some cooler heads I have spoken with are privately making the same point: Wasn't it always unfair to promise people something the Republicans knew they could never deliver (defunding Obamacare)? -- Just one week ago Republicans were united, railing against the man-made evil known as Obamacare. If you look closely here, you will see that something very profound has changed: Republicans seem to have pressed the delete key on talk of defunding Obamacare.
