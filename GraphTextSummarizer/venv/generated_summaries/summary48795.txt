Most adults in the study, which looked at average adult sugar consumption between 2005 and 2010, ate or drank more than 10% of their total calories in added sugar. We're not even to dinner yet and already you've already had more sugar than you need. We're talking about added sugar here, the sugar in processed and manufactured foods -- sugary drinks, sodas and juices, cakes and cookies, candy, processed cereals, salad dressings and breads. Added sugar is often what manufacturers put in to make  food taste better. About one in 10 adults took in 25% or more of calories from added sugar.
