-- Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas has fired his chief of staff despite an inquiry into a sex scandal that cleared the second-in-command of wrongdoing. "I was exonerated from the main accusations of abusing my power in office for personal gain and sexual favors," Husseini said Wednesday. The report clears Husseini of corruption and sexual misconduct charges. The president fired Husseini on Tuesday at the recommendation of a committee that Abbas created to look into the allegations. Rafiq Husseini was accused of using the power of his office to extract sex from a female job seeker.
