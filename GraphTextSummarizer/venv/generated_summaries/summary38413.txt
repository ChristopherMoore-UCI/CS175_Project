There were other high-profile departures in the form of 2011 U.S. PGA champion Keegan Bradley, Lee Westwood and 2012 British Open winner Ernie Els. Donald, the 2011 champion, fought hard to beat Germany's Marcel Siem on the final hole while fellow Englishman, and European Ryder Cup hero, Ian Poulter beat Stephen Gallacher 2&1. -- When Nike signed a multi-million dollar deal to add Rory McIlroy to their ranks they must have salivated at the thought of the world's top player going head-to-head with stablemate Tiger Woods. Elsewhere, defending champion Hunter Mahan moved into the second round after a comprehensive 5&4 victory over Matteo Manassero. Woods, the world No. 2, didn't fare any better, losing to Charles Howell III.
