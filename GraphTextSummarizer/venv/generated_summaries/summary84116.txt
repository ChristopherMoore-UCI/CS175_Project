Like Hollywood, game publishers are counting on bestselling franchises and sequels to attract the growing demographic of people who play games. "Halo 4" (Microsoft, 343 Industries, Xbox 360, November 6, 2012) "Halo" developer Bungie has moved on to an original franchise for Activision, leaving Microsoft to turn to new developer 343 Industries for the first in the Reclaimer Trilogy of Halo games. But it still relies on big-name titles to fill its coffers and entice gamers to spend an inordinate amount of time on multiplayer experiences online. The game industry is growing rapidly through new business models like free-to-play games, mobile games and cloud-based gaming. Crytek is blending the best of both worlds from its first two bestsellers and offering gamers more options in both the campaign and multiplayer experiences this time around.
