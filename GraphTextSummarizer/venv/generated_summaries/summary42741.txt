Most of those released Saturday were children and the elderly, said Saman Jabari, the Kurdistan Democratic Party leader. The militant group ISIS, which calls itself the Islamic State, steamrolled into Iraq's north last year, forcing hundreds of thousands of minorities from their homes. The U.S. State Department estimates that 500,000 Yazidis live in northern Iraq, accounting for less than 1% of the country's population. They are of Kurdish descent, and their religion is considered a pre-Islamic sect that draws from Christianity, Judaism and Zoroastrianism. One of the oldest religious communities in the world, they have long suffered persecution, with many Muslims referring to them as devil worshippers.
