While architects often pivot to monochromatic colors, Chetwood wanted to mix it up with color. The designs are unusual, the "sort of idea that China embraces, that perhaps somewhere else in the world they think you're going too far there," Chetwood said. The ambitious Phoenix towers were designed by London-based architects Chetwoods and will claim the tallest building title from Dubai's Burj Khalifa. Stretching up more than a kilometer into the skies above Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei province, the Phoenix project aims to clean the air and water from its surrounding areas. The world's tallest towers, futuristic pink spires that "breath life" into the environment, are due to begin construction within two years.
