Joseph Tomaselli, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Brownsville, said flooding and fallen trees, signs, power lines and power poles were reported in Brownsville and Cameron County on Tuesday morning. A storm surge was forecast to raise water levels by as much as 1 to 3 feet along southern Texas, forecasters said. "It was pretty loud last night," said CNN iReporter Jeremy Williams of Weslaco, Texas, about 45 miles northwest of Brownsville. -- Hermine dumped rain on the San Antonio, Texas, area Tuesday before bringing the same, along with tornado watches and flash-flood warnings, to the central and northern parts of the state. "It's rain and a lot of wind," said CNN iReporter Caroline Radtke of San Antonio, who shot a video of the weather spawned by Hermine.
