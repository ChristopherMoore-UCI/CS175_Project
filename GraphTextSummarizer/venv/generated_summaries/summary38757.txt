An agreement signed Friday by government and opposition leaders requires protesters and security forces alike to withdraw from the streets and turn in illegal weapons. However, other officers appeared on Ukrainian television saying they had defected after receiving orders to use force on protesters. Their commander, Vassily Krikowsky, decided to lead them to Kiev after seeing the images of bloodied protesters, some killed -- opposition officials say -- at the hands of security forces. The question of whether some police officers were defecting amid the violence took center stage on Thursday, when the government said protesters had taken several dozen police officers hostage. -- A protester in military fatigues and an old steel army helmet barks out orders to a line of Ukrainian police officers -- yes, police officers.
