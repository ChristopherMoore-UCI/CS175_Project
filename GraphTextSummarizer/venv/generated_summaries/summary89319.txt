It's sad, really, because GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham -- who is trying to work a deal on immigration reform -- won his GOP primary with almost 60% of the vote in South Carolina. Cantor's demise will scare Republicans away from immigration reform which, as a national party, is an issue that they should embrace. Will House Speaker John Boehner (whose job he coveted) stay on longer? And the sin recently was his decision to support one strand of immigration reform -- a path to citizenship for children who were brought to the United States illegally -- the so-called Dreamers. An opposition party that shut down the government and thwarted immigration reform.
