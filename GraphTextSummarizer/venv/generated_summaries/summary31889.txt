During my principalship at American Indian Public Charter School, we spent less than $8,000 per student, proving that schools did not need more money. The American public has been conned into believing that public schools need more money. President Obama is moving in the "right" direction by reforming public schools to be held responsible to the American public in return for more money. I believe all the money in the world would not be enough to improve schools run by incompetent public school administrators. Teachers unions and politicians are constantly claiming that K-12 public schools need more money in order to produce good academic results.
