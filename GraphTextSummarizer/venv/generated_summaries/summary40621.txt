If you increase the health of citizens, it automatically makes cities more attractive, which in turn brings more people to cities, which improves the economy. I think it's really imperative for governments to create healthy cities so people can go out and do other great things. Spanjian has been the director of sustainability for Houston since 2010, when current Mayor Annise Parker was elected. I would also love more people to commute less to work, by living closer or by using alternative transportation. They have launched several sustainability initiatives under the "Green Houston" program and Parker says the city has cut its greenhouse gas emissions by a quarter.
