The ill patient, identified as Wilmo Louwes, was hospitalized and immediately isolated in the town of Higuey, near the eastern resort city of Punta Cana, Dominican Republic. The disease, which can cause deadly diarrhea and vomiting, is contracted by ingesting contaminated food or water. That ranking places it in a lower position than the United Kingdom (No. 18) and the United States (No. 37), but higher than South Korea (No. 58) and Mexico (No. 61). Although the lone reported case is the result of a migrant bringing the disease into the country and is not related to local water or food contamination, many Dominicans are still worried. The Dominican Republic Ministry of Public Health is receiving help in contingency planning and implementation from the U.S. Agency for International Development and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said Todd Haskell, spokesman for the USAID office in Santo Domingo.
