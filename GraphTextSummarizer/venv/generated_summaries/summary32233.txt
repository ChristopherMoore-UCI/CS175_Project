Paul, a licensed clinical social worker, had been managing the Seamless Transition Integrated Care Clinic, which is responsible for assisting new veterans with their VA benefits, services and programs, to include mental health, according to the Veterans of Foreign Wars. CNN's months-long investigation into deaths due to long wait times for veterans at VA hospitals led to the resignation of Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki. The email, sent by Robin Paul, "in no way reflects the attitudes of our staff toward our patients," Roudebush VA Medical Center Director Tom Mattice said in a statement posted on the hospital's Facebook page. Matthew Conrad on Facebook said, "Robin Paul's continued employment is an insult to every Veteran who has served this country." Mattice announced Paul's leave, and a pending investigation, Tuesday evening. I'm sure Ms. Paul has received a reprimand for her actions.
