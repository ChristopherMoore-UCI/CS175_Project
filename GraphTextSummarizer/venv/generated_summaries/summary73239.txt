Liberia faced 14 years of civil war and strife under the Charles Taylor regime that ended in 2003. The president's political resilience and tough reputation have earned her the nickname "Iron Lady." Edward McClain, the minister of state for presidential affairs, will work with Vice President Joseph Boakai while the president is out of the country. Designated deputies will take over until Cabinet leaders are asked to return or their successors appointed, according to the statement. Johnson-Sirleaf -- currently the only elected female head of state in Africa -- is up for re-election next year.
