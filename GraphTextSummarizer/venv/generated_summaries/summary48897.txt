-- A Libyan woman who stormed into a Tripoli hotel Saturday, telling foreign reporters that she had been raped by government troops, has been released, and her case is being investigated, government spokesman Moussa Ibrahim said Sunday. But Ibrahim refused to take further questions on the issue Sunday, noting that Libyan society is "very conservative." However, international journalists, including CNN's staff, are not allowed to move freely in the Libyan capital and are escorted out of the hotel only on organized outings by government minders. Robertson also tried to ask Ibrahim about statements the spokesman made referring to al-Obeidy as a prostitute, but he declined to answer the question while saying, "I'm not withdrawing from what I said. the government official said that would be up to the family," Robertson said, adding that journalists have indeed been in touch with the family, who have said they would grant permission to see al-Obeidy.
