Warm weather conditions and negligible winds, particularly for morning starters like McIlroy, saw a clutch of stars break 70, including Woods, who opened with a three-under-par 69. -- Rory McIlroy led an early morning assault by the world's best golfers on a toothless Hoylake Thursday to claim the first round lead at the British Open with Tiger Woods also making a promising start to his first major of the season. Northern Ireland's McIlroy carded six birdies in a pretty much flawless first round of six-under 66 on the Royal Liverpool seaside links, missing several other opportunities as he peppered the flags with his approach shots. In the 2010 British Open at St Andrews he led with a 63 and followed it up with an 80, while at last week's Scottish Open McIlroy backed up a 64 with a 78 to slip off the pace. Home hope Rose stayed in contention with a level-par 72 -- on a day 49 players broke par.
