CNN: How important is poetry in Arab culture? Adonis, born Ali Ahmad Said Esbar, grew up in a poor village near the Syrian city of Latakia and received no formal education until he was granted a scholarship to a French lycee by the then president of Syria at the age of 13. The Syrian poet, critic and artist Adonis has been described as the greatest living Arab poet. He was the first Arab to win the German Goethe Prize last year at the age of 81, whose judges described him as "the most important Arab poet of our time," and he was one of the favorites to win last year's Nobel Prize for Literature. He was forced to leave Syria in 1956 after being imprisoned for his involvement in the opposition Syrian National Socialist Party.
