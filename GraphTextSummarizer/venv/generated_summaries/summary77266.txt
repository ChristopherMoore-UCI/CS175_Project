To show our solidarity, one week after the loss of MH17, flight attendants everywhere are pinning a small black ribbon to their uniform; to remember our newest angels of the sky. The moment MH17 hit home Last Thursday, when news of the crash broke, I was operating a flight into Amsterdam, from where flight MH17 had left just a few hours earlier. I know a number of flight attendants and pilots who have been involved in accidents. Much has been made recently of flight attendants being one big family. I hope to extend the black ribbon idea to one day each year, where flight attendants around the world can remember our fallen colleagues.
