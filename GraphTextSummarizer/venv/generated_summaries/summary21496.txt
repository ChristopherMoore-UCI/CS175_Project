Thanks to Instagram, we know that "Full House" stars Candace Cameron Bure, Bob Saget, John Stamos and Andrea Barber were present for the nuptials, as was the show's creator, Jeff Franklin. The actor, who played Uncle Joey on that series, wed longtime girlfriend Melissa Bring on Wednesday, People magazine reported. Coulier and Bring announced their engagement in June, and Coulier told Us Weekly magazine that "Melissa has been my best friend since I met her nine years ago. Candid snaps show the friends hanging out, with one photo catching John Stamos inexplicably carrying a large wooden bench. " "I feel like the luckiest man on the planet," said the actor, who also does stand-up and voice-over work.
