The son of actor Martin Sheen, Charlie Sheen recently signed a new contract to continue with "Two and a Half Men." A former Aspen police officer who interviewed Mueller and took photos after the incident said she was "appalled" that Sheen got the "lightest possible sentence imaginable." "I wish that the judge could have seen what Mrs. Sheen looked like on that Christmas Day," said Valerie McFarlane, who lost her job with the Aspen Police Department earlier this year in an unrelated matter. The case stemmed from Sheen's arrest on Christmas Day after his wife, Brooke Mueller, told Aspen police he threatened her with a knife at their holiday home. Aspen police charged Sheen with felony second-degree assault, felony menacing and a misdemeanor charge of criminal mischief. Sheen told police he became angry when his wife threatened to divorce him and fight for custody of their twin sons, the report said.
