-- When a Vatican cardinal presented a message from Pope Francis to the World Economic Forum, it might have been the first time a papal message actually has been read out in Davos, but it certainly wasn't the first time a Pope has spoken out on economic justice. To begin, the first Pope from the developing world brings a degree of credibility on matters of economic justice that other world leaders lack. It's easy to say that no one person -- even a Pope who's also one of the most popular figures on the planet -- can bring down entrenched systems of power. In other words, Francis has some serious cards to lay on the table in the high-stakes poker game of global economic reform. Francis recently welcomed Russian President Vladimir Putin, he'll meet French President Francois Hollande on Friday, and the White House announced today that U.S. President Barack Obama will make a pilgrimage to the Vatican to meet Francis on March 27.
