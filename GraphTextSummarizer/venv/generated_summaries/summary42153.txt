The dwindling of marriage is both cause and consequence of America's evolution away from a society of equal chances. Marriage means more asset accumulation: Married families save more at every income level. The end of the same-sex marriage debate does not, however, settle the problem of marriage in America. As the IAV writes: "(M)arriage trends in middle America, particularly among the nearly 60 percent of Americans who've graduated from high school but do not have a four-year college degree, are more and more resembling the historic marriage trends in poor and low-income America." Marriage means two incomes at a time when most Americans find two incomes essential to earning a middle-class livelihood.
