Two days after his 66th birthday, Katsav arrived at the Maasiyahu Prison in Ramla, central Israel, where he will be kept in a cell block for prisoners who are observant Jews. A three judge panel last year found Katsav guilty of two charges of rape, two charges of forceful sexual harassment and one charge of sexual harassment. -- Moshe Katsav, the former Israeli president, began a seven-year prison sentence on Wednesday for rape and other sexual offenses. Katsav, of the center-right Likud Party, was president of Israel from 2000 to 2007. ""The five and a half years of battle come to an end in anger and frustration," Katsav said as he left his home surrounded by well wishers.
