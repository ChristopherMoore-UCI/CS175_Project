Speaking at a press conference, Serbian Prime Minister Aleksandar Vucic said that the situation in his country is "difficult," but that Serbia is prepared for the next wave of floods. More rising waters are expected Sunday evening near Sabac, a city in western Serbia near the Sava River. -- Severe flooding across Serbia has prompted the evacuation of at least 16,300 people -- including 1,100 whisked away on helicopters -- the government said Saturday. Rescuers in the hard-hit town of Obrenovac, 30 kilometers (about 19 miles) southwest of Belgrade, have recovered the first bodies of flood victims, according to Vucic. He was especially grateful to members of the Russian special forces, highlighting one member who swam 200 meters in cold water to save several people.
