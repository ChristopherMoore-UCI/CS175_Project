Until the 2003 ban, South Korea was the third-largest market for U.S. beef exporters. -- Tens of thousands of South Koreans were demonstrating Saturday on the streets of the capital to protest the government's decision to import what they say is unsafe U.S. beef. South Korea's new pro-U.S. president agreed to lift the import ban in April before a summit with U.S. President George W. Bush. South Korean protesters protest against government's policy on U.S. beef imports on Saturday. Animals older than 30 months old are considered at a greater risk for mad cow disease, which can be transmitted to humans.
