He has been transported to the hospital and there will be updates thereafter," said Gophers team doctor Pat Smith. -- University of Minnesota head football coach Jerry Kill is in stable condition after suffering a seizure on the sideline of a game against New Mexico State on Saturday in Minneapolis, the team doctor said. "He has a history of them since his cancer, which has been well controlled through medications," Smith said. We have to do a better job as a medical staff keeping him hydrated," Smith said. CNN affiliate WCCO in Minnesota reported that Kill suffered the seizure during the final seconds of the game, which New Mexico State would win, 28-21.
