Kerry travels to Jerusalem and Ramallah on Wednesday in his ongoing attempt to broker peace between Israel and the Palestinians. -- Israel released 26 Palestinian prisoners Monday in a gesture of goodwill between the two sides, days before a visit to the region by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry. The two sides are four months into a nine-month deadline set by Kerry to reach a peace deal, with little visible progress. The release was a step aimed at "resuming the diplomatic process," Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said in a statement Saturday announcing the move. Kerry will meet with both Abbas and Netanyahu during his trip -- his ninth visit to the region.
