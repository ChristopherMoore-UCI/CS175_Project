The arrival of Sergio Aguero and Samir Nasri has meant City have not missed wantaway former captain Carlos Tevez, while David Silva has blossomed along with Edin Dzeko and Mario Balotelli for the 2011 FA Cup winners. After being criticized for defensive play last season, City boss Roberto Mancini has taken the English Premier League by storm with an all-out attacking style. "Last year was difficult, because some of the media criticized City for defending more than attack," Toure said. While Manchester United's status as one of the world's most popular clubs remains intact, Toure's presence at City along with his older brother Kolo has helped change the balance among supporters back home. Ivory Coast international Toure, who moved to Eastlands from the Camp Nou in a $38 million deal in July 2010, said that with the current wealth of expensive talent City can rival the European and Spanish champions' free-flowing passing style.
