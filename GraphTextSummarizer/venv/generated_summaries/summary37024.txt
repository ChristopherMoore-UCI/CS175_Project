Police used water cannons to disperse hundreds of demonstrators gathered Tuesday in Istanbul's main commercial street to protest the building of a road through a university forest in the Turkish capital city of Ankara. The new round of protests in Istanbul erupted after the Ankara Municipality began cutting trees Friday in the Middle Eastern Technical University forest to make way for a highway development project. Police used their shields and water cannons to clear the main part of Istiklal Street, pushing protesters into side streets. Protesters gathered in Istiklal Street and chanted anti-government slogans such as, "This is just the beginning, the resistance will continue," "A thousand greetings to the resistance," "Killer police will pay," and "Police go away, these streets are ours." In May, widespread protests swept through Turkey over plans to turn a central Istanbul park into a shopping mall.
