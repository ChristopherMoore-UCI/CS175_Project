The furry, four-legged animal -- long absent from the city -- could weasel its way back into the hearts of New Yorkers based on a petition submitted to the Department of Health asking it to repeal the city's 15-year ban on ferrets as pets. Ariel Jasper, a Brooklyn College master's student, said she drafted the petition in January because she has always loved ferrets and wants to correct the current Health Code, which she claims contains many inaccuracies about ferrets. The Health Department, led by de Blasio appointee Dr. Mary T. Bassett, said that a public hearing and comment period will be held in the fall, followed by a Board of Health vote. Owning a ferret is legal in 48 states, including in the remainder of New York state, she added. The Health Department said in its announcement that it would be irresponsible from a public safety perspective to allow a ferret to be kept as a pet in New York City, citing their unpredictable behavior and reports that they are prone to attacking humans.
