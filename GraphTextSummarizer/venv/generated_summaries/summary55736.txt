Namely, to drink more Diet Coke. The basic idea is that I can only have Diet Coke on the weekends and days off from work. Of course, despite the 100% scientific fact that Diet Coke is made from the tears of angels and unicorns, and carbonated by the gentle vibrations of Art Garfunkel's voice, I believe -- though, some research doesn't necessarily agree -- that a major negative side effect of this addiction is chronic dehydration. You see, the day you start selling black market copper wire to pay for Diet Coke is the day you realize you have a serious problem. And, if Diet Coke is provided free as part of a work lunch or company event, that also negates the not-at-the-office rule.
