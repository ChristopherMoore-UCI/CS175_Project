-- A government audit on Navy security found that the Navy Yard and other installations may have increased security risks in an effort to reduce costs, a federal source told CNN. "Our objective is to determine whether the Navy Commercial Access Control System (NCACS) is mitigating access control risks to Navy installations. "As a result, at least 52 convicted felons received routine unauthorized installation access, placing military personnel at increased security risk." The audit covered "a variety" of military installations, of which Navy Yard was one, according to the federal source with access to the report. "Navy installations command attempted to reduce access control costs," according to a soon-to-be-released report from the Department of Defense Inspector General.
