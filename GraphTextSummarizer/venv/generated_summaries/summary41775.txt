Children wearing their green school sweaters held signs calling the seizure of the playground "terror against children" and Kenya "the land of shameless grabbers." Children were "promised laptops not canisters of tear gas," tweeted former Kenyan Vice President Kalonzo Musyoka. The children, along with teachers and activists, were demonstrating after the playground was walled off during the holidays, said Boniface Mwangi, who participated in the protest. But not without the memory of what Mwangi called "a dark, sad day for Kenya." "What has #OccupyPlayGround achieved apart from crying terrorised children, activists pushing agenda via kids?" wrote a Twitter user on the handle @SnrMbatha.
