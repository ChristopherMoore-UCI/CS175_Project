New Mexico authorities are seeking the extradition of Staake from Vermont and Ruane from New York, McDonald said. Their unsuccessful scheme called for targeting Bieber and his bodyguard while in New York City in mid-November, and their motive grew from the inmate's quest for notoriety and his infatuation with Bieber, said a New Mexico State Police affidavit. The nephew, Tanner Ruane, 23, was released with their 1983 BMW, but he then spilled the beans about the murder plots when he called Martin in prison the same day, New Mexico authorities said. "This perceived slight made Mr. Martin upset and that, coupled with Mr. Martin's perception of being a 'nobody' in prison, led him to begin plotting the kidnap and murder of (Bieber)," the affidavit said, adding that Martin gave statements to investigators. "Mr. Martin confirmed that the 'dogs' would be castrated too, and Mr. Ruane not only agreed, but stated he himself was the one who was going to do the castrating," the affidavit said.
