Virginia State Police say there is a "new forensic link" between the Hannah Graham case and the death of Morgan Harrington, a 20-year-old Virginia Tech student, who went missing after attending a Metallica concert in Charlottesville in October 2009. "If you look at the map and place the many missing or murdered young women in our area, it is a startling graphic," Harrington's mother, Gil Harrington, told CNN last week. According to a statement from Lynchburg police, a woman reported she was raped on the campus of Liberty University on October 17, 2002. Almost from the start, speculation was raised about the possibility of a connection between Graham's disappearance and Harrington's death. According to CNN affiliate WUSA, there are at least two other women besides Graham and Harrington who have disappeared from the same area since 2009.
