-- A day after Syrian forces overran the Homs neighborhood of Baba Amr, opposition groups said Friday that government forces had executed 14 civilians there and the Red Cross said an aid convoy seeking to deliver food and medical care was turned back. " Amid claims by opposition groups that Syrian officials were keeping aid workers out of Baba Amr to conceal atrocities, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon cited reports of summary executions, arbitrary detentions and torture and called for an immediate end to the violence and for humanitarian aid agencies to be granted unfettered access. A convoy of Red Cross trucks and Red Crescent ambulances reached Homs Friday after receiving authority from the Syrian government to enter Baba Amr on Thursday, a spokesman for the International Committee of the Red Cross. Together with the reports of continuing violence in Syria, the refusal to allow aid trucks into Baba Amr paints a "very, very alarming" picture," said Rupert Colville, a spokesman for he U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights. Much of the attention recently over the violence in Syria has focused on Baba Amr, a neighborhood of five square miles that endured 26 consecutive days of shelling before rebel forces announced a "tactical retreat" on Thursday.
