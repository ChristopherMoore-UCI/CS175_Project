Moments before shooting the hostage-taker Friday night, police SWAT teams helped four bank employees escape through a window, Interior Minister Miguel Hidalgo told the government's Andina news agency. Hidalgo praised the rescue operation, saying the gunman had been "uncompromising" and left police no choice but to shoot him. A bomb squad entered the bank after hostages had been evacuated to detonate the explosive the gunman had used to threatened the hostages, Andina reported. -- Two hostages were injured at a bank in Lima, Peru, before a police sniper killed a man who held 33 people there for seven hours, state media reported. The bank is located in Gamarra, Lima's textile and garment district, a poor part of the city with a high crime rate.
