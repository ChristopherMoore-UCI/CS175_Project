After decades of strategizing, planning and selling the city to NFL team owners, Indy says it's ready to host Super Bowl XLVI. "We're not about that," said Dianna Boyce of Indianapolis' Super Bowl host committee. That's almost as long as TV's Super Bowl pregame show. Fast-forward to Sunday when perhaps more than 112 million people will watch the NFL world championship "taking place in little old Indianapolis," said Griswold, the radio host. "Our plan was to eventually get into the rotation for future Super Bowls," Hudnut said.
