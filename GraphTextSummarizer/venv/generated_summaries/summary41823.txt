-- Mel Gibson's ex-girlfriend dropped her domestic violence accusations against the actor during a court hearing Wednesday morning, according to sources close to both Gibson and Oksana Grigorieva. Grigorieva's lawyer also told a Los Angeles County Superior Court judge she wanted the restraining order that prohibited Gibson from having contact with her lifted, the sources said. Gibson and Grigorieva are in a bitter legal fight over custody of their daughter. Gibson entered a "no contest" plea in March to a misdemeanor battery charge relating to an incident last year involving Grigorieva. It was not immediately clear if Grigorieva would continue to pursue a civil suit against Gibson based on the violence accusations.
