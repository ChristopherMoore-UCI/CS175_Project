Apple CEO Tim Cook has knocked Apple's rivals for making "trade-offs" in order to pack larger screens into phones, although he has not ruled out such a move for future iPhones. But don't expect to see them when Apple rolls out new iPhones next week. On Tuesday, Apple is expected to roll out two different iPhones -- an update to the iPhone 5 and a cheaper model that would be designed to appeal to buyers in emerging markets like China and India. -- Apple is testing iPhone display screens as large as 6 inches, according to a new report. Citing "people familiar with the matter," the Wall Street Journal on Friday reported that the bigger screens could signal a future move by Apple to offer iPhones of various sizes.
