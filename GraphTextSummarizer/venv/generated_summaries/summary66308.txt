Smigiel said that when he recently met with a city auditor, he was told about a shelved proposal that predated him, calling for a hotline that Norfolk city workers -- and workers at Norfolk-affiliated agencies such as Community Services Board -- could call confidentially to report fraud or any other ethical issues. Norfolk Mayor Paul Fraim told CNN on Friday that when a new director took over at Norfolk Community Services Board recently, she was "doing her due diligence" when she discovered the hooky-playing employee was on the books. The mayor said state law requires cities, towns and counties throughout Virginia to host the boards, but each city has little involvement beyond providing some of the funding for the offices. On behalf of the city attorney's office, Norfolk city spokeswoman Terry Bishirjian referred to a statement released on Wednesday that said, "The city attorney's office, with the approval of Womack, took appropriate steps to prevent any further payments to the employee and the employee was terminated." After all necessary employment actions are taken, the city attorney will turn the matter over to Norfolk's Department of Police for further investigation.
