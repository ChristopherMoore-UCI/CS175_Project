In the past 10 years, Anaheim has had 50 shootings involving police officers, and 22 people died in those shootings, said Lt. Tim Schmidt. Police acknowledged Diaz was unarmed, but "based on the actions of Diaz during a foot pursuit, our officer believed Diaz was armed with a gun and posed an immediate threat," police spokesman Tim Schmidt said. Two years after Hispanics rioted against police in a city that Disneyland made famous, Anaheim, California, has hired the first Latino police chief in its 157-year history. Raul Quezada, 44, was sworn in as chief on Wednesday, overseeing a police department that is 56% white in a city that is 53% Hispanic -- and is still reeling from strife that grew out of police shootings of poor Latinos, including at least one resulting in death, sparking the riots. He was a Los Angeles police officer for three years before joining the Anaheim force.
