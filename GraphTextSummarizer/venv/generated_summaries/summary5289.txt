Merkel, a champion of forcing governments to balance their budgets in order to promote stable economic growth in Europe, said she regrets the suffering of the Greek people in the face of tough budget cuts. Greece is heading toward new elections next month, with polls suggesting a narrow victory for a radical leftist party that wants to tear up an international loan agreement that forced the government to make deep budget cuts. Greek voters punished the major parties at the polls May 6 for the harsh budget cuts imposed by the country's international lenders, the European Union, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund. The election left no party able to form a government, creating deep uncertainty about Greece's ability to continue to meet the terms of its bailout package and therefore its debt obligations. The Greek government said Friday that in a phone conversation with the country's president, German Chancellor Angela Merkel suggested that the issue of whether his country remains in the eurozone be put to a referendum, a claim Germany flatly denied.
