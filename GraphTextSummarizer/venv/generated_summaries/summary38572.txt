There's also been some tension between the United States and Pakistan recently, especially after U.S. forces killed terrorist leader Osama bin Laden in Pakistan. Creditors like China, which holds more than $1 trillion worth of U.S. treasuries, and Japan, which holds more than $890 billion worth of debt. The country accused the U.S. of violating Pakistani law by launching the attack on bin Laden inside of Pakistani borders. Yesterday, U.S. Senator John Kerry, who's the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, traveled to Pakistan. Most in Washington agree, not raising the debt ceiling, and defaulting on debt, would trigger a spike in borrowing rates and a loss of confidence in the ability of the U.S. government to honor its obligations.
