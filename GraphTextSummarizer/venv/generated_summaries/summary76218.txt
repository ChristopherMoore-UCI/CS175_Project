Mahmoud Othman, an Iraqi Kurdish lawmaker, told CNN mediation efforts by Kurdish officials, Americans and the Arab League began Thursday after a dramatic walkout by Sunni Arab lawmakers and will continue ahead of Saturday's scheduled parliament session. "This is a new dictatorship that is happening in Iraq," said Allawi, a secular Shiite who walked out with his Sunni allies. Iraqiya also issued demands, including that legislators pass a law within 30 days forming the national council and form a committee to review the files of people illegally detained, a great concern for Sunni Arabs who have accused Iraq's Shiite-dominated government of persecuting them. It also called for a final agreement on outstanding legislation and for canceling a ban on several Sunni Arab politicians from running in elections. It threatened to undermine political amity and lead to the formation of a government without adequate Sunni representation.
