" Watson's impassioned speech, delivered September 20 as part of her role as a goodwill ambassador for UN Women, drew attention for her remarks about the need for equality and for men to embrace feminism. -- A 15-year-old British schoolboy has struck a chord with his eloquent response to actress Emma Watson's United Nations speech encouraging men to join in the fight for gender equality. Ed Holtom's letter, published in the Sunday Telegraph, was praised on social media for demonstrating an understanding of gender issues that many adults today don't fully comprehend. Both men and women should feel free to be strong," Watson told the UN.
