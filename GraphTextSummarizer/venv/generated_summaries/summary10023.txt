Gov. Mark Dayton held a news conference to announce an impasse in budget talks two hours before the deadline, saying the night was a one of "deep sorrow for me." "Unfortunately, Gov. Dayton has chosen to prioritize his rigid, tax-and-spend ideology, rather than prioritize the best interests of Minnesotans." The government shutdown in Minnesota could drag on for days as a spokeswoman for Gov. Mark Dayton said talks probably won't happen until after the July 4 holiday. Zellers told reporters that budget talks were much closer than Dayton previously said. Senate Majority Leader Amy Koch said in a statement issued by her office Friday that Republicans had "100 matched" some of Dayton's funding requests.
