A previous emergency order issued by then-Gov. Ted Strickland that prohibited people convicted of animal cruelty from owning exotic animals expired in April. He also had been convicted of animal cruelty and animals at large in 2005 and was arrested several times for traffic violations. Humane Society doesn't fault authorities for shooting animals As of Wednesday afternoon, authorities had killed 49 animals -- 18 tigers, 17 lions, six black bears, two grizzly bears, three mountain lions, two wolves and a baboon. Douthitt said it is inappropriate for people like Thompson to keep dangerous animals as pets, just as it was to shoot so many of them. Thompson had threatened to release animals "It was like a war zone," Kopchak said when authorities descended on Thompson's property, set off the road named after Kopchak's family.
