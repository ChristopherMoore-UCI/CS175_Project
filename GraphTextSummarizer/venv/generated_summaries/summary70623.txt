This past spring, after a local newspaper reported on a new video that allegedly showed him smoking crack cocaine, Ford relented on one front: by going into rehab. His brother, Doug Ford, who ran for Ford's old job as mayor -- lost. Fall from grace Rob Ford's fall from grace, if you can call it that, began in May 2013 with the release of a cell phone video that appeared to show him smoking crack cocaine. The Toronto city council largely stripped him of his mayoral powers months later over those and other allegations of bad behavior. The mayor apologized for "a lot of stupid things," including having used crack cocaine, but he refused to resign or enter rehab.
