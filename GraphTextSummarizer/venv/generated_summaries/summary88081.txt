During his campaign for president in 2008, Obama made clear he opposed military engagements such as the the war in Iraq, which he termed "dumb" and vowed to end. But while Obama has broad public approval for his ISIS mission, according to polls, the decision to engage the U.S. military in Iraq and Syria undercuts his image as a president opposed to war -- though describing him as a foreign policy "dove" was never truly accurate. Like most Americans, President Barack Obama is tired of war. While Obama may be setting out on a very different type of mission in Iraq, vowing the United States. wouldn't "get dragged into another ground war" there, he's nonetheless setting his successor up to carry on the mission. His goals there, analysts say, are distinct from Iraq campaigns in the past.
