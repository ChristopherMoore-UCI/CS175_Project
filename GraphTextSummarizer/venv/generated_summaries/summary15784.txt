It's his desire to do it," coach and translator Harmander Singh said Sunday in an interview with CNN affiliate CBC. Singh, born in rural India in 1911, did not start running marathons until he was 89, after he moved to England following the death of his wife and son. Singh says his secret is a life without alcohol and smoking, a vegetarian diet of curries and tea, and daily exercise. Singh, the centenarian, already held the World Record for the 90-plus age group, completing the same race in 2003 at age 92. The Association of Road Racing Statistician already recognized Singh as the oldest for a marathon he ran at age 93.
