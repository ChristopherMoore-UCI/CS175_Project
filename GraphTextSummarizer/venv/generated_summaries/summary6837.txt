An e-mail from one of the crewmen aboard the Maersk Alabama tells a gripping tale of sailors fighting back against pirates who had taken over their ship. Crewman Matt Fisher hopes other ships can learn lessons from the Maersk Alabama takeover and recapture. "I heard that several other pirate vessels were heading our way and the Navy wanted us out of the way. Watch crew arrive in the United States Â» "We stayed close by for some time, but then the Navy asked us to head out," Fisher said. But the Maersk Alabama, with U.S. Navy protection aboard, was nearing Mombasa, Kenya, by that time.
