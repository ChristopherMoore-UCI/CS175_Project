Dr. Drew Pinsky told HLN's Joy Behar last month that he diagnosed Uchitel as a "love addict," an affliction in which a person "mistakes intensity for intimacy." Rachel Uchitel graduates from the DGA Detectives Academy in Los Angeles next month, according to school director Dale Gustafson. Before starting the detective training, Uchitel was a cast member of the current season of TV's "Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew." "She's smart," Gustafson said Wednesday. " Uchitel, halfway through the 10-week course, has already studied asset recovery, criminal defense, family law, skip tracing and missing persons investigations, he said.
