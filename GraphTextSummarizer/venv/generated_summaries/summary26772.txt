We already knew that Ray Rice punched his wife and she was knocked unconscious, but when you witness the violence you can no longer turn this "incident" into a tiff between drunk lovers or blame the victim: Janay Palmer. " Domestic violence usually takes place behind closed doors; that's because batterers typically hide the abuse. The video showing Ray Rice punching Janay Palmer inside an elevator was released Monday. The NFL, faced with new evidence that proves Janay Palmer had no role in this incident, regardless of what she might have said to downplay it, are doing what they should have done after the first video showed her unconscious on a lobby floor and Rice admitted he had assaulted her . That's part of the cycle of abuse: violence then a honeymoon period, only to be followed by violence again.
