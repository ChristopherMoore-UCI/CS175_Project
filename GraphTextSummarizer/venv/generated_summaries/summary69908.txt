While she has not spoken with the public, her attorneys have said Russell is distraught over the loss of life and injuries suffered by bombing victims. Four people have been charged in connection with the bombing, including Russell's brother-in-law, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who is suspected of carrying out the attack along with his brother, Tamerlan, 26. CNN legal analyst Paul Callan said he didn't believe Russell would be able to enjoy "spousal privilege" against investigators' questions. And then there's that phone call law enforcement sources say Russell placed to her husband after authorities released pictures identifying him as a suspect in the bombings. Russell didn't have any legal requirement to call authorities on learning her husband was potentially involved, criminal defense attorney Mark Geragos told Burnett.
