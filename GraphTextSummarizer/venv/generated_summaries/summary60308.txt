The criminal complaint says the officers, considering Jordan Miles' appearance suspicious, got out of the car and identified themselves as police. Terez Miles said her son, Jordan Miles, who is black, thought his life was in jeopardy when three white men jumped out of a car on the night of January 11 as he walked not far from his home. The officers "delivered 2-3 closed fist strikes to Miles' head/face with still no effect," and then a "knee strike to Miles' head causing him to momentarily stop resisting," so that he could be handcuffed, the document says. The complaint says the police officers believed Miles was engaged in criminal activity and possibly armed with a "large heavy object." A hearing in the case was scheduled for Thursday, but it was unclear whether the officers involved showed up, said Miles' attorney, Kerry Lewis.
