Digitization, which harnesses the power of what we call the Internet of Everything at Cisco -- the connection of people, process, data and things -- will change everything from the way we work to how we serve citizens, and teach our young people. This transformation will contribute to France's overall global competitiveness by supporting job growth, education, cybersecurity, innovation and entrepreneurial initiatives in France. France has a strong traditional infrastructure in place -- roads, water lines, buildings, even parking spaces -- and the country is now committing to build out their digital infrastructure, which will help increase productivity, create jobs, and improve the lives of citizens. I believe that France will lead in this new era of country digitization. And with more startups than any other European country at the Consumer Electronics Show this year, and a strong infrastructure in place, France is primed to embrace the latest technology transition: digitization of everything.
