Black leaders in Congress quickly slammed the decision not to indict New York City police officer Daniel Pantaleo in Garner's death and called on the Department of Justice to investigate Garner's death. The decision not to indict a New York City police officer in the chokehold death of Eric Garner, a black man who was suspected of illegally selling cigarettes, came just nine days after another grand jury decided not to indict a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri in the death of black teenager Michael Brown. Sen. Chuck Schumer, also of New York, said he was confident Lynch will "conduct a tough but fair investigation into the tragic death of Eric Garner." Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican and would-be 2016 presidential contender who has specialized in reaching out to minority voters, blamed high taxes on cigarettes in the Empire State as partially to blame for putting police officers in "a dangerous situation with bad laws." . Protests featuring slogans like "Hands up, don't shoot," "Black lives matter" and now "I can't breathe" broke out again Wednesday in reaction to the Staten Island grand jury's decision as demonstrators called for justice for Garner and Brown, the black teenager who was shot by police officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson this summer. Amid outcry from Democrats on Capitol Hill and mostly silence from Congressional Republicans, two New York GOP Congressman defended the grand jury's decision Wednesday not to indict NYPD officer Pantaleo.
