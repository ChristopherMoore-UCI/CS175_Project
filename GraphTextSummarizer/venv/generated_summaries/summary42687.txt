This has left us humbled and hurt and searching for answers." Since the disaster, President Obama has ordered a review of mines with poor safety records. A preliminary report on the disaster by MSHA found that the Upper Big Branch mine had "a significant history of safety issues" and that the agency was closely monitoring Massey Energy. Stan Suboleski, a member of Massey's board of directors, acknowledged the company's Upper Big Branch Mine had a high number of citations for serious safety violations. In addition, Suboleski said, the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration required changes to the mine's ventilation system in September that company engineers found "significantly reduced" the amount of fresh air that reached the portion of the mine where work was taking place, and the company resisted that change "to the point of shutting down production for two days" before agreeing. -- Coal-producing giant Massey Energy defended its safety record Monday after the worst U.S. mine disaster in decades and rebuffed calls for its CEO to step down.
