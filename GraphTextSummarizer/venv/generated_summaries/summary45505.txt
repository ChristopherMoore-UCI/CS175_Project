-- Kenya's bar association is calling for the prosecution of men who publicly strip women because of the way they dress. After the videotaped incident, other instances of women getting undressed were reported, including in Mombasa, Kenya's second-largest city. Mutua urged Keriako Tobiko, director of public prosecutions, to take action and for the national police to form a special unit to patrol areas where these crimes are likely to happen. "The ongoing brutality that is stripping our women in public for allegedly dressing in an indecent manner must be brought to an end," Eric Mutua, chairman of the Law Society of Kenya, said in a statement.
