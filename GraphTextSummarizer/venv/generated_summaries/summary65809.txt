British forces will remain in Basra to train and supervise Iraqi forces. -- British Prime Minister Gordon Brown has dismissed a suggestion that a withdrawal by UK troops from their base in the southern Iraqi city of Basra was a defeat, insisting it was an "organized" move. During their time in Basra, British forces have helped the Iraqis take more responsibility for governing Basra, she said. Brown, speaking as 500 British troops completed their withdrawal from Basra Palace, said Monday troops would still be able to intervene in the city in "certain circumstances." This is a pre-planned, and this is an organized move from Basra Palace to Basra Air Station."
