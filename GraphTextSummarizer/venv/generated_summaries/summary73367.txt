When he got to Dallas on Thursday evening, airport police were waiting for the 29-year-old birthday celebrant because he was wanted on outstanding warrants, said David Magana, a spokesman for Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. "All indications are that this was hoax and a pretty nasty trick was played on this passenger," Philadelphia Police Chief Inspector Joseph Sullivan said Thursday morning. Just hours after being falsely accused of carrying explosive material onto a plane, Christopher Shell arrived in Dallas after being reboarding a flight from Philadelphia. Earlier Thursday, Shell was deemed the victim of a hoax that caused officials to order a US Airways flight on its way to Dallas to return to Philadelphia. He said someone called Philadelphia police and identified a passenger who the caller said was carrying a potentially explosive substance.
