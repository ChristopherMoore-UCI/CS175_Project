As a Duggar, Jessa abided by the rule of no kissing before marriage and the couple are said to have stepped into a room to privately share their first kiss after they wed on November 1. Those rules include only side hugs when courting, no hand holding until engagement, chaperoned dates and saving that first kiss until the couple is legally wed. It appears Jessa may have bent one of those rules as she reportedly gave Ben a full on frontal hug after he proposed following a romantic scavenger hunt in August. -- Looks like the former Jessa Duggar has made up for lost time. Fans got a chance to see the proposal and all that led up to it in a special titled "19 Kids & Counting: Jessa's Engagement" which aired this week.
