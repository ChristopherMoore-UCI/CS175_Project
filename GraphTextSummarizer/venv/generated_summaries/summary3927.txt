Those aspects of life can't be measured by the gross domestic product (GDP), long used as a key indicator of a nation's prosperity, British Prime Minister David Cameron says. " Initiatives regarded as good for growth sometimes have negative effects on the quality of life, he said -- such as loose controls on immigration, which can affect public services, or cheap prices on alcohol that can lead to more incidents of crime. Cameron said government can't legislate for fulfillment or satisfaction, but it can boost well-being by finding out what will improve lives and then acting on it. "When a city is torn apart by crime and disorder, that can increase GDP because of all the extra locks and security people buy. "In time it will lead to government policy that is more focused not just on the bottom line, but on all those things that make life worthwhile," he said.
