A 12-year-old male killer whale, who showed signs of being ill only the day before, died Tuesday afternoon at SeaWorld in San Diego, California, the park announced. "It's a very sad day," spokesman Dave Koontz told CNN. SeaWorld said its shows would resume on schedule Wednesday. The last killer whale to die at the San Diego venue was Splash, who was sickly when SeaWorld adopted him. Park veterinarians began a regimen of antibiotics to help try to stabilize his condition while they attempted to determine the cause of his illness," a SeaWorld statement said.
