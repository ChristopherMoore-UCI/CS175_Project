The most recent airstrikes were aimed at supporting Peshmerga fighters efforts to open a land corridor from Sinjar north to Dahuk in northern Iraq, officials said. The Kurdish military says it has "cleansed" the area of ISIS fighters with the help of coalition airstrikes. Kurdish Peshmerga forces say they've recaptured territory near Sinjar Mountain in northern Iraq, where dramatic airdrops were made last summer to the Yazidis, one of Iraq's smallest minorities. The plight of the Yazidis, coupled with the ISIS assault against Iraq's semiautonomous Kurdish region, prompted the United States to begin targeted airstrikes in Iraq last August. CNN and some other news organizations have primarily maintained the use of ISIS (for Islamic State in Iraq and Syria).
