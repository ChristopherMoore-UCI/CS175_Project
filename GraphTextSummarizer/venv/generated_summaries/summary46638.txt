A rep for Hewitt told CNN in a statement that the star and Hallisay - who is refered to as "her husband" - are "thrilled to announce the birth of their daughter, Autumn James Hallisay," but didn't mention anything about a wedding date. The 34-year-old actress appears to have quietly married her "Client List" co-star Brian Hallisay, 35, ahead of their first child's arrival on Wednesday. Hewitt and Hallisay first revealed that they were expecting a baby and planned to get married in June. "I lost my mom a little less than a year and a half ago to cancer," Hewitt told People magazine in September. At the time, the pair said that they were "looking forward to starting our family together," and Hewitt has been outspoken about embracing motherhood.
