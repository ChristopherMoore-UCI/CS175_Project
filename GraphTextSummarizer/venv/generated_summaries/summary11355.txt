Timeline: Same-sex marriage Many other states, including New Jersey, Illinois, Delaware, Rhode Island and Hawaii, have legalized domestic partnerships and civil unions for such couples -- a step designed in most cases to provide the same rights of marriage under state law. But other states have passed laws or state constitutional amendments banning such marriages. The federal law does not prohibit states from allowing same-sex marriages, but it also does not force states to recognize them from other states. In its split decision, the panel found that Proposition 8 "works a meaningful harm to gays and lesbians" by denying their right to civil marriage. California's governor and state attorney general have refused to defend Proposition 8 in court, leaving it to a private coalition of groups supporting the law to file the appeals.
