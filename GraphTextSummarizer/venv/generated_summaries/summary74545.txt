Explaining his decision to try out the racquet in Hamburg earlier this week, Federer said on the ATP Tour website: "I've been very close on numerous occasions to changing racquets in a bigger way. "After I lost at Wimbledon, I thought this is a good time to go and test the racquets, to take a bit of time off and then add some tournaments and see was there enough time to change or not. " Federer entered the Hamburg clay-court tournament to try and rediscover some form after a dismal Wimbledon. " Federer -- who dropped from third to fifth in the world rankings after his Wimbledon loss -- will now head home to Switzerland to play at Gstaad next week. The saying goes that a bad workman blames his tools but Roger Federer refused to pin a shock defeat in Hamburg on his new racquet.
