The Supreme Court's rejection ended the last legal maneuver for Gardner, 49, who is scheduled to face execution shortly after midnight Friday (2 a.m. ET) for the shooting death of attorney Michael Burdell during a botched escape attempt from custody in 1985 at a Salt Lake City, Utah, courthouse. As he awaited execution, Gardner watched the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy in an observational cell and read a novel by David Baldacci entitled "Divine Justice," said Utah Department of Corrections spokesman Steve Gehrke. "He asserts that executing him now, after nearly 25 years on death row in Utah, so lacks retributive or deterrent value that it violates the Eighth Amendment," Andrew Parnes, Gardner's lawyer, told the high court. The U.S. Supreme Court rejected a request Thursday to temporarily stay the execution of death row inmate Ronnie Lee Gardner, who is set to die before a Utah firing squad early Friday. "Mr. Gardner has had a full and fair opportunity to have his case considered by numerous tribunals."
