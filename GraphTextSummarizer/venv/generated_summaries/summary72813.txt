-- A Taliban leader has instructed fighters in Afghanistan to target U.S. and other coalition troops in response to the United States sending more troops into the war. The statement comes as U.S. troops begin increased deployments in Afghanistan. "The Taliban extremists are promising to bring more death and destruction to Afghanistan and limit the freedom of movement of all Afghans," Julian said. The statement also warned Afghans to not get "near U.S. troops anywhere because we will target them any where they are and if anybody is killed in a attack on them we will not be responsible for their death." A two-page statement sent to CNN instructs fighters to start new attacks against coalition troops and Afghan parliament members, and urges suicide bombers to strike.
