-- A group of British children and teachers quarantined for nearly a week in China because of swine flu fears were allowed to leave their hotel Tuesday, Britain's Foreign Office said. The students and teachers came from various schools in Britain and were all traveling to China together as members of the same British school association, the Specialist Schools and Academies Trust. Two students outside the Yan Xiang Hotel where a group of British children and teachers have been quarantined. Olivia Bishop, one of the teachers on the trip, said Chinese authorities pulled three students aside as soon as they landed at the airport because they had high temperatures. Two tested positive for mild symptoms of the virus, she said, and the rest of the group was able to continue with planned sightseeing.
