President Barack Obama has stirred up the Republican Party's inner-fundamentalist -- an angry, vengeful spirit currently being channeled by candidate Rick Santorum. There is more than a thematic connection between Santorum and the age of Buchanan. Santorum's campaign manager is Mike Biundo, who worked for Buchanan in 1996. Buchanan, she once told an interviewer, was "without euphemism, declaring that my own country was at war with me." His statewide staff is peppered with former Buchananites (Jim Finnegan and Ted Maravelias of New Hampshire, Michael Phillips and Craig R Bachler of Florida), and his list of endorsements is a roll call of '90s Christian conservatives: Gary Bauer, James Dobson, Phyllis Schlafly and Richard Viguerie.
