Best hike to remember A vertiginous tease, the hike from Keʻe Beach to Hanakapiʻai Falls can elicit awe, anticipation and impatience. Soon you'll reach Maha'ulepu Beach, where a pristine swath of velvety sand meets scattered rocks and relentless waves. That's why it draws some of the fittest and strongest from around the world, who've been lured by the notoriety of mastering this challenging stretch at ocean level. Explore for a bit at the wet caves or the inspired Limahuli Garden, winding up your afternoon at far-flung Keʻe Beach -- the ultimate sunset perch. Now every Friday is the Hanapepe Art Walk as galleries are open late and the strip is awash in looky-loos with a hankering for art.
