A March 29 letter from Black and Marquez Kelly's lawyer Brian Schall to Ark Music Factory obtained by Rolling Stone alleges that Ark has failed to provide Black with the master recordings of her song and video; has been exploiting her likeness and her song on YouTube, iTunes, Amazon and Ark's website; created an unauthorized "Friday" ringtone; and has been advertising Black as an exclusive Ark recording artist on its website. " Wilson's Ark Music Factory partner Clarence Jey contended that Ark did act as a record label for Black, and distributed and promoted her with her mother's consent -- until it became clear that Black was going to make actual money. Black -- whose song "Friday" hit Number 38 on Billboard's digital singles chart this week -- and her mother, Georgina Marquez Kelly, are accusing Ark Music Factory, which produced "Friday," of copyright infringement and unlawful exploitation of publicity rights. In an interview with Rolling Stone, Ark Music Factory founder Patrice Wilson denied most of the allegations in the letter. Why Rebecca Black's Much-Mocked Viral Hit 'Friday' is Actually Good "Georgina's trying to get the rights to things she doesn't have the rights to," said Ark Creative Director Barry Wayne.
