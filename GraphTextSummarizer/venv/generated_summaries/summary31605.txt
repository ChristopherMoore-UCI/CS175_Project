Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called the decision to free Palestinian prisoners one of the most difficult of his career. -- Israel released 26 Palestinian prisoners early Wednesday, part of an agreement that fueled new peace talks. The issue of Israeli settlements derailed the last round of direct talks, in 2010, and critics of Netanyahu say building on disputed territory could derail the new talks. Israel released more than two dozen Palestinian prisoners in August on the eve of new peace talks. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas welcomed the prisoners' release, describing it as a "day of joy."
