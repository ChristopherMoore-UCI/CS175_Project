" In collating forest biodiversity research for CNN, the Secretariat highlighted one example that shows the astonishing variety of life: Yasuni National Park in Ecuador is less than 0.5% of the Amazon basin but estimated to contain 100,000 species of insects -- or about the same as the whole of North America. "The exact number of species which depend on tropical rainforests is not known -- but they are very old ecosystems that have survived ice ages and allowed uninterrupted evolution over millions of years. Although many millions of species are known to inhabit this ecosystem, quantifying precisely how many plants and animals rely on the rainforest is difficult. And new species are being discovered all the time. David Ainsworth of the Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity told CNN: "It is estimated that at least two-thirds of all Earth's terrestrial species are found in tropical forests.
