NATO officials acknowledge there are trust issues to overcome with Russia. When NATO leaders meet this weekend with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, they plan to endorse a new Russia/NATO partnership to work on issues such as terrorism, Afghanistan and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. NATO still has the core mandate to provide collective security for all its members, said Daalder, but now must address new threats to Europe's security -- threats not as much from Russia, but from possible terrorist attacks, cyber attacks, attacks on energy infrastructure and piracy on the high seas. Still, they hope the substantial common interests NATO shares with Russia make cooperation possible. While NATO forces are increasingly successful against the Taliban, it remains very unclear whether Afghan President Hamid Karzai's government will be able to sustain the "holding and building" of the provinces once they are transferred.
