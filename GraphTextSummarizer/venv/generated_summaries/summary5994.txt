" Gerrard will continue playing football -- but not in the English Premier League -- and Italian journalist Gianluca di Marzio has reported that U.S. club LA Galaxy are interested in signing the Liverpool midfielder. Liverpool must prepare for life without one its greatest ever players after captain Steven Gerrard confirmed he will leave the club at the end of the 2014-2015 season. However, his long-cherished desire to win the Premier League never materialized -- Liverpool came close in 2009 finishing second to Manchester United and last season Brendan Rodgers' side were pipped to the post by Manchester City. It was Gerrard's looping headed goal early in the second half that sparked Liverpool's remarkable recovery. His greatest achievement came in 2005 when he captained Liverpool to victory in the Champions League final against AC Milan in Istanbul.
