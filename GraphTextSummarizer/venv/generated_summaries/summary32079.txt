Lanza moved to Connecticut from Kingston, New Hampshire, with his parents and older brother Ryan, according to a booklet for the town's Newtown's Bennetts Farm neighborhood. " Alex Israel was in the same class at Newtown High School with Lanza, and lived a few houses down from him. On Friday morning, Lanza walked into Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, dressed in black battle fatigues and a military vest" and began firing, according to a law enforcement source. Others in Newtown who knew Lanza said they had no idea he'd ever be responsible for such horror. Before Friday's rampage, authorities said, Lanza killed his mother in their home in Newtown's Sandy Hook community.
