Michael Murphy was christened Saturday by his mother, Maureen, at Bath Iron Works shipyard in Maine. "I feel not only Michael's presence, but that ship embodies the spirits of Michael and his teammates," Murphy's father, Daniel, told CNN. " Murphy's team -- on a mission to go after a Taliban leader -- was ambushed when the troops were outnumbered by Taliban fighters. Murphy was honored for his courage by running into a clearing to call for help despite exposing himself to enemy fire. It says, "Michael Murphy," but among its admirers, it's already being called "the Murph."
