With more people upgrading to smartphones, issues over productivity and stress will surely rise as more executives find the line between work and leisure time blurring. The task, Khaki estimates, should have taken about 20 minutes but ended up taking three times as long because of BlackBerry monitoring. But according to a British occupational psychologist, persistent monitoring of your BlackBerry will increase stress levels and most likely decrease productivity too. "Low" users would generally allocate specific times to check their BlackBerry and respond to emails. "People who fell into the high user category tend to have a distorted perception of their own usage and they equate their BlackBerry use with being dedicated to the job," Khaki told CNN.
