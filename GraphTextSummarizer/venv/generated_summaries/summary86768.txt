-- Unknown gunmen fired into a crowd of people outside an elementary school in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, Wednesday afternoon, killing one person and injuring four others, a Juarez municipal police spokesman said. Ciudad Juarez is across the border from El Paso, Texas, and has been the scene of some of Mexico's worst violence in recent years. The gunmen caught up to them outside of the school and fired into the crowd without caring about the people there," municipal police spokesman Adrian Sanchez said. Earlier this week, the Chihuahua state government said that 225 women have been murdered in Juarez this year. School was in session at the time of the shooting at 2 p.m. local time (3 p.m. ET), but none of the children were injured, Sanchez said.
