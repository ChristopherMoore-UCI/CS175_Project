At Yosemite National Park in California, all programs at the park's Mariposa Grove are cancelled; the Shark Valley Visitor Center at Florida's Everglades National Park is eliminating 60% of its programs due to staff reductions; and Petersburg National Battlefield in Virginia is cutting its offerings by more than half. And at Glacier National Park in Montana, reduced seasonal hiring at the end of the summer will result in less maintenance, mowing, rock removal, patching, striping and shoulder dressing along the Going to the Sun Road and other main park roads. At Acadia National Park in Maine, the winter closure of park facilities was extended by an extra month. Similar delays have happened in Bryce Canyon National Park in Utah and Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado. Other examples include the Maggie L. Walker National Historic Site in Virginia, which will close on Mondays, and the visitor centers at Voyageurs National Park in Minnesota, which will be closed two days a week.
