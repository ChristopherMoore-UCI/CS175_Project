" Fossati returned to Al Sadd this year after being sacked by Saudi club Al-Shahab in December, having last worked in Qatar as national coach in 2008. The Ivory Coast striker put Al Sadd ahead in the 69th minute, but the hosts equalized when substitute Lee Sung-hyun headed home in stoppage time. "I am particularly disappointed that I became injured at a crucial time and I am very sorry to all the home fans that I could not show my full potential in this game tonight," said the 32-year-old, who started the final on the bench after picking up a knock in the first leg of the semi against Saudi side Al Ittihad. Coach Jorge Fossati was delighted with his player after Al Sadd booked a place at the FIFA World Club Cup in December. Saqr saved penalties from Kim Dong-chan and Park Won-jae, while Al Sadd's South Korea international defender Lee Jung-Soo hit the crossbar before Algeria's Nadir Belhadj netted the decisive spot-kick.
