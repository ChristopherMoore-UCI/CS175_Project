-- Tiger Woods won his first golf tournament in more than two years, narrowly defeating fellow American Zach Johnson to capture the Chevron World Challenge title Sunday. Woods finished three strokes under par for the day, allowing him to leapfrog Johnson for the one-stroke win at the Sherwood Country Club in Thousand Oaks, California, according to the PGA Tour's website. The victory was the 35-year-old golfer's first since capturing the Australian Masters title in November 2009. In April, Woods likely will be among those battling in the season's first major, The Masters, which he has won four times.
