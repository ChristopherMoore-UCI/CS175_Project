It is likely that Kim Jong Un's uncle, Jang Song Thaek, will rule behind the scenes as Kim Jong Un trains on the job, the global intelligence firm Stratfor said. -- As North Koreans face an uncertain future without Kim Jong Il, the world's attention now turns to his youngest son, Kim Jong Un, whom the ruling Workers' Party has dubbed the "great successor. In contrast, Kim Jong Il himself was groomed over a period of 14 years before taking the reins from his father, Kim Il Sung, in 1994. But Kim Jong Un is simply "not ready" to rule, said Victor Cha, senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and an expert on North Korea. Kim Jong Un is said to have a fondness for James Bond and basketball star Michael Jordan.
