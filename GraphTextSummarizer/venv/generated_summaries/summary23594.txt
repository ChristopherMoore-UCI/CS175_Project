This year, for the first time ever, BBC America is airing the "Doctor Who" Christmas special at 9 p.m. ET on Christmas Day -- the same day BBC airs the special in the UK. But the show gets a friendly reception for being so "fringe." CBS late night talk show host Craig Ferguson -- who grew up watching "Doctor Who" in Scotland -- filmed an extravagant opening segment set to the "Doctor Who" theme song, on the night that he interviewed Smith. This year's Christmas special, written by lead writer and executive producer, Steven Moffat, is called "A Christmas Carol," and features Matt Smith as the 11th Doctor, a grumpy, Scrooge-like Michael Gambon (plays Professor Dumbledore in the "Harry Potter" movies) and opera singer Katherine Jenkins. All that downloading "means (American fans) love the shows so much they can't wait to see them," Richard de Croce, senior vice president of programming at BBC America said. Since 2005, American fans of the franchise had to wait days, even weeks to see re-broadcasts of episodes and special events, first on Sci Fi Channel (now Syfy) and now on BBC America.
