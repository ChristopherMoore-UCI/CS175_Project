The 24-year-old singer also drew cheers by proposing a new law, titled, "If you don't like it, go home," which would remove homophobic straight soldiers from the military instead of gay soldiers. In addition to speaking at Monday's rally, Gaga has used her online presence to rally her fans -- nicknamed "Little Monsters" -- in support of repeal. "Shouldn't everyone deserve the right to wear the same meat dress that I do?" asked the singer, who caught flak for showing up at MTV's Video Music Awards in a dress made of raw meat. Declaring that "Equality is the prime rib of America," pop star Lady Gaga urged Maine's two U.S. senators to help break a Republican filibuster on legislation that includes a repeal of the military's ban on openly homosexual service members. "Repeal 'don't ask, don't tell' or go home."
