Iraqi Kurdish fighters join Kobani fight Situated on the Turkish border, Kobani is seen by many as a key battleground in ISIS' fight to expand its already vast territory in Syria. International authorities, witnesses and people in the middle of yearslong strife in Syria and Iraq have accused ISIS of many misdeeds and war crimes in the past, including enslaving young women and children. But rather than relief and celebration, scores of Syrian Kurdish children say they endured torture and humiliation -- at the hands of ISIS. Some of the boys escaped, were released or were swapped for captive ISIS fighters between June and September. "They (ISIS) told them to give them the addresses of their families, cousins, uncles, saying, 'When we go to Kobani, we will get them and cut them up,'" the boy said.
