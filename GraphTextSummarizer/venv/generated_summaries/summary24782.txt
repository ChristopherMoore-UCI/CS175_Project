CNN: What's on your playlist when you're traveling from city to city? The rapper, born Jermaine Cole, has been making waves lately -- from rumors of an alleged sex tape with touring buddy Rihanna that the singer has dismissed as nonsense to a guest verse on the video for Beyonce's latest single, "Party." -- Get ready to hear a lot more from J Cole. Not too shabby for a guy who only a few years ago was graduating magna cum laude from St. John's University in New York. The up-and-coming artist -- who was one of the first signed to Jay-Z's Roc Nation label -- recently spoke with CNN about his album, "Cole World: The Sideline Story," why he needs to watch his jump shot, and who he rocks on his playlist.
