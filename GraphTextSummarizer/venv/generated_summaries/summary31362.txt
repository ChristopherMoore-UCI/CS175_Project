" Fonseka, who led troops to victory over Tamil Tiger rebels exactly three years ago this week, had fallen out of favor with Rajapaksa and his powerful brother, Defense Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa. " Television footage showed Fonseka walking out of prison Monday after Justice Secretary Kamalini de Silva sent paperwork to prison authorities ordering his release. Last year, Fonseka was found guilty of "inciting violence" for alleging in a newspaper interview that Gotabhaya Rajapaksa had ordered the shooting of rebel leaders who were surrendering with white flags during the final stages of the civil war in May 2009. Under the Sri Lankan constitution, the president is empowered to pardon "any offender convicted of any offense in any court of Sri Lanka." President Mahinda Rajapaksa had signed an order and placed it with the Justice Ministry before he flew to Doha to attend the Qatar Forum, according to his spokesperson Bandula Jayasekera. That split came after Fonseka unsuccessfully challenged Rajapaksa in early 2010 presidential elections.
