It should be pointed out that conservatives, criticized by liberals as health care and welfare slashers and greedy capitalists, give far more to charity than liberals. Arthur Brooks wrote in his now-famous book, "Who Really Cares," that households headed by conservatives give 30% more to charity than households headed by liberals. The Chronicle of Philanthropy, which tracks the corporate giving of America's largest companies, recently reported that in 2010, a very tough financial year, total cash donations by this group rose 13%, to $4.9 billion. "There is a reason the world always looks to America," Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard said in an address to Congress this year. China, which boasts the second largest economy in the world, is one of the least generous nations on Earth when it comes to charitable contributions.
