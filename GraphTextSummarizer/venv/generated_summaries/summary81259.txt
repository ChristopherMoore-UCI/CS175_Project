His last court appearance on November 10 was adjourned after prosecutors requested psychological assessments of the former employee of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. However, the case has been adjourned until July next year to allow for more than 200 pieces of forensic and DNA evidence to be analyzed. CNN's Vivian Kam, Jonathan Stayton and Andrew Stevens in Hong Kong contributed to this report. Rurik Jutting has been in custody since November 1 following the discovery of the bodies of the two women at his home in an upscale residential complex in the city's Wan Chai district. The defense had questioned the length of the latest adjournment, but prosecutors pointed out that the government's forensics department estimated a 28-week period for sifting through the body of evidence.
