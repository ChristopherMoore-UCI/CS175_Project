"I knew one day he will reveal me." Of the 245 people in the United States whom DNA testing has exonerated, none has spent more time behind bars than Bain, according to the Innocence Project, a national organization dedicated to exonerating wrongfully convicted people through such testing. The victim, now 44, lives in Florida and was made aware of Bain's situation, according to multiple sources. Bain submitted handwritten motions four times seeking such testing but was denied each time. Polk County State Attorney Jerry Hill told the judge that DNA testing had excluded Bain from the crime. In 2001, Florida passed a statute allowing cases to be reopened for DNA testing.
