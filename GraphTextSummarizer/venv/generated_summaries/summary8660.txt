These studies show that violent video games increase aggressive thoughts, angry feelings, physiological arousal (e.g., heart rate, blood pressure), and aggressive behavior. My colleagues and I found that typical college students who played violent video games for 20 minutes at a time for three consecutive days showed increasingly higher levels of aggressive behavior each day they played. The problem is that people are looking for a yes-or-no answer about the role of video games in violence, when there is none. Violent video games are just one more factor that may be pushing them toward violence. Controlling the use of violent video games is one step we can take to help protect our society from violence.
