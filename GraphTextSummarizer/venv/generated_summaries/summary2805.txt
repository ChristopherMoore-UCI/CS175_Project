"As a film director, it takes a lot of efforts and good movies for people to remember you, but having excessive children had ruined it all," he said, according to Xinhua, China's state news agency. All I can say is that this is nothing to him," Sina Weibo user__729_ wrote on China's equivalent of Twitter. A letter sent to Zhang by the family planning bureau of Binhu District of Wuxi City, Jiangsu province in eastern China on Thursday demanded that he pay a penalty for having two "beyond-the-quota" children. The letter was posted on the district's official account on Sina Weibo, China's Twitter-like microblogging service. Zhang's breach of the policy has set off a firestorm, especially among some netizens who resent how the rich and famous in China flout rules and policies.
