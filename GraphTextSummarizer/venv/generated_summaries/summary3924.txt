Ashtiani's attorney, Mohammad Mostafaei, has gone into hiding since last weekend after being interrogated by Iranian authorities, human rights groups say. Iran's judiciary could reinstate her sentence of death by stoning, execute her by other means, or possibly even grant her a reprieve, according to human rights groups. -- Despite international pressure, Iran said Tuesday that it rejects Brazil's offer of asylum for an Iranian woman sentenced to death by stoning. Iranian authorities say the sentence has been put on hold, but there have been no reports as to whether a new sentence has been imposed. Advocates and Mostafaei say his wife and brother-in-law are being held by Iranian authorities.
