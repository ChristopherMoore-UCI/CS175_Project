After his re-election, Obama extended Bush-era tax cuts for all but the wealthiest Americans, making good on his campaign effort to make them pay a little more in the coming years. None of these, in the long run, might be as important as his efforts to help the economy, which, ironically, has felt stronger just as Americans' faith in Obama to steer it has dwindled. But while the stock market has rallied during the Obama presidency -- the Dow Jones Industrial Average has nearly doubled during his time in office -- the divide between wealthy and struggling Americans has grown exponentially. The economy for years has been the issue that Americans want politicians to fix. Stephen Weatherford, a political science professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, said Americans have short memories. "To a kind of ironic extent, if presidents come in facing big problems and they're able to do something to solve those problems, people don't evaluate them based on those problems," he said.
