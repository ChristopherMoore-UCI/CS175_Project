They want to paint them as "others." Both Obama, the nation's first black president, and Romney, a Mormon, have found that their shared status as members of minority groups and political pioneers, in many ways, has also changed the rules of this presidential campaign cycle, said Nancy Wadsworth, co-editor of the anthology "Faith and Race in American Political Life." Obama's delayed response after unarmed black teen Trayvon Martin was shot indicated the president and his advisers were "gauging the cultural landscape," said Mark Anthony Neal, an African-American studies professor at Duke University and the author of several books, including "New Black Man: Rethinking Black Masculinity." Race serves Romney because his whiteness reads him as insider. Obama has faltered a bit in the past while navigating the thorny issue of race. Hundreds of evangelical alumni and students at Liberty University, an institution founded by Rev. Jerry Falwell, balked on Facebook when the school invited Romney to speak at commencement.
