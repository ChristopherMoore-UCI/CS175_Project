Reflective though his new solo work is, Albarn is in playful mood and shows his love of performing and collaborating: he willingly shares the limelight with other musicians, such as Mali's Afel Bocoum and Madou Diabete, Blur guitarist Graham Coxon, rappers De La Soul and legendary producer Brian Eno. Easy, as Albarn announces -- only half-believing it himself -- the arrival of Brian Eno, the legendary musician, composer and record producer, to sing the wonderful "Heavy Seas of Love," from this year's album, with the Leytonstone choir and Madou. but we've decided it's just a big pub," Damon Albarn tells the audience at a packed Royal Albert Hall, assembled for the Blur and Gorillaz star's first concert in his own right at London's most prestigious music venue. The concert is about far more than just promoting his new record though: effectively it revisits many of the many musical moments of his long and varied career, from his foray into world music with Africa Express, his animation side-project Gorillaz, supergroup The Good, the Bad and the Queen, and of course his first band, Blur. He and his band are superbly tight, as we get one highlight to the next, from "Kids with Guns," and "Don't Get Lost in Heaven," to the spine-tingling experience of Albarn alone at the piano singing Blur's "Out of Time."
