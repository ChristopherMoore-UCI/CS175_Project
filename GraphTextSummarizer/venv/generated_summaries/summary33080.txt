African art has inspired painters from Picasso to Matisse, and while the uninitiated might think of African art in terms of traditional statues and masks, contemporary African art is thriving. -- With year-round sunshine, Johannesburg is the perfect city for outdoor events, but it also hosts an array of cultural happenings. Last year's Arts Alive featured high-brow events including jazz performances at Zoo Lake and a student film festival, as well more visceral fare, with the likes of DJ Krush delivering electronic beats in Newtown. Centered around the Newton Cultural Precinct, Arts Alive is one of the biggest cultural events in Africa, with live music, theater, visual arts happenings, poetry readings and stand-up comedy. Displays include paintings, installations, photography, moving images and furniture, and ticket holders can also attend talks by local artists and international guests.
