The Langtry Estate & Vineyard in Middletown in nearby Lake County was advised to evacuate, Cal Fire spokeswoman Stacie McCambridge told CNN affiliate KGO. "There are some small vineyards in the general area but nothing major," said Cal Fire spokesman Daniel Berlant. As California faces what officials call probably the worst drought in a century, fire officials say it will exacerbate the state's wildfire season, which appears to have begun months earlier than normal. A 4,300-acre wildfire in California's Napa County was barely under control Thursday and is now threatening at least one vineyard in a nearby area, authorities said. Firefighters were defending about 180 structures Thursday and were laboring in high heat, humidity and the possibility of erratic winds in steep, rugged terrain in rural areas of the two counties, Cal Fire said.
