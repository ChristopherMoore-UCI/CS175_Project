North Korea government has warned the United States that its "citadels" will be attacked, dwarfing the hacking attack on Sony. "We have made clear that we will respond to the DPRK's misbehavior," said Sung Kim, the U.S. special representative for North Korea policy. A North Korean ambassador insisted that his country had nothing to do with the massive computer hack at Sony and called for the United States, which has blamed North Korea, to provide evidence. At a briefing on the subject, Rep. Ed Royce, a California Republican and chairman of the House Foreign Relations Committee, called to "cut off hard currency" so North Korea cannot carry out offensive attacks like the cyber attacks. Sony Pictures made "The Interview," a comedy depicting the assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
