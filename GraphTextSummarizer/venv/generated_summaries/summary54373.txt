-- Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer on Monday deflected concerns that the state's new immigration law will hurt economic development, saying many businesses have long wanted tougher action. Would you boycott Arizona over immigration law? "The bottom line is that when I go about meeting with businesses that come into Arizona ... they want to know that we have a safe and secure environment into which to move their businesses here," Brewer said at an Arizona Town Hall event in Tucson. Brewer signed the controversial legislation into law on Friday. Critics say the law could foster racial profiling and prompt businesses, conventions and tourists to stay away from the state.
