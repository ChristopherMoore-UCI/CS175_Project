The FAO defines undernourishment as "the condition of people whose dietary energy consumption is continuously below a minimum dietary energy requirement for maintaining a healthy life and carrying out a light physical activity with an acceptable minimum body weight for attained height. " The most undernourished nation on the list, at least by percentage, is the Democratic Republic of Congo. That's at least 847.5 million people, most of whom live in sub-Saharan Africa or Asia and the Pacific. Because of political turmoil within the country, the FAO has not been able to gather dependable statistics for the country. That's because, like many developed nations, its undernourished rate is under 5%.
