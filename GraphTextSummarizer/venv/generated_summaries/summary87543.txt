North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory still must sign the measure into law, and if he does, Charles Holt hopes to go to Raleigh and shake his hand. If signed by the governor, North Carolina would become the first state to compensate sterilization victims. After going back and forth on the issue for 10 years, on Thursday the North Carolina legislature agreed to give $10 million to victims. Holt was 19 and  living in an institution for boys in Butner, North Carolina when he was given a vasectomy without his consent. "It's been a long hard fight," said state Rep. Larry Womble, who championed the cause.
