To compile the annual list, Lonely Planet asks its U.S. staff, authors and contributors to nominate urban and natural spots, popular and lesser known sites, and locations that have something significant happening in 2015. Lonely Planet's top 10 U.S. destinations for 2015 list includes cities marking important anniversaries, wide open natural spaces and hidden city gems that will soon be popular. "There are lots of great things happening all over the country, and you should really come out and see it for yourself," St. Louis said.
