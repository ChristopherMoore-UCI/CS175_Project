-- Despite deep public spending cuts that triggered waves of protests last year, Greece will not default on its debt payment obligations, Prime Minister George Papandreou told CNN. The economic troubles in Greece last year sparked a wave of sovereign debt woes across Europe, especially hitting Ireland, Spain and Portugal. Besides debt woes in Greece, countries like Ireland and Spain were deeply exposed to the crash of the housing bubble. Concern has grown of an unfair burden placed on larger economies by the problems of smaller economies like Greece. But European Monetary Union has been challenged as the bailout of Greece thrust the spotlight on the uneven economics among member nations.
