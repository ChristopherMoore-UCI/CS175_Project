The bloodshed appears to mark a new round of violence to hit Iraq in recent months, much of it stemming from decades-old discord between the nation's Sunnis and Shiites, the two largest branches of Islam. Nasiriya is located in the heavily Shiite region of southern Iraq and is about 400 kilometers outside of Baghdad. According to figures released by the U.N. Assistance Mission for Iraq, 1,057 Iraqis were killed and another 2,326 were wounded in acts of terrorism and violence last month. In a press release Saturday, the State Department said the attacks "bear the hallmarks of suicide and vehicle attacks in Iraq over the past ninety days" and said most of those attacks were committed by al Qaeda in Iraq, which is led by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The Islamic State of Iraq, an umbrella group that includes al Qaeda in Iraq, claimed responsibility for Saturday's attacks on Sunday.
