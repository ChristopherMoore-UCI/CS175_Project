Of the two experts who testified in defense of the boy, only one used the word and he used it just once, attorney Reagan Wynn told CNN's "New Day." The case made national headlines after a witness claimed Couch was a victim of "affluenza" -- the product of wealthy, privileged parents who never set limits for the Texas boy. The family of a teen critically injured when another teen, Ethan Couch, drove drunk last year has reached a settlement of more than $2 million. Earlier this year, a lawyer representing Couch, who was 16 at the time of the wreck last June, lashed out at the news media for their focus on the use of "affluenza" to describe the boy's privileged upbringing. Last June, Hollie Boyles, and daughter, Shelby, left their home to help Breanna Mitchell, whose SUV had broken down.
