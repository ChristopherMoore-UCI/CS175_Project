The U.S. military first detained Manning in May 2010 for leaking U.S. combat video -- including a U.S. helicopter gunship attack posted on WikiLeaks -- and classified State Department cables. During the proceeding, Manning spent more than an hour reading a statement that detailed why and how he sent classified material to WikiLeaks, a group that facilitates the anonymous leaking of secret information through its website. Manning said he passed on information that "upset" or "disturbed" him but didn't give WikiLeaks anything he thought would harm the United States if it were made public. Bradley Manning, accused in the largest leak of classified documents in U.S. history, have adopted the phrase: "I am Bradley Manning." WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of its information.
