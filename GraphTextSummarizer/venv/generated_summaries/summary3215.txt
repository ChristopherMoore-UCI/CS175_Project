-- A bat that apparently had trouble flying instead tried to hitch a ride on the space shuttle Discovery, NASA officials said. Discovery's seven-member crew, which lifted off from Kennedy Space Center on Sunday, is on a 14-day mission to deliver supplies needed to expand the International Space Station. NASA officials had hoped the bat would fly away on its own, but admitted the bat probably died quickly during Discovery's climb into orbit. The crew of the Discovery safely docked at the International Space Station on Tuesday. The animal was last seen clinging on the foam of the external tank of the space shuttle moments before the Discovery launched, officials said.
