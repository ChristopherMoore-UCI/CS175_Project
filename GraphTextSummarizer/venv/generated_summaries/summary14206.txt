Garth Brooks works weekends in Vegas His youngest daughter Allie graduated from high school in May, relieving Brooks of his paternal duty to drive his kids from his farm in Owasso, Oklahoma, to school each morning and be there for every soccer match. "To do what the city manager suggests (play three shows and not all five) means I agree that is how people should be treated and I just can't agree with that." While the promoter surrendered Tuesday, saying it had "exhausted all avenues regarding the staging of this event," the note revealed that Brooks held out some hope. The traffic, noise and "potential antisocial behaviour" by Brooks fans could add up to "an unacceptable level of disruption" for Dublin residents, the council said. The promoter, saying Brooks insisted on five shows or none at all, announced Tuesday that all concerts of "The Garth Brooks Comeback Special Event" were canceled and the 400,000 tickets sold would be refunded. The council approved Friday, Saturday and Sunday shows, but rejected licenses for Monday and Tuesday night concerts.
