Children with asthma or a history of breathing problems are particularly susceptible for severe symptoms. Anyone can get infected with enteroviruses, according to the CDC, but infants, children and teens are more likely to become sick because they have not yet built up immunity from previous exposures to the viruses. Unfortunately in the beginning it's difficult -- if not impossible -- to tell the difference between a regular cold and this type of virus. Plenty of rest, fluids and over-the-counter medications will help ease symptoms in standard cases. Twelve states are investigating clusters of enterovirus illnesses: Alabama, Colorado, Michigan, Georgia, Ohio, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma, Kentucky and Utah.
