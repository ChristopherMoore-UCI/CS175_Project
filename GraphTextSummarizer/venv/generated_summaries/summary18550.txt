"We never wanted to address losing Dr. King's life here," said former Memphis City Councilman Berlin Boyd, who helped lead the street-naming effort. Born and raised in Memphis, Boyd, 34, said he always wondered why there was no official street tribute for King. A nearly 1-mile stretch of Linden Avenue will be renamed Dr. M.L. King Jr. Avenue on Wednesday, the anniversary of the civil rights leader's assassination. More than 900 U.S. cities have streets named after King. The Rev. Jesse Jackson, who was with King at the Lorraine, said the assassination left Memphis with a deep sense of pain and guilt.
