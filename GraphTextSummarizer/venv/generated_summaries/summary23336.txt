The existence of a cutoff low pattern occurs most commonly in Southern Europe, according to a 2004 study of cutoff low systems in the Northern Hemisphere. "High water levels contaminate water treatment plants leaving thousands without drinking water," Ramos explained. You might think, more water means more power, but that is not necessarily the case. Many smaller power stations are flooded -- some temporarily, while others are permanently damaged." Rivers in the Balkans also represent the main supply of fresh water. Eventually the warm air will wrap completely around, creating a pocket of cold air within the core of the low pressure system.
