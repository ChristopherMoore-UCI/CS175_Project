"DHS is responsible for ensuring it is adequately prepared to continue critical operations in the event of a pandemic," Inspector General John Roth said in a news release. For example, the audit found more than 4,000 bottles of expired hand sanitizer in storage with the DHS. Some 81% of the antiviral drugs the DHS has will expire by the end of next year. The report concluded "it is imperative that DHS be prepared to continue mission-essential operations should a pandemic occur," and yet it found that DHS didn't develop a clear plan on how to replenish their stockpiles of equipment. Investigators say there is "no justification or related documentation" available to support that number of suits, nor does any kind of documentation explain why they were necessary.
