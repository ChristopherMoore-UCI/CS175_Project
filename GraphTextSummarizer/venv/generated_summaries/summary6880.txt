EW critics disagree on 'Skyfall' "Skyfall's" debut marks the seventh-best November opening weekend of all time — behind two "Twilight" films and four "Harry Potter" titles — and the film, which Sony and MGM spent about $200 million to make, garnered an impressive $25,050 per theater average from 3,505 theaters. And now "Skyfall" has improved upon "Quantum's" opening weekend by 30 percent. "Skyfall's" most popular international territory has been the United Kingdom, where it has earned £72.9 million ($117.5 million) in 17 days, already establishing it as the fourth highest grossing film in British history. "Skyfall's" per-theater average was even more impressive in IMAX locations, where the film found $13.1 million (15 percent of its weekend gross) from 320 screens, good for a $40,938 average. After four years off of the silver screen, James Bond made his triumphant return this weekend in "Skyfall" — and the British spy's appeal was bigger than ever.
