A wave, a long wave, stretched shore to shore, beneath a panorama of snow and icy-gray November splendor in Alaska's Cook Inlet. There are a few dozen tidal bores shredding the globe, in all climates and perhaps most dramatically in Canada's Bay of Fundy. Now we entered hyper-drive to document a traveler's surprise: We wanted to catch a wave and a surfer on camera. During a prior trip, we played a hunch and found Sarah Palin voting in a hockey rink on Super Tuesday and had a nice live chat in 2012. Alaska gave Jeff and me our first glimpse of a tidal bore.
