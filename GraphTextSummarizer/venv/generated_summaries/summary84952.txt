A judge who investigated the Gran Rex theater said the bomb was set to be detonated around 4:30 p.m. Wednesday afternoon, when former Colombian President Alvaro Uribe is scheduled to speak. Human rights groups are planning a demonstration Wednesday afternoon near the theater to protest the former Colombian president's participation in the symposium. Uribe was Colombia's president from 2002-2010, and was known for his focus on improving security and his tough stance on leftist guerrillas. Uribe is scheduled to speak on at an international entrepreneurs conference Wednesday at the Gran Rex, one of the largest theaters in Buenos Aires. Later Tuesday, federal police said the bomb was designed more to cause commotion than serious damage, and had been set to go off on Tuesday afternoon, according to the state-run Telam news agency.
