-- Britain's Prince Philip, the husband of Queen Elizabeth II, is "responding well" to hospital treatment for a recurrence of a bladder infection, Buckingham Palace said Thursday. The queen and the Duke of Edinburgh also gave a garden party at Balmoral Castle last week. However, he appeared in good form this week as he fulfilled several engagements on the Isle of Wight, off the south coast of England. The longest-serving consort in British history, Philip married then-Princess Elizabeth in November 1947 at Westminster Abbey. Before the bladder infection, which he initially contracted during events marking the queen's diamond jubilee, he spent four nights in a hospital over the Christmas holiday last year for treatment of a blocked coronary artery.
