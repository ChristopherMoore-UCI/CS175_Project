Karzai wants a promise from the United States that there will be no more raids on Afghan homes, and that Afghan prisoners will be released from the Guantanamo Bay detention center. "If U.S. military forces conduct military operations on Afghan homes even one more time, then there will be no BSA and we won't sign it," Karzai said Sunday. Despite rousing approval by the vast majority of Afghan elders, Afghanistan's security deal with the United States still hangs in the balance. President Hamid Karzai says he won't sign it until some conditions are met. In his speech at the jirga, Karzai had already threatened not to sign, if the sensitive issue of house raids was not addressed.
