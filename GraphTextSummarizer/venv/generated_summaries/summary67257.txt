England's League Cup fourth round saw an immediate return to winning ways for Manchester United after their 6-1 defeat to Manchester City Sunday in the EPL. Udinese and Lazio are not playing until Wednesday as Juve took full advantage to regain the leadership they held until a 2-2 draw against Genoa Saturday. -- Xavi Hernandez scored the only goal of the game with a thunderous free kick as Barcelona beat nine-man Granada Tuesday to return to the top of La Liga. The Spanish champions, held 0-0 at home by Sevilla at the weekend, once again found goals hard to come by against their struggling opponents. Strikers Dimitar Berbatov and Michael Owen, who have been frozen out of league action, scored the opening two goals with Antonio Valencia getting the third.
