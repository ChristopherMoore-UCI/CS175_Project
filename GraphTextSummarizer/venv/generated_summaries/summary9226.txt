In Texas alone the agricultural damage caused by hogs is estimated to be $52 million dollars annually. What looks to be the path of a devastating tornado in America's heartland is actually the result of a small group of feral hogs in the Lone Star state. Being a lifelong big game hunter, I fully support any legal method of helping lower the population of feral hogs. In fact, trapped hogs in Texas are often sold to independent buyers who sell these swines overseas to Asian markets. I've hunted wild hogs in the swamplands of Florida.
