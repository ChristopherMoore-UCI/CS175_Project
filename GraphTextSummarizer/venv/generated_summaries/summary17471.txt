Appeals court scrutinizes Virginia same-sex marriage ban But it's similar to a spate of federal rulings in recent months because the initial ruling that kicked off the process knocked down Arkansas law barring same-sex marriages. Higher courts later stayed those decisions on appeal, but not before some same-sex couples married. The Arkansas case is an entirely in-state matter, involving a local county court and the state's Supreme Court. In recent months, federal judges have found restrictions limiting marriage to one man and one woman to be unconstitutional in several other states.
