The man's body was found Monday less than 150 feet from shore, Coast Guard spokesman Ricardo Castrodad said. The private plane, chartered by Tropical Aviation Corp., took off from the Dominican Republic and was on its way to an airport in Puerto Rico when it went down Sunday evening, officials said. "The wind was blowing very hard, so much that we couldn't go out in the boat any day." As they left Sunday night, group members hugged Lecaroz and talked about returning later this month to fish and golf, he said. -- Rescuers have found the body of a man who was one of six people aboard a small airplane that crashed Sunday evening near the northern shore of Puerto Rico, the U.S. Coast Guard said. In the Dominican Republic, meanwhile, a man who said he spent the weekend with the missing passengers said he urged them not to leave Sunday night because of severe weather.
