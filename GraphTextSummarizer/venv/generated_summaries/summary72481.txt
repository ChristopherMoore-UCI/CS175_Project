In the western town of Tal Kalakh, rebel fighters stand their ground as government forces loom just yards away. While the opposition Free Syrian Army controls Tal Kalakh, the town is surrounded by regime troops. " Abu Udey says the men in his city were forced to arm themselves after peaceful demonstrations were met by violence from regime forces. The men agree on almost everything: They don't want a sectarian rift in Syria, they don't want foreign jihadist fighters entering the country, and they say government thugs must be stopped from harassing the population here. Residents and fighters said they have had to create a makeshift graveyard close to the city center because regime troops have prevented them from reaching the main cemetery.
