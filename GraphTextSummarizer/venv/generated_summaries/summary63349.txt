"Do not consider Social Security a piggy bank for giving tax cuts to the wealthiest people in our country," she said. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California, who met with Obama on Friday, told reporters she wants the president to "have the room" to reach a deal, and offered her "full cooperation to do that." However, she said, House Democrats "do not support cuts in benefits for Social Security or Medicare," and negotiations on specific reforms to those programs should be separate from a broader deficit reduction deal. A group of progressive House Democrats said Thursday morning they are collecting signatures for a letter to Obama opposing any reductions in Social Security, Medicare, or Medicaid. Defense spending and tax reform are also on the table, the officials told CNN. Boehner said the parameters of the negotiations would be scaled back from what the administration had requested and the focus would be on spending cuts already discussed in previous talks led by Vice President Joe Biden.
