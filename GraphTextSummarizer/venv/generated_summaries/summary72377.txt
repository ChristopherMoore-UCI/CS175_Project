Both British Athletics and UK Anti-Doping have declined to comment, while both the Russian Athletics Federation and Russian Anti-Doping Agency have so far failed to reply to CNN's request for comment. During Monday's edition of the "Sport Inside," a former member of the IAAF's medical commission -- who is not identified -- said the samples in question were from athletes representing Spain, Kenya, Greece, Germany, Morocco, Russia and at least one from Britain. The allegations reported by German TV station WDR came less than a week after German broadcaster ZDF/ARD aired an hour-long programme documenting Russia's alleged endemic use of banned substances. "When we receive information of that type, we immediately carry out surprise doping tests on the suspicious athletes," Odriozola said in an email sent to CNN. , the sport has been accused of covering up how it dealt with scores of suspicious blood samples.
