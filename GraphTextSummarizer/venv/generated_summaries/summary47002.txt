I was cooking French bistro things - steak and chips, lemon tart and those kinds of things. I was born in the'60s and grew up in the '70s -- not exactly the best decade for food in British history. And so even though then I was doing bistro cooking, that element of science -- the knowledge of what happens when we cook on a scientific level -- had already started to influence my food. There were the trees; the noise of the feet of the waiting staff crunching on the gravel; the noise of the crickets filled the air; the sommelier with his handlebar moustache and leather apron; the wine list the size of something out of the tablet of a Cecil B. DeMille film; the cheese trolley the sound of a chariot. Harold had written a section in the book where he said that browning meat doesn't keep in the juices -- and that flew in the face of all the things I had learned about classical French cooking up until then.
