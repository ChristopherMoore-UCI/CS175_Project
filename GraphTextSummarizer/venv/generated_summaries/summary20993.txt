-- Orange is the new snack -- that's the case in Ukraine anyway after one of the country's top football players donated 20 tons of tangerines to local children. Darijo Srna, who plays for Donetsk-based Shakhtar, made the gesture which allowed for the fruit from his hometown of Metkovic in Croatia, which is renowned for the fruit, to arrive in Ukraine. In April 2014, pro-Russian activists took control of government buildings in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine. "As a child, back in Croatia, I also went through a period when I needed help," Srna told the club's official website. "I am missing it a lot," Srna said of Donetsk.
