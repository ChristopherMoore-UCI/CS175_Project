If the concept of flying wind turbines fulfills its promise, by the end of the decade innovators may transform this big idea into reality while ushering some of the world's most isolated communities into the 21st century. But the BAT takes wind turbine technology to the next level, literally -- about 1,000 feet above the ground. The sight of whirling wind turbine blades sitting atop towers has become common in states such as California and Texas and in Europe. No expensive infrastructure, such as electrical grids or power stations, is required. Suddenly, with airborne wind turbines, isolated communities in South American jungles or Alaskan islands could have easier, cheaper access to technology that most take for granted.
