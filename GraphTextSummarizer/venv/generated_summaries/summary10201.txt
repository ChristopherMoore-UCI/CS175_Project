-- Afghan President Hamid Karzai on Sunday stoody by a decree to disband private security firms operating in his country, despite objections from the United States and other countries that the move would leave international development organizations without adequate protection to do their work. Regarding protection for the development organizations, Karzai asked other countries to present a list of security requirements for large national projects and that the Afghan government would take decisions on whether and how to safeguard them. Karzai said that he has wanted to disband the organizations for some time and had warned about security for development organizations before, but that his words went unheeded. All the participants at the meeting reiterated their support for the decree and agreed to continue working together on implementing the ban in a way that doesn't leave development agencies in a lurch, U.S. Embassy spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said. Clinton also pledged to work cooperatively with Karzai to support a smooth transition to full Afghan security responsibility, he said.
