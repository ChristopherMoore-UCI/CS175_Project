Rosberg heads to his home grand prix in Germany this weekend on cloud nine -- and still leading the 2014 world championship by four points from Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton. After Hamilton's victory at the British Grand Prix put him back in the title hunt, Mercedes non-executive chairman Niki Lauda predicted of his Mercedes charges: "They will fight until the end like you do not believe to be world champion. Rosberg, the son of 1982 F1 world champion Keke, also goes to Germany with a multi-year contract extension in his back pocket. The Mercedes driver -- who had sportingly invited French Lotus driver Romain Grosjean to watch Germany defeat France in the quarterfinals after qualifying for the British Grand Prix -- plans to mark Germany's triumph with a special helmet for his homecoming race. Rosberg has won three races with Hamilton, who has lost valuable points with two retirements, taking five grand prix victories as the season reaches its halfway point.
