"The sentence imposed today is more than justified," Zugibe said, adding that two years in Rockland County jail will give John "time to reflect on his thoughtless actions." John and four others, including groom-to-be Brian Bond, were injured. "The defendant's reckless decision to drive a speedboat while under the influence of alcohol and drugs tragically caused the untimely deaths of two innocent people," Rockland County District Attorney Thomas Zugibe said in a statement. Jojo John, 36, was piloting a 19-foot Stingray powerboat around 10:40 p.m. on July 26, 2013, when it slammed into one of three construction barges strapped together near the Tappan Zee Bridge, 25 miles north of Manhattan, hurling Lindsey Stewart and Mark Lennon into the river, resulting in their deaths, according to court documents. In a statement, John's attorney, David Narain, said his client "is truly remorseful for his actions." "While justice is difficult to achieve in a case such as this, we hope that the victims and their families find some form of justice in today's disposition," Narain said. John's blood alcohol level was found to be 0.15, nearly twice the legal limit of .08, and "cocaine metabolites" were found in his system, prosecutors said.
