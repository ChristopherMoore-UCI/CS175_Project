-- Tiger Woods was penalized two strokes Saturday after a rules committee deemed he violated one of golf's ball-drop rules during Friday's play, an official with the Masters Tournament said. Masters officials spoke with Woods early Saturday morning, Ridley said at a news conference. Woods finished Saturday's round at 3-under par, four strokes off the lead. "I didn't know I had taken an incorrect drop prior to signing my scorecard," Woods said in a four-part tweet on Saturday. Woods was "very forthright" and "honest," Ridley said, and it was his best judgment that Woods intended to comply with the rules.
