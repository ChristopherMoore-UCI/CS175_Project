Where the lawsuits stand A month after the plane crash, the families of publicist Arturo Rivera, makeup artist Jacob Yebale, attorney Mario Macias Pacheco, and hairdresser Jorge Armando Sanchez Vasquez filed a wrongful death lawsuit against U.S.-based Starwood Management and Jenni Rivera Enterprises Inc. seeking punitive damages for negligence. Rivera crash puts spotlight on charter jet safety The 1969 Learjet that Rivera and the six others boarded last year was involved in another crash in 2005 in Amarillo, Texas, when the pilot lost ability to steer during landing. Responding to the intense public interest in the entertainer after her death, Cobo  -- one of the country's leading experts in Latin music who regularly interviewed Rivera -- wrote a biography on Rivera, "Jenni Rivera: The Incredible Journey of a Warrior Butterfly," which was released in Spanish and English earlier this year. It's been a year since a plane crash ended the lives of Mexican-American singer Jenni Rivera and six others, and new details have emerged about what might have caused the plane to plunge 28,000 feet into a mountainous area of northern Mexico.
