But Tuesday, KFC said it conducted two investigations, including one by an independent investigator, and neither revealed any proof that the scenario described to reporters and on social media actually occurred, KFC spokesman Rick Maynard said in a statement e-mailed to CNN. Little Victoria Wilcher had to eat through a feeding tube, her grandmother said, because she had been recently attacked by pit bulls. Authorities verified to CNN on Tuesday the account of how Victoria came to be injured. At the time, KFC left an apology on the Facebook page and pledged to donate $30,000 for Victoria's treatment. Despite saying it hadn't found proof that one of its restaurants mistreated the girl or her grandmother, KFC is vowing to honor its commitment to donate $30,000 to assist with Victoria's medical bills.
