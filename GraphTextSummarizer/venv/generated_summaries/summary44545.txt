I learned the basics of riding in a "paceline" with my teammates and coaches, how to better control my bike and about the importance of keeping the pedals turning even when coasting (the "soft pedal"). As with most things in life, seeing and doing are two very different things. Constantly practicing the exhale under water while only putting my face in the water or "bobbing" at the deep end of the pool has taught me how to control my breathing better. Now that I can better control my breathing, my workouts have finally become aerobic activities. I've learned that you should never increase your distance more than 10% per week so that your body has time to adjust to the increased workload.
