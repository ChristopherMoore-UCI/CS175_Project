Record breaking wicketkeeper Mark Boucher's enforced retirement is a "huge loss" for South African cricket, its former chief Ali Bacher told CNN Wednesday. "It's a huge loss for South African cricket, he's had a most distinguished career in cricket for his country and he will certainly go down as one of our greatest ever cricketers." Bacher, who was in charge of South African cricket when Boucher first came to prominence in 1997, paid his own tribute. Many of them were during the career of former South African paceman Makhaya Ntini, the pair combining to send many batsmen back to the pavilion. Bacher, himself a former Test star, said it was likely AB de Villiers would take his place behind the stumps for the series against England which starts next week.
