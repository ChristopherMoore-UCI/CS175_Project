"We've seen an increased number of people taking the exam to get licensing." Tarsa Scott, a real estate agent turned stylist at Fabulocs, a natural hair salon in suburban Maryland, chalked up the sector's strength to one thing: the desire to look and feel good. "Most people -- especially women -- even when there are bad times, we want to feel good," said Scott, who got an office job after the housing market collapsed, but turned to hair styling to supplement her income. Fabulocs owner Nimat Bilal said business has always been strong and is only getting better. Two years ago, as other industries struggled, Bilal moved to a larger space to accommodate the growing number of people who wanted to work with her. According to Census data, the number of barbershops in Maryland rose nearly 11% between 2007 -- when the recession hit -- and 2009, while the number of beauty salons in the state jumped more than 17%.
