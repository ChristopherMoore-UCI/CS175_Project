Former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck -- who has been arrested in connection with a police probe into phone hacking -- said he would not talk about illegal eavesdropping because of the arrest. Police investigating phone hacking by journalists say that about 5,800 people, including celebrities, crime victims, politicians and members of the royal family, were targets of the practice by journalists in search of stories. But he said he had never heard about phone hacking by the News of the World until royal reporter Clive Goodman was arrested for it in 2006. The Leveson Inquiry has been hearing from high-profile figures since last month, including celebrities such as "Harry Potter" author J.K. Rowling and actor Hugh Grant, both of whom complained about press intrusion into their lives. A former News of the World journalist testified last month that the editors of the tabloid knew that their reporters were hacking phones in search of stories.
