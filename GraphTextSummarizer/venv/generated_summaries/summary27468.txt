Tuesday's attack on the AP Twitter feed shows "an escalation in depth but not in scale," Noman said. What is worrying about the AP Twitter hack is that next time there is breaking news on Twitter, people will wonder if it's true or just another compromise, Noman said. However, Noman and his fellow researchers do "not have evidence that this group is actually a Syrian government operation." The group has sought to recruit volunteers through its Facebook page, inviting them to flood selected websites with pre-prepared spam comments, said Noman. Early attacks focused on apparently irrelevant websites, but later efforts shifted first toward compromising the Facebook pages of organizations seen as hostile to the Syrian government, and now high-profile Twitter accounts.
