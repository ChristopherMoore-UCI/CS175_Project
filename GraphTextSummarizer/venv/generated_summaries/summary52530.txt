It is unclear how the cancellation of the festival will affect the touring plans of other bands on the bill, which also included Evanescence, Faith No More, Flogging Molly, Mastodon, Andrew W.K., Incubus and the Darkness. As of yet, neither Lambert or Queen have commented on the possibility of making alternate plans. The Sonisphere Knebworth festival, which was to host performances by Kiss, Marilyn Manson and a version of Queen fronted by Adam Lambert, has been cancelled. " Other Sonisphere festivals, including events in Poland, Spain and Swizterland, will go on as planned with Metallica as a headliner. According to organizers, plans for the event -- which was to be held in Stevenage, England on July 6-8-- were scrapped due to unforeseen difficulties.
