CNN political analyst and National Journal editorial director Ron Brownstein said that Perry's focus on border security "allows him to shore up his tough on security bona fides" in what has become "a big moment for the Republican Party" on immigration. That part of the plan is up to Congress and the comprehensive immigration plan which would have provided more resources for border security is stalled in the House, and neither body has yet unveiled how they would solve the current border crisis. It represents concrete action over concerns raised by Perry and other Republicans that border security be given more resources generally and specifically in this case to deal with what most agree is a humanitarian crisis. Aguilar said one thing that will help relieve the workload of border patrol agents is to relieve CBP from being the sole government agency to process and care for the unaccompanied youth in the immediate aftermath of their detention. "The real solution to basically helping border patrol is going to be a holistic approach to this that goes way beyond more boots on the ground," said David Aguilar, the acting commissioner of CBP from 2011 until 2013.
