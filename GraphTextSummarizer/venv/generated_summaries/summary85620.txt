Peters Baker said that, based on the murder charges against him, a judge opted not to set bond for Howell, meaning he'll be held in Jackson County Jail presumably until his trial on the new charges. Two other victims are fighting for their lives in a local hospital, Jackson County Prosecutor Jean Peters Baker said on Wednesday. "I woke up this morning, very determined and resolved to get justice in this case," Peters Baker said upon learning Howell had been charged again with murder. It's also possible that this case -- or at least the shotgun -- could shed light on the first time that Howell was charged with murder in the deaths of Tabitha Brewer and Nick Travis. Peters Baker said she called the Brewer and Travis families, as well as the prosecutors who tried but failed to win a conviction in their deaths, soon after Howell was connected to these new killings.
