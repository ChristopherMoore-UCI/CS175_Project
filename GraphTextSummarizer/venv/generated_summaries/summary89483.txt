iReport video: Shots fired at St. Louis protest Protesters invoke Michael Brown Protesters took to St. Louis streets for two nights this week, and some of them drew parallels to the shooting of Michael Brown in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson. It started when Myers and two other males ran from the officer, who was in a car, St. Louis police said. Van Jones, a civil rights activist and CNN contributor, said there is a lot of police mistrust after the Brown killing. Myers and Brown were both 18, African-American and killed by white police officers. "It's a clear case of this young man being gunned down by an insensitive white officer who was off-duty," Akbar Muhammad, who also is a member of a coalition calling for the officer who shot Brown to be prosecuted, told CNN affiliate KTVI.
