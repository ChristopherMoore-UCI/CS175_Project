Opinion: Scandal shines spotlight on murky horse trade Unauthorized horse meat has been discovered in a variety of products labeled as beef that were sold in supermarkets in countries including Britain, France, Sweden, Switzerland, Germany and Ireland. The discovery of pig DNA in beef products is of particular concern to Jews and Muslims, whose dietary laws forbid the consumption of pork products. Spanghero was the first company to label the meat as beef, the minister said, adding that 750 tons of horse meat were involved over a period of at least six months. Horse meat concerns date to February 2012, officials say "The company has never ordered horse meat, and we never knowingly sold horse meat," the representative said.
