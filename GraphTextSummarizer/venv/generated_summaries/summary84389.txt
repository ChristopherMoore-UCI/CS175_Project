Banks said that while she has encountered discriminatory job ads in newspapers and other websites, this was the first case she has seen involving Gumtree. "I'm certainly going to look at commencing an investigation into what's happeningâ€”the role of Gumtree, what Coles' role was, and find out more details about the subcontractor," said Tasmania's Anti-Discrimination Commissioner Robin Banks. Banks said she would examine whether Coles "fulfilled its obligations to ensure its agents do not engage in discrimination," while Gumtree may have breached the Act by permitting the publication of discriminatory advertising, she added. "It happens every so often," she said, adding that in her experience, newspaper editors have been "very responsive" in improving procedures to vet ads and setting up training for their staff. Coles said the offending ad was placed by a cleaning subcontractor without the company's knowledge, in a written statement from spokesperson Jim Cooper.
