"The fact that anybody got into any sort of beef over the Giants and the Dodgers and somebody lost their life," San Francisco Police Chief Greg Suhr said earlier this week. The incident occurred after the Dodgers and Giants played and a man wearing Dodgers gear was killed just blocks from the San Francisco stadium. -- Authorities in San Francisco are asking for help from anybody who witnessed a recent fatal stabbing of a Dodgers fan after a man once suspected in the case was released. The fatal slashing occurred Wednesday night and some have said it stemmed from the long-standing baseball rivalry between fans of the Los Angeles Dodgers and the San Francisco Giants. But Friday night that man was released from jail, CNN affiliate KGO reported.
