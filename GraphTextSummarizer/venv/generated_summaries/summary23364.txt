Speaking to reporters Saturday ahead of his arrival in Japan, U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said that the "world will respond" to Russia's annexation of Ukraine. Luhansk is on the border with Russia in eastern Ukraine, a region that some say could follow the lead of Crimea and soon fall under Moscow's control. That was followed by Crimea leaving Ukraine and being folded into Russia following a quickly organized referendum -- a move that derided by authorities in Kiev and officials in the West. A classified U.S. intelligence assessment last month identified Luhansk, along with Kharkiv and Dontesk, as possible targets for Russian forces seeking to establish a land bridge to Crimea. NATO says tens of thousands of Russian troops have massed near Ukraine's border, amid fears they may seek to invade.
