"The Pope is not free to change the church's teachings with regard to the immorality of homosexual acts or the insolubility of marriage or any other doctrine of the faith," Burke told Buzzfeed recently. Cardinal Raymond Burke, a leading conservative, has been vocal in his criticism of the direction the Pope is leading the Catholic Church in. Burke was one of the highest ranking Americans in the church hierarchy in his position on the Vatican's supreme court. The National Catholic Reporter points out that Burke's new post is a job that "has almost no responsibilities." Last month, Burke himself said he had been ousted from the Vatican's high court.
