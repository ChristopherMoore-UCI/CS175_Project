" Instead, at CrossFit Gantry in Long Island City Queens -- the affiliate that made news this week -- children starting at 3 years old will focus on traditional CrossFit movements but without any weight. People shouldn't let their contempt for the word "CrossFit" overshadow that it's just something active and interesting for children to do. Participants work out in groups and meet not in a gym, but an industrial-looking "box" that is void of all the things I love most -- you know, SportsCenter and USA Today. So, my daily routine isn't exactly CrossFit. Which is a little pathetic when you consider that, now, even toddlers are taking on CrossFit.
