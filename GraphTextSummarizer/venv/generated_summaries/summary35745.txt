" So far he has lost nearly 240 pounds -- a result of diet, exercise and traditional Chinese medicine such as acupuncture, which doctors say reduces appetite and increases metabolism. Bland said he misses his family and friends, but his goal is to lose the weight and be "healthier and happier." "Yes this is our record," Dr. Su Zhixin proudly boasted. " Bland's weight yo-yoed for years, ballooning after he lost his job 12 years ago. His family was amazed at his weight loss, and more importantly, despite the fears of his doctor, Bland did not put on any weight while he was away. In fact, he woke at 4 a.m. most days, he said, to work out at the gym -- an indication, said his doctors, that he has broken the bad eating and living patterns that caused his weight gain.
