In this situation, there are a slew of kids books for the iPad that are animated, do voiceovers, etc. Other than the obvious -- games, education and creativity -- there's a slew of reasons why I think the iPad was created for kids -- at least tech-tech loving adults with kids. I firmly believe that it was secretly made with kids in mind. In terms of car-ride iPad savers, I'd have to suggest the instant classic "Paper Toss," "Little Things" or "LunchBox. However, when (and I really mean when), your kid flies off the handle because they can't take another three hours before you get to Grandma's house, bust out the iPad and get back to the tranquility of wheels on asphalt.
