Bungalows come with private plunge pools overlooking a generous stretch of ocean. If it weren't for the rates, you could mistake this hotel for a pricer single-letter chain (cough, W, cough). Accommodations range from rooms with bunk beds to oceanfront suites with private balconies; whitewashed walls, ceiling fans, and dark wood furnishings are a theme throughout. Wi-Fi is free, ocean views are standard, and spa services are a bargain. -- Colleen Clark Travel + Leisure: See more affordable beach resorts
