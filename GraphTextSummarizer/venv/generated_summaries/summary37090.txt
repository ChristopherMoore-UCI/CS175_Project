-- New York City's annual Halloween parade may go dark for a second year if organizers don't raise $50,000 by Monday to make up for losses caused by Superstorm Sandy in 2012. In order to host the hundreds of puppets, more than 50 bands, dancers, artists and thousands of costumed New Yorkers, organizers say they must raise the sum by Monday. The organizers started a campaign to raise the money through online fundraising site Kickstarter.com that will end Monday. " Online organizers say that the parade will also provide a much-needed economic boost to the area's local businesses after being hard-hit by the storm. For the first time in its 39-year history, the parade was canceled at the last minute in 2012 after Sandy "Frankenstormed" the event.
