It is an additional irony that many conservatives are fine with raising taxes on those 47% of Americans who don't make enough money to pay federal income taxes, as long as top rates are lowered enough to make the overall shift revenue neutral. Both Obama and congressional Republicans have campaigned on tax reform and tax simplification in the past. But historic perspective is the enemy of partisan ideologues, and on the flip-side, conservatives who idealize the past conveniently ignore that tax rates at the heart of the American Century were almost double what they are today. But the real argument for raising taxes is directly related to balancing budgets and reducing long-term deficits and debt. This isn't tax policy as much as it has become a shell-game masquerading as ideology.
