"Since 2005, food manufacturers have voluntarily lowered the amounts of trans fats in their food products by over 73%." The FDA has opened a 60-day comment period on the determination "to collect additional data and to gain input on the time potentially needed for food manufacturers to reformulate products that currently contain artificial trans fat should this determination be finalized," the agency said. Nancy Brown, the Heart Association's CEO, said she hopes the FDA goes a step further and revises labels for foods that are trans fat free. If the preliminary determination is finalized, according to the FDA, then partially hydrogenated oils will become food additives that could not be used in food without approval. However, in recent years many food manufacturers have taken steps to limit or eliminate trans fat from their products.
