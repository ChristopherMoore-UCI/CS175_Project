Zeedyk's study, published by British charity National Literacy Trust, included an experiment in which 20 babies were wheeled in buggies for a mile, spending half the trip facing their parents and the other half facing away, Parents using face-to-face strollers were more likely to talk to their children, who were less likely to exhibit signs of stress, the study said. Parents are less likely to interact with children in forward-facing strollers. UK child education campaigners the Sutton Trust say the study highlights the need for manufacturers to rethink the designs of strollers. "Our data suggests that for many babies today, life in a buggy is emotionally impoverished and possibly stressful," Zeedyk said. "Our experimental study showed that, simply by turning the buggy around, parents' rate of talking to their baby doubled," said developmental psychologist Suzanne Zeedyk, who led the research.
