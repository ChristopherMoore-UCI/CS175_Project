Veteran flight attendant Lee Yoon Hye sensed something was awry as Flight 214 neared the San Francisco International Airport runway. Shock and survival: Plane crash through the eyes of children After striking the edge of the runway at San Francisco International Airport, the Boeing 777 tumbled into the ground, igniting flames and a trail of smoke. Another emergency slide in the back trapped another crew member and was deflated with a kitchen knife, Lee said according to South Korean news station YTN. Dressed in her airline uniform, her name tag pinned to her jacket and her hair in the airline's trademark bun, she addressed  Korean journalists gathered in San Francisco earlier this week. "When there was a fire, I was just thinking to extinguish it, not thinking that it's too dangerous or 'What am I going to do?'"
