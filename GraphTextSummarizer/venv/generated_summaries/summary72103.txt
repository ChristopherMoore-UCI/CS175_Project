An American missionary once held hostage by Colombian rebels has been accused by local authorities of collaborating with his former captors. After his release, he took part in evangelical campaigns across Colombia and set up radio stations to broadcast gospel preaching and music into the conflict zones. But his activities appear to have run afoul of Colombian authorities, who announced Thursday that they had arrested Stendal, accusing him of supporting the FARC. "It leaves much to be desired of the intelligence department of the police of Cundinamarca to confuse evangelizing with rebellion," said the statement from the FARC, which is known in English as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia. "They're accusing me of rebellion for the missionary trips and the visits that I made into rebel-held territory, distributing Bibles and Galcom radios," he says, referring to solar-powered portable radio sets that are fixed to receive Christian broadcasts.
