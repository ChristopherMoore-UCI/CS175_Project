Most of the artifacts Carol Armstrong had made available to the museum prior to her closet find, weren't any actual flown artifacts, but were still exciting, Allan Needell the Apollo curator at the National Air and Space Museum told CNN. Not until recently did Carol Armstrong email the museum with the news she'd found, "a white cloth bag filled with assorted small items that looked like they may have come from a spacecraft. Perhaps that's why astronaut Neil Armstrong, the first man to step foot on the moon, left some of his personal artifacts from his journey to the moon in a closet. Needell said the Armstrong artifacts "tell a number of stories" - the technical story that has been so carefully documented and the human story of those who were involved. In the wake of his death, Carol Armstrong donated many of the Apollo 11 artifacts to the museum's National Collection.
