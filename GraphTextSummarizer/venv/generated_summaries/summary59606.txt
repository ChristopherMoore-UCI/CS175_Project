The organization also highlights past instances in which Iran has detained international journalists, including the case of U.S. freelancer Roxana Saberi. Gholam-Hossein Esmaili, the director general of the Tehran Province Justice Department, is quoted by Iran's official IRNA news agency as saying a "Washington Post journalist has been detained for some questions and after technical investigations, the judiciary will provide details on the issue." "Iran has a dismal record with regard to its treatment of imprisoned journalists. In a statement Thursday, Washington Post foreign editor Douglas Jehl said "we are deeply troubled by this news and are concerned for the welfare of Jason, Yeganeh and two others said to have been detained with them." "We call on Iranian authorities to immediately explain why Jason Rezaian, Yeganeh Salehi, and two other journalists have been detained, and we call for their immediate release," said Sherif Mansour, its Middle East and North Africa program coordinator.
