Axl Rose sent a "Thanks, but no thanks" letter to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame for its induction of Guns N' Roses in Cleveland next weekend. The Guns N' Roses lead singer wrote that after being "polite, courteous and open to an amicable solution," he concluded that the induction ceremony "doesn't appear to be somewhere I'm actually wanted or respected." "Of course I realized as things stood, if Guns N' Roses were to be inducted it'd be somewhat of a complicated or awkward situation," said Rose, who tours with a version of the group that includes none of the original members from 1985. "Neither former members, label representatives nor the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame should imply whether directly, indirectly or by omission that I am included in any purported induction of 'Guns N' Roses'. Bad blood between Rose and several former band mates from the original 1985 lineup is apparently at the center of his decision. Rose closed his letter saying, "as ironic as it may seem, I'd like to sincerely thank the board for their nomination and their votes for Guns' induction.
