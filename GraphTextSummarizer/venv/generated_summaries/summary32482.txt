Team Leopard rider Weylandt dies in Giro d'Italia crash Leopard-Trek's remaining eight-man squad came over the finish line together, accompanied by Garmin rider Tyler Farrar, a training partner and close friend of Weylandt. -- Tuesday's fourth stage of the Giro d'Italia was turned into a tribute to tragic Belgian Wouter Weylandt, who died in a horror crash during Monday's third stage. " After many riders had expressed their sadness in an outpouring of emotion on Twitter, the peloton agreed to award all prize money from Tuesday's stage to Weylandt's family. Before the stage, the peloton held a minute's silence for Weylandt, and along the route the streets were packed with people paying their respects to the rider, who had won the corresponding stage of last year's Giro. "The decision really needed to be taken by the riders, because they are the ones that participate in the race," said Leopard team manager Brian Nygaard.
