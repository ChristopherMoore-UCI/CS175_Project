Miramonte is a kindergarten-through-sixth-grade school located in unincorporated Los Angeles County within the Florence-Firestone area, about 6 miles south of downtown Los Angeles. "There are good teachers here, too," said Maria Flores, who has two children at Miramonte. On Wednesday, the new school staff was being trained in the Miramonte auditorium, said one of the teachers, special education assistant Contisia Davis. In their expanding investigation into alleged teacher sexual misconduct at Miramonte, authorities this week also charged a second teacher, Martin Bernard Springer, 49, of Alhambra, California, whom the school board fired Tuesday. On Thursday, Los Angeles County investigators announced they have found 200 more photos allegedly taken by Berndt, who has been charged with 23 felony counts of lewd acts with pupils, according to a sheriff's spokesman.
