As part of the investigation into Cox-Powell's disappearance, Utah authorities searched the Washington house where Powell, his two sons and his father, Steven Powell, were living last year. Investigators found a hatchet in the home of Josh Powell, whom authorities believe set the Sunday afternoon fire, said Ed Troyer, a spokesman for the Pierce County, Washington, Sheriff's Department. As late as last month, Utah authorities were still working to connect Powell to the disappearance of his wife, who authorities believe is dead. The sheriff's department has copies of an e-mail Powell sent to his attorney as well as family and friends that said "he couldn't live with what was going on," Troyer said. After the arrest of Powell's father, custody of his sons was given to the Coxes, according to Washington state court records.
