-- Late one night, after dark, we met up with Don Brewster -- head of Agape International Missions, an NGO fighting child prostitution -- to go behind the scenes at Cambodia's KTVs: karaoke clubs that are fronts for brothels. We were ushered in and led us upstairs to karaoke room where hostesses in satin, beaded formal dresses greet us. Girls sat on plastic chairs lining the entrance, all painted up and wearing short skirts, high heels and fake smiles. I had no idea that I was going to be involved in trying to recruit girls to leave the KTV life and receive the services of Don's NGO. Don drove us first to an out of the way small side street, where there were tiny KTVs operating out in the open like cheap brothels.
