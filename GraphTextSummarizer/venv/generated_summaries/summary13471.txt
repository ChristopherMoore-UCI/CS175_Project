"Perhaps some people come to St. Francis because they don't feel judged," said Stephanie Samoy, a self-proclaimed lesbian who has been active in the parish for several years. Members of the gay ministries of St. Francis Xavier say they view the parade as an opportunity to welcome gay Catholics back into the fold. New York's Archbishop Timothy Dolan asked the church's pastor to keep St. Francis' name out of the picture. -- This year, as for the past 12 years or more, parishioners from St. Francis Xavier Roman Catholic Church have marched under their church banner in New York's colorful Gay Pride parade. But they also wore T-shirts on which they printed the St. Francis Xavier name.
