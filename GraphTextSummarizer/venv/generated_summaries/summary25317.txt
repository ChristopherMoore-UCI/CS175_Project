" A SeaWorld spokesman said that Jett's song is no longer used in any of its shows, but that it "was played as walk-in music for the "Shamu Rocks" nighttime show at SeaWorld Orlando and was fully licensed for us to use. "I was surprised and upset to see on YouTube that SeaWorld used "I Love Rock 'n' Roll" as the opening music for its cruel and abusive 'Shamu Rocks' show," Jett said in a letter sent this week to SeaWorld President Jim Atchison. The documentary -- which first aired on CNN in October -- tells the story of the killing in 2010 of experienced SeaWorld trainer Dawn Brancheau by a 12,000-pound orca. " "A new nighttime Shamu show is being designed for SeaWorld Orlando and we had no plans to use any of her music in that show," spokesman Nick Gollattscheck told CNN Wednesday. "SeaWorld's reliance on cruelty and captivity for commerce has been widely exposed," Jett's letter, obtained by CNN, said.
