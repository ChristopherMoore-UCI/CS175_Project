It was her 31st straight win and with it Williams has moved to within two of Chris Evert and Martina Navratilova, who are tied fourth in the all-time list of grand slam singles titles winners. -- Serena Williams powered her way to the French Open title Saturday with a straight sets victory over defending champion Maria Sharapova of Russia in a compelling final. Sharapova put up a brave fight but could not prevent Williams from claiming her first French Open title since her maiden triumph in 2002. Williams, who has lost just three matches since her upset defeat to Virginie Razzano in the first round of the French Open last year, immediately hit back and led 4-3 with a second break of Sharapova's service. At 31 years and 247 days, she is oldest woman in the Open Era to win the French Open title, the previous mark held by Evert since 1986.
