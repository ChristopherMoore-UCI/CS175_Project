AmpSurf is open to anyone with any disability, including spinal cord injuries, blindness, post-traumatic stress disorder and autism. " Cummings co-founded AmpSurf with his prosthetist and two other amputees, including Rodney Roller, the man who taught Cummings how to surf. A divorced father of three, Cummings said he was abandoned by his girlfriend and denied physical rehabilitation by his insurance. "I wanted to prove that I was whole, and one of the ways to do that was to learn to surf," Cummings said. For Cummings, AmpSurf will always be about more than just surfing; it's about happiness, not just for the participants, but for him and his volunteers.
