The day before the wedding, Bridezilla treated the bridesmaids to manicures and pedicures, and as her colors were black and white, she "encouraged" all of us to choose red for our nails. The Frisky: I'm not really sold on monogamy In that moment I realized this was her Holy Grail, and I didn't want to ruin our friendship over money and nail polish. I got to party in Miami, chill by the pool in Tampa, and be V.I.P. at all the wedding events. Bachelorette party in Miami: unfortunately, NOT priceless. In addition to the bachelorette party, I spent a total of $1,500 on a dress I will never wear again, a gift for the bridal shower her future mother-in-law hosted, a gift and food for the naughty-themed bridal shower we, the bridesmaids, hosted (the maid of honor's idea), my plane ticket to Tampa for the wedding, and my hotel room stay.
