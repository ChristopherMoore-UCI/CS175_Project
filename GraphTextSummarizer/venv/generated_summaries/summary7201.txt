Shoppers cannot buy them yet from Apple retail stores, although they can be picked up at stores after being ordered online. The new Mini's release comes three weeks after Apple introduced the device and 12 days after the new full-size iPad Air went on sale. As of late morning Tuesday, Apple's online store was listing shipping delays of one to three business days for 16GB and 32GB models and five to 10 business days for models with higher amounts of storage. Apple tends to release new products on Fridays, giving them a full weekend to rack up sales while excitement is high. An Apple spokeswoman declined to say when they might become available for in-store purchases.
