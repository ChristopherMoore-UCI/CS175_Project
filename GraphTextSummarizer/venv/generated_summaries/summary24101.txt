In its ruling, the NFL singled out Payton -- who led the Saints to its first ever Super Bowl victory in February 2010, after a season in which the bounty program was in place -- by saying that violations for the bounty program "were compounded by the failure of Coach Payton to supervise the players and coaches. " In public remarks, Payton has not admitted he lied to the NFL and insisted that no one was injured as a result of the bounty program. General manager Mickey Loomis was suspended without pay for that season's first eight regular-season games, and assistant head coach Joe Vitt was suspended without pay for the first six regular-season games. The NFL found evidence that bounties were put on quarterbacks Brett Favre of the Minnesota Vikings, Cam Newton of the Carolina Panthers, Aaron Rodgers of the Green Bay Packers and Kurt Warner of the Arizona Cardinals. Goodell has said he's also considering imposing penalties against players involved in the bounty program, but he hasn't given a timetable and has insisted he'll first consult with the NFL Players Association before doing so.
