Ashton's two-day visit to Tehran is the first official visit by an EU foreign policy chief since 2008, according to Iran's Press TV. "I have been engaged in discussions with Iran for nearly four years, and I think this interim agreement is really, really important, but not as important as a comprehensive agreement that we are currently engaged in," she said, according to published remarks. The next round of talks between the so-called P5+1 -- the United States, China, Russia, Britain, France and Germany -- and Iran will start next week in Vienna. The United States and its allies believe Iran is trying to develop a nuclear weapon, while Tehran has said its atomic efforts are peaceful. Catherine Ashton spoke to reporters alongside Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif at a news conference in Tehran.
