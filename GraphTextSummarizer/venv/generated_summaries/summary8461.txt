A first -- and last -- kiss "I always went to camp kicking and screaming," Alex Spitz said of her early teenage years at Camp JCA Shalom in Malibu, California. American adolescents and summer camp go together like bug juice and s'mores. The couple has since purchased a camp nearby, Fernwood Cove, where they live year-round with their son, Perrin, 4½, and daughter Sylvie, 6½. The Gills have experienced adversity as well, with Beigette suffering a traumatic spinal cord injury during a family bike trip after camp season in 2011. The only date the camp had free amid busy summer sessions was May 31, 2009. As the last of the sleepaway campers begrudgingly say their goodbyes to bunkmates this month, it's worth remembering that some campers and counselors keep the campfire flames burning much longer with summer flings that become lifetime commitments.
