Militiamen from Misrata and a number of other Libyan cities came into Tripoli during the fight for the capital in August 2011 and have created bases in different parts of the capital where they have remained since. "The scenes in trauma hospitals across Tripoli resembled a war zone tonight: frantic health staff rushing to provide help, armed men nervously patrolling corridors, and families desperately trying to find their loved ones " Said Hanan Salah, a Libya researcher for Human Rights Watch, who visited a number of the capital's main hospitals. Anger against the various militias has been mounting for months in Tripoli and other Libyan parts of the country, including the eastern city of Benghazi that has been gripped by increasing violence, including political assassinations. As long as militias and armed groups are not held to account for crimes they commit, innocent people will continue to die," Human Rights Watch's Salah told CNN. Fighting broke out after protesters marched on the Tripoli headquarters of militias from the coastal city of Misrata.
