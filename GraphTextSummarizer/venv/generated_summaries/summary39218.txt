The survey published Tuesday by the Washington-based Pew Research Center also says that of the 34% of Mexicans who indicated they would like to move to the U.S., 17% "would do so without authorization," meaning without legal documents. The survey also shows that Mexicans seem to have a very positive image of the military (75%), although many people are concerned about human rights violations as the armed forces continue to fight criminal organizations. " On the other hand, the survey found that fewer Mexicans have friends or family in the United States. The survey covered a wide range of topics including the popularity of current President Enrique Pena Nieto (51%), which declined 6 percentage points in the past year as he pushed through energy and communications reforms some view with suspicion. The Pew Research Center reported in 2012 that net migration from Mexico to the United States fell to zero (and perhaps less) between 2005 and 2010, meaning the number of Mexicans migrating north is equal to or less than those going back to their country.
