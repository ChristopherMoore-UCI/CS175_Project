The relay, put online late last year, triggered unexpectedly, causing another device to stop supplying power to part of the building, Entergy New Orleans told city officials Friday. Entergy told New Orleans City Council members that the company still doesn't know why the device triggered, but the relay has been removed, the dome's electrical system is ready to go and steps will be taken to ensure a malfunction doesn't happen again. "S&C continues to work with all those involved to get the system back online, and our customers can continue to rely on the quality and performance of our products." Asked whether Entergy agrees with S&C's characterization of the problem, Entergy spokesman Mike Burns responded: "Tests conducted by S&C and Entergy on the two relays installed at the Superdome shows that one relay functioned as expected and the other relay did not. " New York area on the clock for history-making Super Bowl CNN's Kimberly Segal and Mariano Castillo contributed to this report. The relay and switch gear were part of Entergy's 2011-2012 project to improve electrical reliability at the dome, Entergy official Dennis Dawsey told council members.
