" Guterres met with top Iraqi leaders, including President Jalal Talabani, Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki and Minister of Foreign Affairs Hoshyar Zebari. The UNHCR said several of the men deported from Sweden were from Iraq's volatile provinces -- Baghdad, Diyala, Salaheddin, Nineveh and Kirkuk. "This new government represents an enormous opportunity for Iraq, but also for our work," said Antonio Guterres, the U.N. high commissioner for refugees, on his first visit to Iraq since the country formed a new government in December. The UNHCR said it was a reference to recent deportations of Iraqis from a number of European countries. Last year, western European countries deported more than 400 Iraqis, according to the UNHCR.
