"There is a slightly elevated risk of a larger earthquake while the swarm is active," said seismologist Ian Madin from neighboring Oregon. Similar swarms In 1968, in nearby Adel, Oregon, a swarm lasting several months produced three quakes of about magnitude 5. Seismologists refer to such quake groupings as swarms, and the U.S. Geological Survey has detected them regularly. Since they started four months ago, Nevada Seismological Laboratory has recorded around 550 quakes of magnitude 2 or higher, and 42 with intensities above 3.0. Another, shorter swarm near Reno, Nevada, in 2008 led to a magnitude 5 quake and caused moderate local damage.
