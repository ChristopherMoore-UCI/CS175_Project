"Flight to space is an entire series of pinnacle life experiences," said Garriott, a 48-year-old board member of Space Adventures, the company that arranged his 12-day trip last year. Two relatively new U.S. aerospace companies were hired last year by NASA to send unmanned cargo to the international space station. Some companies, such as Virgin Galactic, aim to sell suborbital flights -- high enough to reach the edges of space and weightlessness -- within the next few years. Bigelow primarily sees the habitats as destinations for research scientists and astronauts -- particularly those from countries that haven't used the international space station as much as they'd like or nations making their first steps into space, Gold said. Gold, Garriott and others in the private sector say they hope NASA can be persuaded to invest in, and eventually hire, aerospace companies to deliver NASA astronauts to low-Earth orbit instead of using its own spacecraft.
