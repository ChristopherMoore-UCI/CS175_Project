Camp Ashraf was established in 1986 after former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein invited members of the MEK to relocate to Iraq in an effort to undermine the Iranian government, which was then at war with Iraq. The group believes the current regime in Iraq, under orders from Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, has previously staged deadly attacks against Camp Ashraf. Before moving, the Camp Ashraf residents had demanded a commitment that no Iraqi police would remain inside the new site, in order to ensure the security of the residents. "In a nutshell, Camp Liberty lacks the most basic international humanitarian standards and human rights standards are not met," the statement said. When they arrived seven hours later at the new site, a former U.S. military base near Baghdad International Airport called Camp Liberty, the group discovered a heavy presence of police.
