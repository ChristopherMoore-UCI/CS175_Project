But unlike other criminal disciplines, there are no universally-recognized charters governing international norms for cybercrime, and most countries' justice systems are at drastically different stages of development in this nascent legal field. The Feds and their international counterparts deserve a solid pat on the back for this one, but the progress will quickly retreat if the events of the past week don't trigger a more enduring dialogue on international norms for cybercrime. It also communicates to China and the rest of the world the degree to which such behavior directly threatens America's interests, perhaps even in a manner commensurate with more conventional threats like terrorism and WMD proliferation. In unprecedented fashion, the faces of five officers from the previously disclosed 61398 Unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army now appear on a "Wanted by the FBI" poster, a striking suggestion that perhaps prosecuting cybercrime shouldn't differ all that much from prosecuting other crimes. Then, on Monday, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder released an indictment for five Chinese nationals on charges of corporate cybertheft.
