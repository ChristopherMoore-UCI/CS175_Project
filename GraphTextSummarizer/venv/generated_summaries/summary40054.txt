The accord, between Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany,  includes a ceasefire between Ukraine and pro-Russian separatists and an agreement for both sides to pull back heavy weapons. Pro-Russian separatists have also accused Ukraine of instigating violence. A war with Ukraine would be "apocalyptic" but will probably never happen, Russian President Vladimir Putin said. The United Nations says more than 5,000 people have been killed since mid-April amid the fighting between pro-Russian rebels and Ukrainian troops. "The way I watch the news, I realize the Americans want to get a hold of half of Russia." Russia has denied widespread claims that it is supporting the pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine and has sent its own troops to the border.
