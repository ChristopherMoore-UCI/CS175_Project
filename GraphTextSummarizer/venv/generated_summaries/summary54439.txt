Georgia teen Kendrick Johnson, who was found dead in a rolled-up gym mat at his high school in January, died as the result of "unexplained, apparent non-accidental, blunt force trauma," according to a newly released, independent autopsy report. That report said, "bruising noted to the right side jaw." However, a January 25 report by the Valdosta - Lowndes County Regional Crime Laboratory cited "no signs of blunt force trauma on Johnson's face or body." Johnson, 17 and an athlete, was found January 11 headfirst in a rolled wrestling mat at a Lowndes County High School gym in Valdosta, Georgia. That autopsy, conducted June 15, found blunt force trauma to the right neck and soft tissues, "consistent with inflicted injury." Attorney for Georgia's Middle District and Lowndes County Coroner for review.
