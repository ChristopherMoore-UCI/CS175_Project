Man accused of slapping crying boy on Delta flight is out of a job After the hearing, Shein issued a statement on Hundley's behalf, saying that the day before the flight on February 8, her client had learned that his son had overdosed on insulin and was in a coma on life support. " Hundley "had paid a terrible price for his hurtful words but asks only that people understand that he was not doing well that night and spoke hurtful words he would have not otherwise have said," Shein said. "Mr. Hundley had been up for 24 hours over this tragic news and was heading to Atlanta to decide, with his son's mother, if they should take him off life support as he had no brain activity. Before Hundley's court appearance, his attorney, Marcia Shein, said that he would be entering a plea of not guilty. In her statement Wednesday, Shein did not address whether Hundley was drunk.
