"I've been doing this for 20 years, and every flight, there's always this 'wow' impression," says Vladimir Pletser, the parabolic flight manager at the ESA, and a Guinness record holder for most aircraft flown in parabola. "Gravity does not disappear, but we are in a state of freefall," explains Pletser. The International Space University in Strasbourg, for instance, is researching how gravity affects our everyday perception of objects in terms of weight and density. "By studying the manipulation of objects in different gravity fields, we understand how important gravity is on Earth," he explains. According to Leonardo Surdo, a researcher at the university, studies show that on Earth, when people are presented with two balls of equal weight, they will mistakenly assume the smaller one is heavier.
