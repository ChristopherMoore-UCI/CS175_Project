The Kingdome, Seattle The Kingdome opened in 1976 and was home to the Seattle Seahawks, Seattle Mariners, Seattle Supersonics and Seattle Sounders. Tiger Stadium, Detroit The decision to vacate Tiger Stadium in Detroit was controversial from the start -- and despite making the list of National Register of Historic Places in 1989, multiple efforts failed to save it. The former home of the Houston Astros and Houston Oilers altered the course of sports venues in the United States: many professional sports cities -- Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, San Francisco, Minneapolis, San Francisco, Oakland and Seattle -- built similar multipurpose stadiums -- some covered and some open-air -- for both football and baseball. Also referred to as City Stadium, it was named a National Historic Landmark this year. New Jersey representatives have introduced legislation to have it included as part of Paterson Great Falls National Historic Park.
