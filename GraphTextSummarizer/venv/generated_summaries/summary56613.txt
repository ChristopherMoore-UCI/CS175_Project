Physiotherapy for recovering dancers is well entrenched -- and organizations such as the National Institute of Dance Medicine and Science and the International Association for Dance Medicine and Science have done a lot to advance knowledge of health issues among the big ballet companies and schools that feed them. It is hardly surprising that critics often refer to dancers -- especially the hard-worked young apprentices in the corps -- as the "foot soldiers" of ballet. First screened at the Prix de Lausanne ballet competition in February, in the film Rump buzzes with enthusiasm as he documents his work rehabilitating leading dancers -- including world-famous principals Mathias Heymann and Federico Bonelli, and the English National Ballet's artistic director Tamara Rojo -- and his light-handed attempts to start a revolution in dance health. He's used to hearing the complaint from ballet company directors that (he recalls) "they are sports and we are art, and it doesn't go together. Rump now plans to spread his approach from ballet companies, to dance schools and beyond by compiling GJUUM -- a diverse team of sports scientists who will offer his all-round approach.
