There is information on public wages and private wages, but nothing which combines the two. This means the average wage as calculated by the ILO will not always capture what an average family lives on, particularly as self-employed workers in developing countries can earn much less than wage earners. -- CNN created the Global Wage Calculator with data supplied by the International Labor Organization, which takes on the gargantuan task of compiling the average wage of the world, as well as individual countries. The $PPP figure reveals the buying power of what you earn, inside your country, relative to the spending power of someone in the U.S. The G20 data is presented as an indicator of global wages. However, with wages stagnant in recent years, at least in developed economies, the differences are likely to be small.
