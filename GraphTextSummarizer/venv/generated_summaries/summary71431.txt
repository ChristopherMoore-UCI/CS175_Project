The battle between the families of civil rights titans, over three documents, is detailed in a  federal court lawsuit Belafonte filed against Bernice King, Dexter King and Martin Luther King III. King and his wife were known for giving documents as gifts and Belafonte is one of many associates who lay claim to what would become a library of civil rights papers. Harry Belafonte, one of the nation's most prominent African-American performers and social activists, is suing the children of the nation's pre-eminent civil rights leader, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. The King estate stopped the sale, alleging the documents did not belong to Belafonte. Belafonte, as a successful African-American musician and actor, is said to have provided for the very children he is now suing so King could pursue his activism.
