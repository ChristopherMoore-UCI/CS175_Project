Investigators are probing the June 3 attack on the mosque in Yemen's presidential palace, which occurred when Saleh and other senior officials were attending Friday prayers. -- The health of Yemen's wounded president is improving, but doctors are recommending that he stay in Saudi Arabia for a "longer time" to recover, an adviser said Friday. Close to 45,000 people in southern Yemen have been displaced, particularly in Aden, Lahj and Abyan provinces, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimated this week. Yemeni ruling party officials had been saying that President Ali Abdullah Saleh would return home Friday from Saudi Arabia, where he was taken for treatment after he was wounded in a June 3 attack on the country's presidential palace. In New York, members of the U.N. Security Council expressed "grave concern" Friday about the deteriorating security and humanitarian situation in Yemen.
