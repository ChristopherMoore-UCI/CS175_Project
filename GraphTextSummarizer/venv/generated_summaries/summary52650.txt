From Eliel and Eero Saarinen's Midwest churches to Marcel Breuer's austere concrete to the far-out experiments of Pietro Belluschi, the series is a beautiful study of how religion has long spawned many of the world's most beautiful buildings. "I was always in awe of how light and a few building materials like concrete, glass and wood can evoke a spiritual feeling," says Morlinghaus, who was drawn to the beauty of churches after experiencing the "very cathedral-like feel" of Eero Saarinen's Terminal 5 at JFK. But Morlinghaus, who describes himself as agnostic, says he's not trying to sell anyone on the merits of religion. Of all of the houses of worship he visited, Morlinghaus' favorite is the Thorncrown Chapel in Eureka Springs, Arkansas, designed by E. Fay Jones. The structures he documented are full of vaulted ceilings, soaring cantilevers and manipulated light, all of which are meant to enrapture believers.
