But the limiting factor of magnetic levitation is requiring a base to float over, effectively requiring that objects are stationary. This year, Japanese scientists used acoustic levitation to manipulate small objects with three-dimensional capability for the first time. High concept projects such as China's 'Super Maglev' would use this system for supersonic transport, and it could even support space missions. He has consulted on projects to float a 60-ton stage, and to enhance gravity in space, among other ambitious plans. "Or for use in our daily lives such as floating interactions at home and small object levitation."
