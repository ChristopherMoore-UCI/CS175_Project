Olympic snowboarding medalist Shaun White apologized Tuesday, a day after his arrest on vandalism and public intoxication charges at a hotel in Nashville. The guest didn't press charges, but White was arrested on the other misdemeanor charges after refusing to sign a citation, police said. White ran from the hotel after an employee accused him of smashing a phone, police said. A guest followed White from the hotel and called police, the incident report said. White was taken to a hospital to have his head injury checked, police said.
