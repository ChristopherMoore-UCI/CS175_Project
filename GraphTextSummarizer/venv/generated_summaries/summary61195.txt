"I had a tough first set and one bad game that cost me the set really," said Federer, who won the event on hard court in 2006 and then in its first year on clay in 2009. The world No. 1 thought the players should have been consulted on Madrid's decision to depart from the traditional red clay and the Serbian cut a frustrated figure on court. " World No. 3 Roger Federer survived a big scare against rising star Milos Raonic in Wednesday's late match, finally triumphing 4-6 7-5 7-6 (7-4) after more than two hours on court. It was the King of Clay's first work out on Madrid's controversial new blue clay surface but the world number two had little problem in dispensing with Davydenko in just over 80 minutes. I played a good tie-breaker overall." Federer, playing his first match in five weeks following a third-round exit in Miami, will next play French 14th seed Richard Gasquet.
