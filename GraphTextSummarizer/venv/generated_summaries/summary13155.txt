Here is a timeline of some key moments leading up to Gadhafi's death, according to Libya's interim Prime Minister Mahmoud Jibril, other National Transitional Council officials and other sources: -- Having taken over the city of Bani Walid earlier in the week, fighters aligned with Libya's National Transitional Council turn their attention on Sirte -- the last holdout of Gadhafi loyalists. Eventually, National Transitional Council forces put Gadhafi into the vehicle. According to Ali Aujali, Libya's ambassador to the United States, troops find Gadhafi during the day in a large drainage pipe in Sirte. -- Soon after the news breaks on Thursday afternoon, crowds throughout Libya erupt in celebration of Gadhafi's death. -- Moammar Gadhafi had been on the run for months, as opposition fighters aided by NATO airstrikes pushed him and his supporters from the Libyan capital of Tripoli and other long-time strongholds.
