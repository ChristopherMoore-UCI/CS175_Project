-- Passengers were evacuated from a Delta aircraft after smoke began coming from the wheel area, after it landed at Atlanta's airport Saturday afternoon, a witnesses and company official said. Flight 2284 had just arrived at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport from Pittsburgh, around 4:14 p.m. when the incident occurred, said Delta spokeswoman Leslie Parker. "After (the plane) landed there was a big boom, and then just a line of smoke," Kalel Dunst, who saw the incident from a hotel room nearby, told CNN. CNN's Justin Lear contributed to this report. Parker said the plane's brakes overheated, causing smoke.
