I believe deeply in the Democratic Party's vision for America -- and yet I also believe there is a time for bipartisan cooperation, and was proud to work for President Bill Clinton as he pursued many bipartisan efforts. Even though he no doubt can't stand me, I stand by my introduction of Stewart that day on "Crossfire":  He is both the smartest funnyman on TV and the funniest smart man on TV. The show went off the rails and Stewart, who began by denouncing our hostile environment, was within minutes calling Tucker Carlson "a dick." How Jon Stewart changed politics I told him that was silly, forgetting that this is precisely what he tries to do with his "Daily Show" interviews.
