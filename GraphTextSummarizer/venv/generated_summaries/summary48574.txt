-- Researchers have raised the alert status at Mount Redoubt, a volcano in southern Alaska, after another increase in seismic activity. Seismic activity at Alaska's Mount Redoubt again has scientists watching for an eruption. Bill Burton, a geologist with the U.S. Geological Survey, said since January there have been increases in seismic activity at Mount Redoubt followed by periods of quiet. An increase in seismic activity at the same volcano prompted a "watch" level last Monday. In the U.S. Geological Survey's color-coded alert levels, the orange "watch" level means the volcano "is exhibiting heightened or escalating unrest with increased potential of eruption" or that "eruption is underway with no or minor volcanic-ash emissions."
