In a sketch on this weekend's episode of "Saturday Night Live" that captures the gridlocked climate of Washington politics, President Obama pushes the bill (played by Kenan Thompson) down the steps of the Capitol to make room for a cigarette-smoking executive order (played by Bobby Moynihan). -- You sure gotta climb a lot of steps to reach the Capitol building in Washington, so just imagine what the tumble down is like. "There's an easier way to get things done around here," Obama (played by Jay Pharoah) tells a bewildered schoolboy visiting the Capitol. The sketch starts off the same way as the original "Schoolhouse Rock" segment, with a schoolboy meeting the bill on the Capitol steps. Bill launches into the classic "I'm Just a Bill" ditty, explaining how he goes from "sitting here on Capitol Hill" to the House, the Senate and then to the President's desk.
