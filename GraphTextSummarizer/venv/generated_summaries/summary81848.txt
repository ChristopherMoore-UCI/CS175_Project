Victim X said Sandusky molested him in 1988 when he was a junior in high school. All those years, he never told a soul that Sandusky had touched him, until November 2011, as Sandusky's arrest in other cases was making national headlines and leading news coverage for days. Most of the victims have settled with Penn State, but a few have refused to settle and Victim X is one of them. Instead, it was shelved for the possibility of a "round two" prosecution that was not pursued because Sandusky is serving a de facto life sentence; at age 68 he was sentenced to at least 30 years in prison for 45 counts of child sexual abuse. "What we're asking for is his day in court against Jerry Sandusky," said Victim X's attorney, Mitchell Garabedian, in Boston.
