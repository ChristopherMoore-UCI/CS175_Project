Hong Kong has a number of zones that suffer from persistently low levels of oxygen, which "increase in their severity and their scope whenever we have these algal blooms," he added. "Hong Kong and the entire Pearl River Delta has a big problem with wastewater, and that is surely a factor with these plankton blooms," said David Baker from the Swire Institute of Marine Science at the University of Hong Kong. Despite its blue hue, the phenomena is referred to as a red tide and, according to a Hong Kong government website that keeps track of sightings, several have been reported so far this year. When the blooms die, they sink to the bottom of the sea when they decompose, consuming huge amounts of oxygen. Cheung added that the algae can be deadly because it deprives the water of oxygen, though the government has not recorded any evidence of fish kills.
