Claybrooks alleges that at his casting call for the show he was interviewed for less time than white applicants, rushed through the process, and therefore not given the same opportunity as the white applicants. The production company says it has had "various participants of color throughout the series' history, and the producers have been consistently -- and publicly -- vocal about seeking diverse candidates for both programs. -- A class action lawsuit that accused ABC and the firms that produce the dating shows "The Bachelor" and "The Bachelorette" of intentionally excluding people of color from lead roles has been dismissed. As always, we continue to seek out participants of color for both 'The Bachelor' and 'The Bachelorette.' He said his application materials were taken by an employee of the defendants named in the suit; the same wasn't done for other apparent non-black applicants he saw.
