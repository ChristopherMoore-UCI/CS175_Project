-- Two weeks after being arrested for a shooting he said was in self-defense, a Florida man has been indicted on a charge of first degree murder and three counts of attempted first degree murder. Some have compared this incident to the Trayvon Martin case, the shooting of an unarmed Florida teen earlier this year that sparked nationwide protests and inflamed public passions over race relations and gun control. Martin's shooting also focused a spotlight on Florida's controversial "Stand Your Ground" law, which allows the use of deadly force when a person perceives a threat to safety. The indictment came down Thursday in connection with the November 26 shooting that killed 17-year-old Jordan Davis in Jacksonville. Michael Dunn also faces a charge of shooting or throwing deadly missiles.
