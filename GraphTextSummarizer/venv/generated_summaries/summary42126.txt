Bonny said he'll go back on his own during the summer "to do what I can in Port-au-Prince and to seek out my family." Project Haiti had planned to visit the Maison Fortune orphanage near the central town of Hinche during spring break in March, but the earthquake forced the group to wait until the week between final exams and graduation. Because Penn State's Project Haiti is a student-led organization without chaperones, Bonny is responsible for all 25 people on the trip, "and I don't feel that [searching for his family] is the best course of action for us." " Three students from Lawrence Technological University in Southfield, Michigan, are going ahead with a working spring break in Haiti. " Stock's roommate, Kelly Songer, 21, of Emporium, Pennsylvania, desires to bring hope and encouragement to Maison Fortune. "Originally the plan was to go over spring break, and I'd never had an interest in going anywhere where it was just about lying around and partying, and that's not me at all," she added.
