A new bill passed two months ago by the Florida legislature expanded the definition of a "slot machine" so that it would include regular computers being used as makeshift slot machines, closing a loophole in state laws that legislators said allowed some gambling centers to operate as Internet cafes and adult arcades. According to Kaplan, the owner of that network of computers could be in trouble for running illegal slot machines. "There are unintended consequences of hastily passed legislation in the wake of a scandal," said attorney Justin Kaplan, whose firm Kluger, Kaplan, Silverman, Katzen & Levine is representing the plaintiff in the suit. Kaplan says that the law is unconstitutional because of an amendment that presumes a device is a slot machine if "it is used to display images of games of chance" and involves a payout of anything of value. The state recently passed a bill to crack down on gambling in Internet cafes.
