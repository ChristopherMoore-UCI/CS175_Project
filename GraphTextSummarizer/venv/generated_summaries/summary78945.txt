" Open a Japanese architecture magazine or browse the Internet, and there are many examples of eccentric homes across the country, from strange polygonal structures to houses with no windows. " Avant-garde design in Japan largely caters to middle class couples or families building a small house, not the typical clientele of bold architectural ideas elsewhere in the world. Take for example, Tatsumi Terado and his wife Hanae who lives in a house with no interior walls, hardly any barriers and some ladders to get around. Calling the design "kind of a tree house," Fujimoto says, "We thought the whole house is like one big tree. "We feel we're getting in better shape these days," says Hanae Terado, extolling the benefits of all the climbing around the house.
