There are plenty of athletes competing in the 2012 Games who span the age range between Kpossi and Hoketsu, some of them well past their 30th year. As the world focuses on the competition and pageantry in London this summer, athletes over 30 are putting on one spectacular show. At 13, swimmer Adzo Kpossi of Togo is the youngest Olympian competing in the London Summer Games. Dressed elegantly in top hat and tails, the 71-year-old represents Japan in the dressage equestrian competition.
