The Cabinet meeting, led by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, discussed a report prepared by the National Board of Revenue that claimed it had found tax irregularities by Yunus between 2004 and 2011, said cabinet secretary Mohammad Musharraf Hossain Bhuiyan at a briefing. -- Nobel Laureate and microfinance pioneer Muhammad Yunus faced a new government fight Monday as the Cabinet ordered "legal action" against him for what it called "tax irregularities." Yunus, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006, however, denied the allegations in a news release issued by Yunus Center in Dhaka. On Tuesday, the U.S. State Department urged the Bangladeshi government to treat Yunus "in a fair and transparent manner, in keeping with Bangladeshi law and the principles of due process. "Professor Yunus has done everything with the consent and approval of the governing body," it said.
