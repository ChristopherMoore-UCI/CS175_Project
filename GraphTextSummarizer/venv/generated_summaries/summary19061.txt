" Schiller's resignation came a day after Ron Schiller, NPR's former senior vice president for fundraising, was shown in an undercover video calling the Tea Party "racist" and "scary" and questioning whether NPR needs federal funding. "I think that what's happening here is that not only are they looking at the budget but they're looking at a way to silence public broadcasting," said Rehm, whose show is broadcast on NPR outlets across the country. In the video, Ron Schiller says that NPR, which is partially funded by government money, would be "better off without federal funding." In his statement to NPR employees, Edwards said he recognizes "the magnitude of this news -- and that it comes on top of what has been a traumatic period for NPR and the larger public radio community. In the NPR video, Ron Schiller and another NPR executive are shown having lunch with potential donors, who were really working undercover for O'Keefe, posing as representatives of a Muslim organization considering making a $5 million donation.
