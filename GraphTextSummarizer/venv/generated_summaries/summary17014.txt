"We have now had a financial loss as a result of their indecision." Britain's ecosystems have suffered from serious tree diseases in the past, with as many as 30 million elms lost to Dutch elm disease in the 1970s. The detection of ash dieback disease, believed to have most likely been transmitted via fungal spores carried on the wind from continental Europe, has prompted environmental authorities to warn it will not be possible to eradicate the disease from Britain's "green and pleasant land. Infected ash trees develop lesions on their bark, and dieback and browning of their leaves, which can be harder to spot during autumn months. Jim C. Smith, an urban forestry adviser for the Forestry Commission, said ash dieback was "at least as serious" as Dutch elm, "but we don't know how it will actually spread in the country." "AshTag" is an app which allows members of the public to report likely sightings of the disease to authorities, along with precise location coordinates, using their smartphones.
