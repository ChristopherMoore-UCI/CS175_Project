Released as a prototype last year, the car is carbon neutral, entirely emissions-free and boasts electric motors and water jets to allow the driver to control the vehicle under the water. On land, on water, under the water: The Rinspeed sQuba will go anywhere you want and it is entirely emissions-free. The Rinspeed sQuba is a fully submersible car designed by Swiss car designer Frank M Rinderknecht. Inspired by James Bond's submersible Lotus Esprit in the 1977 movie "The Spy Who Loved Me," the car drives on land, on water -- and under the water to a depth of ten meters. The sQuba also has a compressed air tank which allows the occupants to breathe under water and all of the body work is water-tight and water-resistant.
