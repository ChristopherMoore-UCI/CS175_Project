The engineering went flawlessly," said Scott Hubbard, who was the first Mars program director at NASA headquarters and is now a consulting professor at Stanford University. But if Curiosity detects them, Wray said, that might help scientists move from asking, "Was Mars ever habitable?" to "Did Mars actually host life?" Curiosity's mission is also significant in an era when NASA's budgets are shrinking and China is becoming more ambitious in its space exploration program. NASA's rover Curiosity successfully carried out a highly challenging landing on Mars early Monday, transmitting images back to Earth after traveling hundreds of millions of miles through space to explore the red planet. Rocks and minerals found on Earth are different than on Mars, but the idea of a mountain made of layers is familiar to scientists. The phenomenon of sedimentary layers is remarkably similar to what is seen on Earth, in California's Death Valley or in Glacier National Park in Montana, said John Grotzinger, chief scientist of the Mars Science Laboratory mission.
