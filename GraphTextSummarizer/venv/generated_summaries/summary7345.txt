-- Uruguay star Diego Forlan said Monday that he is leaving Atletico Madrid and is set to join Serie A Inter Milan. Forlan, who appeared at a news conference with Atletico president Enrique Cerezo, said the La Liga club would always be in his heart. The 30-year-old Santa Cruz has fallen further down the pecking order at City with the arrival of Sergio Aguero from Atletico Madrid. In other transfer news Monday, Paraguay's Roque Santa Cruz has left Manchester City to join La Liga Real Betis on a season-long loan deal. Atletico have set up a special Twitter hash tag so their fans could pay tribute to Forlan, who scored 74 goals in 134 appearances for the club.
