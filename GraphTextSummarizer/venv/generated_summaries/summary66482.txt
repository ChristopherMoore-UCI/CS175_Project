This time last year McIlroy was suffering with an illness suspected to be Dengue Fever, and he ended up finishing second in the Race To Dubai standings behind Donald. However, he is battling illness which may mean he has to wait until next week's Hong Kong Open title defense or the season-ending World Tour Championship in Dubai before he can emulate Luke Donald's feat last year. Half the field had not played since Thursday, including veteran American Phil Mickelson and fellow major winner Padraig Harrington -- who were both down the field after the opening round. McIlroy, unable to complete his first round on Thursday, came back early to post a one-under-par 70 and was then level after 12 holes when the second round of the $6 million event was again halted. Caroline Wozniacki traveled to Asia to be by his side after her season ended last weekend at a tournament final in Bulgaria, but the couple -- dubbed "Wozilroy" -- has had to put up with rain and early-morning starts.
