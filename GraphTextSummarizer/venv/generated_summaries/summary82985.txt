Lessing "passed away peacefully" at her London home early Sunday, according to HarperCollins spokeswoman Susanna Frayn. -- Author Doris Lessing, who won a Nobel Prize for her life of literature, died Sunday at age 94, her publisher, HarperCollins, said. HarperCollins editor Nicholas Pearson called it "a handbook to a whole generation." "But her many books have spoken to us in so many various ways," Pearson said. Lessing began writing at 7, which she said was not the result of inspiration, but her innate capacity. Lessing, who dropped out of a school in the Rhodesian capital, Salisbury, when she was just 13, developed her writing skills by reading the works of Dickens, Tolstoy, D.H. Lawrence and Dostoevsky.
