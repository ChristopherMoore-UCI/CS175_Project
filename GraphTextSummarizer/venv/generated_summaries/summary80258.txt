" Haykal Maki, a pro-opposition lawyer who was in the throng, said protesters want a "regime change," the resignation of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, and lawsuits addressing the regime's corruption. In an address on national TV on Thursday night, Ben Ali addressed the crisis in a speech that came as street unrest percolated and a message purportedly from an al Qaeda affiliate announced its support of protesters. He vowed to cut prices of basic foodstuffs, to lift censorship and to ensure police do not use live ammunition except in self-defense, and indicated that he will not run again for president. " Ben Ali said he had asked the prime minister to reduce prices of staples, including sugar, milk and bread and said he had decided to give "complete freedom to all media outlets ... as long as they respect our values and the value of the profession." Tunisia has been wracked by angry demonstrations, with citizens protesting high unemployment, alleged corruption, rising prices, limitations on rights, and anger with the government's performance.
