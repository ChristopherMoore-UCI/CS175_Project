Sherwood threw caution to the wind and fielded an attacking lineup, starting strikers Emmanuel Adebayor and Roberto Soldado -- Villas-Boas usually just played with one up front -- as well as Erik Lamela and Gylfi Sigurdsson. It was the first time Tottenham scored three goals in an English Premier League match this season and the lack of goals was one of the reasons Andre Villas-Boas got the sack last week. Tottenham reclaimed seventh from Manchester United and trails new league-leader Liverpool by six points. The Toffees have the fewest losses in the league under newish boss Roberto Martinez -- one. Adebayor volleyed Soldado's cross in the 25th minute and central defender Jos Hooiveld scored into his own net under pressure in the penalty box early in the second half.
