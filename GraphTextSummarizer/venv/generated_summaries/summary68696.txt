Lapatin would not say if other funeral directors were being investigated but added that charges could be filed later. "The scope is a lot wider than Mr. Pennine," Lapatin said. The bodies were brought to another location, where a fee was paid for cremation, Lapatin said. This week, a man found the bodies of two adults and an infant in a storage unit previously rented to Pennine in nearby Johnston, according to Johnston Police Maj. Frank Levesque. After Pennine committed suicide last month, another funeral director found six bodies in a garage detached from the Pennine Funeral Home, according to Providence Police Maj. David Lapatin.
