"The University and football program have strict guidelines regarding issues of this magnitude," Alabama head football coach Nick Saban said. Three of the players -- defensive lineman Dennis "D.J." Pettway, linebacker Tyler Hayes and running back Brent Calloway -- appeared in 13 games last season. -- Just a month after reveling in the glory of a national championship, four members of the University of Alabama football team have been arrested after a pair of campus robberies. According to police, Pettway, Hayes and Williams punched and kicked a student shortly after midnight Monday until he was unconscious, CNN affiliate WVTM reported. The accused are all freshmen players for the Crimson Tide, which beat Notre Dame in a resounding 42-14 victory last month to clinch the BCS National Championship.
