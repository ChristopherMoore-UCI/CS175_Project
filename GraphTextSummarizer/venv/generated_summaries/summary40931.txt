In the past five years, grants from the group have supported 170,000 screenings, about 4% of the total exams performed at Planned Parenthood health centers nationwide, according to the group. Planned Parenthood's loss attracted moral support when CREDO, which describes itself as the largest corporate donor to Planned Parenthood, announced Thursday that 250,000 of its members had signed a petition urging the Komen Foundation to reverse its decision. Her stated reasons did not include the recent grant making criteria changes by Komen's global organization that impact Planned Parenthood," said a statement from Elizabeth Berger, president of the Los Angeles County chapter. The fallout from the Susan G. Komen foundation's decision not to renew funding for some Planned Parenthood projects has led to threatened resignations, angry press statements and a letter from Senate Democrats. "Planned Parenthood operatives are lashing out at Komen across the Internet and throughout the media, in what appears to be a coordinated effort to paint Komen's policy as cowardly and politically motivated." The Komen Foundation denied Thursday that its decision stemmed from politics.
