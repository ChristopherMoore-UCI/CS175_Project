People are built to expect these signals of attention, but cars refuse to provide them. And soon cars will be driving themselves, so that people can ignore the road and multitask their way to fighting for attention from each other, just as they do outside the car. While it is remarkable that cars can understand something that took billions of years of human evolution, the typical car recognition rate of 85% to 95% makes it a mediocre second-language speaker. One-day-old infants can distinguish speech from any other sounds and 4-day-olds can distinguish between their native language and other languages. And speaking to cars seems particularly desirable.
