The suspect's mother, Diana Chism, last month released a statement through her son's attorney saying her "heart is broken for the Ritzer family and the loss of their daughter and sister Colleen Ritzer." A ninth grade student told investigators that she was in class with Chism and Ritzer after school on the day of the crime, the affidavit said. "This is the first step in a long process to secure justice for Ms. Ritzer and her family," Blodgett said. -- Philip Chism, the Massachusetts teenager accused of raping and killing his algebra teacher, became visibly upset when the teacher, Colleen Ritzer, spoke about the teen's home state of Tennessee after class, according to a police affidavit unsealed Friday. She said the teacher and Chism were talking about China but, at some point, Ritzer mentioned the student's home state of Tennessee.
