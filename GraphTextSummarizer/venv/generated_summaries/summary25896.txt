SeaWorld employees testified that trainers of killer whales are taught to recognize "precursors" -- odd behaviors that could lead to aggression. Tuesday, while testifying about a 1999 incident involving SeaWorld San Diego killer whale Kasatka, trainer Ken Peters testified how the female killer whale grabbed his foot and pulled him underwater. OSHA attorneys reviewed multiple SeaWorld incident reports in which trainers missed aggressive behaviors. Since Brancheau's death, SeaWorld has forbidden trainers from entering the water with killer whales. SeaWorld employees on Tuesday testified at a federal job safety hearing that, while the behavior of killer whales is is extremely predictable, the job of working with a 6-ton marine mammal carries a calculated risk.
