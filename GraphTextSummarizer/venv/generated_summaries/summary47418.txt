"Denmure and her designated friend, charged to decide what was best for Bela, were unaware of Best Friends experience in providing appropriate care for dogs like Bela," Eric Rayvid, a shelter representative, told WCPO after it was revealed that the dog would be saved. "We are thrilled to announce that Bela has been released to Best Friends Animal Society and we are currently arranging his transport to our sanctuary in Kanab, Utah," wrote Francis Battista, vice chair of Best Friends. People across the country learned of 9-year-old Bela's story through media reports last week that emphasized a provision in the will of his owner, Connie Ley, that said the dog should be put to sleep and his ashes placed with Ley's ashes if a suitable home couldn't be found for Bela. Before her death on November 25, Ley worried that Bela's aggressive behavior could pose a danger to other people. But Bela will go to Best Friends Animal Society, the group revealed on its blog Tuesday.
