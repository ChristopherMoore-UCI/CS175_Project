The prison houses some of the country's most dangerous Taliban prisoners, and the escape was an embarrassment for the Afghanistan government and its Western allies, said CNN National Security Analyst Peter Bergen. -- The head of a Kandahar prison where a mass escape occurred this week was among 20 people arrested Thursday on suspicion of assisting the jailbreak, a senior prison official told CNN. The NATO-led International Security Assistance Force said the number of escaped prisoners was closer to 470. In 2008, as many as 1,000 prisoners -- nearly half of them Taliban members -- escaped after militants detonated a truck bomb against the side of the prison compound. "The escape of the prisoners are not possible without authorities' cooperation," said Gen. Amir Mohammad Jamshid, the chief director of jails in Afghanistan.
