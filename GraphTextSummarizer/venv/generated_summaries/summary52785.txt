Sanctions target Russia A new round of EU sanctions against Russia over its actions in Ukraine came into effect Friday, targeting six companies and a number of Russian officials and separatist leaders in eastern Ukraine. More disputes surrounding Russian convoys -- filled with aid, according to Moscow, though they were never checked by Ukrainian or International Red Cross officials -- that jetted in and out of eastern Ukraine. " Kiev and the West accuse Russian President Vladimir Putin of arming and supporting the pro-Russia rebels, and of sending Russian troops into Ukraine. The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, which has monitors in Ukraine, said that Russian vehicles began showing up late Friday near the border. A NATO military officer said Thursday that Russia has about 1,000 troops inside eastern Ukraine, down from a significantly higher number in recent weeks.
