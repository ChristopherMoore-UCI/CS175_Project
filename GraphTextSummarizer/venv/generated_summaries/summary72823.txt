Founded in February 2000, TripAdvisor now claims to be the world's largest travel website, hosting millions of reviews from its community of users. Good or bad, TripAdvisor usually thrives on reviews -- but when antitrust officials in Italy gave their damning opinion of the travel website, it wasn't quite so happy. It said TripAdvisor Italy had fallen foul of three articles of the Italian consumer code, "making it likely to mislead a wide audience of consumers. " Demanding payment of the fine within 30 days, the ICA also accused the travel company of failing to provide proper checks to weed out bogus postings. "We firmly believe that TripAdvisor is a force for good -- both for consumers and the hospitality industry."
