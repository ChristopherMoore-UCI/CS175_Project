-- Five males armed with guns and sledgehammers robbed a jewelry store at a Memphis, Tennessee, mall Saturday night, prompting shoppers and workers to hide amid the chaos, police said. After the incident, police received "numerous calls from people in the mall hiding and inside other businesses," according to Macon-Moore. She said that there were reports of gunshots, and Twitter contained various posts indicating that might have happened. The robbers targeted Reeds Jewelers in Wolfchase Galleria around 7:30 p.m. (8:30 p.m. ET), Memphis police spokeswoman Alyssa Macon-Moore said. "There are no reported injuries at this time," Macon-Moore said about an hour later.
