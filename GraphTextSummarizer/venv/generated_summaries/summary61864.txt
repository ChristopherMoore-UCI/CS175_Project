In a rare, joint news conference with the global news media inside the heart of Beijing, U.S. President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping pledged cooperation on a range of common interests as they concluded an unusually colorful economic summit. U.S. officials were confident the press event marked one of the only known occasions in which a Chinese leader had taken an unscripted question from an American journalist in China. Xi appeared to grimace when asked by New York Times reporter Mark Landler about international press access in China and whether he viewed Obama's "pivot" to Asia as an authentic component of U.S. foreign policy. Still, the news conference was the culmination of weeks of intense negotiations between high-level White House and Chinese officials who initially balked at the idea. China maximized its position as APEC summit host, staging an Olympics-caliber dinner spectacular complete with fireworks.
