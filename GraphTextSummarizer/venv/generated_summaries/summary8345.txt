-- The upcoming ninth season of NBC's "The Office" will be the sitcom's last, executive producer Greg Daniels said Tuesday. "As we head into the home stretch, we have a lot of exciting things I personally have been wanting to do since season two and the ending should be pretty cool," Daniels said. The show could have continued by adding characters as veteran stars moved on to other projects, but "the show would be changed to such a degree that it wouldn't be the same show," he said. Though the show's ratings are healthy -- it is NBC's highest-rated scripted series -- contracts are expiring for most of the original cast, making it "the last chance for us to go out together and to make an artistic ending," Daniels said. Is NBC developing an 'Office' spinoff for Rainn Wilson?
