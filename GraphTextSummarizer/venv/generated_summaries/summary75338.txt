"The reason there haven't been as many super-heroines as superheroes is when we first started doing these kind of stories, when Marvel was first doing The Fantastic Four and Spiderman and The X-Men there were many more men, there were many more males than females buying comic books so we always really directed our stories towards the male reader and we had male readers and male super-heroes." "We figured it's about time that we had heroes who weren't just all American and what we would be more and what would be more interesting than having a superhero who is Chinese? They were stories about monsters and witches and giants and magicians, well superhero stories have that same flavor but they are done for adults as well as for children." " Lee believes that this will ensure continuing interest in comic book characters which have stood the test of time. " After half a century of seeing U.S. comic book giants Marvel and DC Comics exporting American heroes to the world, Lee feels it's time for a change.
