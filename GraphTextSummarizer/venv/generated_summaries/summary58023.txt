Peak Facebook time is during the evening, just before bed. Perhaps the most unpardonable sin: 50% of smartphone users admit to checking Facebook while at a movie. Still, 70% of smartphone users are frequent Facebook visitors, with more than half of them checking it every day. The rest of the time is divided fairly evenly between Facebook messaging and posting updates. The study tapped 7,446 iPhone and Android users in the U.S. between 18 and 44 — representative of the 50% of the population that uses smartphones — and asked them questions about their phone usage across one week in March.
