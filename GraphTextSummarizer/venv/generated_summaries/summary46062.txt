" But the adoptive father said the real intent of the lawsuit "is just to uphold these constitutional principles -- integrity of a person's body, and some kind of due process for infants where people around them in power are considering doing surgeries like this." Pamela Crawford agreed. The defendants named in the suit also include doctors from Medical University of South Carolina and Greenville Memorial Hospital. Pamela Crawford said performing gender assignment surgery on a baby robbed her child of the ability to make the decision for himself. The lawsuit claims doctors at a state hospital and Department of Social Services workers "decided to remove M.C.'s healthy genital tissue and radically restructure his reproductive organs in order to make his body appear to be female." The surgery took place when the child was 16 months old and a ward of the state, according to a lawsuit filed by the parents against three doctors and several members of the South Carolina Department of Social Services.
