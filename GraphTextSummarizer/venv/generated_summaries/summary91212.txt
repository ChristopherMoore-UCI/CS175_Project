But local residents have told the group that the rioting began with a dispute between Uighur youth and Han Chinese settlers in a market, he said. Chinese authorities have blamed Islamic militants of Uighur descent for previous outbreaks of violence in Xinjiang province, where Uighur-Han Chinese rioting in July 2009 left nearly 200 people dead and 1,700 injured. -- Chinese authorities have made dozens of arrests following a deadly clash between Han Chinese and ethnic Uighurs in the country's remote northwest, a U.S.-based Uighur leader said Wednesday. Beijing says militant Uighur groups linked to the East Turkistan Islamic Movement, a separatist organization it says operates from neighboring Afghanistan and Pakistan, have been fomenting trouble in the region. China's state news agency Xinhua said 12 people were killed in rioting near the northwestern city of Kashgar, including two shot and killed by police during Tuesday's melee.
