-- Hundreds of military police raided a slum in northern Rio de Janeiro this weekend, seizing dozens of vehicles and hundreds of bundles of marijuana, state-run media reported Sunday. There were no exchanges of gunfire in the operation, the city's public security chief Jose Mariano Beltrame told reporters on Sunday, according to Agencia Brasil. The peaceful operation is in stark contrast to what happened in Rio in November, when at least 35 people died in violence set off after drug gangs lashed out at the increased police presence in the crime-ridden slums, which are known as favelas, police said. While Brazil has made significant economic inroads in recent years, poverty and crime remain significant problems in several areas, particularly slums in cities such as Rio de Janeiro. This weekend's operation, which culminated with the raising of a Brazilian flag Sunday morning in the Caixa d'Agua section of the city, was conducted by about 750 military police personnel.
