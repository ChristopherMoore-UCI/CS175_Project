" Wilson's father, Jack Wilson Jr., played for Hawaii in the late 1980s, the university said. "We are very saddened by the news of Willis' passing," Hawaii football coach Norm Chow said in a statement. Wilson, a running back, graduated from high school in Lakewood, Washington, and spent three seasons at the University of Washington. Wilson and two other people were in knee-deep water when the wave hit them, fire officials told KGMB. After an air, land and sea search, authorities found Wilson's body.
