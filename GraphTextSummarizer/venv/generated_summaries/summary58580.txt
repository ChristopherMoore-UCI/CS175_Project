"The language in 'Gatsby' is almost like poetry," says Louis Giannetti, emeritus film professor at Case Western Reserve University. "Films work best when they're extremely entertaining. "The Godfather" is usually Exhibit A: a fine, pulpy novel turned into a great film thanks to Coppola's attention to theme, photography and character. Len Cassuto, an English professor at Fordham University, says he admires the film version of "The Remains of the Day" for taking Anthony Hopkins' passive butler and turning him into a fascinating film character. Moreover, it can be tough for a film to translate the internal thoughts of characters and narrators into action -- turning subtext into text, in other words.
