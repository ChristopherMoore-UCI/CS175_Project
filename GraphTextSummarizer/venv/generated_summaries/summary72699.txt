I recently took a friend visiting around and she was looking for London snow globes. It is very green, very suburban, it has a lot of nice restaurants on the high street and like lots of London, you often see celebrities strolling down the street. You should spend all your time outside, but if it is raining, the museums in London are superior, generally free and a great way to pass several hours. I am the chief cameraman in CNN's London bureau and have lived in London since 1996. London Dungeon is the other tourist place I am not sure I need to ever visit again.
