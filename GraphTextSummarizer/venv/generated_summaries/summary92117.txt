On Thursday French President Nicolas Sarkozy denied reports of a rift between Paris and Berlin after Germany's unilateral ban imposed earlier this week on the naked short selling of eurozone sovereign debt instruments. "The recent crises and the risk for the stability of the euro area have underlined the interdependence among EU economies and exposed the vulnerability of Member States, in particular inside the euro area," the European Commission said in a memo on Thursday. The meeting comes as Germany's parliament voted in favor of a near-trillion dollar eurozone rescue package after German Chancellor Angela Merkel warned that the future of the common currency was in danger. Friday's meeting in Brussels has been called by EU President Herman Van Rompuy with the goal of delivering "economic governance" reform across the 27-state economic and political bloc by October. "I told Angela Merkel ... that we cannot have disagreements between Germany and France about subjects of this importance," Sarkozy said.
