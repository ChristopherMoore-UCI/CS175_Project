The defendants are accused of using public funds to pay lawmakers monthly bribes for their support during the first government of President Luis Inacio Lula da Silva in 2005. The main accusation in what is known as the Mensalao scandal, which means "big monthly allowance," is that the Worker's Party diverted funds from advertising budgets -- not for personal enrichment, but to ensure lawmakers passed Lula's initiatives through Congress. Brazilians have seen their share of scandals. The trial is expected to last a month and could tarnish the Workers Party and Lula's legacy ahead of municipal elections. They impeached President Fernando Collor in 1992 for corruption, but he is now an active senator.
