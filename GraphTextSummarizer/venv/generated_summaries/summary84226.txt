Dibaba used her famed finishing kick to pull clear of Kenyan pair Sally Kipyego and reigning world champion Vivian Cheruiyot with a 62 second last lap to win in 30 minutes 20.75 seconds. Ennis, the poster girl of the 2012 London Games, set personal bests in the 100m hurdles and 200m on the way to a first day score of 4,158 points, 184 clear of Lithuanian Austra Skujyte. With the long jump, javelin and 800m to go, Ennis has a healthy lead over defending Olympic champion Natallia Dobrynska of Ukraine and Russian world champion Tatyana Chernova, who were 10th and ninth respectively. The 30-year-old threw 21.89 meters to edge out Germany's world champion David Storl, who had a best of 21.86m. Reese Hoffa of the United States took bronze with 21.23m. Majewski matched the feat of American Parry O'Brien, who won successive golds in 1952 and 1956. Saturday's track and field action will see the first appearance for Jamaica's sprinting superstar Usain Bolt as he begins the defense of the 100m title.
