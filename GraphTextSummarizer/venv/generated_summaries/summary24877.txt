Please know we're going to work to ensure that, in the future, possible spoilers by official AMC social feeds are killed before they can infect, certainly before the West Coast (U.S.) broadcast of The Walking Dead. According to Forbes, "The Walking Dead" took over social media during Sunday's episode, with a 238% increase in mentions over the prior week. "The RIP hashtag specific to the episode was used by nine percent of people engaging on social media (Sunday) night, and three percent admitted that they cried because a character on the show cried," Forbes reported. " The network posted a #RIP photo on social media after the East Coast airing of the series' midseason finale, revealing the death of a main character. On Monday, AMC posted an apology to viewers on the show's official Facebook page.
