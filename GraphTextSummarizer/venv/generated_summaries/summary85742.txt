-- A Muslim Brotherhood candidate for next month's presidential elections here lashed out Monday at the eleventh-hour entrance into the race by Omar Suleiman, the former spy chief to deposed strongman Hosni Mubarak. "Banning former regime members from practicing their political rights for five years or even 10 has been discussed thoroughly, but the law has not been reactivated and there must be proof that Omar Suleiman has been implicated in political corruption before he is banned from running." The deceased mother of Abu Ismael held U.S. citizenship and used her U.S. passport to enter Egypt three times, Egypt's Interior Ministry has said. A millionaire businessman who served two prison terms under Mubarak, al-Shater is considered a conservative, though he is also credited as being the driving force behind the Brotherhood's affirmation that Egypt should continue to honor its international agreements. And Brotherhood leader Mohamed Badie has said the new Egypt "is under a serious threat" because its current military-led government "has failed to represent the will of the people." A military junta took power after Mubarak's ouster.
