"New Horizons is on a journey to a new class of planets we've never seen, in a place we've never been before," says New Horizons Project Scientist Hal Weaver of APL. "For decades, we thought Pluto was this odd little body on the planetary outskirts; now we know it's really a gateway to an entire region of new worlds in the Kuiper Belt, and New Horizons is going to provide the first close-up look at them. For the scientists on the New Horizons team, Pluto is very much a planet -- just a new kind of planet. NASA's New Horizons spacecraft is closing in on Pluto and its five moons. "The pictures are what we're all waiting for," Alan Stern, New Horizons principal investigator, told CNN.
