The border dispute arose after China, which supported North Vietnam during the Vietnam War, invaded its southern neighbor in February 1979 -- two months after Vietnam invaded Cambodia and ousted the pro-Beijing Pol Pot regime. The settlement of the dispute -- which covered the land border between the two countries -- came during a December 28-31 meeting in Hanoi, Vietnam, Xinhua news agency reported, citing a joint statement issued by the two governments on Wednesday. The two sides are still in disagreement over the Spratly islands, a chain in the South China Sea claimed by Vietnam, China, Taiwan, Brunei, Malaysia and the Philippines. -- China and Vietnam have settled a lengthy border dispute nearly 30 years after a month-long war that left tens of thousands of people dead, state-run media reported. A ceremony marking the agreement and building of land border markers will be held later, the news agency said.
