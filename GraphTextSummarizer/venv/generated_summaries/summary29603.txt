"Following press reports in Hong Kong earlier today claiming that traces of melamine had been found in a Nestle growing up milk, Nestle is confident that none of its products in China is made from milk adulterated with melamine," the company said. It has shown up in testing done on milk and yogurt, prompting at least two supermarket chains in Hong Kong to pull dairy products by Mengniu and Yili from store shelves, representatives from the companies told CNN Friday. Although tests are still ongoing, her illness is suspected to be linked to consuming milk products containing melamine, the hospital statement said. "Over 70 different tests are routinely conducted in the course of producing infant formula and other milk products," Nestle said. "In fact, the Chinese authorities have issued official certificates for all tested Nestle products stating that no melamine has been detected in any of them."
