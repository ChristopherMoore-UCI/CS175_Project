"A cheetah female can't produce enough milk for just one cub because a single cub won't stimulate mom enough to keep producing milk," cheetah biologist Adrienne Crosier said. Cross-fostering cheetah cubs is rare, having been done six times within the North American captive cheetah population. Single-cub cheetahs are usually at risk because their mothers don't produce enough milk. "Hey buddy, nice teeth," Padilla told the young male as he took a look in his mouth and swabbed a sample for DNA testing. After two cubs were born to different mothers at the zoo, officials decided to have one mom tend to both to ensure their chance of survival.
