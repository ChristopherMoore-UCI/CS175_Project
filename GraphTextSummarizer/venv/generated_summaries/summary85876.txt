They recently formed a music group with two friends called All Access, and Young, who earned a Grammy nomination for co-writing "Idol" pal Chris Daughtry's hit "It's Not Over," is also producing country songs for DeGarmo. The attraction was immediate for Young, who, along with DeGarmo, had to get naked onstage for each performance of "Hair." "We became best friends through 'Hair,' ironically not through 'Idol,' " says DeGarmo, who now plays as a New Jersey Mob boss's daughter on the CBS soap "The Young and the Restless." Nearly two years after falling in love, "American Idol" alumni Ace Young and Diana DeGarmo are opening up about their relationship. So when DeGarmo's tour ended last summer, Young found a way to keep her close.
