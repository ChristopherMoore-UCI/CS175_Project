"Chaplin rehearsed on film -- he'd try out an idea and do it over and over again," explained Mehran. "Chaplin was a perfectionist, the king of the re-take," said Hooman Mehran, historian and author of "Chaplin's Limelight and the Music Hall Tradition." At the time, sound had also started to come into movies, and Chaplin worried "City Lights" would be his last silent film -- he wanted to make it a masterpiece. "It's no coincidence that "City Lights" is about a blind woman -- a lot of Chaplin's heroines have a physical disability, which comes back to his mother." Now for the first time we can see the making of the memorable scene -- in which blind flower girl Cherrill mistakes Chaplin the tramp for a wealthy man -- in rare behind-the-scenes footage released by film archive the Criterion Collection.
