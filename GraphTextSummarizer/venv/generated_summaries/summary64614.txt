Srebrenica became an emblem for the dissolution of Yugoslavia -- once a multi-ethnic state of Serbs, Croats, Muslims and others -- into six countries during a bloody and brutal conflict in the early 1990s. -- Former Serbian leader Radovan Karadzic appeared in court Monday to defend himself on charges of war crimes and genocide, resuming a trial which he has fought for years to delay. Karadzic, who is representing himself, faces 11 counts of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. At the time, the defense requested time to study a large set of documents that the prosecution had submitted. He spoke firmly and fluently as he defended himself, occasionally looking irritated or dismissive, but not appearing to obstruct the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.
