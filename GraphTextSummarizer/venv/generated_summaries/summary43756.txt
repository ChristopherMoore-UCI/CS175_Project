"This is something I have felt strongly about for a long time: Bullying by certain Muslim groups will not be tolerated in a free country." Sulpovar said Pakistan's decision to block Facebook was ridiculous. "Islam discourages any visual representations of the prophets of God -- Jesus, Moses, Mohammed, anybody -- because we believe it can lead to a form of idol worship," Ibrahim Hooper said. There were riots around the world in response to a series of cartoons of Mohammed in a Danish newspaper in 2005, and at least two European cartoonists live under police protection after publication of their drawings of the Muslim prophet. Sulpovar denied being anti-Muslim. "Nobody is inciting violence or preaching open hatred towards individuals." Sulpovar said she is not a Muslim but added that she had received "hundreds of e-mails from people trying to explain this to me."
