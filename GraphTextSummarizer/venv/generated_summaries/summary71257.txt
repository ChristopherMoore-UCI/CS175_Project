Thomas Donahue, a son of one the alleged Bulger victims, told reporters outside of court on Thursday, "I don't care if he (Bulger) is tired," in response to Carney's request. Earlier in the day, before the jury entered the courtroom, the judge heard a request from J.W. Carney, Bulger's attorney, to postpone the trial until next week. Earlier in the trial, Weeks testified that he saw Bulger shoot Barrett in the back of his head after Barrett had tried to buy his way out of death. Authorities believe Bulger killed McGonagle, who was a leader of a rival gang in Boston. Bulger is charged in the deaths of 19 people during some two decades when prosecutors say he ran Boston's Irish mob.
