The Stamp Stampede encourages people to adorn their dollars, to beautify their bucks, to put make-up on their moola, to stamp money with messages that promote a constitutional amendment to get special interest money out of politics. But if we don't stunt the influence of money in politics, we may very well lose our democracy to special interests. Ice cream brings people together. Well, if we're going to save our democracy, we need a constitutional amendment that declares once and for all: 1) Money is not free speech. But change won't happen if we sit back and let other people do the dirty work.
