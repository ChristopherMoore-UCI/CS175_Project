Pope Francis has expressed his intention to visit the United States next year for a major meeting of the Roman Catholic Church, CNN Vatican analyst John Allen said Friday, citing Vatican sources. The General Assembly of the United Nations generally meets in September, leading to speculation that Francis might combine the Philadelphia trip with a stop in New York to address the U.N., according to Allen, a correspondent for the National Catholic Reporter. "There are more Latino bishops now than a few years ago, but the American hierarchy still reflects the old Catholic church dominated by the Irish and, to a certain extent, Italians and other people of European origins," he said. "As far as I know, he's never visited the United States, and as shepherd of the universal church it will really be beneficial for him to have a greater understanding of the flock here, and for people here to get to know our Holy Father," Paprocki said. During the five-day visit, the pope also delivered a speech at United Nations General Assembly, celebrated Mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral, and prayed at ground zero in lower Manhattan before leading a Mass at Yankee Stadium in front of 60,000 people.
