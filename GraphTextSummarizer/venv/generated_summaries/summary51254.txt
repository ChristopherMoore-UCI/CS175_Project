-- The Supreme Court has tossed out government fines against CBS Inc. and its affiliates for airing the infamous shot of brief nudity involving singer Janet Jackson during the 2004 Super Bowl. They worry, however, about unplanned, often spontaneous indecent or profane incidents at live events, such as awards shows and sporting events. But Roberts nevertheless agreed with his colleagues to dismiss the government's appeal, in light of the FCC's newly clarified policy allowing for no exceptions to fleeting expletives or images. The Justice Department had told the high court there was no "fleeting images exemption from indecency enforcement" and that the singer's act was "shocking and pandering," airing "during a prime-time broadcast of a sporting event that was marketed as family entertainment and contained no warning that it would include nudity." " High court rules for broadcasters on TV 'indecency' "The agency never stated that the (fleeting expletives) exception applied to fleeting images as well, and there was good reason to believe that it did not," he wrote.
