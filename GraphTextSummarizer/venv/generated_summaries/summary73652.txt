A stone's throw away in neighboring Long Island -- including in Nassau County, which borders New York -- the National Weather Service has issued a blizzard warning from 6 p.m. Thursday through 1 p.m. Friday because of a forecast marked by 8 to 10 inches of snow, wind chills dipping to 10-below zero and sustained winds up to 35 mph and gusting 10 mph stronger than that. Its forecast calls for about 9 inches of snow, subzero wind chills and winds regularly blowing between 21 and 26 mph, which could test newly inaugurated Mayor Bill de Blasio. Citing likely "near blizzard" conditions Thursday night into late Friday morning, the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency warned that 1 to 2 feet of fluffy, drifting snow could accumulate in some pockets and that there could be moderate coastal flooding. "Falling and blowing snow with strong winds and poor visibilities are likely," the Weather Service said. Even if it doesn't officially get socked with a blizzard -- which meteorologists define as three hours or longer of 35 mph winds or more and considerable snow -- New York City should come close.
