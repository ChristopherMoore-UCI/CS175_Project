It's part of a campaign to curb population growth in India, a nation of 1.25 billion people, second only to China in population. A surgeon has been arrested on charges of negligence and attempted culpable homicide in the deaths of a dozen women who had undergone sterilization operations at a mobile clinic in one of India's poorest states. Dr. R. K. Gupta, assisted by a team of fellow medical professionals, operated on 83 women in a span of six hours Saturday in Chhattisgarh state. Whether or not that is true, New Delhi-based Human Rights Law Network advocate Kerry McBroom said this is often not the case at mobile sterilization clinics around India. Women get paid (the women in Chhattisgarh each got 1,400 rupees, or about $23) to have the operations.
