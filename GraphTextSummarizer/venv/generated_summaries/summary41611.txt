It is true that New York City's Zuccotti Park -- like Tahrir Square -- has been enclosed by barricades and surrounded by police. Under the guise of emergency law, Egyptian police were given legal backing to crush peaceful protests. Ever since disgruntled Americans declared themselves the 99% and occupied Wall Street, their protests have been compared to those in the squares of the Middle East and North Africa -- especially Cairo's Tahrir Square â€” where pro-democracy demonstrations challenged decades of tyrannical power. In New York, police resorted to pepper spray and clubbings; in Oakland, California, police sprayed tear gas and are seen in videos apparently throwing stun grenades. During the first 18 days of the Egyptian revolution, police and other state security organizations killed at least 840 people and injured thousands, according to Amnesty International.
