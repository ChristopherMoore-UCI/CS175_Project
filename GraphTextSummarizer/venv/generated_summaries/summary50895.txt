In the past 20 years, the state's biggest cultural exports have been a show about organized crime and "Jersey Shore" -- a show, as most New Jersey residents will be quick to tell you starred mostly New Yorkers. Before taking the state's highest office, Chris Christie toppled corrupt New Jersey mayors like they were dominoes, sending them to jail one after another. It's not just New Jersey Democrats who are playing politics with the outspoken governor and possible candidate for president in 2016. So for many New Jerseyans, it's disappointing to see Christie now focused on answering for the actions of staff. He'd love to take down Christie and ignore the fact that tourism ads are regular practice in New Jersey or any other state with an abundant coastline.
