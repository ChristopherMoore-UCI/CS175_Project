'Fancy and comfortable' Cockerell found Masik Pass to be "fancy and comfortable." Austrian and French companies declined to sell ski lifts to North Korea. "The number of local Korean skiers was a surprise, considering that [before Masik opened] there was just one ski slope in the country -- and in a very remote and hard to reach area," Cockerell said. Controversial construction "We're aware of the controversies surrounding [Masik]," wrote Cockerell on the Koryo Tours blog. Koryo Tours is one of the few foreign tour companies operating in North Korea.
