Had Hull converted any of its three good chances in the opening half Saturday, the result might have been different and more pressure would have been felt by new City boss Manuel Pellegrini. "I think we have proved to a few people that we can play at this level." Still without injured captain Vincent Kompany, City's defense looked shaky and Hull striker Sone Aluko should have done better when he was in alone on struggling keeper Joe Hart. Hatem Ben Arfa's late strike eased some of the pressure on relieved Newcastle boss Alan Pardew. "You can't predict when you are going to score but what you can predict is your performance and in the second half we were terrific," Pardew was quoted as saying by the BBC. Although still early in the campaign, Manchester City was under pressure following a 3-2 loss at Cardiff City on Sunday after taking the lead.
