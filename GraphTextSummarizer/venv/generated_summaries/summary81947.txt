"Today is a black day for the Cypriot democracy and its people because of the loss of lives of our compatriots and injuries," said President Demetris Christofias. Defense Minister Costas Papacostas and National Guard Chief Petros Tsalikides resigned, Cyprus state radio said. In the meantime, the nation's other two power stations were "trying to meet the demand," said Costas Gavrielides, a spokesman for the country's electricity authority. The explosion knocked out power at the neighboring Vasilikos Power Station, the nation's largest electricity plant, the power company said. Greece's defense ministry announced Monday that it was sending a C-27 aircraft and military experts to help authorities with their investigation of the blast.
