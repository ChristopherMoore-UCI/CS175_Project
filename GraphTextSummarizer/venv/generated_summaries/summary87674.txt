A young female -- thought to be a teenager, said Wilson -- also was shot, with emergency personnel then transporting her to Tacoma General Hospital. Three sheriff's deputies responded to the scene around 3:45 p.m. Sunday after getting a call about a suspicious person "from a bystander who had concerns about a person inside the store," Deputy Scott Wilson said. The two deputies, both men with between five and 10 years of experience in the department, were sent to Tacoma General Hospital to be treated for what Wilson described as "non-life-threatening" injuries. Located on Sinclair Inlet, Port Orchard is about 30 miles north-northwest of Tacoma and across Puget Sound from Seattle. The store was locked down for about 20 minutes immediately after the shooting with about 100 people inside, Walmart customer Mike Lambert told CNN affiliate KIRO, with police tape used to cordon off the parking lot.
