The day before before the rampage, a video posted on YouTube featured Rodger ranting for nearly seven minutes against women who he said rejected him and popular kids who ignored him. " Rodger wrote about the website PuaHate.com as a "forum full of men who are starved of sex, just like me. But it's also in the blog where Rodger railed against life in Isla Vista. But the impetus for most of Rodger's angst stemmed from his unfulfilled desires for women. I had never seen what beautiful girls looked like naked, and the sight filled me with strong and overwhelming emotions," Rodger said in his autobiography.
