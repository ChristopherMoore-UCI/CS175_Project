"(The) World Cup in Spain was like dream come true for me," Baltacha said. Today, Baltacha spends his time coaching promising youngsters at English Championship side Charlton Athletic.

Baltacha, who hails from Ukraine (then part of the USSR and currently a country in political and social turmoil), was a cultured, yet physically tough defender and sweeper who made 300 appearances for Dynamo Kiev and earned 49 caps for the Soviet Union.
