But later in life, we can wake up and find our lives leeched of adventure. But if you think adventure is something that only happens to other people; that you are too unfit to climb a mountain, too scared to sail across the open sea, too nervous to travel through a country where you can't speak the language; perhaps you should rethink. The survey of travelers from 35 countries also found that people aged 41 to 60 are the highest participating age group in adventure travel. " "Women make up the majority of adventure travelers (52 percent) worldwide, with the most common destination being South America," said the trade association. Some are born with an adventurous streak, an insatiable curiosity that can only be quelled through discovery, while others seek out adventures as a means of conquering the demons within: fear, boredom, stagnation, a sort of dry rot of the soul.
