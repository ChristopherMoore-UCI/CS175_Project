The United States has steadfastly refused to do so in countries like Iraq with shaky, corrupt political systems and dubious legal systems. Keeping U.S. forces in Iraq would have put American personnel on the front lines of that tense, emotional confrontation.

One ought to ask hawks if they believe Obama should have exposed American military personnel to the tender mercies of Iraq's court system. The eruption of fighting in Iraq's Anbar Province is causing much consternation and recrimination in U.S. foreign policy circles.
