-- Southern China is suffering from its worst outbreak of dengue fever in two decades, with 1,000 new cases of the potentially fatal mosquito-borne disease emerging each day, according to official media reports. Elsewhere in Asia, Malaysia and Taiwan have reported more cases and deaths in 2014 than in previous years, and Japan has seen more than 150 infections in its first outbreak of the tropical disease since 1945, according to news agency Kyodo. And a new study released this week found that dengue cases in India may be 300 times the number officially reported. Local health authorities in China warned the situation was "severe," with six deaths and 21,527 infections recorded in Guangdong province in southern China by Sunday. The World Health Organization lists dengue fever as a "neglected disease" and estimates that there may be 50 to 100 million dengue infections worldwide each year.
