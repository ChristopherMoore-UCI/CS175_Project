Pakistan continued its crackdown on militants in North Waziristan for a sixth day Tuesday, killing more than 20 Taliban and other fighters with airstrikes, the Pakistani army said. It's also a base for foreign fighters and a refuge for members of the Islamist militant Haqqani movement. Over six days, more than 200 militants have been killed in airstrikes and ground assaults. Airstrikes early Tuesday killed 25 local and foreign militants at six terrorist hideouts, including a training camp and an IED-making factory, the army said in a statement. A curfew remains in effect, and all routes leading to North Waziristan remain sealed off with no one allowed to move out.
