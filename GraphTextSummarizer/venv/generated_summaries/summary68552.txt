-- Despite most of the team being of short stature and playing barefoot, the Triqui Indian boys from Mexico won the championship -- and the hearts of many -- at the International Festival of Mini-Basketball held in Argentina. It's something we lack in Mexico: character, strength, inner strength. If they did it, we can also win, we can qualify and be world champions," said Rigoberto Lopez, 11, a member of the Triqui kids team, to CNN en Espanol before traveling to Argentina. "The main idea was to help these children through sports, to give them a different opportunity: go to school, play basketball, to get away from the mountains, to see other parts of the world," he said. According to Zuniga, the academy's success inspired other Mexican states to adopt the Triqui community model.
