Authorities have said that Hernandez and two other men picked up Odin Lloyd from his Boston apartment in a rental car shortly before Lloyd was found shot to death on June 17. A grand jury in Bristol County on Thursday afternoon indicted Hernandez, 24, on charges of assault and battery tied to the February 25 altercation, according to a statement from that county's district attorney's office. Aaron Hernandez -- already accused of first-degree murder -- was indicted Thursday on charges stemming from a jailhouse fight, a district attorney's office in Massachusetts said. Bristol County Sheriff Thomas Hodgson earlier told CNN that jail officials would look at how the two inmates came into contact, because "no more than one inmate is supposed to be out at a time" in the unit in which Hernandez is housed. An attorney for Hernandez did not immediately respond Thursday to a CNN message.
