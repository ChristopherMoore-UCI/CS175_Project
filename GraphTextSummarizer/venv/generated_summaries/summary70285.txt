White voters were 74% of voters in 2008; they were 72% this year. Voters who look like James are on their way out; voters like Rebecca are our future. The big picture is this: Democrats are continuing to win big with the demographic groups that are growing; Republicans are still struggling to increase support with shrinking base voter groups. There's an entire chapter in "40 More Years" on the importance of youth voters. Romney lost by relying on a tapped-out, ever-shrinking group of voters.
