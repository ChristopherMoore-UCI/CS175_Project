But it's not just high-speed transport from A to B, Ockels says -- the Superbus can also use normal roads at normal speeds. A former Formula One aerodynamicist, Terzi has incorporated hydraulic cylinders in the design so that the car can sit just 7cm off the ground when traveling at high speed, rising to a height of 43cm when it uses normal roads in towns and cities. After taking a ride earlier this month, 61-year-old Branson commented on his blog that he thinks the Superbus could take on the train business one day, matching it for speed while trumping its convenience by dropping commuters off at their front door. Superbus is a new spin on public transport that aims to match the speed and comfort of a train while offering the flexibility and convenience of the car. Rear-wheel steering helps the Superbus achieve a 24-meter turning circle, going easily around a roundabout, says Terzi.
