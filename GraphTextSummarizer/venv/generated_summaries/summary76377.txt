Bottom row from left: Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's Prime Minister, Alex Stubb, Finnish Minister for European Affairs, and Pierre Moscovici, Finance Minister of France.

The business executives From left: Bob Dudley, chief executive of BP, Christophe de Margerie, chief executive of Total S.A., Christopher J. Nassetta, who heads Hilton Worldwide, and Jacob Frenkel, chair of JPMorgan Chase International. But there is no easy way to ask serious-minded men and women who hold high office, and who have matters of state on their mind, "do you mind if I take a quick selfie?" To be sure, they know what it is and may even have engaged in selfie-ing themselves.
