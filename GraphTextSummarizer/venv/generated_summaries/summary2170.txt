Jankovic, still seeking her first grand slam title, was Rome champion in 2007-08 and losing finalist in 2010. Ivanovic's only win over 17-time grand slam champion Williams came at January's Australian Open, but the 2008 French Open winner then lost to young Canadian Eugenie Bouchard in the quarterfinals. Ivanovic's compatriot, also a former No. 1, upset Polish third seed Agnieszka Radwanska 6-4 6-4 to give herself a chance of reaching the final for the third time. The American defending champion defeated China's Shuai Zhang 6-1 6-3, while 11th seed Ivanovic followed up her win over two-time Rome winner Maria Sharapova by beating Spain's Carla Suarez Navarro 6-4 3-6 6-4. Having suffered shock quarterfinal defeats in his former strongholds of Monte Carlo and Barcelona, the Spanish tennis star rallied to retain his Madrid title -- and on Friday he battled back from the brink of defeat in Rome to reach the semifinals.
