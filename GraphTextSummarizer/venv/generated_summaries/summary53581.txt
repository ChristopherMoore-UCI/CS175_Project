According to the documents filed in Multonamah County Circuit Court, Kaine Horman, the father of missing 7-year-old Kyron Horman, is alleging that Terri Horman leaked information from the sealed restraining order against her to Michael Cook, a high school classmate of her husband's. The documents also allege that Terri Horman, Kyron's stepmother, began a sexual affair with Cook after her stepson's disappearance and that she attempted to "abduct" her daughter from Kaine Horman. " Monday's documents also say law enforcement authorities told Kaine Horman's attorney that his wife's "relationship concerns and sexual overtures to Mr. Cook resemble those made to the man (that Terri Horman) previously attempted to hire to murder" her husband. The alleged sexual relationship between Cook and Terri Horman began on or about June 30 after Kaine Horman had moved out of the family home, according to the documents. The documents further allege that Terri Horman went by the gym where Kaine Horman works out "looking to 'abduct' her daughter, Kiara, from the gym daycare center," citing a gym employee.
