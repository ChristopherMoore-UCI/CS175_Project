Sprint tumbled to last place in this year's Consumer Reports rankings for U.S. wireless service providers, based on a survey of users. Although it trailed only first-place Verizon in overall customer satisfaction among major carriers, Sprint got what Consumer Reports called "dismal marks" for value, voice, text and 4G reliability. "Our latest cell service satisfaction survey revealed a somewhat precipitous decline by Sprint that shuffled the rankings of the major standard service providers," said Glenn Derene, electronics content development team leader for Consumer Reports. That, the group said, may mean many customers paid for wireless service they didn't need. "And smaller, no-frills, no-contract and prepaid service providers continue to do a better job of satisfying customers, and provide an increasingly viable alternative to some of the expensive, long-term contracts that many consumers find themselves locked into."
