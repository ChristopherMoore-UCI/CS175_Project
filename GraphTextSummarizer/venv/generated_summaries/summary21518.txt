She noted that both the Williamson and Pius XII controversies blew up "soon before what were expected to be major advances in Catholic-Jewish relations" -- the trip to Israel and the synagogue visit. Israel Meir Lau, a former chief rabbi of Israel and himself a Holocaust survivor, said it would "shame" the Vatican to declare Pius XII a saint. First, he said, Benedict XVI had merely ratified a decision which the Vatican committee that evaluates candidates for sainthood had already made about Pius XII. The Vatican has long argued that Pius did more behind the scenes to help Jews than he gets credit for -- but has not produced proof. He started the year by welcoming a Holocaust-denying bishop back into the fold, and ended it by putting the controversial World War II-era Pope Pius XII one step closer to sainthood.
