4 NATO troops killed in 'insider' attack in Afghanistan On August 10, 2012, Greg Buckley Jr. was gunned down by the very forces he had been training, just days after learning that he was to head home early. -- Deployed to a volatile outpost in southern Afghanistan where U.S. Marines routinely face a mix of skirmishes and hidden explosives, Greg Buckley Jr. sensed that an attack was imminent. But Greg Sr. said his son had informed his superior officers that "one day they are going turn around and turn those weapons on us. "It's not really day-by-day," said Greg's mother, Marina Buckley. "One of his superiors came over and had Greg apologize to the guy," said the elder Buckley.
