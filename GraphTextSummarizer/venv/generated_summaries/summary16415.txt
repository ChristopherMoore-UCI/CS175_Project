When their parents divorced, Cabra would visit Perez at his father's house on 13th Street, or Calle 13. "Later, it took on another meaning, with the question of whether immigrants are residents or visitors," said Perez, who along with Cabra, recently sat down to talk with CNN en EspaÃ±ol's Claudia Palacios. Though raunchy, the group's lyrics are often hard-hitting on social issues, and Perez is particularly well-known for being outspoken about poverty, Puerto Rican independence and education. "I liked to use bad words," said Perez, who raps and writes the group's lyrics. Their younger sister, Ileana Cabra, known as "PG-13," also performs with Calle 13 sometimes.
