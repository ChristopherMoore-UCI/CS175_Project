In the heart of Sao Paulo, Brazil's largest city, the Little Peruvian Corner turns out spicy lomo saltado -- or jumping sirloin -- for a fast-growing immigrant population. Immaculate red and white tables dot the second-floor walk-up business that's usually full of Peruvian immigrants at lunchtime. Villar hired Peruvian immigrants as waiters and cooks, but he still dons an apron and fries up the popular dishes. He used his savings and legal status to open Little Peruvian Corner. But today more immigrants are coming to Brazil, Latin America's economic powerhouse.
