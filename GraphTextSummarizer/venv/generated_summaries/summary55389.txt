-- Scotland's Andy Murray will face Roger Federer in the final of the Shanghai Masters on Sunday after both men eased past their semi-final opponents in straight sets on Saturday. Federer's semi-final win means he switches places in the world rankings with Djokovic, rising to second, behind current number one Spain's Rafael Nadal. Murray, who is looking for his second title of the season will face Roger Federer in the final after he beat Novak Djokovic 7-5 6-4 in the second semi-final. The record-breaking Swiss produced some vintage form to overcome Djokovic, who beat Federer in the semi-final at the U.S. Open last month. World number four Murray powered past Argentina's Juan Monaco 6-4 6-1 in 85 minutes at the Qi Zhong center to reach his second straight final at a Masters 1000 event.
