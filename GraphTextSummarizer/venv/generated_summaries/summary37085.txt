Novartis says it is seeking U.S. license for the vaccine's use in all adolescents and young adults which they say would "enable immediate response to future outbreaks," according to its press release. There are vaccines approved in the United States for other types of meningitis, but group B is the strain that does "pack the most powerful punch," the CDC said. "These recent outbreaks remind us how unpredictable the disease can be," said Andrin Oswald, division head for Novartis Vaccines. Meningitis B outbreaks are rare but deadly, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There were eight confirmed cases at Princeton and four UCSB students were confirmed as sick with meningococcal disease, which can cause meningitis or blood infections.
