-- FARC rebels in Colombia say they will release French journalist Romeo Langlois on Wednesday, according to a statement posted on a website linked to the armed leftist insurgent group. Dramatic rescues, escapes and hostage handovers have revealed harsh conditions in jungle camps, including stories of prisoners chained to trees, grueling marches between hideouts, torrential rain and blistering sun. The France 24 journalist was seized last month in a FARC attack on a Colombian army unit engaged in counter-narcotics operations. " He was reporting alongside soldiers when the rebel group attacked and captured him on April 28, the Colombian government said. Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said his government would do whatever was necessary to guarantee Langlois' release.
