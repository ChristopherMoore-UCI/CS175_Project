Leslie Waffen, 67, of Rockville, Maryland, pleaded guilty in October to an eight-year scheme to embezzle historic recordings donated to the government in order to peddle them on eBay. Among the items Waffen took was an original master copy of an interview with baseball great Babe Ruth conducted while he was quail hunting in New Jersey on December 10, 1937. That former radio engineer, J. David Goldin, told the Washington Post he saw the listing for the Babe Ruth hunting recording when he was searching the Internet in September 2010. Waffen stole numerous other items, including Herbert Morrison's eyewitness report of the 1937 Hindenburg disaster, a September 1924 transcontinental defense test phone call and the first network television broadcast of the World Series in 1948. Waffen sold it on eBay in September 2010 for a paltry $34.74.
