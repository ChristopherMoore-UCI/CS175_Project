-- U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton urged Syrian President Bashar al-Assad on Wednesday to accept the six-point U.N.-Arab League plan offered by envoy Kofi Annan as a way to halt the violence in Syria. For one, Annan, the joint U.N. and Arab League special envoy on Syria, is meeting with the Syrian government and with the opposition. "It has commanded a U.N.-supervised cessation of violence in all its forms, beginning with a pullback from population centers by the Syrian government and its forces, humanitarian access to all areas in need, and the beginning of a Syrian-led political process to address the legitimate aspirations of all the Syrian people that will lead to a democratic transition." In addition, she said, the United States is coordinating with the United Nations on the delivery of humanitarian aid and working with the Syrian opposition to "strengthen its preparation to participate in the Syrian-led transition process. " Furthermore, the United States also is calling on the Syrian opposition to refuse orders to fire on their fellow citizens as well as working with the Syrian business community on implementing the Annan plan.
