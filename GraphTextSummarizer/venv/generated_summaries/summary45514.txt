-- CNN senior international correspondent Nic Robertson analyzes the fallout from the publication of tens of thousands of U.S. military and diplomatic reports about Afghanistan by whistleblower website WikiLeaks. For instance, this allegation that the Pakistani intelligence service -- the Inter-Services Intelligence -- has been supporting the Taliban fighting U.S. troops in Afghanistan. A: They're absolutely damaging, the military says, because it puts troops in harm's way, it gives away factual details about how troops operate; for instance, the fact U.S. troops know heat-seeking surface-to-air missiles are being used against them is something they didn't want to put in the Taliban's domain. That's what WikiLeaks boss Julian Assange wants to do. They say the Taliban will use this against U.S. troops, they will look at all the analysis and they will use that to their advantage in the field; they will use these details of civilian casualties in their own propaganda.
