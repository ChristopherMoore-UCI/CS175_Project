PSI has ensured quality care by applying proven commercial franchising strategies -- think McDonalds or Subway -- to health care. About half of the spending on health care in Africa goes to private providers and care can be unregulated and quality inconsistent. In Tanzania, the franchise is called Familia. Lucy, a Familia community health worker, goes out into the community every day and educates women about family planning and other health issues. During my week on the ground, however, I met PSI community health workers, nurses, doctors and business owners who deliver controlled and quality health care across Tanzania. Lucy reiterated that for women like Sophia, access to family planning is a key to health and economic stability.
