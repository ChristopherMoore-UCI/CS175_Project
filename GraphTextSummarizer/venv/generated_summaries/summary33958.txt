Instead of clearing calendars to watch in real time and line up for the water-cooler conversation the next morning, fans of such shows as "Lost" and Fox's similarly serialized "24" might just as easily record and time-shift their viewing, avoiding office chats until they watched on their own schedules. It's likely that many viewers who gave up on "Lost" in years past will return for this final lap, hoping to witness something special. It's a very different TV world than in 1967, when the long-awaited ending of ABC's "The Fugitive," with David Janssen's Richard Kimble finally coming face-to-face with his wife's one-armed killer, drew enough viewers to set a TV record for entertainment programming that beat even The Beatles on "The Ed Sullivan Show" three years earlier. The creators and show runners of this labyrinthine drama series have known for years what the final image will be (my guess, and my hope: an extreme closeup of Jack's eye, ending the show just as it began), and are crafting this final season with an eye (so to speak) to the show's beginnings, as well as its endings. iReporter: "Lost" lives up to expectations After all, how many more opportunities like this will viewers get?
