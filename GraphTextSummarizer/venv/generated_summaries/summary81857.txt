Instead of encouraging physicians to see more patients, Medicare and the health insurers need to reward doctors who take the effort to engage e-patients both in the exam room and outside the clinic. E-patients can help, by recognizing the constraints on physicians and demanding that changes be made in the health system that will help doctors better meet the needs of empowered patients. In a recent survey, health marketing firm Manhattan Research found that virtually all doctors had patients who searched for health information online, and more than two-thirds of physicians found this to be a positive trend. When a primary care doctor routinely sees 30 patients or more in a day, combined with hours wasted on health insurer bureaucracy, taking the additional time to e-mail patients is not fiscally feasible when it is not reimbursed by Medicare or most health insurers. And, frustrated with the time needed to engage e-patients, he wondered, "if there [were] patients like this in poor, war-torn countries where the need for doctors is more dire." Most doctors, however, want their patients to be conscientious about their health and informed about their diseases.
