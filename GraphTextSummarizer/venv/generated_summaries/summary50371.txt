The Pentagon on Wednesday had estimated the number of U.S. forces in Iraq at 56,000, which reflected the last calculation conducted August 17, the military said in a news release. The brigade's departure comes more than seven years after U.S. combat forces entered Iraq, though it does not signify the end of all U.S. combat forces in the country. -- The number of U.S. troops remaining in Iraq is about 52,000, the U.S. military said Thursday. In all, the number of U.S. troops in Iraq has decreased by more than 90,000 in the past 18 months and Obama has promised that all U.S. forces will be out by the end of 2011. But there is plenty of work left to do, former U.S. Ambassador Ryan Crocker said Wednesday.
