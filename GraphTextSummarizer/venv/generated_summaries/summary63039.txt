Backers applaud Arizona legislators for taking seriously their concerns about illegal immigration and crime. But Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer and others who support SB1070 say it does not involve profiling or other illegal acts. One of the two lawsuits against SB1070 was filed Thursday by a police officer in Tucson, Arizona, who asked that local law enforcement be exempt from enforcing the measure. Arizona lawmakers say the law is needed because the federal government has failed to enforce border security with Mexico, allowing more than 450,000 illegal immigrants to move into in the state. All of them, as well as the Clubs for whom they play, have gone to great lengths to ensure full compliance with federal immigration law.
