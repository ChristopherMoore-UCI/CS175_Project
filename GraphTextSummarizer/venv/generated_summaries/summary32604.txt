The Canadian Council of Imams Declaration of religious freedom, gender equity, life's sanctity and individual freedom of choice, declared by the elite of Canada's scholarly and respected religious leadership on behalf of all of Canada's mainstream Muslim communities, denies the rights of radicals to define our religion. Muslims around the world offer thoughts on what Islam means today Western ideals are Muslim ideals. These signatories will lead Muslim communities onto a path of active engagement, taking back Islam and claiming it for multicultural peace. The Muslims expected a fight to the death but met people willing to live in peace, and they founded a society with rights, freedom, liberty and justice for all, regardless of race, creed or gender. Radicals regularly, ignorantly and blatantly abuse the Quran and the Sunnah (the acts of Mohammed that Muslims use to figure out what the revelations really mean) to promote the idea that Islam is a violent faith.
