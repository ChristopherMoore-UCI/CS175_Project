President Barack Obama poked fun Saturday night at his chief of staff and ribbed Washington's elite during a black-tie dinner at Alfalfa Club, a 93-year-old Washington social club. "I know that many you are aware that this dinner began almost 100 years ago as a way to celebrate the birthday of General Robert E. Lee," Obama said, referring to the man who commanded the Confederate army during the Civil War. Arizona Sen. John McCain, whom Obama defeated for the presidency, and McCain's running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, also attended the event. " On the president's first full day in office, Chief Justice John Roberts re-administered the oath of office to Obama after they flubbed during the inauguration. Colin Powell chats with other guests at the Alfalfa dinner in Washington on Saturday night.
