It's no secret that part of what makes crowdfunding campaigns spread quickly and gather a supporter base is social media. Also, by browsing their list of backers, you can get an idea of whether the supporters are part of the Kickstarter community (backed multiple projects) or are first-time supporters, meaning the project drove a lot of its own traffic.

Although ultimately, you want your backers to come away from your video and campaign feeling something, you must also back up your pitch with technical ability.
