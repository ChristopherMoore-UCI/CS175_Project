Pillay said the report concluded that "the abuses and human rights violations going on on the ground undermine the proclaimed reform package," and that she had recommended Syria be referred to the International Criminal Court "because all the evidence produced by the commission's report support a finding of widespread and systematic violations of human rights -- equaling crimes against humanity." That concern was raised in the Fact-Finding Mission on Syria, whose report concluded that Syria is guilty of human rights violations in its months-long crackdown on protesters and that it may be time for the International Criminal Court to get involved. The report called on the U.N. Human Rights Council to urge the U.N. Security Council to "address in the strongest terms the killing of peaceful protesters and other civilians in Syria through the use of excessive force and other grave human rights violations; to call for an immediate cessation of attacks against the civilian population; and to consider referring the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court." CNN cannot independently confirm reports by witnesses, the opposition groups or the government because Syria refuses to allow international journalists to enter the country. "The future of Syria must be determined by its people, but President Bashar al-Assad is standing in their way," U.S. President Barack Obama said in a statement.
