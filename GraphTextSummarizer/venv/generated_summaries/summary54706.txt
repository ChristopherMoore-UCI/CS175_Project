" The governor's executive action will not definitively end future use of capital punishment in Washington -- that would take action from the legislature or voters -- nor will death row sentences automatically be commuted or pardons issued. I refuse to be a part of this compromised and inequitable system any longer; and I will not allow further executions while I am governor," said John Kitzhaber, a Democrat.
