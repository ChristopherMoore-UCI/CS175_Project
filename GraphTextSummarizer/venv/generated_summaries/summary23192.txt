"New Year's Eve is the worst," the comedian said in a web only mini installment of his show 'Last Week Tonight with John Oliver.' According to Oliver: "Forced interaction with strangers, being drunk cold and tired, and having to stare at Ryan Seacrest for five solid minutes waiting for him to tell you what the time is." John Oliver feels your pain. But, if like thousands of others, you're dreading the night and its obligatory accoutrements, take heart. In the video, he offers you several excuses to get you out of New Year's Eve commitments.
