Despite the call to cancel Saturday's demonstration, some Iranians told CNN they would go out on the streets if they see protests taking shape, making the scope of the protests, if any, difficult to predict. Mohammad Javad Larijani, the secretary general of Iran's High Council for Human Rights, has said that the government only goes after those who incite violence. "While the international community has focused on Iran's nuclear ambitions, Tehran has been methodically crushing all forms of dissent inside the country," said Joe Stork, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch. A joint statement posted on Moussavi's Facebook page said that it was obvious to the opposition that if "innocent and defenseless" people took to the streets Saturday, they would once again be met with violence. Green Movement supporters have always said they seek democratic reforms and civil rights, not violence.
