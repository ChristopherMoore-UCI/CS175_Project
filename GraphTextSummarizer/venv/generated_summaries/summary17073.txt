A former exotic dancer has filed a lawsuit against Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, accusing him of sexual assault. In the suit filed Monday in Dallas County, Jana Weckerly claims that Jones assaulted her in 2009 and that the Dallas Cowboys knew about and covered up the incident. The allegations against the Cowboys owner is the latest distraction for the NFL, pulling the spotlight from its early season games. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said he does not rule out the possibility of Rice returning to the league someday. Ravens running back Ray Rice was cut from the team and indefinitely suspended from the league this week after video surfaced showing the moment he delivered a punch to his then-fiancÃ©e that knocked her out.
