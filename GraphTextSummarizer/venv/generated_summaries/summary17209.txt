Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department Detective Traci Gonzales knew there were drug and gang ties to the slaying, so she showed the videotape to Los Angeles Police Department Detective Ron Chavarria, a veteran on the gang beat. FBI Special Agent Scott Garriola believes Saenz graduated from local gangs to international drug trafficking -- crossing the border with falsified documents. -- Joe Saenz rubbed his hands together and smiled as he walked up to a Los Angeles County, California, home. Within days, Saenz -- also known as Jose Saenz, Louie Louie and more than two dozen other aliases -- was wanted for a third murder. A member of the Cuatro Flats gang, Saenz first stepped into police crosshairs in 1998.
