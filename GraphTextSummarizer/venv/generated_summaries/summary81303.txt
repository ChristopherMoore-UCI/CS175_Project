Aboard were Aaliyah and eight others -- including her hair stylist, Eric Forman, makeup artists Anthony Dodd and Christopher Maldonado, security guard Scott Gallin, video producer Douglas Kratz, Blackground Records employees Keith Wallace and Gina Smith, and the pilot, Luis Morales III. -- It's been a decade since the tragic death of R&B star and budding actress Aaliyah Dana Haughton. She had just completed her work on the film, "Queen of The Damned" and was already being sought after for other movie roles. So, on August 25, blast Aaliyah's timeless music loud and remember her for being a trendsetting force in fashion and for helping to redefine and take R&B music to another level. Born in Brooklyn and raised in Detroit, she quickly garnered a fan base in the early '90s with her original take on R&B music.
