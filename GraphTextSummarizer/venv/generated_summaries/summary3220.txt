In 2007, the mall changed name from "South China Mall" to "New South China Mall, Living City" and a revitalization plan was drawn up by current owners the Founders Group, a conglomerate set up by Peking University, and its subsidiary PKU Founder. Economist Brian Jackson says the shift in focus towards restaurants and businesses that target China's middle, rather than, upper class, is a smart move on behalf of the developers. Large parts of the previously abandoned buildings are now full of shops, restaurants and entertainment venues. China is also haunted by serious problems in its real-estate market, with over investment and large vacancy rates. Soon, it was classified by industry analysts as a "dead mall" and it became an unflattering symbol of China's runaway speculation on real estate projects.
