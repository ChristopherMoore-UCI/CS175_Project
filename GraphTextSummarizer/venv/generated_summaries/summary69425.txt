"During that time, we will focus not on a speedy recovery, but a thorough one." Russell is one of the founders of the San Diego-based nonprofit group Invisible Children, which produced the half-hour film about warlord Joseph Kony. The group has said it hopes the film and other efforts will make Kony a household name and drum up international support to halt the killings, rapes, abuses and abductions committed by his group, the Lord's Resistance Army, in central Africa. -- Jason Russell, who directed a documentary about a notorious Ugandan warlord that went viral, will remain hospitalized "a number of weeks" to recover from "reactive psychosis," his family said Wednesday. Russell, 33, was picked up by police last Thursday after several people reported a man running along a San Diego, California, street in his underwear, screaming, sources said. "The preliminary diagnosis he received is called brief reactive psychosis, an acute state brought on by extreme exhaustion, stress and dehydration." Russell's family said his doctors told them it was "a common experience given the great mental, emotional and physical shock his body has gone through in these last two weeks.
