The third bullfighter, Saul Jimenez Fortes, started with him, but Nazare, who as second bullfighter on the card would normally have faced the second bull, exercised his right to step in, replacing Jimenez in the ring. Next, it was time for the second bull, weighing slightly more than the first at 537 kilograms. Between them, they gored or bashed three bullfighters, putting them out of action, and forcing authorities to suspend a bullfight at the San Isidro Festival in Madrid for the first time in 35 years, said a spokesman for Las Ventas bullring, who by custom is not identified. But the tradition says the bull must die, so in stepped the second bullfighter, Antonio Nazare, who finished him off. But the second bull promptly butted Nazare so hard in the knees that he had to be carted off to the on-site infirmary.
