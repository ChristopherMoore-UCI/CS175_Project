The attacker detonated the bomb about 9 p.m. while in the "sleeping area" on the base, said Paktia province spokesman Roullah Samoun. NATO's International Security Assistance Force said that "several ISAF service members from the United States were injured" in an explosion on their base in eastern Afghanistan's Paktia province. It is unclear how the bomber got onto the base, but preliminary investigations show the attacker wore an Afghan border police uniform, Samoun said. An earlier suicide attack on a U.S. base in Afghanistan killed seven CIA officers and a Jordanian army captain on December 30. The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, also on a base in eastern Afghanistan.
