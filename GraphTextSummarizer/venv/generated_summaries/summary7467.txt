Family attorney Walter Madison said police placed Tamir's sister in the car with Loehmann. As Tamir Rice's 14-year-old sister rushed to her brother's side upon learning he'd been shot, police officers "tackled" her, handcuffed her and placed her in a squad car with the Cleveland officer who shot Tamir, her mother and a Rice family attorney told reporters Monday. Within two seconds of exiting the police car, Officer Timothy Loehmann gunned down Tamir, 12. " Cleveland police Chief Calvin Williams has previously said that four minutes after Tamir was shot, a detective and FBI agent arrived and the FBI agent administered first aid. "Two little boys came and knocked on my door and said, 'Police officers just shot your son twice in the stomach,' " she said.
