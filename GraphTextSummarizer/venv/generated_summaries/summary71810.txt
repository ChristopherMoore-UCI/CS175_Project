-- Family members of Meredith Kercher said Saturday they were satisfied with the verdict that found American Amanda Knox and her Italian ex-boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, guilty of the fatal knifing of the British student. Public prosecutor Giuliano Mignini told CNN he feels he presented a strong case. "Ultimately we are pleased with the decision," said Lyle Kercher, Meredith Kercher's brother. "You have to go with the evidence," Arline Kercher said. Authorities said 300 euros (about $444) was discovered missing from Kercher's purse.
