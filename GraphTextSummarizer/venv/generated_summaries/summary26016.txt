Many countries, especially small island nations in the Pacific and Caribbean, rely on coral reefs for fishing, tourism and coastal protection, and the report says that "degradation and loss of reefs will result in significant social and economic impacts." However, the report also notes that reefs have shown an ability to rebound from "extreme damage. As a result, "mass coral bleaching, a stress response to warming waters, has occurred in every region and is becoming more frequent as higher temperatures recur," the report says, noting that "extreme bleaching kills corals outright." "Our projections suggest that during the 2030s, roughly half of reefs globally will experience stress sufficient to induce severe bleaching in most years," the study says. "This report serves as a wake-up call for policy-makers, business leaders, ocean managers, and others about the urgent need for greater protection for coral reefs," said Jane Lubchenco, administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Add to that thermal stress from rising ocean temperatures and the number of threatened reefs jumps to 75%, the World Resources Institute found in the report, titled "Reefs at Risk," released Wednesday. " In order to help that recovery, "local threats must be tackled head-on with direct management interventions, while efforts to quickly and significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions are of paramount concern not only for reefs but for nature and humanity as a whole," the report says.
