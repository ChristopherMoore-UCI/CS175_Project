While it's tradition that potential White House hopefuls make swings through the early voting states well before the midterm elections to reach out to voters, court local politicians, help raise money for local parties, campaign for fellow Republicans or Democrats, and start to reach out to donors and campaign strategists, the action started a lot earlier this cycle than it did in the last one. They're all crucial early voting states in the presidential primary and caucus calendar, with Iowa kicking off the voting, New Hampshire holding the first primary, and South Carolina the first southern state to vote. In part, it's because this is the most wide open field on the GOP side in a generation," veteran New Hampshire Republican strategist Jim Merrill said. "Better candidates equals better run and earlier campaigns and that's what we're seeing this year." He's was in New Hampshire last month on an official White House visit on jobs and the economy.
