Paisley, LL Cool J team up for song Country music fans are notorious for excommunicating those whom they perceive as undesirable (see Wright, Chely). As a result, Paisley is getting hammered for pouring faux apologies on top of a stack of syrupy denials. "Accidental" attempts to address a subject matter so few artists in country music are willing to do, which makes Paisley a brave man in so many ways. In 2009, Brad Paisley released the song "Welcome to the Future" from his album "American Saturday Night." But its greatest sin is that in Paisley's effort to push for racial harmony, it miscasts the country's racial tension -- with emphasis on the Confederate flag and Abraham Lincoln -- as a distant thing of the past.
