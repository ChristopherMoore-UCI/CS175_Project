" In one of the greatest sporting rebuffs of all time, Owens -- one of 18 black athletes on the U.S. team  -- duly won four gold medals in the 100 meters, 200 meters, long jump and 4x100 meters relay. In 1976 he received the Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor the U.S. can bestow, and in 1990, a decade after his death from lung cancer, President George Bush awarded him a posthumous Congressional Medal of Honor. His 100 meters time of 10.3 seconds equaled the Olympic record, while his performances in the 200 meters and long jump -- 20.7 seconds and 8.06 meters respectively -- set new world records. -- African American Jesse Owens remains the most iconic Olympian of them all. Born James Cleveland Owens -- he was nicknamed Jesse by a school teacher -- he was the son of a sharecropper and grandson of slaves.
