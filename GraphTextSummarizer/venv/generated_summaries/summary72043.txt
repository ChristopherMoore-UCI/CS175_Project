In September, Air Force spokesman Lt. Col. Todd Vician said the Air Force believed that "Maj. Witt's discharge was fully consistent with the law and thus appropriate." The court found that Witt's sexual  orientation does not negatively impact unit morale or cohesion. In the summer of 2004, Witt was notified that the Air Force had begun an investigation into an allegation that she had engaged in homosexual conduct. On  Tuesday, the Justice Department filed an appeal of that ruling, but it is not  seeking a stay of the order to reinstate Witt, clearing the way for her to rejoin the service. "I am thrilled to be able to serve in the Air Force again," Witt said in statement released Tuesday.
