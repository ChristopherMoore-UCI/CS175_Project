"For those that we don't compress, we still strip out EXIF data," Facebook spokeswoman Jaime Schopflin wrote in an e-mail. "We do this since users can unintentionally leak sensitive information in EXIF data." Thompson, the security expert from AVG, commended these efforts. So if they weren't stripping that [EXIF data], it would be particularly alarming." " Users who don't want their photos tagged with GPS data can either disable the option on their cameras or run the images through software, such as Photoshop, that can remove the EXIF. Some photo services, including Facebook, TwitPic and Yfrog, strip EXIF once a file is uploaded and don't offer a way for users to access the original.
