Baseball Hall of Famer Tony Gwynn dies The statistics of Anthony Keith Gwynn are so off-the-chart absurd, they almost make a baseball lover laugh out loud: In the 20 seasons he played (all for the same team, the San Diego Padres), he did not slug home runs the way Babe Ruth or Hank Aaron or Barry Bonds did; on the contrary, a mere 135 homers in all that time? It was decided on a clutch 11th-inning double by a pinch-hitter -- yep, Chris Gwynn, the lesser of the Gwynn brothers historically, and it won the division championship for the Padres. " Tony Gwynn and a habit all too common in baseball He didn't play for New York or St. Louis or San Francisco. He and the Padres were expected by many to lose to the Detroit Tigers, a very strong team that year.
