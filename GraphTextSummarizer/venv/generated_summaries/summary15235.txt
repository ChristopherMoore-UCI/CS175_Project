Lima, Peru -- Murder suspect Joran van der Sloot arrived Saturday at the Lima police headquarters in Peru, where he is facing charges that he killed a Peruvian woman. The body of 21-year-old Stephany Flores Ramirez was found Wednesday in a Lima hotel room registered to van der Sloot, a Dutch citizen who was twice arrested and released in connection with the 2005 disappearance of American teenager Natalee Holloway in Aruba. The Dutch Consulate has told Peruvian authorities that it is not comfortable with the way van der Sloot has been presented to the media, Neyra said. Gonzalo said van der Sloot has asked for his mother, though authorities couldn't confirm whether she's coming to Lima. A hotel worker is seen in a surveillance video speaking to van der Sloot as he is leaving the hotel, Gonzalo said.
