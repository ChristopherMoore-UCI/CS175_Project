"Obama congratulated President Calderon for his leadership and Mexico's excellent work chairing the Cancun conference to a successful conclusion," the White House said in a statement, "that... advances the effort to address the challenge of climate change. History will judge harshly," the statement said, adding that developing nations will face the worst consequences of climate change. Christiana Figueres, the UN's chief negotiator at the conference, said the results had "reignited" hope in climate change talks. The agreement does not specify what will happen once the Kyoto Protocol expires, postponing the debate until the next scheduled climate talks in South Africa in 2011. -- Delegates at the United Nations climate change conference in Cancun, Mexico,
