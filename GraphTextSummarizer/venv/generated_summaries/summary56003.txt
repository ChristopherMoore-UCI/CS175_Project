The World Food Program said its two slain employees were Muhyedin Yarrow and Mohamed Salad. The trio was attacked in Mataban town in Hiban Province in central Somalia, United Nations spokesman Martin Nesirky said. Yarrow, 54, had worked for the agency for 13 years, and Salad, 28, joined the organization two years ago, it said. The incident illustrates the risks that humanitarian workers can face working in dangerous and difficult environments, Nesirky said. "WFP condemns the killing of people who devote their lives to helping others and extends its deepest condolences to the families of the victims," the agency said in a statement.
