-- Facebook and its photo-sharing subsidiary Instagram Wednesday announced new policies aimed at stemming online sales of illegal guns. The social media platforms have agreed to remove reported posts that evade gun laws, restrict minors under the age of 18 from viewing posts about firearm sales and provide education to better inform law-abiding sellers of guns. In November, New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman joined efforts to persuade Facebook and Instagram to issue new gun rules. Facebook already prohibits ads for the sale of guns or ammunition, said Bickert, adding that the new rules will strengthen that policy. Mayors Against Illegal Guns, the largest gun violence prevention group, which was founded by former Mayors Michael Bloomberg of New York and Thomas Menino of Boston, discussed the issue with Facebook officials.
