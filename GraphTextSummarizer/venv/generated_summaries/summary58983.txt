Tarantino told the gossip site Deadline that he had given the script to only six people, including actors Michael Madsen, best known as the killer in "Reservoir Dogs," as well as Bruce Dern and Tim Roth. -- A lawsuit filed by Academy Award winning screenwriter and celebrated director Quentin Tarantino against the Gawker website for linking to a script for a future movie project was dismissed Tuesday by a federal judge. Tarantino failed to prove that was an act of direct copyright infringement, said Judge John F. Walter of the Central District of California. "Reservoir Dogs" was Roth's breakthrough film. Although Gawker did not post the script to its own site, Tarantino's attorney charged the script would not have been widely accessible if Gawker had not linked to it.
