Ted Cruz, in a statement criticizing Obama's speech, said, "America saw a powerful demonstration that it is time to move on beyond President Barack Obama." " "It's unfortunate President Obama wants to use the tax code to divide us -- instead of proposing reforms to create economic opportunity for every American," he said on Facebook. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said in a statement that Obama got it "right" and "laid out ways we can create more opportunities for working families." Paul, for example, jabbed Obama's push for free community college with multiple tweets. Joining "Hambycast" by phone, Rubio later tweaked Obama's pitch to make community college free.
