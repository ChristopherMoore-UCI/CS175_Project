In conjunction with the campaign, the UNEP has released results of a survey it says highlights how concerned young people are about climate change. This weekend, 26 paintings with the theme of climate change will be auctioned in New York City to raise money for children most adversely affected by global warming. The vast majority of nearly 2,000 children surveyed in five countries decisively said that climate change was a top concern: Brazil (96 percent), South Africa (91 percent), India (85 percent), the United States (82 percent) and Russia (70 percent). But that is the case this weekend when a series of paintings go on the block with the purpose of drawing attention to climate change. Daniela Melendez, 14, of Colombia strikes a more upbeat note with her painting showing the globe and people harnessing alternative forms of energy.
