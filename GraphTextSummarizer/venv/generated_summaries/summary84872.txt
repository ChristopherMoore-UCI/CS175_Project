Ken Falk, legal director of the ACLU's Indiana chapter, said just because schools have access to information about students' behavior outside school does not mean they have the authority to discipline that behavior. As schools and courts grapple with determining where a school's authority ends online, more First Amendment cases like this one will crop up, said Catherine Ross, a professor at The George Washington University Law School and author of the forthcoming "The Troubled First Amendment in Our Public Schools. New tests are starting to emerge to determine whether online speech takes place "in" school, such as determining whether the person who created the speech made it available at school. "What schools have to recognize is there is that line and the type of stuff that my friends and I in high school did -- I'm in my late 50s now -- the school never knew about," Falk said. Churubusco High School's code of conduct says activities in or out of school that could "dishonor" the school are punishable, but the opinion questions the policy's constitutionality.
