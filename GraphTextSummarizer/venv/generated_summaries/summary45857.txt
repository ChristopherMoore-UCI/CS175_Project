The Mariposa County Sheriff's Office evacuated an undisclosed number of residents in the Ponderosa Basin area, and authorities said 700 structures were threatened. There continues to be a threat to the Ponderosa Basin community," Cal Fire said. Jamie Williams in the Cal Fire call center said Saturday night that almost all of the residents in the Ponderosa area have been allowed to return home. More than 745 fire personnel contained 60% of the wildfire, which ignited Friday, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said. California's ongoing historic drought is helping fuel the flames in the park's so-called Bridge Fire, authorities said.
