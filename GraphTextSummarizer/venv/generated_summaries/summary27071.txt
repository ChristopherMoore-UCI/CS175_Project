Holliday said when she looked at her caller ID and saw that the phone call was coming from her son's place of employment, "I just kind of lost it." Manchester police have said they have found no evidence of racial discrimination, and the president of Hartford Distributors said Thornton never filed a claim alleging racial discrimination. Omar Thornton, 34, called his mother, Lille Holliday, before fatally shooting himself, putting an end to the terrifying shooting spree that left eight people dead at Hartford Distributors in Manchester, Connecticut, on August 3. Asked about the how calm Thornton sounded when he placed a 911 call to police after the killings, Holliday said, "I think that he was at his limit and the calmness is something that he's always been. Holliday said she had few clues as to what Thornton was planning, but noted, "I could just kind of see slowly he was just getting frustrated and aggravated." "He was getting more stressed out and he started to just kind of change," Holliday said. "He said, 'I just killed the five most racist people,' and I knew he wasn't playing because he don't talk like that," Holliday told CNN's Soledad O'Brien in an interview that aired Tuesday.
