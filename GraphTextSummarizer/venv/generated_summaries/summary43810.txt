They are part of the general concept of the Culture Ministry and the government aimed at gradual renovation and reforming the cultural institutions, preserving their traditions and experience," Russian Culture Minister Vladimir Medinsky said Tuesday. Local newspapers quoted ballet members as saying Dmitrichenko was angry because he thought Filin was stifling the career of Anzhelina Vorontsova -- Dmitrichenko's girlfriend. He must now restore the Bolshoi's reputation after January's attack on artistic director Sergei Filin mired the ballet in scandal. Authorities painted Dmitrichenko as a villain -- the type of role Filin often cast him as in productions. Bolshoi dancer Pavel Dmitrichenko has confessed to organizing the attack, but said Filin was only supposed to be beaten.
