-- Seven American service members were among the 11 people killed in a helicopter crash in southern Afghanistan on Thursday, NATO's International Security Assistance Force said. What's different today, Roggio said, is that Taliban militants don't have the same level of equipment, coalition helicopter crews perform better and the aircraft receive excellent maintenance. In a separate incident Thursday, ISAF said another service member died after a bombing in southern Afghanistan. Some of the U.S. troops killed are believed to be special operations forces, according to Pentagon officials. Six other helicopter crashes involving Operation Enduring Freedom, the official name for the U.S. operation in Afghanistan, occurred this year, according to a CNN count.
