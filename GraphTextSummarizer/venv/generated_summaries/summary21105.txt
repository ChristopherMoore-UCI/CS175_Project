-- Montpellier's France international striker Olivier Giroud has agreed to join English Premier League club Arsenal. Giroud, who passed a medical at Arsenal's training ground on Monday, was a key player for Montpellier last season as the French club won Ligue 1 for the first time in their history, scoring 21 goals in 36 appearances. "He has proved that he is capable of performing at the top level with club and country, and we saw what a big influence he was in Montpellier's championship-winning side last season. "We're delighted to have secured the signing of Olivier Giroud," Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger told the club's website. The 25-year-old, who made three substitute appearances for France during Euro 2012, will officially join Arsenal on July 1 on a "long-term" contract though Arsenal did not disclose the length of the deal.
