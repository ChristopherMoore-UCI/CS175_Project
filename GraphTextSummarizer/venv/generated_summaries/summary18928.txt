The goal, Okereke said, is to engage with young minds and create a network of people that will push forward broader discussions about 21st century Africa. "Sudan is not a place people just wake up one morning and try to go to -- it is the place you hear in the news, " said Okereke. "We're talking about trans-African exchange," explains Okereke. But his constant need for movement is most clearly manifested through Invisible Borders, an artist-led project he co-founded in 2009 with the aim of finding new ways of portraying the complexities of life in contemporary Africa. "And this is what is beautiful now about Africa -- when people see something like this, they immediately imagine themselves being able to do it as well."
