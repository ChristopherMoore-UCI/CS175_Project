Though the Curse of the Bambino was finally vanquished with Boston's World Series title in 2004 -- and then for good measure in 2007 -- those victories came on the road, not at their Fenway Park home. But the person who shelled out the most for America's pastime on StubHub didn't even come from America: A fan from Calgary paid a whopping $12,092 for a seat near home plate, according to StubHub spokeswoman Shannon Barbara. The last time the Boston Red Sox won a World Series at home, the team featured a 23-year-old ace pitcher named Babe Ruth, who won two games en route to a 4-2 series victory over the Chicago Cubs. -- A front-row seat to potentially witness history Wednesday night at Fenway Park in Boston won't come cheap -- and neither will the tickets for standing-room-only. If a seventh game is necessary, it would also be played at Fenway Park, so either way, a team donning red will be celebrating in Boston this week.
