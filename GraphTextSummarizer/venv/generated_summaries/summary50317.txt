He asked for peace from drug dealers, corrupt officials who collaborate with them, and arms dealers. Pope Francis reminded the world of the Vatican's status as a state and his role as a moral diplomat in his traditional speech given at the end of Easter Mass. The Pontiff lamented the suffering of people in the conflicts currently making headlines and called for violence everywhere to end. Foremost, he asked that bloodshed end in Iraq and Syria and that humanitarian aid get to those in need. Francis mentioned Libya; the nuclear talks with Iran in Lausanne, Switzerland; Yemen; Nigeria; South Sudan; and the shooting at the Garissa University College in Kenya. "May the international community not stand by before the immense humanitarian tragedy unfolding in these countries and the drama of the numerous refugees," he said in his "urbi et orbi" address, Latin for "to the city (Rome) and to the world."
