Taveras "has done more to demoralize and disrespect teachers in 30 days than I think anyone could possibly do in the history of teaching," union President Steve Smith told CNN affiliate WPRI. In a 4-3 decision, the Providence City School Board, voted last week to adopt Taveras' plan to fire 2,000 teachers and staff to give budget writers more flexibility to make cuts. -- Hundreds of protesters took to the streets in Providence, Rhode Island, Wednesday to demand that Mayor Angel Taveras take back the termination letters he sent to every educator in the city last week. "People will have their voices heard -- however my resolve has not changed," Taveras told WPRI. The move has outraged veteran teachers and union leaders.
