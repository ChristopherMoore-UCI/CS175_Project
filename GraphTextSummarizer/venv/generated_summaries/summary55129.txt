Rita McCann still remembers the day when her joy at the prospect of giving birth to her first child turned into sheer terror. " Campaigners have accused the doctors, who worked primarily in Catholic hospitals, of putting their religious beliefs before the well-being of patients. I was screaming and being restrained," recalled Philomena, a pubiotomy patient and SoS member who recalled the birth of her third child in 1959, at the same hospital where Rita McCann had given birth two years before. Roughly 1,500 women in Ireland were subjected to symphysiotomy between the 1940s and 1984, according to the government. In cases where the pubic symphysis is completely severed, patients may get "earlier onset arthritis and joint degeneration," O'Dowd says.
