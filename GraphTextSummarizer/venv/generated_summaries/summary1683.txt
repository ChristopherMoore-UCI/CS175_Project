The NFL initiated an investigation into Favre's actions after the sports website Deadspin.com reported in August that the athlete sent voice messages, texts and pictures of his penis to Sterger in 2008, when he was the Jets' quarterback and she was working for the team as a sideline personality and host. -- Jenn Sterger, the woman to whom pro football quarterback Brett Favre "After much deliberation, LaRusso & Conway has been retained to represent Jenn Sterger and to advise her throughout the process," said Phil Reese, Sterger's manager and CEO of the firm Player Relations/Public Relations. Daulerio said Ahlerich also told him he met Tuesday with Favre and that the meeting was "even-handed" and that the parties involved were "well-represented." Daulerio has acknowledged that third-party sources were paid for the story about Sterger and that he could not say definitively that the messages or photos the site posted came from the 41-year-old quarterback. The Jets have given National Football League officials all the information they have regarding the incident, a team spokesman said last week.
