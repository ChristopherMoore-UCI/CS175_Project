Ruane believes Dublin is a good base for emerging companies, despite their consumers being located elsewhere. He acknowledges language barriers can prove more difficult for companies in Europe than in other parts of the world, such as the U.S. "There is a localization requirement; we don't have one homogenous market like the U.S. where there are 300 million plus people that companies can target." "I meet companies all the time where the founders have returned home after perhaps graduating from Stamford University and spending some years with the large internet companies in Silicon Valley," explains Ruane. According to Noel Ruane, head of Dogpatch Labs Europe -- which likens itself to a 'frat house for geeks' -- the city has enough of an internet community to rival Silicon Valley. The country continues to live off bailout funds -- yet in September internet giant Twitter announced its intention to set up headquarters in Dublin.
