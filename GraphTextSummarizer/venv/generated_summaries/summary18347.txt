My pick of the bunch, EZ Apps' $2.99 Hurricane Tracker offers detailed storm maps, National Hurricane Center info, threat level maps, audio/video forecast updates, real-time feeds and push alerts. If all you need is tracking for the Atlantic, Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico and the Eastern and Central Pacific, Kitty Code offers Hurricane Express, a cheaper $0.99 version that eschews the app's global features, and if you're looking for the tablet-optimized version of Hurricane, Kitty Code offers Hurricane HD for $3.99, which adds "exclusive" video and blog updates from HurricaneTrack.com. Fair warning: The free version of Hurricane Hound hasn't been updated in over a year, and it looks like the $1.99 add-free version is where developer STKI Concepts is focusing its attention, recently adding support for "current radar and weather satellite overlays." Hurricane / Hurricane HD (iOS) Developer Kitty Code's longstanding $2.99 hurricane-watching app (updated in June) offers a repository of global meteorological information, including tracking maps, satellite views, five-day forecasts, radar and bulletins from the National Hurricane Center. Hurricane Hound (Android) Hurricane Hound uses Google Maps as its framework and tracks both forecasts and the locations of Atlantic and East Pacific hurricanes and tropical storms, points out areas the National Weather Service is keeping tabs on and offers standard NWS "tropical outlooks and discussions, public advisories, forecasts, and satellite imagery." Pull up Hurricane Isaac and you can see information about wind speed, storm speed and direction as well as follow it from its genesis off the west coast of Africa in mid-August through its current position several hundred miles southeast of the Mississippi River Delta.
