The bluefin, caught off Hokkaido in northern Japan, was "an excellent quality" said Yosuke Imada, the owner of the high-end Kyubei sushi restaurant in Tokyo. The catch will be split by Imada and Hong Kong's Itamae Sushi chain. The record price reflects the increasing demand for high-quality fresh tuna, especially throughout Asia, with competition between Japanese and Chinese buyers intensifying in recent years. A giant bluefin tuna caught off the coast of northern Japan went for a record 32.49 million yen (about $396,000) at an auction Wednesday, the Tokyo Metropolitan Central Wholesale Market said. "It became a bit too expensive," Imada said answering questions after the record bidding.
