On the women's tour, Jelena Jankovic suffered a shock defeat at the China Open, going down 6-2 2-6 6-2 against fellow Serb Bojana Jovanovski. -- Juan Martin Del Potro is confident he can return to his best form in a month after crashing to a 6-3 6-0 defeat against Spain's Feliciano Lopez in the first round of the Japan Open. Radwanska lost 5-7 7-6 7-5 in a hard-fought match against Angelique Kerber of Germany. Del Potro is still working his way back to full fitness after an eight-month absence with a wrist injury, and world number six Lopez took just 82 minutes to dispose of the Argentinean. Elsewhere in the draw, Russia's Dmitri Tursunov earned an impressive win over seventh-seed Ernests Gulbis, defeating the Latvian in straight sets 6-3 6-4.
