The seventh seed will play in the last four of a major for the first time since the 2012 U.S. Open. Wawrinka will play Tomas Berdych for a place in Sunday's final, after the Czech upset third seed David Ferrer in Tuesday's earlier quarterfinal. "There were some special moments which went well together in this match, making it for the first time here in the Aussie Open to the semis, winning my first match on Rod Laver after all those years," said the Czech. At the end of a marathon four-hour encounter, it was Switzerland's Wawrinka who converted his first match point to seal a 2-6 6-4 6-2 3-6 9-7 win over the six-time grand slam champion. The world No. 2, a winner at Melbourne Park in each of the last three years, was beaten in a grueling five-set contest by eighth seed Stanislas Wawrinka.
