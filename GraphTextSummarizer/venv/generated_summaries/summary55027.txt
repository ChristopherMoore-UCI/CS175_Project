Preliminary results from a study by Hanna Tuomisto, at the Wildlife Conservation Research Unit, University of Oxford, suggest that cultured meat would reduce the carbon emissions of meat production by more than 80 percent. "If cultured meat looks, tastes, and costs the same as regular meat, then I think acceptance will be high. If cultured meat looks, tastes, and costs the same as regular meat, then do we care that it's produced in a steel tank, rather than in an animal farm? In this context Matheny believes his project could significantly cut the environmental impact of meat production -- using much less water and producing far fewer greenhouse gases. "We could reduce the environmental footprint of meat, which currently contributes more to global warming than the entire transportation sector," says Matheny.
