White also confirmed to CNN affiliate WSB that she had a sexual relationship with Cain, countering Cain's claims that the relationship was just a friendship "Absolutely," White said when asked by the affiliate if the relationship was sexual. He did not address White's assertion directly, and said Cain "has no obligation to discuss these types of accusations publicly with the media. She said their on-again, off-again relationship allegedly began in Louisville, Kentucky, in the late 1990s, when Cain gave a National Restaurant Association presentation to a group that included White. " White told WAGA the affair ended about eight months ago, as Cain prepared to announce his presidential bid. WAGA said that when it sent a text message to the number she identified as Cain's, the candidate called back and acknowledged he knew White but had been trying to help her financially.
