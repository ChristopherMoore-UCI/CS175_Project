-- A Singapore court on Friday rejected an appeal by a British author against a conviction for contempt of court over a book that criticized the  justice system. Statements in his book criticized Singapore's judicial system, leading to the contempt of court charge, according to the attorney general. His book asserts that Singapore's death penalty is applied unfairly to the poor and spares those with money and political connections. Singapore's court of appeal concluded that the book contained statements that undermined the integrity of the judicial system. Shadrake was sentenced to six weeks in jail and a S$ 20,000 fine (U.S. $16,000), a penalty his lawyer calls the "harshest ever received in a contempt of court case" in Singapore.
