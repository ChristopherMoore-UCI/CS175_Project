" Arctic tailgate The winter storm is separate from one that hit 20 states this week, pummeling baseball fans in Wisconsin and dumping record snow in parts of Kansas. So we're thrilled to see snow or ice -- whatever moisture we can get," Wichita resident Kristen Woodburn said. Some snow records Wichita, Kansas, saw its second-highest storm snowfall total on record with 14.2 inches over two days, the National Weather Service said. This is the third straight year of severe drought in the nation's breadbasket -- affecting not just Kansas, but also Nebraska, Iowa, Missouri and a host of other farm-heavy states. It is not expected to be as strong as the blizzard, but the storm could still pack a powerful punch, with between 6-18 inches of snow expected in some places.
