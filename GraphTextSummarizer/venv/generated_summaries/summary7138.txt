At this time, they form the largest curtain of falling water in the world, with more than 500 million liters of water spilling over the falls each minute. The falls straddle the border between Zambia and Zimbabwe, in the heart of two national parks -- the Mosi-oa-Tunya park on the Zambian side and the Victoria Falls park in Zimbabwe, which collectively form a UNESCO World Heritage Site. But anyone planning a visit to Victoria Falls will be relieved to know it's not just about bungee jumping. They were named after the British Queen in 1855 by Scottish explorer David Livingstone, but their local name of "Mosi-oa-Tunya" -- meaning "the smoke that thunders"-- is far more descriptive. The falls churn up torrents of raging white water, and where there's white water, there's white water rafting.
