Soderling, who beat Nadal en route to last year's French Open final, showed his ability on clay by winning the second to set up a decider. The fifth seed Verdasco might have been demoralized after his straight sets rout at the hands of Rafael Nadal in the Monte Carlo Masters final last weekend, but showed his fighting qualities against Soderling. Nevertheless, it was a promising first appearance of the season on clay for Soderling as he builds up to the French Open at Roland Garros from May 23 where Roger Federer defends the crown. Verdasco broke the big-hitting Soderling in consecutive service games as he took the opening set. With defending champion Nadal opting not to defend his title at his own club, Verdasco took advantage to add to his San Jose title success earlier this year.
