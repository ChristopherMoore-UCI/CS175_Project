So a lot of rich Republicans, seeing the Wisconsin recall battle as a preview of the presidential race, wrote Walker huge checks. The money raised in the recall already shatters Wisconsin's record of $37 million, set just 18 months ago when Republican Gov. Scott Walker was first elected. In fact, 70% of Walker's donations in the last month came from outside Wisconsin -- hundreds of thousands of contributors large and small from all over the country. One, Greater Wisconsin Committee, is trying to help push Walker out. Phil Prange has raised money for Wisconsin Republicans for 25 years.
