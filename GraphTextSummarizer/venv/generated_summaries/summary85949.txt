On June 1, an Air France Airbus A330 crashed off Brazil while en route from Rio de Janeiro to Paris, France. The Airbus 310 went down early Tuesday, carrying 142 passengers and 11 crew members on a flight that originated in Yemen's capital, Sanaa. A man hugs a relative of one of the victims at an airport in Marseille in southern France. The airline has three regular flights a week to Moroni, off the east coast of Africa, about 2,900 km (1,800 miles) south of Yemen. In the wake of the Air France crash on June 1, United States accident investigators have been probing two recent failures of airspeed and altitude indications aboard Airbus A330s.
