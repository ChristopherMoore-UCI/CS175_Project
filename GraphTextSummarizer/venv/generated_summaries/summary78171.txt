-- Warring parties in South Sudan have agreed to peace talks where a cessation of hostilities between President Salva Kiir's forces and supporters of former Vice President Riek Machar will top the agenda, the United Nations special representative to South Sudan told CNN on Tuesday. But the source close to Machar, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told CNN he was not going himself but was sending a team that includes Rebecca Garang, the widow of former leader John Garang, and the acting governor of Jonglei state. "There are reliable reports that a large number of civilians died in a series of selective killings in Bor town, in Jonglei State, and Bentiu town, in Unity State, that looks very much like an ethnic pogrom," it said. Negotiating peace A source close to Machar told CNN on Tuesday that the rebel leader has sent a delegation to Addis Ababa for talks with the South Sudanese government. Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, at a news conference, said that if Machar did not agree to talks, the other countries would "go for him."
