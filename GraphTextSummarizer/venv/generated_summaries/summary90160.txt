French forces are dealing with "determined terrorists" in Mali, said Defense Minister Jean Yves Le Drian, speaking to French radio station Europe 1 from the African nation's capital, Bamako. French involvement in the conflict began on January 11, the day after militants said they had seized the city of Konna, east of Diabaly in central Mali, and were poised to advance south toward Bamako, the capital. The French-Algerian man, who was sought by French police, was detained by Malian officers in northern Mali, Le Drian said. -- A Frenchman was captured among jihadists fighting international forces in northern Mali and is being extradited to France, the French defense minister said Friday. " France is using DNA tests to identify the Islamist fighters killed in recent battles in northern Mali, Fabius said.
