Champions AC Milan are third, a point behind the top two, after their goalless draw at Fiorentina on Saturday, while former leaders Udinese are now in fourth place -- level on points with Milan -- after losing 2-0 at Parma. A Jonathan Biabiany header and a Sebastian Giovinco penalty gave Parma a victory that lifted them up to ninth place in the table. The victory lifts Stuttgart up to sixth place in the table, seven points adrift of leaders Bayern Munich. Goals from Simone Pepe, Alessandro Matri and Claudio Marchisio put Juve ahead of Lazio, who drew 0-0 at Napoli on Saturday, on goal difference -- with Antonio Conte's side also having a vital game in hand. Jose Guerrero and Marcel Jansen secured Fink's maiden success after three successive draws as Hamburg moved out of the relegation zone and into 14th place.
