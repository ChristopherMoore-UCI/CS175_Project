The jury also found Thomas Chan, who was responsible for land acquisition at the company and Francis Kwan, a former Hong Kong Stock Exchange official, guilty for making a series of payments to Hui. After five days of deliberation, a Hong Kong High Court jury found the older Kwok guilty of bribing Hui between 2005 and 2007. Hui is the highest-ranking former official to face trial in Hong Kong. Hong Kong, a special administrative region of China, is considered to be one of the world's least corrupt territories. The tycoon, Thomas Kwok along with his younger brother, Raymond Kwok were accused of bribing Rafael Hui, the government official, in offenses spanning nearly a decade.
