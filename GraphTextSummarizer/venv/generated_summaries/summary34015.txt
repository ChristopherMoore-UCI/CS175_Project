CIA Director John Brennan has ordered an in-depth review of the intelligence agency's organizational structure, asking the agency to "take a close and honest look at ourselves." "Given that the review is still pending, the officers have not yet put forth their findings, conclusions or recommendations," said CIA spokesman Dean Boyd. Citing an "ever-growing number" of complex national security challenges as cause for the evaluation, Brennan announced the internal review in a letter to Central Intelligence Agency staff. The review will come as the CIA adapts to new threats from terror groups like ISIS and the al Qaeda linked Khorasan group have added to agency's terror landscape. The clandestine staff that collects intelligence information, for instance, is separate from the staff analyzing the data collected.
