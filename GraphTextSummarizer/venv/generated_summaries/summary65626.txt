The topic of women having the right to go topless on social media was addressed by Scout Willis, daughter of actors Demi Moore and Bruce Willis, in May when she posted photos to Twitter of herself walking topless in New York. It shows Handler posing topless astride a horse in the style of a famous photo of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Willis chastised Instagram for its nudity policy in the tweets: "Legal in NYC but not on @instagram" and "What @instagram won't let you see #FreeTheNipple." Handler posted a notice from Instagram that says the photo doesn't follow the app's community guidelines, which specify, "Accounts found sharing nudity or mature content will be disabled and your access to Instagram may be discontinued. #kremlin" Instagram pulled the photo down more than once, according to Handler, because it violated the company's standards.
