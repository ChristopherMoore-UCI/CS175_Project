The streaming service is committed to expanding its original programming, which currently includes shows like The Awesomes, Deadbeat and East Los High, as well as Casey Wilson's upcoming Real Housewives parody The Hotwives of Orlando, but original episodes of Community would put HuluPlus — with its six million subscribers — on the map in a bigger way, much like the revival of Arrested Development did for Netflix. Responding to the cancellation news on his blog, he said he was open to making more episodes ("I'm not going to be the guy who recancels cancelled Community") but also noted: "[T]here are lots of reasons a Community resurrection could be difficult.
