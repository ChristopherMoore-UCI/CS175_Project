"The defense believes that Mr. Brian Lucas contributed the DNA in the Alabama and Texas cases and that it is his DNA that was found during those crimes, not Aaron Lucas's." Aaron Lucas also argues that some of the Colorado Springs sex crimes may have been committed by a man who had been arrested for indecent exposure, defense attorneys said in court papers. Both of the Texas and Alabama cases "involve DNA evidence that the prosecution states matches the DNA of Aaron Lucas," defense attorneys said in court papers. " In fact, both Lucas brothers lived in Alabama and Texas, where the other sexual assaults occurred, but authorities in Alabama, Texas and Colorado say Aaron Lucas is the focus of their investigations, Colorado prosecutors said. "Aaron Lucas has an identical twin brother, Brian Lucas, who has (a) similar DNA profile," Aaron Lucas' attorneys said in court documents. When Aaron Lucas was arrested last year, Colorado authorities took his DNA and ran the findings in a national law enforcement database, said police in Madison, Alabama, and Texarkana, Texas.
