-- Brandi Fernandez, interim district attorney for Kaufman County, is a very capable and competent prosecutor, one of the Texas county's top elected officials says. Fernandez graduated from Texas Tech University School of Law in 1996. Before that, Fernandez was an assistant district attorney for the 106th Judicial District Attorney's Office in north Texas. " Another defense attorney told the Dallas Morning News that Fernandez was a "beast." "She strikes fear in some people's hearts," Eric Smenner told the paper, adding that she was tougher to negotiate plea deals with than other prosecutors, but that compromise wasn't impossible. Fernandez, 42, was the lead prosecutor in a case against a member of the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas, the Kaufman Herald reported in August.
