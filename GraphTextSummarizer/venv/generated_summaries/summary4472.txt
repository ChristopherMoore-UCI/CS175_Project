Last year, a couple of veteran reporters having drinks at a bar decided to mark the 20th anniversary of the Siege of Sarajevo with a reunion of war journalists. It's a lot easier to rebuild structures than heal ethnic divides magnified by atrocities of war but I am hopeful Sarajevo and Bosnia are heading in the right direction. Last week, the 20th anniversary of the conflict, I returned to Sarajevo for a reunion of journalists who covered the war. The vehicle was too small to include Kaplan, but a few minutes later another television crew offered him a ride into Sarajevo in their 'soft-skinned' van, with TV written in black tape across the back. It had a delegation from Belgrade that included Yugoslavian Prime Minister Milan Panic.
