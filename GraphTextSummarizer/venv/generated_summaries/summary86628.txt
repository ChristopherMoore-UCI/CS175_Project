It's peak harvest season in Oregon wine country, but you'll still pay less for hotels and other pleasures than you would in California's Napa Valley, Bowen says. "Spa prices are very reasonable, even at luxury hotels," says Indonesia travel specialist Diane Embree of Michael's Travel Centre, based in Westlake Village, California. Embree says that many of her clients stay in multiple hotels during a trip, just to experience the different kinds of luxury accommodations in Indonesia. "And, if you go to day spas, rather than hotel spas, the prices are extremely reasonable." Cambodia is high-end in terms of hotel experiences, but extremely cheap in terms of getting around and eating good meals, she says.
