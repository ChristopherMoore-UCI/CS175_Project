-- Holders Inter Milan are through to the quarterfinals of the Italian Cup, defeating Genoa 2-1 at the San Siro despite coach Claudio Ranieri resting a host of key players. Genoa pulled a consolation goal back in injury time when Lucas Pratto's shot hit the crossbar and Valter Birsa reacted first to score from close range. Goals from Jonas, Roberto Soldado, Pablo Piatti and Tino Costa have put Valencia in a strong position ahead of next week's second leg tie. Inter took the lead in the ninth minute when Brazilian defender Maicon let fly with a superb 25-yard shot that gave Cristiano Lupatelli no chance in the Genoa goal. And the home side doubled their lead five minutes after the break when Andrea Poli played a one-two with Joel Obi before volleying home his first goal for the club.
