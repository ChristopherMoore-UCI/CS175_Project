Kwiatkowski appeared in New Hampshire federal court last Tuesday and waived his right to a detention hearing. "The filing of federal criminal charges in New Hampshire was the first information ARRT received about Mr. Kwiatkowski that met the standard of evidence enabling the organization to remove his ARRT credential," the registry said in a statement. Authorities accuse him of stealing drugs from Exeter Hospital, and it's believed he infected 30 people in New Hampshire with hepatitis C through infected syringes. Those are two areas that Kwiatkowski visited during his "routine duties to transport patients," an Exeter Hospital statement said.
