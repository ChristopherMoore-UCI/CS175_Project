The statement noted that "a number of U.S. Embassy vehicles" were stolen on January 28, when Egyptian police abandoned their posts in droves around Cairo. The YouTube video, dated January 28, is one of three from recent days showing drivers seemingly purposefully ramming their vehicle into demonstrators in streets that appear to be around Cairo's Tahrir Square. Later, the State Department and U.S. Embassy in Egypt issued a joint statement also acknowledging video of the "hit-and-run" incident that "injured dozens in Cairo." -- A white diplomatic van shown plowing into anti-government protesters in Cairo might belong to the United States, officials said, adding that 20 such vehicles have been stolen in Egypt amid the unrest. A spokesman did not explain how U.S. officials came to that casualty toll.
