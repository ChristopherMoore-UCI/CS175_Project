"If our friendship with Israel is going to continue, an apology and compensation are the only possible ways for it." Turkey was once Israel's strongest ally among Muslim nations, but the relationship between the two nations has been chilly since May 31, when Israeli forces intercepted an aid flotilla headed to Gaza from Turkey. Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu criticized Israel for not reciprocating his country's efforts to remedy relations, despite Turkey's "wish to reconcile with Israel," according to the state-run Anadolu news agency. Turkey's foreign minister continued Saturday to press for an apology from Israel over its forces killing nine Turkish activists, a day before the boat that set off the row between the two countries is scheduled to arrive in Istanbul. In September, the U.N. Human Rights Council concluded that Israeli forces committed serious violations of international law in the mid-sea interception. Tens of thousands of people are expected Sunday to greet the boat at the center of the controversy, the Mavi Marmara, when it arrives Sunday in Istanbul, according to a press release from Foundation for Human Rights and Freedoms and Humanitarian Relief.
