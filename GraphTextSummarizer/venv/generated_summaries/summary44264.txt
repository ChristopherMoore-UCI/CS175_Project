A review of a computer hard drive used by cop-killing suspect Eric Matthew Frein shows he planned the attack and his retreat into the woods for a couple of years, Pennsylvania State Police Lt. Col George Bivens said Friday. Bivens said a hard drive which Frein had access to indicated extensive Internet research on topics such as "how to avoid police manhunts, use of various law enforcement technologies and skills related to survival." "It did give us a lot of insight into the techniques that he might be employing -- what his escape might involve," Bivens said. "Frein has been known to visit the area in the past and it is a large facility that needs to be cleared," Pennsylvania State Trooper Tom Kelly said via email. Who is suspect Eric Frein? "There has been no sighting there or no one specific reason as to why it is being searched." Bivens added, "We do know he has an interest in that location and do know he has spent some time there." A war buff obsessed with Eastern European military conflicts, Frein has "experimented with explosives," Bivens said.
