"When our child pornography laws were written, they failed to take into account advances in technology, such as cell phones," Abruzzo said in a statement published on the website of CNN affiliate WPBF in West Palm Beach. "There's probably a lot of kids who don't realize how this (sexting) could impact their life," Karl Bergstrom of Fort Myers told CNN affiliate WINK. This reform will let our youth know that such behavior is wrong without labeling them sex offenders for the rest of their lives. Under House Bill 75, teens who receive explicit images won't be charged if they took reasonable steps to report it, did not solicit the image and did not send it to someone. "(This bill) modernizes these laws to ensure that children's lives are not ruined due to youthful indiscretion.
