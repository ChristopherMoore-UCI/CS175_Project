Chen had said early Friday that U.S. Embassy officials had told him Chinese security personnel stopped U.S. diplomats from entering his hospital room Thursday. When Chen left the embassy, U.S. officials announced that they had worked out a deal with China for his future and that Chen was leaving of his own free will. His statements prompted bewildered reactions from U.S. officials, who reiterated that the decision to leave the embassy was Chen's and that he had repeatedly said he wished to remain in China. " U.S. Ambassador to China Gary Locke, who spoke with Chen by phone for 20 minutes, said Chen told him he wants to travel to the United States for study, senior U.S. officials said. But Chen subsequently indicated he regretted having abandoned the embassy and made pleas through CNN and other international news organizations to U.S. leaders to get him out of China.
