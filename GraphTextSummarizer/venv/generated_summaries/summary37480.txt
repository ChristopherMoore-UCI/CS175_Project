Outlining how CAS reacted to the two now famous lithium-ion battery incidents is the head of CAS, Louis J. Mancini, senior vice president, and James Testin, managing director of AOG (Aircraft On Ground) Aircraft Services. " CAS's 10 teams fanned out to Asia, Europe, Africa and the United States while awaiting the FAA review of the design and fix. " Multiple skill sets "Within CAS we had enough personnel to do what we needed to do [to install the fix]," says Testin. The parts easily go into a lower cargo hold but the tools and logistics to do the work are more suitable for a freighter, Testin says. What began as a typical repair reaction by CAS to the JAL incident became an international crisis a day later on January 16 when the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration grounded the six U.S.-registered 787s operated by United Airlines.
