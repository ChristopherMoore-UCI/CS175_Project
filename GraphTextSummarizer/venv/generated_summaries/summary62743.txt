The other thing we realized is that music is something that is deeply personal to people and curating that experience is definitely a personal experience. Look, the way we think about it is that there are 500 million people right now that listen to music online, and out of those 500 million the vast majority of people listen illegally. Ek: The most important thing in converting people from pirate users to legal users has been to get them to engage more in music. We just feel that what is missing right now is sort of music across the Web. So we felt that what we added to the table was really powering music to all these great experiences.
