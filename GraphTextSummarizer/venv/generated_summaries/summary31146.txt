The church asked Schaefer to decide whether his advocacy on behalf of the gay community would prevent him from fully complying with church law, according to a statement from Bishop Peggy Johnson of the United Methodist Church. On Thursday, the minister at Zion United Methodist Church of Iona in the small town of Lebanon was found guilty in a church trial for officiating his son's same-sex wedding, church officials said. When Frank Schaefer's son was in his teens, he was suicidal, torn by sadness that the church would think less of him for being gay, Schaefer said Friday on CNN's "New Day." So he was upfront with church officials. He refused again, forcing church officials to defrock him.
