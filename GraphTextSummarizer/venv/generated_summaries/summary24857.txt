Brooklyn, New York The Brooklyn Botanic Garden, which claims a more diverse collection of Japanese flowering cherries in one place than anywhere in the world outside Japan, celebrates cherry blossom season April 1-29. The city began planting cherry trees in significant numbers in the early 1930s after the mayors of Kobe and Yokohama presented Vancouver with 500 Japanese cherry trees to honor Japanese Canadians who served in World War I. Fukuoka, Japan The most dedicated of cherry blossom lovers will head to Japan to celebrate the blossom as the Japanese do. Wherever cherry trees thrive and are beloved, look for cherry blossom festivals as an annual rite of spring. Japan travel expert Duff Trimble lived in Fukuoka for three years and spent a lot of time running and biking in Maizuru Park and Ohori Park, where cherry trees blossom. "The ruins of Fukuoka Castle had the more typical concentration of cherry trees on top of the ruins and was one of the most popular cherry blossom-viewing areas in Fukuoka," says Trimble, whose Toronto-based Wabi-Sabi Japan runs custom-guided Japan adventures.
