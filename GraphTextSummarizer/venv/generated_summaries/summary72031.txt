Lee Chung-Yong headed a 90th winner after Owen Coyle's side had been pegged back to 2-2 by a late equalizer from veteran home striker Kevin Phillips. That Wembley defeat was the start of a difficult spell for Arsenal, who were beaten by Barcelona in midweek to end their Champions League hopes. Bolton had taken the lead through Johan Elmander's fine finish in the 21st minute before Cameron Jerome scored Birmingham's first equalizer in the 38th minute. Rooney's goal in the 49th minute gave them a two-goal cushion which was needed as Edwin van der Sar made a series of excellent stops to deny Arsenal a route back into the tie. Kevin Davies converted a 66th-minute penalty to put Bolton ahead again only for Phillips to strike in the 80th minute.
