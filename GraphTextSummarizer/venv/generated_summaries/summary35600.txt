St Pancras Old Church, Pancras Road, London Hannah Courtoy: The spinster's 'time machine' "It looks like Dr. Who's TARDIS as designed by the architects of the Death Star," says author and publisher Mark Pilkington, who's been investigating time machine claims about the mysterious last resting place of three Victorian spinsters.

The ancient churchyard, once a haunt of grave robbers, is now one of the most peaceful places in busy St. Pancras. Many London cemeteries have a lion -- animals of all stripes are well represented in its graveyards -- but perhaps the most elegant has since 1912 slept in the jungle that is overgrown Abney Park in Stoke Newington.
