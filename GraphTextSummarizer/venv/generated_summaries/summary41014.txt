At a sports match in 1995, as President, Mandela made a gesture of support to white South Africans that drew gasps. What they're saying: "How convenient that we choose to ignore that he once sang, 'Kill white people'" "If apartheid was racist toward blacks, Mandela was equally racist towards whites" What's the basis: Umkhonto we Sizwe beat the war drum against the "white supremacy" and "the white state." What's the truth: It's true that Mandela once believed that civil disobedience was not enough to vanquish racism and apartheid. " "So Nelson Mandela was a communist who supported Saddam Hussein and befriended Gadaffi apparently...." What's the basis: Mandela was branded a communist by the white apartheid government, which made it a crime to be one. Rugby was the dominant sport of white South Africans of Dutch heritage -- Afrikaners -- and was reviled by blacks.
