That could be household waste, garden waste, agricultural waste or forestry waste," a spokesperson for INEOS Bio told CNN. Cellulosic ethanol is made from the cellulose found in waste materials like wood chips and the non-edible parts of food crops, or from purpose-grown grasses such as switchgrass and miscanthus. INEOS Bio, an offshoot of UK-based chemical company INEOS, is soon to announce the location of its first commercial plant, which will produce ethanol from waste materials. Because cellulosic ethanol takes much less energy to produce than traditional biofuels, it's an even greener alternative to gasoline. "You have to do more than demonstrate that it can be done, you have to show that it can be done profitably," says Harl, citing a 2007 IMF report on biofuels that describes cellulosic ethanol as twice as expensive to produce as gasoline and 75% more expensive than corn-based ethanol.
