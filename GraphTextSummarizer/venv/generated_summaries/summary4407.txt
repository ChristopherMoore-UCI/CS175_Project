Rock, runner-up three times in Europe including in 2009 at the same Royal Park I Roveri course, had extended his lead to two shots by the end of Saturday's third round but lost ground with a bogey at his third hole. Molinari won the tournament in 2006 for his first European Tour success, while the 18-year-old Manassero had been seeking his third title since turning professional 13 months ago. -- English golfer Robert Rock completed a wire-to-wire success at the Italian Open on Sunday to clinch his first European Tour title. Boyd matched that with a birdie at the final hole, his eighth of the day after bogeys at his first and 10th holes. The win, after nine years on the circuit, boosted his hopes of impressing in his first U.S. Open start at Congressional next week -- his first major appearance outside of Britain.
