"These are important recommendations that acknowledge the hesitancy of couples to resume their sexual activity, even though the actual risk of worsening with sexual activity is extremely low," says my colleague Dr. Madeleine Castellanos. It's helpful to think of sex the way you might think of other activities that require exertion, such as walking up stairs, exercising, or returning to a generally active lifestyle. In fact, a study last year of 1,900 heart attack patients suggests that just one-third of women and less than half of men received instructions about resuming sexual activity after they left the hospital -- and were 44% more likely to report that they still hadn't had sex a year later. If you're not ready to return to sex completely, don't miss out on other forms of physical intimacy, such as hugging, kissing, cuddling, and touching each other. The new AHA guidelines are aimed at educating health care professionals about the importance of discussing sex with their cardiovascular patients, but they also offer insight for patients themselves.
