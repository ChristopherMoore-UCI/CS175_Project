Despite the mishap, Lily said she'll definitely be back -- especially after getting free passes for the inconvenience. Lily said the sky was filled with dark clouds when she, her parents and siblings boarded the monorail around 6 p.m. "When we sat there, we heard a lot of thunder and saw a few bolts of lightning," the 15-year-old said. A power outage Sunday evening forced the evacuation of about 120 passengers from the monorail, Disney spokeswoman Jacquee Wahler said.
