"It was really the finest show that's ever come out of the Prado and it reflected the idea of our museum, as it were, nestling inside theirs," said Gabriele Finaldi, Deputy Director of the Prado Museum and curator of the exhibition. Aside from both having world-class collections, Finaldi points out that they have something else in common -- both have their origins as royal collections. "One can think of Catherine the Great in Russia and Charles the Fourth here in Spain, who collected with a real passion, because they were personally interested but also because they knew it brought glory to the monarchy and to the country," said Finaldi. Now some 180 items from the Hermitage's world-class collection are nestling inside the many galleries of the Prado, ranging from archaeological pieces all the way to modern masterpieces by Kazimir Malevich. "The Hermitage in the Prado" is the second part of an exhibition exchange -- initiated as part of Spain-Russia Dual Year 2011, dedicated to promoting and strengthening the economic, political, cultural and scientific ties between the two nations -- that saw the Prado exhibiting precious items from its own extensive collection in the State Hermitage Museum in February 2011.
