The news conference came in response to food supplier Findus France saying it will file a legal complaint against a Romanian business that is part of the supply chain. Horsemeat found in hamburgers in Britain and Ireland Findus is only one of several companies that receives products from Comigel, headquartered in Metz, France. " Tesco, which operates grocery stores in 14 countries worldwide, said Monday it discovered horsemeat in spaghetti bolognese products made by Comigel. The products were pulled Monday after Comigel raised concerns about the type of meat that was used, Findus Sweden said. "The level of contamination suggests that Comigel was not following the appropriate production process for our Tesco product, and we will not take food from their facility again," said Tim Smith, a Tesco executive.
