Inter Milan moved up to fifth with a 4-1 victory over bottom club Lecce, while Napoli took sixth on goal difference after crushing Genoa 6-1 with two early goals from striker Edinson Cavani. Claudio Marchisio came closest to scoring in the eighth minute when he scraped the post with a low shot, while the home side rarely tested Juve keeper Gianluigi Buffon and had coach Francesco Guidolin sent to the stands late in the match. Antonio Conte's team extended their unbeaten run to 16 Serie A matches to keep pace with the defending champions, who beat Cagliari 2-0 on Tuesday. Struggling Spanish club Villarreal sacked coach Juan Carlos Garrido Roma also have 24 points after a 2-0 win at Bologna, while ninth-placed Palermo blew a two-goal lead in the 2-2 draw at Novara in new coach Bortolo Mutti's first match.
