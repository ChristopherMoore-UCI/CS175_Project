Nkunda's fighters seized the headquarters of the park on October 26, park officials announced last month, a move park director Emmanuel de Merode called "unprecedented." About 200 of the world's 700 known mountain gorillas lived in the park when rebel leader Laurent Nkunda's men took control of the gorilla section last year, Newport said. Virunga National Park is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and Africa's oldest national park. The gorilla sector of the park "has been swallowed up in this conflict," said Samantha Newport, communications director for the refuge. Young gorillas play in Congo's Virunga Park.
