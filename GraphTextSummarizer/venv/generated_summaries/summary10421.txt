In this album, I'm offering a fusion of bachata with different genres: Jamaican reggae, Bob Marley type of reggae and dance hall," Santos said. While both solo albums include English language tracks, he says bachata and Spanish are his strong suits, and rather than making an all-English album, Santos said he encourages the English-speaking audience to cross over, too -- into his world. Santos also recently announced that he will become the first Latin solo artist to headline a concert at New York's Yankee Stadium, and the first Latin act to perform at the iconic stadium since the Fania All Stars in 1973. Anthony "Romeo" Santos, known to his fans simply as Romeo, is the self-proclaimed king of bachata, and though he remains relatively unknown to the English-speaking world, he is poised to take the music world by storm with his unique bachata fusion. "It's actually great for both of us, for the artist and for myself, because they're also trying to do something unique and different, and these types of collaborations allow that," Santos said.
