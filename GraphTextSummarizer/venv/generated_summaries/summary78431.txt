"We've had some sightings of the individual," said Glenn Miller, assistant commissioner of the Royal Bahamas Police Force. Colton Harris-Moore, dubbed the "barefoot bandit," may have been seen Wednesday evening on Abaco Island, Miller said. The island, about 180 miles east of southern Florida, covers about 650 square miles. The teenage fugitive suspected of flying a stolen plane to the Bahamas over the weekend may have surfaced Wednesday night, authorities there said. He said the Coast Guard told the owner of the plane that an emergency location transmitter on the Cessna was sending out a beacon from the Bahamas.
