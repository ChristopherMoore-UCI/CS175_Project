During their appeal, district officials pointed out that an audit commissioned by Huppenthal praised the program and found "no observable evidence" that the classes violated state law. The Governing Board of the Tucson Unified School District voted late Tuesday to suspend immediately the Mexican-American studies department, marking a turning point in a yearlong controversy over a new state law banning certain ethnic studies. The law authorizes the state superintendent to stop any ethnic studies classes that promote the overthrow of the U.S. government, promote resentment toward a race or class of people, are designed primarily for pupils of a particular ethnic group or advocate ethnic solidarity instead of the treatment of pupils as individuals. The state superintendent's order was, in turn, made after last month's ruling by an administrative law judge that found the program's curriculum was teaching Latino history and culture "in a biased, political, and emotionally charged manner," and upheld state officials' findings that it violated a state law passed in 2010. The board action came in the wake of Friday's order by Arizona State Superintendent John Huppenthal to withhold 10% -- or about $15 million a year -- of state aid to the Tucson district retroactive to August 15, 2011, according to a copy of the order posted on the district's website.
