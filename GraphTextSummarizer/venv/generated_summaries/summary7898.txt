The latest accusations of wrongdoing by journalists working for News International papers were published by rival outlet the Guardian on Monday. -- The scandal that brought down Britain's biggest Sunday newspaper widened Monday with allegations that journalists from other News International papers improperly obtained personal information about former Prime Minister Gordon Brown. Earlier Monday, London's Metropolitan Police angrily blasted leaks from its investigation into illegal eavesdropping by News of the World, hours after British media reported that the paper tried to bribe royal protection officers to get private phone numbers for members of the royal family. The company said Monday that it was withdrawing its plan to sell television channel Sky News as part of its acquisition of BSkyB pending further consideration of the bid. She may be questioned by police about the scandal in the coming weeks, a News International source told CNN Monday.
