The shootings and explosions targeting elections centers wounded 92 people, police and health officials in Baghdad and several provinces told CNN. Iraq has been beset with political and sectarian violence for months, often pitting Sunnis -- a minority in Iraq -- against Shiite Muslims, who came to dominate the government after Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein was overthrown in 2003. -- As Iraqi police and troops cast ballots early in the country's first parliamentary elections since the 2011 withdrawal of U.S. forces, 32 people were killed in attacks across the country on Monday. Police and military have two days to cast votes before the rest of the country's registered voters cast their ballots in parliamentary elections Wednesday. In several instances, suicide bombers detonated explosives at polling centers as security forces waited in line to vote.
