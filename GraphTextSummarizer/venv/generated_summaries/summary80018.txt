Transitional government troops are perched on the outskirts of one of Gadhafi's last bastions of support, with Libya's new leaders giving Gadhafi loyalists in Sirte, Bani Walid and a handful of other towns until Saturday to surrender or face attack. Gadhafi's wife, two sons and other relatives fled to Algeria recently, deepening mistrust between the NTC and Libya's neighbor. The documents NTC officials were examining Monday detailed a trip by Gadhafi's security officials to Beijing on July 16 during which they met with four state-controlled weapons manufacturers, the newspaper reported. Busin said Mustafa Abdul Jalil, NTC chairman, has "made it very, very clear that anybody who has helped and supported and stood by Gadhafi over the months would not be greeted well." China abstained from voting on a Security Council resolution in March that authorized the protection of Libyan civilians by any means necessary, with the exception of a ground invasion. The report comes after fighters from the NTC overran Tripoli and ousted Gadhafi, whose whereabouts remained unknown.
