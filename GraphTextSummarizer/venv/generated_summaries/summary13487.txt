Snowfall rates in central Pennsylvania were expected to reach 1 inch per hour at times on Monday afternoon, said CNN Meteorologist Sean Morris. Late Monday morning, one weather watcher reporting to CNN affiliate CNN affiliate WIVB had recorded 5 inches of snow near Boutwell Hill State Forest, southwest of Buffalo. Pete Petriani, who heads Erie's Bureau of Streets, told CNN affiliate CNN affiliate WICU that depending on how heavily it snows, crews "may have to do a little filling up of the back of trucks just for weight if we have to go out and plow. "The last time we had a big snowstorm across the East Coast was back in October," when fall foliage was still on the trees, said CNN Meteorologist Rob Marciano. A "pattern shift in the jet stream over the weekend" caused the weather change, with temperatures dropping in the country's eastern half and spiking in the west, CNN Meteorologist Sarah Dillingham said.
