"Everyone now has a global platform on which they can shout their opinions and voice their beliefs," says Frank Farley, a psychology professor at Temple University and former president of the American Psychological Association. "There's never been such pressure to speak before one knows," says science writer James Gleick, who traced the increasing speed of society in his book "Faster" and the deluge of data in last year's "The Information."
