The surviving crew member is hospitalized in Seattle with non-life threatening injuries, said Coast Guard Rear Adm. Gary Blore. With his voice cracking at times, Blore told reporters at a media briefing Wednesday afternoon that accidents such as this are deeply personal to members of the Coast Guard. -- Three crew members were killed and one was injured Wednesday when a U.S. Coast Guard helicopter crashed in waters near James Island in LaPush, Washington, officials said. "The Coast Guard lost communication with the helicopter around 9:30 a.m. PT (12:30 p.m. ET)," said Blore. The Coast Guard will conduct an investigation to determine the cause of the accident, said Blore.
