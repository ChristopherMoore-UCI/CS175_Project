Kryzie King, 27, who was indicted last month on 12 felony and misdemeanor charges, including first-degree assault, first-degree assault reckless endangerment and endangering the welfare of a child, pleaded not guilty in Manhattan criminal court. The investigation by the medical examiner's office is expected to conclude within the next month, the prosecutor said, adding that all evidence indicated that Myls' death was caused by King. Myls died January 8 after his father, Okee Wade, left the boy in the care of King before Wade went to jail in connection with a fraud case, police said. King told police that Myls' father dropped the child off for her to watch on December 17 and that she was the "child's primary and sole caretaker" until the time of his death, the complaint said. King, who is being held without bail in a medical facility on Riker's Island, is due back in court March 26.
