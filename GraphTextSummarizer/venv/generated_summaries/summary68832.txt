A breakthrough would be huge, but the team needs more years and more helium-3. He thinks the fusion research, rocket building and moon base project can be done for $15-20 billion over two decades. There are only about 30 kilograms of 3He on Earth, Kulcinski said. , Kulcinski said, adding that we also have a pretty good idea as to where the 3He is on the moon. At their lab in Madison, Wisconsin, Kulcinski and his small team of scientific staff and graduate students have developed a tabletop 3He-powered reactor that can produce a small amount of electricity.
