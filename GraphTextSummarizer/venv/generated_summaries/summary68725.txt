Crawford and Feight were developing a device "intended to be mobile ... designed to turn on remotely from some distance away" that would emit "some dangerous levels of X-ray radiation," according to John Duncan, executive assistant U.S. attorney for the Northern District of New York. " Feight was recruited by Crawford to develop a "remote initiation device" powered "by a plug-in cigarette lighter electrical source," according to an affidavit by FBI Special Agent Geoffrey Kent. Crawford, a manufacturing employee at a GE plant in Schenectady, New York, worked with Feight, an employee at a nearby automotive company often contracted by GE, according to the investigation report. Since the arrest, Crawford has been suspended from the company, which is fully cooperating with authorities, according to GE spokesman Shaun Wiggins. According to the criminal complaint, Crawford repeatedly used another GE employee as a proxy "to covertly obtain the parts list for the remote initiation system" among other things, at times meeting in GE's parking lot.
