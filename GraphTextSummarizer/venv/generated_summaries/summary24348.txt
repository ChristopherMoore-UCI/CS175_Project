Who is in and who is out is the favorite parlor game among the elites, and the wide assumption by many was that when it came to whom the president relied on the most for advice and counsel, it would have been chief of staff Rahm Emanuel, senior adviser Axelrod and press secretary Robert Gibbs. Roland S. Martin says few have understood how much power is wielded by Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett. In the course of 8,100 words, writer Robert Draper made it clear that by her long association with President Obama and his wife, Michelle, no one in the White House knows them better than Jarrett, and that their longtime confidant and mentor is unmistakably the one voice, other than his wife, that the president relies on. Axelrod came off as dismissive of Jarrett's contributions by asserting that she has best served on dealing with "family issues." Five days after the 2008 presidential election, Steve Kroft of "60 Minutes" did a profile on "Obama's brain trust," four political veterans that he reported were the president-elect's most important team members: David Plouffe, Robert Gibbs, David Axelrod and Anita Dunn.
