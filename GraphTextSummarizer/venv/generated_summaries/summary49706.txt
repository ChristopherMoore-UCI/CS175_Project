Gyan, who starred for Ghana in the World Cup finals, has cost Sunderland 15 million euros, beating the fee paid last year for Tottenham striker Darren Bent. Huntelaar failed to establish himself as a regular in his one season at the San Siro following his move from Real Madrid in 2009. With Robinho's arrival, Milan have allowed Klass Jan Huntelaar to leave the club with the Dutch striker signing for German Bundesliga side Schalke, as the final day of the summer transfer window saw a host of players move clubs. On a busy day for Schalke, they have also signed 24-year-old Spanish midfielder Jose Manuel Jurado from Atletico Madrid and Lille defender Nicolas Plestan on a three-year deal. Robinho will link up with recent Barcelona loan signing Zlatan Ibrahimovic and compatriots Ronaldinho and Alexandre Pato in an exciting-looking forward line for the new Serie A season.
