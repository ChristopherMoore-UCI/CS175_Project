Florida officials said that when the state deposited tons of new sand on eroding shorelines, the replenished land became government property, essentially creating a strip of public beach between the landowners' property and the ocean. In most coastal states, beachfront property is split between the government and private owners. "People pay a lot more for beachfront homes for that reason," instead of property with beach views, said Justice Antonin Scalia. At issue is whether courts, by reinterpreting state law, can deprive deed holders of their traditional shoreline rights, amounting to a "judicial taking" of property. -- The Supreme Court wavered like the tides Wednesday in an unusual dispute over whether owners of private waterfront property were unfairly deprived title to land that touches the ocean.
