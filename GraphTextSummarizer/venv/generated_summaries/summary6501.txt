The Arizona winner has opted to take cash, $192.5 million, before taxes. Taking both state and federal taxes into consideration means the Arizona winner would owe up to $78 million in taxes and take home $114 million. Each winner would therefore owe $67 million to the IRS, said Mark Luscombe, principal analyst at tax research firm CCH, in an interview last month. On the day of the drawing, he went to 4 Sons Food Store in Fountain Hills, "handed the clerk a $20 bill and he said, 'I'd like 10 in Quick Pick Powerball tickets,'" she told reporters. The message directed reporters to the law firm Rhoads & Sinon LLP in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, which did not immediately return a call on Friday night.
