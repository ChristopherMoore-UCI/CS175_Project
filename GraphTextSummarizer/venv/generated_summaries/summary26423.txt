Lauryn Hill pleaded guilty in a New Jersey courtroom on Friday to evading federal taxes on $1.8 million earned between 2005 and 2007, the Associated Press reports. The income on which Hill did not pay taxes -- $818,000 collected in 2005, $222,000 in 2006 and $761,000 in 2007 -- was earned by four corporations that she owns.
