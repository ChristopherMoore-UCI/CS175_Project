Scott has always idolized Australian golfing giant Greg Norman -- nicknamed was the Great White Shark -- whose defeat in at the U.S. Masters in 1996 became a defining national moment in Australia. Born in Adelaide, South Australia in 1980, Scott showed early promise as a golfer growing up in Australia's tropical state of Queensland -- a favored golfing destination in Australia. "It was one guy who inspired a nation of golfers, and that is Greg Norman," Scott said. "Australia is a proud sporting nation," Scott told a press conference following his Masters victory. But as with many great Australian sportsmen and sportswomen down the years, Scott's battling determination gave him the last laugh.
