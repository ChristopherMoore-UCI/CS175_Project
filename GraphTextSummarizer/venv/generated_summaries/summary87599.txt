The tragic death of English driver Dan Wheldon after a horror race crash in the U.S. should lead to changes in the IndyCar division, according to Formula One legend Jackie Stewart. " Stewart also questioned the wisdom of mixing drivers with varying levels of IndyCar experience in such a high-speed environment. In yesterday's race there were a good many drivers in there who were not regulars and were not fulltime IndyCar drivers. "Will the caliber of driver be high enough to be able to control those cars at those kinds of speeds? In those days, motor racing truly was dangerous," Stewart said.
