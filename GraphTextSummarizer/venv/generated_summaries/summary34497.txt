"The drought in Niger is an unfolding catastrophe for millions of people and we are struggling against time to scale up quickly enough to reach the escalating number of hungry," said Josette Sheeran, executive director for the U.N. agency. "We are massively scaling up special nutritional help for children under two years of age, whose brains and bodies face permanent damage from acute malnutrition," said Sheeran in a statement released Tuesday after her visit. And despite months of warnings, the money for emergency aid has been what aid agencies described as paltry. Schoors' colleague Stephane Petitprez, CARE's emergency director who just returned from 10 days in eastern Niger, said the people of Niger have no way to survive without their livestock. The United Nations' World Food Programme announced Tuesday that it is "massively scaling up" food distribution to people who have lost crops and livestock.
