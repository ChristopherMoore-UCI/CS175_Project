"You know, I think that women will always need their basics," Brown says, explaining how her business managed to weather the financial downturn of recent years. She accepted, under the condition that she retained all creative control, and today it is estimated that Bobbi Brown products account for about 10% of all Estee Lauder sales. When it comes to her role in an industry which has been heavily criticized for making women feel self-conscious, Brown says: "Everyone I know in the beauty industry, not just the people that work in my company, is really there to make products that make women look and feel better, they devote their lives to it. Brown's love affair with makeup started as she watched her mother's beauty rituals in their suburban Chicago home. After earning a degree in theatrical makeup at Emerson College in Boston, Brown moved to New York City, showing her portfolio to anyone and everyone.
