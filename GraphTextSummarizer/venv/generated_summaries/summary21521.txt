After hearing news of the incident, hundreds of people gathered on the streets chanting anti-government slogans, but before they could mass into one large crowd, security forces moved to break up the groups, the eyewitness said. On Saturday, witnesses also reported that security forces opened fire on people mourning slain protesters. The protests began last month in the southern city of Daraa after a violent crackdown by security forces on peaceful demonstrators protesting the arrests of youths who scribbled anti-government graffiti. Syrian parliament member Khalil Al Rifai announced his resignation Saturday in a television interview, saying security forces had opened fire even though al-Assad promised not to use force against protesters. As thousands of people marched from the burial grounds toward Douma's main hospital Saturday, security forces on the rooftops of government buildings fired shots, a witness said.
