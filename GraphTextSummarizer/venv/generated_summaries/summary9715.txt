Swansea City were held at home 1-1 by Crystal Palace while EPL new boys Burnley drew 1-1 with Aston Villa. In the day's early kick-off, a solitary goal from Danny Wellbeck was enough to give Arsenal victory away to West Brom and ease the pressure on manager Arsene Wenger who has come in for criticism from sections of the Arsenal support in recent weeks. Sunderland were quick to hit back with a thumping drive of their own through Conor Wickham that Chelsea keeper Thibaut Courtois did well to block. The former Manchester City midfielder then fired inches wide from the edge of the box after bursting beyond the Chelsea midfield. The tie means Chelsea are now seven points clear at the top of the EPL table, although that lead could be cut to four points if Southampton triumph at home to Manchester City Sunday.
