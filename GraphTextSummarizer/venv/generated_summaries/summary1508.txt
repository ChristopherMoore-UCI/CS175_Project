Yelton's best result is eighth in a flight, but like many others he is there for the enjoyment of golf and the camaraderie, meeting other old friends who come back year after year. -- If they were handing out awards for courage in the face of personal trauma, 70-year-old Bob Yelton would scoop the lot at this week's World Amateur Handicap Championships. But with encouragement from his brother Don, who has also played in every World Am, and crucially an intervention from his son, Bob did indeed pitch up. In a hot summer in the Carolinas, this has restricted his practice opportunities, but nothing was going to stop Bob from competing in his 29th World Am. But given his dice with death, Bob was happy to just be teeing it up and meeting old friends, doubtless already planning his 30th straight appearance in a unique event.
