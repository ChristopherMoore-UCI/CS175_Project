The inclusion of Mount Fuji in the UNESCO World Heritage list recently has spurred a huge reaction among international travelers and agencies. While Mt Fuji was already popular among tourists, the UNESCO World Heritage status will spark a new wave of interest, say local officials. According to The Japan Times, Japan Travel Bureau Corp. announced Monday a series of day trips for foreigners, accompanied by English-speaking tour guides. The cone-shaped mountain has been worshiped in Japan for centuries. East Japan Railway Co. also offered a 50% discount on tickets for people who use the Chuo Line to visit the mountain.
