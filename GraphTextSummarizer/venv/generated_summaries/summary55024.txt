Mars: survival Groomer paints a terrifying picture of an astronaut's view over the Martian landscape: abrasive particles of glassy sand, whipped into dust-storms (with wind speeds of 200kph/125mph); Galactic cosmic rays of radiation, with only the thinnest atmosphere to block it; temperatures plummeting to minus 130 degrees Celsius. Groomer is the Austrian astrobiologist responsible for building a spacesuit for the Mars explorers of tomorrow -- and he's taking inspiration from armor worn by medieval knights. Staying tough Wearing the Apollo-era suits sported by moonlanders, the Mars explorers would be "very dead, very soon", Groomer warns -- the suits being not nearly robust enough for the longer term missions they'll be expected to undertake across Mars' "totally unforgiving" landscape. Where the other teams' suits are strongly focused on withstanding the physical strains of walking on Mars, Groomer claims his team's effort is the most intelligent: "The big difference in our suit is that we consider it as a central hub for an entire family of instruments," meaning the wearer can keep control of a robotic explorer vehicle and all the devices and sensors to be housed at the Martian base station. It takes Dr Gernot Groomer three hours to put on the spacesuit he hopes will, one day, walk across the surface of Mars.
