The CDC reported that norovirus hit more than 600 passengers and crew on Royal Caribbean's Explorer of the Seas in January, making it one of the biggest such outbreaks on any cruise ship in the past two decades.

The Caribbean Princess, operated by Princess Cruises, cut short its seven-day Caribbean itinerary last month after 178 passengers and 11 crew members were stricken with norovirus.
