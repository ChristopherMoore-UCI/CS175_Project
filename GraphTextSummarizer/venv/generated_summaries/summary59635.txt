Branden Grace, who won four times on the European Tour last season with the first two coming on home soil in South Africa, was tied for third on 206 with Sweden's Kristoffer Broberg and Englishman Steve Webster. Keith Horne shared the limelight with runaway leader Charl Schwartzel at the European Tour's Alfred Dunhill Championship in their native South Africa on Saturday, landing a repeat ace that earned him an unexpected Christmas present. Schwartzel won by 11 shots in Thailand last weekend for his first victory since the 2011 Masters, and he is poised for another convincing triumph after shooting 64 to go 10 clear. Led by former Ryder Cup captain Jose Maria Olazabal, the Europeans could not repeat Friday's strong opening and lost Saturday's fourball matches 3-1 for an overall 4Â½ -- 3Â½ scoreline. Under competition rules, it would not have earned him a prize as the car is only on offer for holes-in-one on the final day, but sponsor BMW made an exception.
