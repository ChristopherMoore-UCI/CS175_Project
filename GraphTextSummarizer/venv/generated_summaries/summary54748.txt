Minor marijuana possession has been the police department's lowest priority since 2003, but voters last year cast ballots to make recreational use legal. The Seattle Police Department announced on its Twitter feed that officers will attend the city's Hempfest to hand out Doritos and literature explaining the new rules surrounding recreational marijuana use in the state. Initiative 502 states that beginning December 6 residents over 21 years old may possess up to an ounce of pot for personal use. Hempfest, which begins Friday and runs through Sunday, says its goal is "to educate the public on the myriad of potential benefits offered by the cannabis plant, including the medicinal, industrial, agricultural, economic, environmental, and other benefits and applications." Before Seattle residents start farming ganja on their stoops, the police want to make a few things clear (such as, you can't grow marijuana on your stoop yet).
