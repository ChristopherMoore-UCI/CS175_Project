"Each and every one of us has the right to speak out against sexual harassment and the many other injustices that millions of women and girls suffer around the world," U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said in a statement Friday. Chinese police on Monday released five female activists who were detained last month, family and friends of the women tell CNN. The women will be under police surveillance for a year and have their movements and activities restricted, attorney Liang Xiaojun said. Wang Qiushi, a lawyer for Wei, said police recommended last week that prosecutors press charges of "assembling a crowd to disturb public order." Wei Tingting, Wang Man, Zheng Churan, Li Tingting and Wu Rongrong were freed.
