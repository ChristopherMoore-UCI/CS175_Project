-- He may not play on game days, but Michael Sam -- the first openly gay man to be drafted into the NFL -- will at least have a home in the league once the regular season starts: the Dallas Cowboys. Talking about what Fisher told the Cowboys executive about Sam, Jerry Jones said, "He was an addition to their locker room, he brought a plus to the locker room. The Cowboys announced Wednesday they'd signed the former University of Missouri defender to their 10-man practice squad, a group that plays during the week with members of the 53-man roster but not during official games. One thing that Jones did not express any reservations about is how Sam will fit in the locker room. That means Sam isn't likely to record a sack or tackle in front of national television cameras anytime soon.
