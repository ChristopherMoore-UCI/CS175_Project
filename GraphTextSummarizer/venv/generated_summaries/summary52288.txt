"This sets up the future of finally answering that age-old question: Does life exist on other planets?" said deputy project manager Ashwin Vasavada. "On Mars, if life exists as single cell-organisms, or if it ever existed, we believe it will be under the ground, or inside rocks," said mission chief engineer Rob Manning. Upon arrival after its 354 million-mile trip, the rover will collect rocks and soil on the Red Planet to see if there are signs of life -- in the form of organic material. "Curiosity" will help determine whether an area on the planet "has ever been a potential habitat for Martian life," NASA says. The mission will last one Martian year, which is 687 Earth days, NASA says.
