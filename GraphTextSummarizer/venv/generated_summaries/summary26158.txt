-- Rep. John Murtha of Pennsylvania, a longtime fixture on the House subcommittee that oversees Pentagon spending, died after complications from  gallbladder surgery, according to his office. Murtha had a "tough-as-nails reputation" and a "passion for service," President Obama said in a written statement. The National Naval Medical Center issued a statement saying Murtha was admitted January 28 for surgery, but declined to reveal additional details, citing his family's request for privacy and federal privacy laws. Murtha, a former Marine, also earned a reputation as one of Congress's loudest anti-war voices. He was "a steadfast advocate for the people of Pennsylvania" and "a respected voice on issues of national security," Obama said.
