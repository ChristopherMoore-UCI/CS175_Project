The early years were harder, Davis and White admit, especially as both kids trained for singles' competitions in addition to working together on ice dancing. 'Not sure what we gave up' Davis and White are just two of the thousands of Olympic moms around the country and the world who devoted hours, energy and money -- and a good chunk of their own lives -- to make their children's Olympic dreams come true. 'Thank you, Mom' Both Davis and White are part of Procter & Gamble's "Thank You, Mom," program, which highlights the awe-inspiring contributions of Olympic moms. That's when their children, Meryl Davis and Charlie White, started skating together as ice dancers. In the ice skating community, Cheryl Davis and Jacqui White are known as "the moms" because they have been nearly inseparable for 16 years.
