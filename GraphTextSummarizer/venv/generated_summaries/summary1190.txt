Telfair County Sheriff Chris Steverson said Towns had the "last known communications" with Bud Runion. Their bodies were recovered Monday in woods in rural Telfair County. The couple made the trip to look at a 1966 Mustang, and once Runion got to Telfair County, the suspect communicated with him, according to the sheriff. Towns turned himself in Monday. The suspect's father told WSB that he went into the woods Monday where Towns was hiding and talked him into surrendering.
