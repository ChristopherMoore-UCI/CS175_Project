Access to basic information about Down syndrome was hard to come by, even from medical practitioners, and it was a challenge to make contact with experts and other parents. Over the next few weeks, Jane and her spouse started talking to potential adoptive parents, but also got plugged into all the resources for families of people with Down syndrome. On the other hand, although safe haven laws make leaving a child at the hospital legal, and American children with Down syndrome do often get adopted, this clearly wasn't the right way to go about it. These are the stories about Down syndrome that don't make news, and maybe that's OK, so long as people know that these networks exist. I'm the father of a boy with Down syndrome and had at least an inkling of what Jane was going through.
