-- Nadine Gordimer, the Nobel Prize-winning South African author and anti-apartheid activist, died Sunday, her family said Monday. "We have lost a great writer, a patriot and strong voice for equality and democracy in the world," said professor Njabulo Ndebele, the foundation's chairman. She was a thoughtful observer from a young age, noting the inequities of South African society while attending an all-girls, all-white Catholic school. In recent years, she had criticized what is known as the "Secrecy Bill," which gave the government great leeway to decide what information should be protected, as well as to prosecute violators. When pondering "Burger's Daughter," she thought the topic would be better handled by a veteran of activist families.
