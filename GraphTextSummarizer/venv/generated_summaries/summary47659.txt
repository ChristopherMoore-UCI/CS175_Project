The results make Libya unique among countries that have held elections after Arab Spring uprisings. The NFA is led by Mahmoud Jibril, who was prime minister in the interim government that declared Libya a free nation after the 2011 revolt that toppled longtime ruler Moammar Gadhafi in October. The mercurial Gadhafi dismantled many of the civic institutions common to democratic states during his 42 years in power, leaving Libya struggling to emerge from his shadow. Jibril said the absence of a civic structure in Libya means people of all political ideologies can be part of a new government. -- A political coalition widely regarded as the liberal option dominated Libya's historic parliamentary elections, results showed Tuesday.
