" Forbes contributor Scott Mendelson notes that "it's no secret that films like 'Pearl Harbor' (an epic romantic drama set during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor) and 'The Island' (a science-fiction thriller that serves as a parable for the perils of genetic science and/or abortion) were Michael Bay's attempts at artistic legitimacy. Here is the question: Can it be called a Michael Bay film if there are no explosions? "I do like releasing films in summer, but this is a small little movie, but it's got a little of that 'Bad Boys' vibe to it," Bay said. Unlike Bay's other projects that have found him alternately hailed and crucified (he appears on both an Internet Movie Database list of all-time worst and best movie directors), there is a dearth of stylized car chases, massive guns and things blowing up. Perhaps that is why Jack Giroux at the Film School Rejects site penned "The Case for Michael Bay as Visionary Auteur."
