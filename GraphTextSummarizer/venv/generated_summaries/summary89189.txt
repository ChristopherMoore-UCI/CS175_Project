Illegal logging in Peru is threatening several uncontacted groups, pushing them over the border with Brazil and toward potential conflicts with about 500 uncontacted Indians living on the Brazilian side, Survival International said. More than 100 uncontacted tribes remain worldwide, and about half live in the remote reaches of the Amazonian rainforest in Peru or Brazil, near the recently photographed tribe, according to Survival International, a nonprofit group that advocates for the rights of indigenous people. "The world needs to wake up to this, and ensure that their territory is protected in accordance with international law. Its director, Stephen Cory, said the new photographs highlight the need to protect uncontacted people from intrusion by the outside world. "These pictures are further evidence that uncontacted tribes really do exist," Cory said in a statement.
