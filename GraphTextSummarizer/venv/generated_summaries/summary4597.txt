Spain face a testing encounter against fellow finalists South Korea on June 3 before they kick off their World Cup campaign with a Group H match against Switzerland on June 16. It was a less than convincing performance in Austria for the European champions, who are among the favorites for next month's World Cup. Spain needed an injury-time goal from substitute Fernando Llorente to beat Saudi Arabia 3-2 in a World Cup warm-up match in Innsbruck on Saturday. The result is setback for Serbia, who face Australia -- winners over their neighbors last week -- in Group D in South Africa, as well as Germany and Ghana. Earlier, Serbia's preparations suffered a setback in a 1-0 defeat to New Zealand, who are also heading to South Africa.
