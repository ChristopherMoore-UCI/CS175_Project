I have since come to believe -- after many meals with many different people in many, many different places -- that though there is no shortage of people who would do us harm, we are essentially good. Bad things happen to good people all the time. I'm not saying that sitting down with people and sharing a plate is the answer to world peace. I hope to show you what people are like at the table, at home, in their businesses, at play. People feel free, with a goofy American guy who has expressed interest only in their food and what they do for fun, to tell stories about themselves -- to let their guard down, to be and to reveal, on occasion, their truest selves.
