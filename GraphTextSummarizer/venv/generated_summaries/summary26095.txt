-- Human error is to blame in last week's gas-fueled explosion that ripped through a strip club in the western Massachusetts city of Springfield, officials said Sunday. Twelve of the 14 firefighters on scene were injured, according to Springfield Fire Commissioner Joseph Conant. Besides the leveled multistory structure that housed Club Scores, 12 buildings suffered significant damage, and at least a dozen others had collateral damage, Conant said. Investigators believe gas from the leak entered the building and later ignited. The blast injured at least 21 people, including firefighters.
