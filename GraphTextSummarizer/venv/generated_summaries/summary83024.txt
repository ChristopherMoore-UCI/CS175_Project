"The impact on children living in such conditions is significant. "From Ghana and Kenya to Bangladesh and India, children living in slums are among the least likely to attend school. Yanca has a modest dream to become a music teacher for other slum children like herself. "One in three urban dwellers lives in slum conditions; in Africa, the proportion is a staggering six in 10," said UNICEF Executive Director Anthony Lake in a report this year called "The State of the World's Children" (PDF). Across all continents, there are hundreds of millions of children who lack access to electricity, clean water and education despite living in cities with modern facilities and technology. By giving children education and encouragement, the idea is that the children will feel empowered and go on to become successful, productive members of society -- instead of becoming disillusioned and falling into gangs or a life of crime.
