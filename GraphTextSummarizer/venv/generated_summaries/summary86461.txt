-- Dozens of Atlanta public school educators falsified standardized tests or failed to address such misconduct in their schools, Gov. Nathan Deal said Tuesday in unveiling the results of a state investigation that confirmed widespread cheating in the city schools dating as far back as 2001. Investigators compared the results with test results from other Georgia schools and found that such patterns did not occur normally, Deal said. The cheating was brought to light after marked improvements in the district's performance on the 2009 statewide Criterion-Referenced Competency test (CRCT) revealed a pattern of incorrect test answers being erased and replaced with correct answers. "I think the overall conclusion was that testing and results and targets being reached became more important than actual learning for children," Deal said. Some of the cheating could result in criminal charges, Deal said.
