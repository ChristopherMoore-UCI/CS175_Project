-- This month marks the anniversary of many historical milestones in the continuing effort to guarantee equal rights to all Americans. Today, African-American voter registration rates are approaching those of whites in many areas, as are the rates of Latino voters. In celebrating its 45th anniversary, we must also remember that passing the Voting Rights Act and other civil rights laws was no easy feat. After the Civil War, ratification of the 15th Amendment was supposed to extend voting rights regardless of "race, color or previous condition of servitude," meaning former African slaves would have the right to vote. Passage of the act signaled a new era of voting rights in the United States, finally enfranchising low-income blacks.
