Iraqi and U.S.-led coalition forces have successfully ousted ISIS from the nation's largest oil refinery, the coalition said Sunday. The goal was to push back ISIS and "diminish its ability to threaten the security of Kirkuk province," the statement said. Meanwhile, Peshmerga forces -- also with the assistance of coalition strikes -- cleared 84 square kilometers (32 square miles) of ISIS-occupied territory in Iraq on Saturday, the Kurdistan Region Security Council said. "Front-line reporting indicates at least 35 ISIS terrorists were killed during the offensive," the council said in a statement. Iraqi security forces regained full control of the Baiji refinery, the Combined Joint Task Force said.
