Coalition forces are working to get Afghan security forces ready to take charge of security after the NATO mission in Afghanistan concludes at the end of 2014. -- Afghan President Hamid Karzai said Thursday he welcomed plans by Britain to withdraw almost 4,000 troops from Afghanistan by the end of next year. Karzai said the UK announcement was "a timely decision for the security responsibilities to be transferred to Afghan forces." There will be about 9,000 British military personnel in Afghanistan by the end of this year. About 1,500 French troops will remain in Afghanistan into 2013 to remove equipment and help train Afghan forces. Afghan security forces are ready to ensure security and protect their country, Karzai said, according to a statement from his office.
