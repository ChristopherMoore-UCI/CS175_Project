He had stopped at a gas station to put air in his tire, Plummer said, and was robbed at gunpoint of his championship ring and Rolex watch. A grand jury indicted the three suspects -- Charman Sinkfield, 30; Demario Ware, 20; and Jquante Crews, 25 -- on charges including murder, felony murder, aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, Fulton County Superior Court spokesman Don Plummer said in a statement. -- Prosecutors will seek the death penalty against three men accused in connection with the July death of former boxing champion Vernon Forrest, officials said Tuesday. A $17,000 reward has been offered for the return of the watch and ring, Plummer said. Former boxing champion Vernon Forrest, 38, was shot and killed in southwest Atlanta, Georgia, on July 25.
