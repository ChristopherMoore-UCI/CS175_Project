More than 100 increasingly difficult levels are packed into this download, including all levels from the original "Zen Bound" along with new game play modes. "Madden NFL 11" offers four game modes in all, including a meaty Season Mode to play through an entire 16-game schedule (and make player trades). Out of the box, the iPhone 4 also supports the 250,000-plus downloads available at the App Store (part of iTunes), many of which are great games that cover a multitude of genres.
