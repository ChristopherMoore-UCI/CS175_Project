The International Maritime Bureau say attacks off the east coast of Africa have increased this year. More than half of this year's attacks were carried out by suspected Somali pirates off the east coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden, a major shipping route between Yemen and Somalia. The first nine months of this year has seen more pirate attacks than all of last year, the bureau reported on Wednesday. Out of those attacks, Somali pirates successfully hijacked 32 vessels and took 533 hostages. The bulk carrier De Xin Hai is one of four ships that Somali pirates are holding for ransom with 80 crew members as hostages, the International Maritime Bureau said Wednesday.
