Simply put, even if every American man and woman wanted to marry, there are more women than men. Providing women with equal pay for equal work, she wrote, would lower their chances of finding a "suitable mate," since, as Schlafly argues, women prefer to marry men who earn more than they do while men prefer to marry women who earn less. On Tuesday in the Christian Post, Schlafly declared that equal pay is bad, widening the wage gap is good and that the entire institution of marriage depends on men continuing to earn more than women. But the truth is that women have long married men who earned more than they did for one main reason: Men have long earned more than women. She also ignores the reality that professional men and women do not receive equal treatment or consideration in the workplace.
