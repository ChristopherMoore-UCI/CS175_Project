The Los Angeles riots 20 years ago this week were sparked by the acquittal of four L.A. police officers in the brutal beating of suspect Rodney King a year earlier. King told CNN last year. Realizing he couldn't outrun police but fearing what they might do to him when they caught him, King said he looked for a public place to stop. " 'We are going to kill you, n****r,' " King said police shouted as they beat him. Last year, on the 20th anniversary of the beating, King was pulled over without incident and ticketed for a minor traffic violation.
