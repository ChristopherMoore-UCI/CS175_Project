The draw means Napoli now have 44 points and ensures they retain third spot in the table for another week even if fourth-placed Fiorentina beat Genoa on Sunday night. Cristiano Ronaldo showed why he was voted the best player in the world earlier this month with another sprightly showing on Saturday as Real Madrid beat Granada 2-0 at the Bernabeu to assume top spot in La Liga. All of which means that Los Blancos leap from fourth to first with 53 points, two more than both Barcelona and Atletico Madrid who play Sunday. Jesus Rueda's 40th minute strike lifts Valladolid to 17th, level on 19 points with Almeria who entertain Getafe on Sunday. Over in Italy, Napoli dropped points for the second consecutive game, drawing 1-1 with relegation-threatened Chievo Verona at the Stadio San Paolo.
