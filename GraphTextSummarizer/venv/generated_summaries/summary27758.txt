Other European leaders from Europe's smaller states will be pressing them hard to demonstrate decisive leadership. The German public appears to dislike Merkel's austerity program at home but is also  strongly resistant to supporting the economies of other states such as France, which are asking for Germany to take measures to stimulate the wider European economy. In the absence of a strong British engagement with the EU, and Spain and Italy's leaders preoccupied with the precarious condition of their own economies, there are no other candidates for the leadership role in Europe. In state elections in Germany at the weekend Merkel's party suffered an electoral setback, losing control of Germany's most populous state to the opposition Social Democratic Party. The German people are hostile to expanded support for eurozone economies in difficulty, such as Greece and Spain, and there is a possible bailout for Spain looming.
