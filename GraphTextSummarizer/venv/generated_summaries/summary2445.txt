An official in Pakistan's Foreign Office said Pakistani troop movements were in response to Indian troop movements and any scale back would follow the right signals from India. Pakistan has urged India to scale back troop deployments along the countries' shared border in order to ease regional tensions following last month's massacre in the Indian city of Mumbai. India accuses Pakistan of harboring militant organizations and claims 10 attackers involved in last month's Mumbai attacks trained at a terrorist camp in the Pakistani-controlled part of Kashmir. Since the division of the subcontinent in 1947, India and Pakistan have fought three wars, including two over the disputed territory of Kashmir -- now wracked by an 18-year, bloody separatist campaign that authorities say has left at least 43,000 dead. Singh said no communication had been received from Pakistan about troop movements, but added that the Indian army was always on alert.
