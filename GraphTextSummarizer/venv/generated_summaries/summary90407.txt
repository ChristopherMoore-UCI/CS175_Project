-- British officials, citing worries that singer Chris Brown might pose a danger to British citizens, barred him from entering the United Kingdom for concerts this week, a UK border official said. A publicist for Brown's UK tour said the shows in England, Scotland and Ireland were canceled "due to issues surrounding his work visa." Brown pleaded guilty last year to a felony charge of assaulting his then-girlfriend, pop star Rihanna. "We reserve the right to refuse entry to the UK to anyone guilty of a serious criminal offense," said Barbara Woodward, director of the UK border agency's international group. He was then scheduled to perform in Cork, Ireland next Tuesday.
