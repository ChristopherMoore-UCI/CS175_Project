-- It was a much-hyped meeting between two of golf's biggest names -- and the chaotically enthusiastic crowd in China were not let down by Rory McIlroy and Tiger Woods in a surreal showdown worth a reported $2 million. tweeted McIlroy, who carded a five under par 67, one fewer than his rival, to claim bragging rights. After banging a ceremonial Chinese gong and immortalizing their hand prints in clay, Woods and McIlroy took to a golf course where models dressed in evening wear inhabited the tees, a luxury yacht sailed across a lake and helicopters parked next to putting greens. " Many observers see China as the next market for golf to conquer, with an expanding, aspirational middle class taking up the game in significant numbers. Woods, who has won 14 major titles to his rival's two, traveled to China after finishing tied for fourth at the CIMB Classic in Malaysia on Sunday.
