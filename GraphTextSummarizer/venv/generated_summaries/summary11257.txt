A tale of two streets in Ferguson Residents from all over St. Louis who gathered day after day on West Florissant encountered police being transported in armored trucks, standing offensively in riot gear, some officers with rifles and others with batons, none with a name tag. I hung around and listened to story after story of police abuse in Ferguson and throughout the St. Louis area. I have met some really good white people who are so deeply rooted within systemic racism that they don't even realize their actions and inactions are racist behaviors and thoughts -- to them, it's just the way things are. Bartimaeus has been crying out in St. Louis for more than 100 days and has been dealt with harshly by the use of rubber bullets, tear gas, pepper spray and wooden batons. We are broken, and simply getting back to the way things were will not heal our brokenness.
