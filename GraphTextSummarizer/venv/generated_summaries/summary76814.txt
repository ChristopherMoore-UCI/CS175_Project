And it's meant to be, because ISIS is not only killing individuals it accuses of homosexuality -- it is trying to spread terror among people who do not conform to traditional ideas about what women and men should look like, do, or say. Still, whatever the uncertainties in these individual cases, as IGLHRC and the women's rights organization MADRE haveÂ asserted, the public and gruesome nature of these executions, and ISIS's previous threats against those who commit what they deem to be "sodomy," raise concerns for anyone in Iraq or Syria who does not conform to traditional ideas about "proper" women and men. Internal and external resettlement of persecuted people should be stepped up with greater financial support to U.N. agencies and human rights NGOs who work directly with vulnerable people. In addition, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) has reported the murders of four more men, also accused of sodomy, who were killed in similar style by ISIS in Syria. ISIS is allegedly also responsible for stoning at least three women in Syria accused of adultery.
