The robbery was part of the story in Martin Scorsese's 1990 "Goodfellas" film about organized crime in New York. Other crimes described in the indictment also sound similar to events portrayed in the film -- a 1969 murder, burning a New York building and a racketeering operation that used threats of violence to extort money from victims. "These 'goodfellas' thought they had a license to steal, a license to kill, and a license to do whatever they wanted," George Venizelos, assistant director-in-charge of the FBI's New York office. " "As alleged, Vincent Asaro devoted his adult life to the Bonanno crime family, with a criminal career that spanned decades," Loretta Lynch, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, said in a statement. Vincent Asaro's lawyer, Gerald McMahon, arrived in the crowded courtroom with a large plastic bag filled with prescription drugs for his client, who, he said, had triple bypass surgery in March.
