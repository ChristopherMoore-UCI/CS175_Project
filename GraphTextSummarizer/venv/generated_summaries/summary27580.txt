Syrian athletes will be taking part in the Games, and that is right," Cameron said at a Downing Street press conference on Wednesday. -- Syrian athletes will be allowed to attend this summer's London Olympics but officials from the war-torn country will not be welcome, says UK Prime Minister David Cameron. His message of support for Syrian athletes came on the same day as a visit by International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Jacques Rogge. "Britain has led efforts within the European Union and elsewhere to institute asset bans, travel freezes and punishing sanctions against this despicable regime and anyone covered by one of those travel bans will not be welcomed in London," Cameron said. Earlier this month, Rogge said there were between six and eight Syrian athletes who could potentially qualify for the Games, but warned that any athlete implicated in war crimes would be banned.
