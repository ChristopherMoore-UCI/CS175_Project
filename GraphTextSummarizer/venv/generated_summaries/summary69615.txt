-- A French prosecutor investigating a ski accident in which former world champion racing driver Michael Schumacher was seriously injured said Wednesday that speed was not an important factor. " Quincy ruled out problems with Schumacher's skis, which he said were almost new. Investigators have begun studying footage filmed on a small camera attached to Schumacher's helmet, but further analysis is needed, Quincy said. Police investigator Stephane Bozon said it was not possible to estimate Schumacher's speed in terms of kilometers per hour, "but this was the speed of a very good skier on a slope which was not very steep." He said experts may be able to use it to determine Schumacher's precise position in relation to the edge of the piste and possibly the speed at which he was traveling at the time of the accident.
