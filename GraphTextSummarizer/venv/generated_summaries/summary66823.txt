Formed just four years ago, this remarkable running team of almost 60 runners has already competed in marathons around the world including Kyoto, Shanghai, Australia's Gold Coast, Seoul and Taipei in addition to local Hong Kong races. From afar, any ordinary bystander would never have guessed that the Fearless Dragons are in fact made up of blind runners paired up with deaf runners and a few "guide runners" who help ensure the team stays on track. Furthermore, people with disabilities were only allowed to complete Form 3 level of education. The Fearless Dragons team is part of Mok's larger initiative called the Hong Kong Network for the Promotion of Inclusive Society that -- among its many other programs -- has set up an education fund for those children. "Only those who came first or elite students were admitted to normal schools." Fortunately, after the government signed the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, things have changed for the better over the years and there have been many efforts ever since to create a barrier-free environment.
