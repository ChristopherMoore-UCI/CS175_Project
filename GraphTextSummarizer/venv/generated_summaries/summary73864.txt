Karachi police said Shah tried to rob people at a park named in honor of slain former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto by pointing a pistol and trying to steal cash and cell phones. A chilling video of the incident was played repeatedly on national television and became the latest in a series of human rights violations that horrified Pakistanis and eroded public confidence in security agencies. The seven men pleaded not guilty, said Muhammad Khan, a public prosecutor in a special anti-terrorism court in the southern city of Karachi. Teenager Sarfraz Shah was shot and killed by Rangers providing security at a public park this month. The Rangers are Pakistan's paramilitary force primarily responsible for border protection, but at the request of provinces, it helps to maintain law and order in cities.
