-- Real Madrid coach Jose Mourinho has been given a one-game touchline ban with another suspended after two of his players received late red cards in their Champions League win over Ajax last week. Alonso and Ramos were also both fined by UEFA, while goalkeeper Iker Casillas and reserve keeper Jerzy Dudek were punished after being shown on television allegedly passing messages to them from the dugout. "The Spanish club's coach Jose Mourinho has been suspended from coaching activities for two UEFA club competition matches, of which the second is deferred for a probationary period of three years. Midfielder Xabi Alonso and right-back Sergio Ramos were both sent off in the dying moments of Real's win in Amsterdam after getting second yellow cards for inexplicable acts of time-wasting with their team leading 4-0. Spanish international teammates Alonso and Ramos were fined €20,000 each, with a €10,000 fine given to Casillas while Dudek was ordered to pay €5,000 "The red cards given to Alonso and Ramos stand, and they have therefore been suspended for one UEFA club competition match," added UEFA.
