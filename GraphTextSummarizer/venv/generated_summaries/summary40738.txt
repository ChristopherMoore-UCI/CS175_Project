The Peru-based developer stunned Detroiters by purchasing the abandoned Packard automotive plant earlier this year -- one of the most famous buildings to be sold after the city filed for bankruptcy and the most emblematic eyesore of Detroit's fall. Palazuelo bought the 325,000 square meter (3.5 million square feet) Packard space for just $405,000. A look at the numbers illustrates why international investors Like Palazuelo are entranced by Detroit's under-appreciated assets. In around 15 years, at a cost of approximately $350 million, Palazuelo envisions transforming the Packard site into a residential, commercial and industrial hub. With Detroit home to an estimated 78,000 abandoned buildings, it is little wonder then that international buyers spy an opportunity with big potential returns.
