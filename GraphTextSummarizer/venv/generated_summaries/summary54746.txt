An announcement by the royal palace that Urdangarin will not participate in official family activities during the investigation and remarks by King Juan Carlos in his Christmas Eve speech that "justice is equal for everyone" have deflected public criticisms of the royal family, according to Gerardo Correas of the International School of Protocol in Madrid. The case, widely reported in Spanish media for weeks, has fueled public criticism of the royal family. According to media reports, authorities have been investigating whether a foundation headed by Urdangarin improperly used public funds. But many Spaniards were still buzzing over the political scandal -- with some asking whether other members of the royal family were connected to, or aware of, Urdangarin's business dealings. Urdangarin, a former Olympic handball player, married the Spanish king's youngest daughter in 1997.
