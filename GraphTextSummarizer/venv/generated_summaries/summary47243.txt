Under this new law, a doctor may withhold information, mislead or even blatantly lie to a pregnant woman and her partner about the health of their baby if the doctor so much as thinks that fetal test results would cause a woman to consider abortion. (The Legislature also overrode the governor's veto of a second egregious law, HB 2780, which forces women to view an ultrasound before having an abortion.) These politicians have decided they know best what women need. How is this mockery of medical care and paternalistic devaluing of women, "pro-life"? And all women, regardless of how they feel about abortion, should be appalled.
