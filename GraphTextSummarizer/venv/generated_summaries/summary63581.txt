Ryder Cup stars Martin Kaymer and Peter Hanson just made the cut on six and five under respectively but home hero Paul Lawrie missed out. " Dane Thorbjorn Olesen is Grace's nearest challenger on 16-under, with Swedes Fredrik Andersson Hed and Alex Noren in third spot on 15-under. -- Ernie Els protege Branden Grace will take a four-shot lead into the final round of the Dunhill Links Championship at St Andrews as he bids for a remarkable fourth European Tour win this season. Els, who shot a 65 at St Andrews, is 12 shots adrift and believes Grace has the make of a major champion. American Dustin Johnson, who won all three of his matches at Medinah, was on the same mark as Kaymer.
