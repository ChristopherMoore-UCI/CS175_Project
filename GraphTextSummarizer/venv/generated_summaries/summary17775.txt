Liana Satenstein recently wrote about the device for Vogue under the headline "The #SelfieStick May Be the Most Shameless Fashion Accessory Ever." "The selfie stick may seem solely for the extremely self-involved, but before you point fingers, or sticks, I'm not the only one using it," Satenstein wrote. According to The Daily Mail, selfie sticks are the must-have gift this season in Britain. Selfie sticks first took off in Asia and, according to the Daily Mail, gained popularity among extreme sports enthusiasts who started using it as a way to capture images of themselves in action. The pole is used to extend camera phones more than three feet away, thus allowing users to take group selfies, panoramic shots and the like. It's that Bluetooth system that caused South Korean officials to ban the use of "unregulated" selfie sticks and to declare that they might be hazardous to other devices.
