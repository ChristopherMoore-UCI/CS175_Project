The Humane Society, which claims support from 11 million people, bills itself on its website as the country's "mainstream force against cruelty, exploitation and neglect" of animals -- including the very kind of dogfighting rings and killings for which Vick was convicted. -- The head of one of America's biggest animal protection organizations said Thursday that Michael Vick, who served prison time for his role in a deadly dogfighting operation, should have the opportunity to bring a dog home -- in due time. And as much as Vick might potentially save some dogs by making the public more aware of fighting rings, Pacelle said that having him interact with dogs should benefit Vick personally. " Jim Gorant, the author of the book "The Lost Dogs" about the animals that were killed and those that survived from the ring that Vick belonged to, questions the extent of Vick's love for animals given his conviction. But putting him to work in communities to save animals and educate people about the problem of dogfighting -- especially with at-risk kids -- is the way to help the problem.
