Lead singer Mick Jagger, guitarist and vocalist Keith Richards, drummer Charlie Watts, Jones and bass guitarist Bill Wyman were famous, but had yet to become rock superstars. Gochanour, however, retained the original title because of the film's cult status among Stones fans. Dispersed throughout the interviews are concert footage of entire performances of other early Stones hits such as "Time Is on My Side" and "The Last Time. I enjoy it with reservations, but I'm not really, sort of, satisfied either artistically or personally with it." Brian Jones' candid words in the first Rolling Stones documentary, 1965's "Charlie is My Darling," are all the more poignant because the guitarist did, in fact, part ways with the band in 1969. At a pivotal point in their careers The Stones are celebrating their 50th anniversary, and "Charlie is My Darling" captures the band at that pivotal point in their careers where they were right on the cusp of superstardom.
