The violence in eastern Ukraine pits pro-Russian separatists against Ukrainian forces and those who support the new Western-backed government in Kiev. Military action On Saturday, a team of international military observers seized by pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine was freed, as Kiev resumed military action to tackle the pro-Moscow gunmen who have overrun the region. Earlier, hundreds of pro-Russian activists shouting, "Odessa is a Russian city, one for all and all for one," attacked the police headquarters, forcing open its gate and breaking windows as they called for the release of their detained comrades. Video posted on YouTube appeared to show supporters of Kiev's government throwing Molotov cocktails at the building where pro-Russian separatists had reportedly taken up positions. Ukraine released 67 people Sunday who were detained for participating in violent clashes after pro-Russian protesters stormed the police headquarters in Odessa, demanding they be let go.
