Indeed, about the only time this season Don's felt the grounding of family is during an outing with daughter Sally (Kiernan Shipka), which ended with an actual profession of love, and a trip to Burger Chef with Peggy (Elisabeth Moss) and Pete (Vincent Kartheiser). She's a manager, essentially No. 2 to the grouchy and limited new creative director, Lou Avery (Allan Havey). You've got Don Draper (Jon Hamm), who has spent these early months of 1969 demoted from creative director to copywriter (copywriter!) About the only episode that really took hits was "The Monolith," which had the most heavy-handed references to "2001" -- but, then again, what other show would bother with such references at all? Megan is going to cross paths with Charles Manson; Don will mount an office coup.
