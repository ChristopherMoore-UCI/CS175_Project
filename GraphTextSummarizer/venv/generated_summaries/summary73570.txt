Food stamp fraud has gone high-tech in recent years, with SNAP cards being sold on Craigslist and eBay, according to the USDA. The rules proposed Thursday will give states the option to place individuals under increased scrutiny when they have asked for an excessive number of replacement cards. According to the USDA, current laws don't permit states to contact households for information about requests for multiple replacements, which in some cases may indicate fraudulent activity. "But we are concerned that a few bad actors are using replacement cards to exchange SNAP benefits for cash, (an activity) commonly referred to as trafficking." Trafficking SNAP cards is illegal and punishable in several ways, including disqualification from the program, fines, and criminal prosecution, according to the USDA.
