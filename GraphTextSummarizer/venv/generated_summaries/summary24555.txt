Showcasing more than 25 designers, the event was what DeVoe had imagined -- a toast to the curvy figure, proof that women can eschew the cultural norm of model-thinness and wear the best clothes and be worthy of Italian Vogue. But as bloggers, customer complaint lines and retail analysts illustrate, it's not for larger women who: â€¢ Want to try on the clothes before they buy them. "Wedding dress sample sizes are all size 10," says Urshel, explaining that plus-sized brides previously could not try on gowns but could only look at them being modeled. Givhan knows that size 6 is not size 16, but says maybe one day the cycle away from size 0s and 2s on the runway can come back around to what "normal" women wear. According to Cohen, that market came close to $18 billion in the April 2009 to April 2010 buying season, but it backed away in the season ending April 2011.
