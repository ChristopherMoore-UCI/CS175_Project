Muttiah Muralitharan made history with his final ball in Test cricket by becoming the first bowler to reach 800 wickets as Sri Lanka thrashed bitter rivals India. But with what became his last ever ball in Test cricket Muralitharan had India's last batsman, Pragyan Ojha, caught by Mahela Jayawardene. When India were reduced to 314-9 it looked as if Muralitharan would be forever stranded on 799 wickets, as Sri Lanka went in search of a resounding victory. India's dismissal for 338 meant Sri Lanka needed only 95 runs to win the first Test and Tharanga Paranavitana and Tillakaratne Dilshan knocked them off for no wickets. He will still be available for the 2011 World Cup which Sri Lanka will co-host with India and Bangladesh, but is expected to retire from all levels of the game after that.
