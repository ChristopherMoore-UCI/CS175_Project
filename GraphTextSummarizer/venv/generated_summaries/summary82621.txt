" Nebraska Medical Center, part of Nebraska Medicine, is one of only four hospitals in the United States that has biocontainment units and has been practicing for years to treat a highly infectious disease such as Ebola. "This patient has been exposed to the virus but is not ill and is not contagious," said Dr. Phil Smith, medical director of the biocontainment unit at the Omaha medical center. And Dr. Martin Salia, who was gravely ill when he arrived from Sierra Leone, died after less than two days of treatment in November, Nebraska Medicine said. "This patient will be under observation in the same room used for treatment of the first three patients and will be carefully monitored to see if Ebola disease develops," Smith said. Nebraska Medical Center has treated three patients with Ebola: Dr. Rick Sacra, who was infected while working in Liberia, was treated and released in September.
