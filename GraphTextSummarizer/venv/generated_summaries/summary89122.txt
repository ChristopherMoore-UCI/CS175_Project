Asked what he wanted to tell the world, Preval said, "I want to thank all the countries that have started to help us," and then he went through a list that included the United States, France, Canada, Cuba, Venezuela, Argentina, Dominican Republic and Israel. -- President Rene Preval said Wednesday that in the aftermath of the devastating earthquake that hit Haiti, he has heard reports of death tolls ranging from 30,000 to 100,000 -- A priority is to clean up the streets, which are clogged with abandoned cars and collapsed buildings, so that rescue workers can do their work, he said. "Let's say that it's too early to give a number," he told CNN's Sanjay Gupta at the airport in Port-au-Prince. "Lots of houses destroyed, hospitals, schools, personal homes -- a lot of people in the street, dead."
