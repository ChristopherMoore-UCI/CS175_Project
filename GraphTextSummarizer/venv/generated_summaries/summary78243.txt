"Postpone using  large appliances, turn out lights, use fans instead of air conditioners, or  if you have to use an air  conditioner, set it at 78 (degrees)," said Con Ed spokesman John Miksad. New York  residents -- advised by Con Ed Power to conserve electricity during the heat wave -- did just that, company spokeswoman Joy Faber said. Faber said later that usage peaked Tuesday -- as New York temperatures hit 103 degrees in some places, according to the National Weather Service -- at 12, 963 megawatts. Coaches, trainers, camp counselors should remain alert for signs of heat exhaustion and heat stroke," the weather service warned. Earlier in the day at  a media briefing with reporters, a Con Ed official had feared that  Tuesday's usage rate would surpass  the record of 13,141 megawatts set in August of  2006.
