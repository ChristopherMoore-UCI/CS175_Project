I Want Revenge wrenched its ankle while training on the wet track Friday morning, race officials said, and trainer Jeff Mullins said the horse is also not likely to run in the Preakness -- the second event in horse racing's Triple Crown -- on May 16. -- Longshot thoroughbred Mine That Bird plowed down a muddy track at Churchill Downs to win the 135th Kentucky Derby on Saturday by several lengths. It was Borel's second time riding a Kentucky Derby winner, having won the 2007 race aboard Street Sense. Second-place thoroughbred Eight Belles had to be euthanized on the track after collapsing with two broken ankles just after crossing the finish line in the 2008 Kentucky Derby. And in 2006, Derby winner Barbaro's right rear leg shattered at the start of that year's Preakness.
