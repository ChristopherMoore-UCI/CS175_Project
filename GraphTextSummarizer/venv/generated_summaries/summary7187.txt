The images show a condensed version of Timeline, in which a user's details (name, occupation, education, location) appear in reverse type on top of â€” rather than below â€” the cover photo. The carousel of thumbnail images highlighting friends, photos, places, likes, etc. has also been compressed. We're curious to know, for instance, whether users will be able to modify the color of the type that appears on top of their cover photos. It's not clear if the new design will give users greater control over the appearance of their Timelines. Screenshots of the new design were posted on Talking Points Memo Tuesday morning.
