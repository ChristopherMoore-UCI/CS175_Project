Iran's atomic energy chief said Wednesday that no deal has been struck to export uranium for enrichment abroad, a demand of Western nations worried that Tehran plans to use its program to build nuclear weapons. Salehi's remarks came a day after President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad told state-run Press TV that Iran would have "no problem" turning over most of its low-enriched uranium to the West for further enrichment. They [Western countries] can come and build 20 nuclear power plants for us; Russia, France and the United States can come and sign contracts and build the power plants. "The discussions are still being conducted, and we will inform the nation of any final agreements," said Ali Akbar Salehi, director of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, according to the state-run Iranian Labour News Agency. Asked what countries in addition to France and Brazil were under consideration, he cited an Asian country, but would not specify which one.
