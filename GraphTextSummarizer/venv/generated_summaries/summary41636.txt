In an excerpt from Christopher Andersen's "Mick: The Wild Life and Mad Genius of Jagger" published by the New York Daily News, Andersen claims that Mick Jagger and David Bowie had an ongoing sexual relationship. Among the various rumors and stories cited, the excerpt points out that Bebe Buell, mother of Liv Tyler and former lover of both Jagger and Bowie, dated the two at the same time, and that the two rockers attempted to lure her into a few orgies. Jagger was a BF on and off for years. "I used to get some pretty strange phone calls from Mick and David at three in the morning inviting me to join them in bed with four gorgeous black women," reads a quote in the book. Mick: The Wild Life and Mad Genius of Jagger was released yesterday.
