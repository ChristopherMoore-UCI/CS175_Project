"Ramadan is the most appropriate season to launch such initiatives, as it reminds us about many health benefits of reducing weight and encourages us to take strong steps to change our bad lifestyles," said Hussain Nasser Lootah, the director general of the Dubai Municipality. -- The city of Dubai is offering gold as an incentive for a weight loss initiative it will launch this week. Dubai is famous for its big shopping malls, fast food chains and soaring summer heat that makes it difficult for people to exercise outdoors. The "Your Weight in Gold" program, which begins Friday registering and weighing participants in different parts of Dubai, will last about a month. To qualify, contestants must lose a minimum of two kilograms (4.4 pounds) during the month, and they will receive one gram of gold for each kilogram of weight lost.
