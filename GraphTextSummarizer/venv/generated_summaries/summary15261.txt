Ahmadinejad's government violently quashed the protests with the help of elements of a unit of the Revolutionary Guard, which answers to the Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's supreme leader. He was also Iran's chief nuclear negotiator from 2003 to 2005 -- during the presidency of Mohammad Khatami , who later became one of the leading figures in Iran's rebellious "Green Movement," which erupted into street protests after the re-election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in 2009. In a book about his experience as Iran's nuclear negotiator during Khatami's presidency, Rouhani criticizes Ayatollah Khamenei, according to Milani. As Khamenei ages and the appointment of a successor becomes necessary, Rouhani will likely have influence on the choice. In a few weeks, he will hand over the mantle of presidency to Hassan Rouhani, who stood victorious Saturday after Iran tallied all its votes in the national election.
