-- Attorney General Eric Holder said Tuesday that the controversial tactic that allowed illegal guns to be smuggled to Mexico "should never have happened, and it must never happen again. At the hearing Tuesday, Republican Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa said, "It doesn't matter how many laws we pass if those responsible for enforcing them refuse to do their duty -- as was the case in Fast and Furious." Grassley pressed Holder at the hearing about who had leaked a sensitive document to the press regarding a whistle-blower who had come forward with allegations of gun-walking. "Unfortunately we will feel its effects for years to come, as guns that were lost during this operation continue to show up at crime scenes both here and in Mexico," Holder said. "We are losing the battle to stop the flow of illegal guns to Mexico." On Monday, Leahy tried to lower the heat on Holder by raising it on the Bush administration for Operation Wide Receiver.
