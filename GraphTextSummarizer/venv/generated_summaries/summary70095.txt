According to the survey, two-thirds see China as a source of unfair competition for U.S. companies, while only a quarter are more likely to view China as a huge potential market for U.S. goods. "That may be why 71 percent of Americans consider China an economic threat to the U.S.," says CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. The poll's release coincides with U.S. President Barack Obama's first visit to China to bolster relations. Only a quarter of those questioned in the poll say that China has a good track record on human rights. "Americans tend to view foreign countries as competition, and China is no exception."
