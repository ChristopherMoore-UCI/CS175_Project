According to Business Insider, the call took place Friday amid news that AOL is slashing the number of Patch sites from 900 to 600. AOL CEO Tim Armstrong was on a call about the future of Patch, the hyperlocal news websites he founded, when he noticed Patch's creative director Abel Lenz and his camera. Lenz later tweeted from a New York bar: "No comment." Incidentally, less than a minute before Lenz's fatal snapshot, Armstrong said he didn't care if anyone leaked information about Patch. "I also want to clear up the fact that leaking information or anything around Patch isn't going to bother me," the CEO said. "If, uh, you guys think that AOL has not been committed to Patch and won't stay committed to Patch, you're wrong," he said.
