All this is legal in New York, the remnants of a bargain struck nationally with the Dixiecrats to exclude minority workers from New Deal federal fair labor laws. The Farmworkers Fair Labor Practices Act, passed by the State Assembly last year and languishing in the State Senate, is the first step to addressing some of these egregious violations of international human rights New York farm workers still face. As a resident of New York State, I wanted to see the conditions for myself. That law surged California forward in the global labor movement, but New York never had a Cesar Chavez. So I drove a few hours north of my home to Liberty, New York, and visited the largest producer of fois gras east of the Mississippi.
