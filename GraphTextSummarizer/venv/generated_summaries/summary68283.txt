And Japan's government recently told residents of several towns outside that zone that they would soon have to evacuate, due to possible long-term health risks from radioactive particles. Japan's government five weeks ago mandated that everyone must leave the town, amid concerns about dangerously high levels of radiation emanating from the stricken Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant about eight kilometers (five miles) away. As he returned to Tokyo, where he's been in government housing, Shirato couldn't help but feel that part of him -- his sense of security growing up in the shadows of the Fukushima Daiichi plant -- had been lost due to the nonstop nuclear crisis. So, with a Japanese journalist and cameraman alongside, he got in a car and headed toward Tomioka, where he and many others hadn't been since the 9.0-magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami struck on March 11. In between picking up his DVD collection and unplugging the electricity, Shirato searched for bank records and identification cards.
