-- Chris Lighty, who managed several of hip hop's biggest artists, apparently shot himself to death in his Bronx, New York, apartment Thursday morning, a New York police spokesman said. Rapper 50 Cent, in a statement sent to CNN, said he was "deeply saddened by the loss of my dear friend and business partner. Lighty founded Violator Records & Management, which counts Mariah Carey, Soulja Boy, 50 Cent, Busta Rhymes, and Diddy among their artist. While the death appears to be a suicide, police investigators will wait until the medical examiner's report before closing their investigation, the spokesman said. " "Chris has been an important part of my business and personal growth for a decade," 50 Cent said.
