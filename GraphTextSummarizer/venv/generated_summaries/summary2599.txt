On the TSA web site, they are listed under prohibited sports goods, which include baseball bats, ski poles, and bows and arrows. After his weapons were detected, the TSA contacted local law enforcement, who questioned the passenger, said TSA spokesman Kawika Riley. The TSA said most passengers who carry prohibited items do so without ill intent, but said officers have a responsibility to prevent weapons from getting through the checkpoint. A passenger at a New York-area airport learned that lesson the hard way last week when a TSA screener discovered a 21-inch spear gun and a utility knife in a carry-on bag. The same rule holds for utility knifes," Riley said.
