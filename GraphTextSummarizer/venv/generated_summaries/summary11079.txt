"London 2012 is going to be a spectacular celebration of sport and it is imperative that tickets are distributed to deserving recipients. "I have also spoken to (London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games) chairman Sebastian Coe since I learnt of this news and informed him that I will ensure that we fully co-operate with any subsequent investigation that takes place in London. "There has never been a situation where we have had a surplus number of tickets and those that we have received will all be distributed using official channels. He said: "I understand you're a dealer -- that's why for me, you are priority number one, the top, the person, in case we have extra tickets to contact you, we contact you." When the charges were put to him, he is said to have responded that he "never planned to sell tickets in the UK," and had been making "diplomatic talk to satisfy the persistent interest of the ticket dealer."
