The group has gained territory, cash and recruits primarily because of the rage and rebellion of the Sunnis of Iraq and Syria, who believe they must fight the Shiites to secure their own survival and strength. First, ISIS is clearly about religion -- its version of radical Islam -- but it is also about power. The United States has been successful in its tactical battles against ISIS and has managed to push the group back from many of its gains in Iraq. In this respect, ISIS is like other radical Islamic groups, such as the Taliban -- they have an allure in the abstract, but once they are actually governing in their medieval, barbarous manner, the allure fades and the disenchantment builds. Remember, no one has ever voted ISIS into power anywhere.
