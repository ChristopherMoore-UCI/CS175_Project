Thousands of refugees seek asylum in Australia each year, said Paul Power, CEO of the Refugee Council of Australia, an umbrella organization for groups that support refugees. Most of those come from Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, Iraq, Iran and Burma, and go travel through Malaysia -- a transit point for many refugees headed for Australia. Under the deal struck between the two countries, the next 800 asylum-seekers who arrive in Australia illegally will be transferred to Malaysia for refugee status determination. In other words, those 800 who are transferred from Australia to Malaysia will not get preferential treatment over those refugees who are already there and have already begun to apply for asylum in Australia. For one, he said, Malaysia, unlike Australia, is not a signatory to the 1951 U.N. Refugee Convention.
