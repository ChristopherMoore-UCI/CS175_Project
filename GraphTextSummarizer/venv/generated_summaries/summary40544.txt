-- King of Clay Rafael Nadal began his defense of his Monte Carlo Masters title Wednesday with a routine 6-4, 6-3 victory against the Finnish player Jarkko Nieminen. Nadal, whose incredible form on clay has seen him go unbeaten at the tournament since 2003, showed little discomfort in dispatching Nieminen despite suffering persistent injury problems with his left knee. " Djokovic will play the Ukrainian Alexandr Dolgopolov in the second round in the hope he can finally break Nadal's clay court stranglehold in Monte Carlo and beyond. "It was the first match on clay after a long time, and the first match after 15 days without touching a racquet," said Nadal. "We've played already here finals in 2009, good match, but Nadal is the ultimate challenge on clay," Djokovic said on Monday.
