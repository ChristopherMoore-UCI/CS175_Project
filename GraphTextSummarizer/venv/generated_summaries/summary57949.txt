This small, simple community is finding itself embroiled in a feud with local officials over a sudden, huge increase in property assessments that are raising property taxes as much as 600% for some. County Attorney Adam Poppell told CNN that the Gullah-Geechee culture is invaluable, but the properties had been historically undervalued due to errors in previous property appraisals. That brought on increase of more than 500% in property taxes. He and his family own three properties on more than seven acres of property on the island. Residents live on a small section known as Hog Hammock.
