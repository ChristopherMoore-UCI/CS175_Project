U.S. officials have said human rights concerns and efforts to strengthen Cuban civil society remain key U.S. policies in Cuba. For the first time, Americans will be able to travel to Cuba by booking flights directly through U.S. airlines and will be permitted to use U.S. credit cards for transactions there. But the Cuban foreign ministry official said while those steps are positive signs, they did not go far enough and Cuban officials would push for the lifting of all trade sanctions and the so-called "wet foot, dry foot" policy that allows Cubans who reach U.S. territory to stay in the country. Historic talks set to begin on Wednesday between the United States and Cuba could lead to "re-established relations," but dealings between the two countries cannot be considered normalized until the U.S. trade embargo is fully lifted, a Cuban official said Tuesday. The U.S. official said the State Department negotiators, led by U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Roberta Jacobson, will argue that caps on diplomats stationed in Havana should be lifted to increase staffing numbers, as should the restrictions currently placed on U.S. diplomats that forbid them traveling more than 25 miles from the interests section.
