Hamas acknowledges militants killed teens Israel's operation followed the June abductions and killings of three Israeli teenagers who were on their way home from school in the West Bank. "In the end, Israel had two alternatives: either to occupy Gaza and destroy Hamas or to go to a ceasefire," a senior Israeli official said on condition of anonymity. Israel has said its military actions destroyed dozens of tunnels used by Palestinian militants to smuggle weapons used to attack Israeli civilians. On Friday, a Hamas official admitted that the act was carried out by Hamas militants. The ceasefire came on the 50th day of Israel's Operation Protective Edge, aimed at stopping rocket attacks against Israeli civilians and weeding out the militants' tunnels.
