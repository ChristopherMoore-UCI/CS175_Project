The CIA headquarters for Africa is reportedly based in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, and U.S. government sources told me the Islamic radicals tried and failed to shoot down a U.S. surveillance drone over Mali. As al Qaeda and its offshoots grow in northern Mali, that message may sound off. There are some Tuareg fighting within northern Mali, and I am aware of camps they operate in the country. There is no government in northern Mali right now: it is remote and hard to access. One of them is that the type of Islam practiced in northern Mali and the areas around northern Mali is much more relaxed.
