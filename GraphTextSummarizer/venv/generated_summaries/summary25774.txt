-- Striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic was sent off as Italian Serie A leaders AC Milan wasted a chance to extend their advantage after being held to a 1-1 home draw by bottom side Bari on Sunday. Lazio, who finished with nine men after the late dismissals of both Stefan Radu and Francesco Matuzalem, have now lost their last five matches against their city rivals and slip down to fifth place in the table as a result, with Roma two points and one place behind. In-form Udinese continued their rise up the table, moving up to fourth place with a 4-0 thashing of Cagliari thanks to a double from the Serie A top scorer Antonio Di Natale. However, in the end, Milan were thankful for a late Antonio Cassano goal to deprive the visitors of a shock victory. Raffaele Palladino gave Parma the lead at the break, but Ezequiel Lavezzi then set up Marek Hamsik to level.
