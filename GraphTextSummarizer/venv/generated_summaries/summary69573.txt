A senior flight attendant was called to the flight deck about 20 minutes after takeoff and alerted by the pilots that they were using their emergency oxygen supply, Goodfellow said, disputing reports that the pilots needed flight attendant assistance to put on the oxygen. The flight bound for Glasgow, Scotland, on December 20 returned to London's Heathrow Airport shortly after takeoff, said airline spokesman Richard Goodfellow. Airline engineers checked the aircraft after landing and dismissed the possibility of contaminated air in the cockpit, Goodfellow said. " Reports of the incident surfaced over the weekend in the British press after passengers apparently posted details on a flight-oriented website. "The pilots followed the flight procedures they were highly trained for, and the flight landed without incident," he said.
