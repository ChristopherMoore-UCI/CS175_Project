JD: Meanwhile we have different regions like the Kurdish region signing contracts with U.S. and European oil companies for production agreements. But Iran, with the question of the nuclear file and the possibility of the U.S. taking military action against Iran, that is a possibility. John Defterios caught up with Mr Chalabi at the Oil and Money Conference in London this week to ask him about what's driving surging oil prices, the future of the Iraq Oil Industry, and tensions in the region. If the politicians who are running the country now go ahead and try to divide the oil wealth among various regions as they had drafted in the revenue-sharing law, then I would say that is going to lead to the break up of the country. IC: I don't think that the tension between Turkey and the Kurds will have much influence on the price of oil.
