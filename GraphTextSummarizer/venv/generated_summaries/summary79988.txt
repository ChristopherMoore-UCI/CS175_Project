Known for straight talk in his nearly four decades of government work, Devaney is the head of a panel of inspectors general that keeps watch over government spending procedures for the stimulus plan. Devaney said investigations so far have generally involved the wrong people receiving government money, such as someone previously deemed ineligible to do business with the government who opened a business under a different name. " After 38 years in government work, Devaney had been looking forward to retiring and playing golf when he got a call last year from Vice President Joe Biden about heading the recovery panel, he said. To Devaney, a former Secret Service agent, such criticism misses the bigger issue, the unprecedented transparency in government spending under the stimulus program. -- As the nation's top stimulus cop, Earl Devaney tracks whether the $787 billion in taxpayer money is being properly spent.
