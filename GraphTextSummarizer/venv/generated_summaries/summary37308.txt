Lennox was taken from the Barnes family home in Belfast by dog wardens two years ago after city council officials identified him as a pit bull-type dog, which is illegal in Northern Ireland. -- An international effort to save a dog on death row in Northern Ireland ended in failure, heartbreak and recrimination Wednesday when Lennox -- described by the Belfast City Council as a "dangerous, illegal pit-bull terrier type" -- was put to death. Lawyers for Barnes argued that the dog had never bitten anyone and had behaved well since being impounded, but in June, Northern Ireland's top court rejected a bid from Barnes to overturn the decision of two lower courts condemning Lennox to death. The council added it was "in ongoing contact" with Northern Ireland police regarding the alleged incidents. We did everything possible to save Lennox but they still wouldn't listen," said Barnes.
