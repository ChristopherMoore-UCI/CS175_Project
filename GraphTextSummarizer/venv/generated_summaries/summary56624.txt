Appearing in blackface belongs in Australia's own dark past, back there, with the 'White Australia Policy', silly songs about Aborigines and Joliffe cartoons. The use of humor for a long time reflected official government policy that also scorned foreigners and Aborigines. Australian popular culture has a long held an often embarrassing tradition of wrapping racism in supposed humor. Aborigines were dispossessed, often violently, and basic human freedoms, and rights to equal education, employment and welfare benefits denied. It was not until 1967 -- almost 200 years after European settlement -- that the law was changed to officially count Aborigines in the census as human beings and no longer included amongst the flora and fauna!
