Americans support gun rights because they believe guns are necessary for self-protection. Little to gain, lots to lose for Obama and Romney on guns Responding to public opinion, states have loosened gun laws to allow citizens to carry weapons with them almost anywhere they go.

Only one-fifth of young Americans own a gun; one-third of over-50 Americans do. But here's the odd thing: At the same time as Americans have become more enthusiastic about gun rights, fewer and fewer Americans actually want to own a gun themselves.
