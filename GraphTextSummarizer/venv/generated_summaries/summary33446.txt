Marciano: What are some key things your team does to help communities like West Liberty? -- A powerful tornado ripped through West Liberty, Kentucky, last week, making the quaint community look like "a war zone," according to the state's governor. Founded by 2008 CNN Hero Tad Agoglia, the organization brought its specialized fleet of disaster recovery equipment to West Liberty. (That) makes it very difficult for firefighters and emergency workers to get through those windy hills and access those home sites to do search and rescue. Agoglia recently spoke to CNN's Rob Marciano about the team's efforts in West Liberty.
