Despite a 21% jump in connection speed during the quarter, the country's average peak connection reached just 7.1 Mbps. Japan came second at 10.7 Mbps and Hong Kong third with a surprisingly sluggish 8.9 Mbps. It's the first time speeds have shot past 50 Mbps and, if the global trend continues, it's just going to get faster. The U.S. state with the fastest connection is still Delaware with a swift 10.9 Mbps, although the District of Columbia is catching up. While there was a slight drop in pace over the quarter, over the year average peak speeds surged 36%.
