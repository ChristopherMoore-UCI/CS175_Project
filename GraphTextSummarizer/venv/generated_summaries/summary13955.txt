The first case (Chamberlain) was optimism supported by wishful thinking, as useful as buying a lottery ticket to fend off bankruptcy. It's the optimism that falsely promised home prices could only go up, so we should borrow as much as possible, regardless of income; a confidence that boasted that complicated financial ideas and convoluted market hedging made for bulletproof Wall Street portfolios. The second (FDR) was optimism propelled by determined action and smart planning. We shouldn't confuse the power of positive thinking with the dangerous delusion of wishful thinking. -- Optimism is all the rage.
