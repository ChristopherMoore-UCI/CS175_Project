Liz Rosenberg said in a statement that Madonna and her son David met Monday with David's birth father, Yohanne Banda, for the first time since the young boy was adopted in 2006. Madonna holds her adopted Malawian son, David Banda, in 2007. Madonna has been involved with Malawi for several years. -- Pop star Madonna and her adopted son met with the young boy's biological father in Malawi as the singer awaited a court decision on whether she could adopt a girl from the same country, her publicist said Tuesday. Madonna is to return to court Friday to hear the judge's decision in the matter, spokeswoman Zione Ntaba said.
