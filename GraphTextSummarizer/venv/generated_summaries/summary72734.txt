-- Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia is known for bold disagreement, conservative arguments, pointed questions and the occasional crude hand gesture, and still, it's been an intense few months for one of the high court's most polarizing figures, with biting insults hurled in his direction. "Nino," as friends and family call him, was the lone offspring of two immigrant Italian families and "the center of their universe," said Biskupic, who published "American Original: The Life and Constitution of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia" in 2009. "Justice Scalia cares so passionately about these issues that he wears his heart on his sleeve and the blood runs through his pen." "I don't think he cares," Scalia biographer Joan Biskupic told CNN in 2009. " Three days earlier, when the high court mostly rejected Arizona's immigration law, Scalia's minority opinion showed he was "more than usually outraged," CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said.
