From December 8 to 11, the troops who found the complex also killed 24 people they said were terrorists and detained 37 suspects, according to a statement issued by Multinational Division North at Camp Speicher in Tikrit. The complex was in an area thought to be an al Qaeda in Iraq haven and operating base, the military said. The moves were part of an operation called Iron Reaper that has been in progress across northern Iraq for the past few weeks. Ground forces first found what appeared to be a detention facility, which was one of three connected to the torture complex, Multinational Division North said. -- Coalition forces found 26 bodies buried in mass graves and a bloodstained "torture complex," with chains hanging from walls and ceilings and a bed connected to an electrical system, the military said Wednesday.
