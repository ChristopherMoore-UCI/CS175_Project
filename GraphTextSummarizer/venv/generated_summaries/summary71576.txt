In the case of San Jose International Airport, security responsibilities lie not just with the TSA, but also with airport and city police. The airport has multiple levels of security, he said: more than 200 cameras, a private security firm, airport police and the TSA. If a teen carrying nothing but a comb can do it, who else could breach airport security and hop aboard the bottom of a plane? Maui airport district manager Marvin Moniz  told CNN affiliate KHON that people have scaled the barbed wire fence and gotten onto the tarmac before, but none of them ever got onto a plane. The city of San Jose, which owns and operates Mineta San Jose International Airport, is not planning to pursue criminal charges against the teen, said Rosemary Barnes, a city public information manager.
