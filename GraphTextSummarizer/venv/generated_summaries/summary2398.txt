CNN spoke to Sweet Valley creator Francine Pascal about the new book and the lasting legacy of the "Sweet Valley" franchise, which sold more than 150 million copies worldwide and was the first young adult series to hit The New York Times best-seller list. Pascal said she believes Cody will do right by the series because, "She grew up with 'Sweet Valley' and she loved it." Jessica still lives in the idyllic Sweet Valley and has done something unforgivable to Elizabeth, who has since high-tailed it to New York, utterly brokenhearted. She pointed out that "Sweet Valley's" legacy lies in "the hundreds of thousands and perhaps even millions of girls who became readers because of 'Sweet Valley.' and I hope I have touched them." Pascal, 73, said the inspiration for the first "Sweet Valley" book was the 1980s nighttime soap "Dallas."
