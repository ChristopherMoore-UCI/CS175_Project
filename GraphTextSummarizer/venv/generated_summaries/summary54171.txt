U.S. Census Bureau data suggest that Americans raising kids as part of a same-sex couple are almost twice as likely to be African-American as are their counterparts raising children in heterosexual couples, and Mississippi is the state where same-sex couples are most likely to have a child. While more of these families might have access to health insurance after the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, right now, among same-sex couples raising biological, adopted or stepchildren, at least one parent or child does not have health insurance in 38% of same-sex couple families. In fact, same-sex couples are four times more likely than other couples to have an adopted child and six times more likely to be fostering a child. Same-sex couples raising children are also at a disadvantage when it comes to health insurance coverage for themselves and their children. They see that LGBT parents are motivated by many of the same desires as other parents: strong, happy and healthy families.
