That was Steven Tyler's outlook after he suffered a painful fall in a hotel bathroom in Paraguay on Tuesday -- an incident he described in detail Thursday on NBC's "Today" show. " Tuesday's show in Paraguay was postponed by a day, but Tyler and the band played Wednesday to a raucous crowd, and the tour will continue. "Short of having my leg taken off, people are going to expect me to take the stage," said Tyler. "It was like one-stop shopping," said Tyler. " Tyler, who notoriously battled drug and alcohol problems in the past, said he accepted the fact that some people might think he fell off the wagon.
