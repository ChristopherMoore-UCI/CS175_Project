Lake Urmia, in northwest Iran, once bore the weight of a ton of people. According to the United Nations Development Program, the lake has shrunk by two-thirds since 1997 due to Iran's water crisis and detrimental agricultural policies. "When you walk on dried crystal of salt, in the absolute silence, you hear just the sound of cracking salt crystal. You remember that the sound of water in this area had been people's life, and it's very disappointing that that silence of the lake has silenced the life," Zendehdel said. That's the hope of Meysam Mir Zendehdel, a documentary photographer from Tehran, Iran.
