Interpol spokesman Pietro Calcaterra told CNN that "we have received information from our office in Baghdad about possible al Qaeda attacks on U.S. and European targets." -- Iraqi authorities have shared information obtained from captured insurgents who claim al Qaeda is planning suicide attacks in the United States and Europe during the Christmas holiday season, a U.S. official said Thursday. The U.S. military in Baghdad told CNN the American mission in Iraq "will work closely with the government of Iraq and our interagency partners to help determine the extent of any potential threat." But, the official added, al Qaeda in Iraq remains a dangerous force. Another U.S. official said "we are looking closely" at the information coming from Iraq.
