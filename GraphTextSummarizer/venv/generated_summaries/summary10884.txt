-- Long lines lingered in some key states after polls closed in most of the United States, but voters and election officials reported few snags in Tuesday's balloting. And in New Jersey, state officials allowed voters displaced by Superstorm Sandy last week to cast ballots electronically or by fax. One of the complaints about misbehaving electronic voting machines occurred in Millerstown, in central Pennsylvania's Perry County, where election officials said they recalibrated the unit after one voter recorded a video of it registering a vote for Obama as one for his Republican challenger, Mitt Romney. Election officials said the voters were able to cast ballots for their intended candidate, and there were no further complaints once the machines were fixed. In Hamilton County, which includes Cincinnati, as many as 15% of voters in some traditional Democratic precincts had been issued provisional ballots.
