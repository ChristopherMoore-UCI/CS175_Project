The parents of Sarah Jones, a crew member killed while filming musician Gregg Allman's biopic "Midnight Rider," filed a wrongful death lawsuit Wednesday. Among the defendants are the production company, the company that operates the train tracks, and various individuals, including the film's director, executive producers, location manager and director of photography. "Despite this knowledge, and as set forth above, the Midnight Rider Defendants breached their duties to conduct the February 20 filming in a safe and legal manner, and each Midnight Rider Defendant is independently liable to Plaintiffs for Sarah's death and resulting damages. Crew members from various countries shared photo tributes, holding clapboards with messages of remembrance for Jones. "Each of the Midnight Riders Defendants had knowledge, actual or constructive, that the scene filmed on February 20 was to take place on active railroad tracks, without permission from CSX, and each Midnight Rider Defendant knew of the danger presented by filming under those circumstances," the complaint reads.
