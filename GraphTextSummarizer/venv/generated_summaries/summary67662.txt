Iran's top cop has offered to quit his job if anyone verifies the results of a recent survey that says 80% of Iranian students drink alcohol and have friendships with the opposite sex, the semi-official Iranian Labour News Agency reported. The police chief said Iran's law enforcement agencies do not interfere with family relations and friendships but they'll step in if laws are broken. Drinking alcohol and relations between men and women who are not related are forbidden in Iran and other conservative Muslim countries. "These findings have no basis and if such things are true, I will resign from my post," Ahmadi Moghadam said, according to ILNA. "If relations are made through deception we will immediately get involved since committing sexual violations calls for the highest punishment."
