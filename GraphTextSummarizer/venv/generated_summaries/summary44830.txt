One of America's most prominent diplomats over the past 25 years, Ryan Crocker, was charged this month with drunken driving and being responsible for a hit and run in Washington state, according to documents obtained Thursday by CNN. Crocker -- who in 2009 received a Presidential Medal of Freedom, the top civilian honor bestowed in the United States, and until last month was his nation's ambassador to Afghanistan -- was arrested August 14 in Spokane, Washington, a case docket provided by the Spokane County prosecutor's office showed. Crocker served as U.S. ambassador to Pakistan from 2004 to March 2007, at which point he became the country's ambassador to Iraq. A witness followed Crocker to a bank several miles up the road, where authorities arrested him about 45 minutes later, the police spokesman told CNN on Thursday. The driver of the other vehicle, a tractor-trailer truck, was not injured,  Briggs told CNN affiliate KXLY.
