Archaeologists searching for a lost city in the jungles of Honduras have discovered the urban remains of what they believe is a vanished ancient civilization, National Geographic reports. Archaeologists no longer believed in the existence of a single "White City," he said, instead believing there had been an entire civilization with many cities. IHAH director Virgilio Paredes Trapero told National Geographic that the forest and valley could disappear within eight years unless action was taken. The importance of this place can't be overestimated," ethnobotanist Mark Plotkin told National Geographic. A writer and photographer for the magazine accompanied a team of scientists to Honduras' Mosquitia region on the trail of a legendary "White City" or "City of the Monkey God."
