-- Who to believe about the CIA's program of enhanced interrogation -- aka, torture? Such moral outrages are no less outrageous because they happened to bad people who can't vote in a U.S. election. It is true that there have been no more successful terrorist attacks on U.S. soil. Cheney's big government conservatives would argue that liberty sometimes has to be surrendered in order to protect life and limb -- and that this trade-off is a no-brainer when the people being asked to make the sacrifice aren't even U.S. citizens and are self-evidently a threat to the United States. Second, faced with the gruesome details of this torture, we are compelled to question the idea that surrendering a little liberty to the state will result in increased security.
