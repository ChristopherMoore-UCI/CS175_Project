Michael Jackson's legacy: Music, family and 'What if?' Even a makeup-stained chair, allegedly from Jackson's rented Holmby Hills mansion where he died, just went on sale on eBay with a starting price of $30,000. In the last year alone, his estate has seen a slew of projects: -- "Xscape," a new album of never-before-released Michael Jackson songs reproduced by executive producer L.A. Reid debuted at No. 2 on the U.S. charts last month. In death, everybody still wants to get paid by Michael Jackson. -- "Michael Jackson One," a Las Vegas Cirque du Soleil extravaganza featuring his music and dance moves, and "The Immortal World Tour," a slick companion show that is now traveling the country, with more than 500 performances so far. Just a year and a half before his death, I conducted what ended up being the last major interview with the reclusive Jackson in his suite at the Carlyle Hotel in New York City.
