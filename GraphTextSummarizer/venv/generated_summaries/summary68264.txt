Dr. Rick Sacra, who entered The Nebraska Medical Center three weeks ago with Ebola, was released Thursday. Sacra worried that Ebola would cause a "domino effect" on the already vulnerable Liberian health care system and that people with common ailments wouldn't get help. At the news conference, Rick Sacra thanked everyone around the world who had prayed for him during his time of need and asked for more prayers and practical health for the people of West Africa. Sacra and Brantly were infected with Ebola while working in Liberia with the aid organization Serving in Mission. By the time these women arrived at Sacra's clinic "only the mothers' lives could be saved," Debbie Sacra said.
