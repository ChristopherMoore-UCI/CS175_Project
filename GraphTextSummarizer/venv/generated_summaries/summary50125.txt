The comment, Kirkpatrick said, "gave a broader context to this gathering -- that there was so much history that gets ignored or brushed under the table when we see a person portraying Lincoln ... or we go to a Civil War re-enactment. You might say the Lincoln convention is a geekier kind of re-enactment -- for political history buffs. " The Lincolns were joined by other lookalikes of the same era, including women dressed as first lady Mary Todd Lincoln, complete with petticoats and huge, colorful gowns. Yep, what we have here is an honest-to-goodness convention of Lincoln lookalikes. Kirkpatrick has photographed plenty of Civil War battle re-enactments.
