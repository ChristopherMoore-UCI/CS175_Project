Kuvin issued his own statement in response to Singer's statement, saying: "The press should be asking Mr. Singer if Mr. Cosby was at the mansion at 'any' time during the summer of 2008. Cosby was not in California on the day in 2008 when Chloe Goins alleges the comedian sexually assaulted her at a Playboy Mansion party, Martin Singer, Cosby's lawyer, said Friday in a statement. "On Wednesday, Chloe Goins and her attorney publicly accused Bill Cosby of assaulting Ms. Goins in 2008 at the 'Midsummer Night's Party' held at the Playboy Mansion in California," the statement said. Mr. Cosby was in New York on that date. Like other women who have accused Cosby, Goins said she was drugged and woke up undressed, said her lawyer, Spencer Kuvin.
