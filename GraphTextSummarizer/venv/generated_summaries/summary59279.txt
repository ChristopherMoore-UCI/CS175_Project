Roach: Beaten Marquez deserves fourth Pacquaio fight What everyone agrees on is that the fights have been great. They were entertaining fights that demanded sequels, then sequels that demanded sequels. " Pacquiao's last fight gave him a taste of what Marquez has felt during the reading of the scorecards for their battles. But for Manny Pacquiao (54-4-2, 38 KOs) and Juan Manuel Marquez (54-6-1, 39 KOs), their legacies require one more battle in the ring, a fourth fight that will give one a chance to finally hear his name pronounced the winner and a match that could allow the other to push aside the controversial decisions of the past. Pacquiao has knocked Marquez down four times, three of which came in the first round of the first fight.
