The Bastrop County Complex fire now includes the 719-acre Union Chapel wildfire, but on Saturday morning, all Union Chapel residents were allowed to return to their homes, officials said. -- Authorities expect to allow residents to begin re-entering some of their communities in fire-ravaged Bastrop County, Texas, this week as firefighters made some headway against the blaze at 50% containment. One person was identified Saturday as Vickie Keenan, 58, said Bastrop County Sheriff Terry Pickering. Six people were unaccounted for Sunday in Bastrop County near Austin where the most damaging blaze was burning. Since January 1, state and local firefighters and crews from across the country have battled 18,887 wildfires over more than 3.5 million acres in Texas, according to state officials.
