-- Thousands of homes are under threat, rail services have been canceled, and soldiers have been called in to boost flood defenses as Britain braces for more devastating rain. "River levels are high across south west, central and southern England and further rain has the potential to cause significant flooding. "Police have declared the flooding situation in Thames Valley a Major Incident and continue to work with partners to help local communities," Thames Valley police tweeted. Train connections have also been disrupted as the strong winds and heavy rain have caused flooding, landslides and obstructions on railways. Soldiers have been deployed to some of the most affected areas to boost flood defenses by filling and stacking sandbags.
