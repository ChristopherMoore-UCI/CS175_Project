The United Nations hopes that donors will go beyond affirming their support to end hunger and fulfill a promise they made during a Group of Eight meeting in July to increase food aid significantly. They promised to do so by promoting investment, reversing the decline in funding for agriculture and tackling the effect of global warming on food security. "If a billion Internet users donate a dollar or a euro a week, we can literally transform the lives of a billion hungry people across the world," said Josette Sheeran, the World Food Program's executive director. "These small-holder farmers are the heart and soul of food security and poverty reduction," he said. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon laid out this sobering statistic as he kicked off a three-day summit on world food security Monday in Rome.
