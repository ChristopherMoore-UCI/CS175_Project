The plane's altitude was too high to be fired on from the ground with a portable missile system, according to a statement from Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko. The Ukrainian military has been battling pro-Russian separatists in the area where the Antonov-26 aircraft went down, officials said. On Friday, pro-Russian separatists fired rockets at a Ukrainian military camp in the Luhansk region, killing 19 troops and injuring at least 55 others, according to Ukraine's counterterrorism office. A spokeswoman with the Russian President's office said Monday she could not confirm any missile had been fired from the Russian Federation. The rocket that struck the plane Monday appears to have come from Russia, Kiev officials said.
