After gunning down the officers, Jerad and Amanda Miller ran to a nearby Walmart, police said, where they killed a bystander before barricading themselves inside the store during a firefight with responding officers. Upon completing that action, he did not realize that Amanda Miller was with Jerad Miller," McMahill said. But Assistant Sheriff Kevin McMahill told reporters Wednesday that a review of forensic evidence at the scene and autopsy results showed that police fatally wounded the gunman. In February, detectives from the Southern Nevada Counter-Terrorism Center investigated threats made by Jerad Miller against the Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles, McMahill said. A second contact came on April 10 when officers interviewed the Millers as witnesses in a domestic violence case, McMahill said.
