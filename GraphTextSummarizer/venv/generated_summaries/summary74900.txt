Taking on 19th Century French writer Stendhal's motto that "beauty is the promise of happiness," de Botton analyzes human surroundings and considers how our needs and desires are transferred into architecture. De Botton is quick to mention the new Westfield mall opening in Shepherd's Bush, London, which he describes as a "monument to human idiocy" which represents a "large, confused shed, which offers the wider community nothing but a windowless fa√ßade clad in nauseating green paneling, with an utter indifference to symmetry, proportion or beauty". Its effectiveness could be compared to the weather: a fine day can substantially change our state of mind -- and people may be willing to make great sacrifices to be nearer a sunny climate," de Botton said. The Swiss-born British writer, modern-day philosopher, and author of international bestseller "The Architecture of Happiness", believes there is more to buildings and architecture than we may think. De Botton said there are "thousands" of public buildings which are ugly and could possibly force a negative, saddening, or even potential anger-producing mood upon us.
