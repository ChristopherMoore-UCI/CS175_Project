"Star Trek Into Darkness" opens on a primitive planet, where the natives are restless and a volcano, in mid-eruption, traps First Officer Spock (Zachary Quinto) over a boiling ocean of lava. The movie was all about how the Enterprise crew first came together, but really it was about how Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto rose up to become those superheroes of yore, Kirk and Spock, by echoing the looks, voices, and personalities of William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy just enough, while still making the roles their own. Like Abrams' first "Trek" movie, this one is positioned as a prequel to the original TV series and subsequent films, though it also lifts (and twists) elements from that sacred text, 1982's "Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan." Kirk and Spock, each following his own nature (one's a hothead, the other a detached brainiac), are usually at loggerheads.
