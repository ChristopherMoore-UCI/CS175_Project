Two were given new names  -- TSK Simferopol, SKChF Sevastopol and Zhemchuzhina Yalta -- and entered in to Russian competition by the Russian Football Union, sparking protests from Ukraine. Last week Russian investigative magazine Novaya Gazeta published a transcript of a leaked recording from a meeting between top Russian soccer executives. The move was announced by European soccer's governing body after the Football Federation of Ukraine (FFU) appealed to UEFA and FIFA for their Russian counterparts to be sanctioned over  "illegally and arbitrarily" taking three of its teams. Crimea was also raised when FIFA president Sepp Blatter met Russian president Vladimir Putin last weekend to discuss preparations for the 2018 finals. UEFA will not recognize any Russian soccer matches involving teams from the disputed region of Crimea.
