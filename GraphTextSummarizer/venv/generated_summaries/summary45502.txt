-- Efforts by government troops to secure control of a main highway that links mainland Sri Lanka to the northern Jaffna peninsula came a step closer Thursday when they re-captured Pallai, a palm-fringed village under rebel control. The village is located past Elephant Pass, described as a gateway to the Jaffna peninsula, which the army re-captured on Wednesday. The only stretch that remains to be recaptured is the area between Elephant Pass and Jaffna. Sri Lankan army troops have had there most decisive victories against the Tamil Tigers in recent weeks. He invited the Tigers -- who have fought for an independent homeland for Sri Lanka's ethnic Tamil minority since 1983 -- to surrender as government troops closed in on their last remaining strongholds.
