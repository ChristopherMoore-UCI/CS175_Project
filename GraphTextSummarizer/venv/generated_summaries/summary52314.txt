"We will target funeral processions and wedding ceremonies of those who support the U.S." Din said Friday that the deceased and his attendants were enemies of Taliban because of their pro-government activity. -- The Pakistani Taliban declared Friday they will target the weddings and funerals of anyone involved in pro-government activity against them. Police say a suicide bomber blew himself up standing in a funeral procession in the northwestern Pakistani province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. The threat came as the Taliban claimed responsibility for Thursday's suicide blast targeting a funeral procession for a member of an anti-Taliban militia. "Anyone who supports the U.S. and Pakistani military will face the same fate," Taliban spokesman Siraj-ud Din said.
