-- Miami police issued a plea for information Saturday after at least one person with an assault rifle opened fire on a crowd of people on a streetcorner Friday night, killing two teens and wounding seven other people. "We are convinced that because of the amount of people out here last night that there is somebody that knows the individuals or individual involved, and we need them to come forward," Timoney said, according to WSVN. Five of the shooting victims were still in the hospital Saturday night, according to CNN affiliate WSVN. Others told WSVN that a masked man with an AK-47 burst onto the scene and ordered everyone to the ground. Evidence markers dot the Miami street where nine people were gunned down with an AK-47 Friday night.
