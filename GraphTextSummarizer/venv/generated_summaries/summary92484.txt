-- The meter reader who led authorities last week to remains believed to be those of Caylee Anthony called police four months ago, directing them three times to same site, authorities said Thursday. Nieves' latest announcement is raising questions about whether police missed several chances to find remains believed to be Caylee's. Remains described as being those of a small child were found last week a half-mile from Casey Anthony's parents' home, in the area where the meter reader first directed police. Caylee Anthony, 2, has been missing since June in a case that has received national attention. Casey Anthony, 22, faces charges including first-degree murder in the June disappearance of her daughter, Caylee, who was 2 at the time.
