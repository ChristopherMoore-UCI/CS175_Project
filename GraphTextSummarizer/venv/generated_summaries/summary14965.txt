Today, not only are all those countries competing against us, but so are China, India and other countries in South America and Africa -- countries with very large and growing populations. Despite the recent, well-publicized successes in U.S. auto manufacturing, what is happening in the American economy is not the reversal of a trend toward declining manufacturing. And this situation creates the political tension we face in America; consequently, we long for manufacturing because we associate that with the strength of the middle class. If manufacturing is to have a reinvigorated future in America, this is where the growth will be seen. This gave rise to a burgeoning, powerful middle class, and more than that, a sense that all of America shared in the economic boom, with the assembly line tethering us like an anchor to shared prosperity.
