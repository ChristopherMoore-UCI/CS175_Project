Directed by first time directors Jon Lucas and Scott Moore, Relativity's $13 million party movie should be able to make back its budget, but it is surely disappointing that the film came in at less than half of "Project X's" opening weekend. Review: '21 and Over' "21 and Over" (CinemaScore: B) had a $9 million opening weekend in 2,771 locations, with a $3,248 per screen average. Still, it's nowhere near what the movie needed to take in on its opening weekend, and will likely not even come close to making up for its almost $200 million budget. If it wasn't obvious that "Identity Thief" was a runaway success, the R-rated movie has already made three times its opening weekend. Down 31 percent from last weekend, Universal's Jason Bateman and Melissa McCarthy comedy picked up eight new theaters.
