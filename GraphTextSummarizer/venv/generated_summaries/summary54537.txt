Cosplay is an integral part of Comic-Con and similar conventions, with countless fans creating elaborate costumes to transform into superhero, comic book, video game, television or movie characters. And while the costumes are varied, there are certainly some favorite characters for cosplayers, as evidenced by photos we've seen of them over the years on CNN iReport. We'll continue to update the gallery throughout SDCC 2014 with new photos of competing costumes. The massive convention -- known for giving fans a first look at the latest "geek-friendly" TV, film and of course, comics -- is also a major gathering for cosplayers (that is, fans who wear costumes of their favorite characters). Come back Saturday and Sunday to see new photos featured in the gallery and discuss cosplay.
