Graham, though supportive of an immigration overhaul, criticized President Barack Obama for taking executive action that could allow almost 5 million undocumented immigrants to avoid deportation and grant many of them work permits. It's another for the President of the United States to say, not only will I decide not to prosecute a group of people, but I will affirmatively give you legal status ... that is well beyond executive action." Republicans hammer legal case against Obama on immigration "Shame on us as Republicans," Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, told CNN's Chief Political Analyst Gloria Borger on "State of the Union." "Shame on us as Republicans for having a body that cannot generate a solution to an issue" involving national security as well as cultural and economic considerations. I am in the camp of securing our borders first, fixing a broken legal immigration," said Graham, one of the Republican senators who pushed a bipartisan bill to passage there in 2013, but on which the House never voted.
