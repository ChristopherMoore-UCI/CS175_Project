However, Ricardo Flores and Edward Alvarez, an attorney representing the Flores family, argued that a police investigation indicated the last time anyone had searched for information about Holloway on van der Sloot's computer was the day before Flores' death -- suggesting the attorney's explanation that van der Sloot attacked Flores after she read an e-mail on his computer was a lie. -- Even though a Peruvian judge postponed a preliminary hearing for Joran van der Sloot Wednesday, it still was a dramatic day in court for the father of the young woman van der Sloot is accused of killing. Ricardo Flores said the family hoped van der Sloot would be charged with robbery and homicide, which would carry a maximum sentence of life in prison. His daughter, Stephany Flores, was found dead in a Lima hotel room registered to van der Sloot in May 2010. The judge rescheduled the closed-door hearing -- which involves some evidence in the case -- for next Tuesday, because van der Sloot did not have legal representation in the courtroom Wednesday, Flores said.
