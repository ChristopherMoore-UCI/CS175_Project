Even The New York Times, which has made fewer cuts than most papers, said last week that 30 jobs will be lost to buyouts. For many years they gave away their wares to anyone with a modem, anxious to avoid being left out of the burgeoning world of online commerce. At some point there have to be actual human beings making phone calls and attending events and pawing through public documents. The Daily Beast, where I work, is also considering a metered paywall, now that the parent company is folding the print edition of Newsweek, which led to substantial layoffs last week. Some early signs are discouraging: Rupert Murdoch's iPad magazine The Daily, which never had a clear identity, folded last week, and Arianna Huffington's hugely successful site couldn't get people to pay a modest fee for a monthly digital magazine.
