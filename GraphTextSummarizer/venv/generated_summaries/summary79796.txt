"This case is about the fact that it was Bob Ward that shot her almost dead between the eyes," said Assistant State Attorney Robin Wilkinson in her opening statement. Kirkconnell, though, insisted that in no way did his client benefit from his wife's death: "From a financial standpoint, the death of Diane Ward ruined Bob Ward financially," he said. Prosecutors, in opening statements, highlighted the financial troubles facing Ward -- who, along with his wife, had been set to testify in bankruptcy proceedings related to one of his companies a few days before the shooting. "Diane Ward was killed by a single gunshot wound as she struggled with her husband over a loaded a gun," the defendant's attorney Kirk Kirkconnell said. " In several videos from an interrogation room -- which the prosecutor promised would be played in court -- Ward offered an array of stories in phone conversations with family and friends, from "It was a tragic accident" to "Diane killed herself."
