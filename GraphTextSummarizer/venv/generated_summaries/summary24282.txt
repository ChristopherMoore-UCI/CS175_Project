We had another first date reveal that he'd clicked through something like 11 pages of Google results ("So, I see you were runner-up in the state spelling bee as an eighth-grader"). Your search for your co-worker was random and innocent, but sometimes we do tumble, "Alice in Wonderland"-style, into Google rabbit holes that we don't need to conduct. In the course of my work, I was demonstrating something to my co-worker and randomly selected a co-worker to Google. That's why you need to be Googling yourself regularly -- so you know what your new boss, new friends and new beau will see when they type in your name. -- Last week, we laid out some ground rules for using The Google to see what the Internet's saying about your co-workers, your love interest and yourself.
