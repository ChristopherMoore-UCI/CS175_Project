The French won 5-0 in his absence last year, but may struggle without injured world No. 7 No. 4 Juan Martin del Potro, the 2009 U.S. Open champion who is resurrecting his career after a year out with wrist problems. Last year Djokovic also played in a Monday final at Flushing Meadows, that time losing to Nadal, and pulled out of his opening singles against the Czech Republic after falling ill. The former world No. 3, now ranked 74th, is 1-4 against Djokovic -- who has won 64 of 66 matches this year. Nadal will play Richard Gasquet in the opening rubber, then Gilles Simon will take over as France's No. 1 against David Ferrer.
