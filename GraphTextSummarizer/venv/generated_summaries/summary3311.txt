U.S. troops, who were on routine patrol in the area, assisted with an initial search of the building at the request of Iraqi police and later assisted with security, said spokeswoman Maj. Angela Funaro. In Baquba, the militants were shooting randomly from the roof of the Diyala provincial council building at Iraqi security forces who surrounded the structure, said the officials, who did not want to be named because they are not authorized to release information to media. When security forces rushed to the scene to help the wounded, four insurgents forced themselves into the building and held people hostage. By Tuesday afternoon, however, security forces regained control of the building and the hostages were freed. A new Iraqi government was formed in December but key positions that oversee security forces remain vacant amid political wrangling.
