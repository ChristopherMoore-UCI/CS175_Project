During his trial, prosecutors said Chen embezzled 600 million New Taiwan dollars (U.S. $18.5 million), took bribes, laundered money and illegally removed classified documents from the president's office. His successor, President Ma Ying-jeou, favors closer ties with mainland China. The challenge for prosecutors was to prove that Chen handed out political favors in exchange for money. The court fined Chen 170 million New Taiwan Dollars (U.S. $5.3 million) and fined his wife 200 million New Taiwan Dollars (U.S. $6.2 million). Wu was convicted on charges that she helped her son, daughter and son-in-law provide false testimony.
