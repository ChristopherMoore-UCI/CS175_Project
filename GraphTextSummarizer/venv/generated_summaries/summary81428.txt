While serving his prison sentence in Oregon, prosecutors allege, Nicholson restarted his career as a double agent and enlisted his son Nathan in his efforts to collect money owed to him by the Russian spy services and to sell more secrets. "Harold Nicholson has admitted not only betraying his country -- again -- but also betraying his family by involving his son Nathaniel in his corrupt scheme to get more money for his past espionage activities," Dwight C. Holton, U.S. attorney for Oregon, said in the statement. Nathan Nicholson had complained to his father that he and his sister were short of money to pay for college, prosecutors said. Nathan Nicholson made trips to California, Mexico, Peru and Cyprus, where he met with Russian government representatives who gave him payments totaling more than $35,000 in cash, according to the indictment. According to court testimony, Nathan Nicholson, who is a former U.S. Army paratrooper, initially told authorities that he had traveled overseas to visit "a battle buddy."
