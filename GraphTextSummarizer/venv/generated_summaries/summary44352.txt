Jamaican medical officials forced the squad to stay in hospital, after three of the party displayed symptoms of malaria -- but the approach was heavy-handed according to the head of Haitian soccer. Not in doubt is the fact that Haiti's under-17 team had their dream of reaching the soccer World Cup crushed after being forced to withdraw from a qualifying tournament hosted by Jamaica. Jamaica insists the matter is now closed after an assurance from Haitian President René Préval, but those closely involved in the saga are in no mood to forgive or forget. Upon returning home Haiti officials promptly recalled their charge d'affaires to Jamaica, while a protest saw thousands march through the capital Port-au-Prince to protest against the treatment meted out to the youth team. Haiti and Jamaica are the latest nations to become embroiled in an unseemly spat that was born on the football field but quickly escalated to dominate and strain diplomatic channels.
