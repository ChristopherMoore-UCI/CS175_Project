Tommy Donahue expressed appreciation to Bulger's defense attorneys Hank Brennan and Carney. Outside of court, Tommy Donahue, son of Michael Donahue, shared his mother's sentiment and called Bulger "a rat coward. "I tip my hat to Carney and Brennan," Tommy Donahue said, referring to the gesture of forfeiting Bulger's recovered assets to his family and Halloran's family. The judge previously ruled that Bulger could not argue immunity as defense in this trial. Bulger witnesses' death ruled a homicide Bulger's defense team said earlier in the day that Bulger is prepared to forfeit the assets found in his Santa Monica, California, apartment to the families of two men he is accused of murdering.
