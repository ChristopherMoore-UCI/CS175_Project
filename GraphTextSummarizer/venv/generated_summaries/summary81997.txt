There also have been reports of brutality against Tahrir Square protesters arrested since Mubarak's fall from power. In an earlier incident, on February 26, opposition activist Mohamed Moussa alleges that he and fellow protesters were relentlessly beaten and kicked while in detention, allowed a brief respite only when they followed orders to chant "Long live Hosni Mubarak." -- It's been more than four months since longtime Egyptian dictator Hosni Mubarak was forced out by his people in largely peaceful mass protests that lasted 18 days. "Whenever one NDP member is forced out by angry protesters, he or she is almost immediately replaced by another Mubarak loyalist," said Najlaa Abdel Hafez, a journalist working for the state-sponsored Al Ahram newspaper. The opposition activists who celebrated in the streets after Mubarak stepped down had hoped that tangible changes would follow soon after their Tahrir Square victory.
