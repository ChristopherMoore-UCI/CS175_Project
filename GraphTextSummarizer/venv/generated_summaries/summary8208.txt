2014 is shaping up to be a bellwether year for faith-based films: Last month, the religious-themed Son of God opened to an impressive $25.6 million, while Darren Aronofsky's biblical opus Noah hits theaters next weekend amid a swirl of controversy. The trilogy's finale, Allegiant, is scheduled for March 18, 2016, showing Hollywood's continued faith in spring as a box-office launchpad after the success of recent March hits like The Hunger Games ($408 million total) and Oz the Great and Powerful ($234 million). Starring Shailene Woodley and Theo James as rebels in a dystopian future, the PG-13 action film Divergent aimed for the same moviegoers who gave The Hunger Games a surprise $152.5 million opening weekend in March, 2012. The weekend's other wide release, Muppets Most Wanted, proved that it's still not easy being green â€” at least at the box office: (However, after the first Hunger Games installment's release, Lionsgate did bump the remainder of the trilogy into the more competitive Thanksgiving time frame.)
