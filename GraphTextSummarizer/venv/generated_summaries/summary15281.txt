-- U.S. President Barack Obama, meeting with South Korean President Lee Myung-bak in Seoul on Thursday, said he will send envoy Stephen Bosworth to North Korea next month for bilateral talks on dismantling Pyongyang's nuclear program. But the Bosworth trip could lead to new negotiations between North Korea and the United States, South Korea, Japan and Russia and China. In recent weeks North Korea has sought direct talks with the United States in what American officials saw as a possible re-entry to full negotiations with the United States and other countries over ending Pyongyang's nuclear program. "Convincing North Korea to give up their nuclear program, it is not a simple matter," according to Lee, who said there's no deadline, at the joint news conference with Obama. "If North Korea is prepared to take concrete and irreversible steps to fulfill its obligations and eliminate its nuclear weapons program, the United States will support economic assistance and help promote its full integration into the community of nations," Obama said.
