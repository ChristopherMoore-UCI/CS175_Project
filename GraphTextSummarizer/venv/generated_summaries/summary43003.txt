-- For far too long, according to Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, his committee was nothing more than "a U-Haul trailer of money for a presidential nominee" who lacked a permanent, sustainable presence in crucial states. "We wrote a report and certainly we advocated people being smart about what they say, but we don't have a magic wand," said RNC Committeeman Henry Barbour. Korn, who came to the RNC after running similar outreach programs in the George W. Bush White House, said the results were particularly stark in heavily Hispanic Passaic County, New Jersey, a county Christie turned red in 2013. " "If we do not, our party's appeal will continue to shrink to its core constituencies only," wrote the five Republican authors of the report, which also stated that the RNC believes "comprehensive immigration reform" is "consistent" with Republican policies to "promote job growth and opportunity for all. Examples: When Rep. Steve King of Iowa told Newsmax that Mexican immigrants have "calves the size of cantaloupes because they're hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert" or when Rep. Trent Frank of Arizona said "the incidence of rape resulting in pregnancy are very low." Priebus, who has called out some of the more outlandish comments, seems to just shrug this off with the fact that the RNC has only been at this for less than a year.
