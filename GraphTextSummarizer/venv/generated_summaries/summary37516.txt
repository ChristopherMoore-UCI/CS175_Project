The turnout of 7.5 million voters starkly contrasted with elections in 2005, when the violence and intimidation of al Qaeda in Iraq kept voters away from the polls and only 2 percent of eligible voters participated. -- Half of Iraq's registered voters turned out for peaceful provincial elections this weekend, the election commission said Sunday. CNN's Arwa Damon, who toured polling stations with U.N. observers, said she noticed an increased sense of awareness and optimism among voters, who said they felt their participation would have an impact on their lives and country. Residents of Iraq's Ramadi province cast their votes this weekend during provincial elections. The sprawling desert area was dominated in 2005 by al Qaeda in Iraq.
