It's also what captivated New York photographer Benjamin Hoste, who has visited Plato at least nine times in recent years. Benjamin Hoste is a documentary photographer based in Brooklyn, New York. Maybe that's just as well because Hoste told me he aimed to take "timeless" photos of Plato: There is a photo of a boy laying on the grass by a trailer tire, for example, and a portrait of Bob Morgan, now deceased, holding two of his walking sticks. When I asked Hoste who the most interesting person in Plato was, his first of several replies was Morgan, who he said was a World War II veteran and cowboy. When he first visited Plato, Hoste said he was struck by the fact that it appeared to be a town that "doesn't really have a center."
