Already, since 2007, a law blocked many Dominicans of Haitian descent from acquiring copies of their birth certificates or national identification cards. "This measure affects us so much that we can't do anything," said Elena Lorac, the daughter of Haitian immigrants. The citizenship of tens of thousands of Dominicans of Haitian descent may be stripped, the result of a court ruling that affects those who were born to parents who were in the country illegally. Dominicans of Haitian descent have long faced inequalities, but the enforcement of the last month's ruling will take social exclusion to an extreme. The U.N. Refugee Agency expressed concern, stating that, "Should this process indeed be carried out without the necessary safeguards, three generations of Dominicans of Haitian descent could become stateless."
