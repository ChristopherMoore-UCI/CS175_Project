Gabor's husband, Prince Frederic von Anhalt, announced several months ago that he wanted to sell the house for $28 million because of the high cost of caring for his 94-year-old wife, who has been in poor health for years. The upper terrace offers a commanding view of downtown Los Angeles, Santa Monica, the ocean and Catalina Island. Hilton, who has not been allowed by von Anhalt to see her mother in several months, said Gabor would never want to leave her house for a condo. He would like to move with his wife into a condo along Wilshire Boulevard in West Los Angeles, closer to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, where Gabor has spent much of her time in the past year, he said. Von Anhalt, 67, placed two porcelain toilets on his lawn facing the home of an adjacent property owner with whom he had a feud, the prince said in a CNN interview last year.
