In the U.S., sales of headphones rose by a third last year to $2.4 billion, with Beats by Dr. Dre making up almost 70% of all high-end headphones during the Christmas period, according to market research firm NPD. She said she recently sold a large amount of counterfeit Beats by Dr. Dre for $50,000 to a British businessman who sent them to the UK by jet -- which is considerably more expensive than container ship -- and sold them as originals. -- Three weeks ago, hip-hop star Andre Young -- better known as Dr. Dre -- made news as his Beats Electronics line, a maker of premium headphones, was valued at more than $1 billion thanks to an investment from the Carlyle Group. Beats Electronics, the company behind the Beats by Dr. Dre brand, said in an email to CNN that the company shows "a fierce commitment" to fight piracy and that it works in close collaboration with anti-counterfeiting organizations, police and customs authorities to identify counterfeit sellers, distributors and manufacturers on key markets. Across the Pearl River Delta in southern China, counterfeit Beats are flowing out of factories, assembly workshops and shops, attracting businesspeople that sell the headphones on global markets.
