North Korea already had barred South Korean workers from entering the complex before May. The average wage for North Korean workers in Kaesong Industrial Complex is $134 per month, according to the South Korean ministry. South Korean workers were blocked again in 2009 during an annual U.S.-South Korean military drill. The agreement to hold talks came after North Korea conceded a demand by the South that contact between the two governments should precede visits to plants in the complex by business people, South Korea's Yonhap News Agency reported. On Wednesday, North Korea also restored the Panmunjom communication hotline with the South, which had been cut off repeatedly over the past four months.
