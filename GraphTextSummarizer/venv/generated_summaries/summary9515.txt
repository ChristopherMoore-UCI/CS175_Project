-- Let's be clear: An agreement that would put Syria's chemical weapons under U.N. lock and key is not a solution. It appears clear that by threatening military intervention, Obama was able to advance Syria's conflict toward a potential point of agreement for action. More to the point is that confronting the scourge of the humanitarian disaster consuming Syria and threatening neighbors is not dependent on removing access to chemical weapons. The administration should also continue to make the case to the American people that Syria's suffering didn't start with chemical weapons and will not end in the chance that they are secured or destroyed. If these negotiations are to be a real opportunity, they must be viewed as a step toward a larger political initiative to achieve conditions for a negotiated transition from civil war to relative stability and eventually the democratic Syria for which so many have sacrificed.
