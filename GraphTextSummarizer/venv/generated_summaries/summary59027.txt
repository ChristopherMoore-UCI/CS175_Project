The 27-year-old singer, beloved for her talent but infamous for erratic public behavior, arrests and drug problems, was found dead at her apartment in London on July 23. -- Toxicology tests have found that "no illegal substances" were in singer Amy Winehouse's system at the time of her death last month, her family said Tuesday. She dominated the 2008 Grammys, winning five awards that night and delivering, via satellite from London, a strong performance of "Rehab." The couple divorced in 2009 after a stormy two years filled by drug addiction and arrests. Her death came less than two months after her latest release from a rehabilitation program and weeks after she was booed offstage by disappointed fans in Serbia.
