Lamanna's predecessor at Carnegie -- Hans-Dieter Sues, now with the Smithsonian -- had acquired two fossils that were dug up in the late 1990s in South Dakota by commercial fossil hunters. The "chicken from hell" moniker aside, what makes Anzu wylie especially exciting to paleontologists is that it's the largest species of egg-stealing oviraptors yet found in North America, said Emma Schachner, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Utah. But, in fact, this was a very bird-like dinosaur ... with a really long bony tail, very large hands and really sharp claws." Lamanna, from the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh, detailed the finding Wednesday with fellow scientists from the University of Utah, the Smithsonian Institution in the scientific journal PLOS One. "It probably spent a lot of its life," Lamanna pointed out, "on the lookout for T. rex. That's one way Matt Lamanna describes Anzu wyliei, the species of dinosaur that he and fellow paleontologists unveiled Wednesday.
