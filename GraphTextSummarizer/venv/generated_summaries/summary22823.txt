A trio of disasters that battered American journalism -- the suspension of NBC anchor Brian Williams, followed by the unrelated deaths of CBS correspondent Bob Simon and New York Times media critic David Carr -- could not come at a worse time for the news business. Carr was a fearless critic of media and was unafraid of exposing the inner workings of even the most powerful companies -- including his own beloved New York Times, which he took to task for firing ex-executive editor Jill Abramson in an essay that my friend and journalist John Avlon and I included in a list of the best newspaper columns of 2014. "We consider these restrictions a form of censorship -- an attempt to control what the public is allowed to see and hear." Equally disturbing is the fact the Obama administration has conducted more criminal prosecutions of whistleblowers under the Espionage Act compared with any of the previous administrations. A cadre of opinion journalists -- notably, Chris Hayes and Joy-Ann Reid on the left, S.E. Cupp and Will Cain on the right -- are diligently building reputations for wit, insight and creativity at a time when Americans are looking for new faces and voices. Williams deserves the least sympathy; he caused his own unpaid suspension by repeatedly distorting and exaggerating key facts about a story he helped report over a decade ago, a breach that calls into question the level of quality control at a network that made him the face of news to 9 million nightly viewers.
