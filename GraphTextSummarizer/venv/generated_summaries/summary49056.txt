On Thursday, officials announced an indictment against a resident of the New York City borough of Brooklyn for conspiracy to commit murder abroad and for support of foreign terrorists. But CNN's national security analyst Peter Bergen and law enforcement analyst Mike Brooks say not to read too much into it -- the rush of arrests is a coincidence. Watch how Zazi was caught on tape Â» Zazi's father, Mohammed Wali Zazi, 53, also from suburban Denver, and Ahmad Wais Afzali, 37, a Muslim cleric and funeral director from the New York borough of Queens, also have been charged with lying to federal agents in the case. Justice Department officials said Michael Finton, also known as Talib Islam, 29, of Decatur, Illinois, drove a vehicle he believed contained a ton of explosives to the Paul Findley Federal Building and Courthouse in Springfield. "They tend to be less well integrated" into mainstream society, and in many cases have faced economic difficulties and unemployment, Bergen said.
