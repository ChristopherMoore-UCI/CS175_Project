"Initial reports from the stadium, which is not a 2010 FIFA World Cup stadium, indicate that 10,000 tickets were distributed outside the stadium, but a number of fans wanted to enter the stadium without tickets," the statement said. -- A stampede of fans erupted outside a South African stadium Sunday before a warmup match between Nigeria and North Korea leading up to the World Cup, police and the local organizing committee said. In a statement issued after the stampede, the sport's international governing body FIFA said the match had "no relation whatsoever" to the upcoming World Cup contests. There were no fatalities reported, police said, but 14 people sustained minor injuries. The match at Makhulong Stadium, in the Johannesburg suburb of Tembisa, was arranged by a private company, authorities said in a statement, and tickets were being handed out outside.
