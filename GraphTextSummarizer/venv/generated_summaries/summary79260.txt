Book of the week on the great soul of Mahatma Gandhi The documents include a two-page will, handwritten "in a neat secretarial hand" in Gujarati and signed by Gandhi, the auction house said. -- A glass microscope slide with a trace of the late Indian independence leader Mahatma Gandhi's blood is among an array of memorabilia due to be sold at auction Tuesday in England. A pair of shabby leather sandals once worn by Gandhi, renowned for his doctrine of nonviolent protest and adherence to an ascetic lifestyle, is also going under the hammer. The slide was donated by Gandhi when he was convalescing after an operation for appendicitis in 1924, according to Mullock's auction house. The independence leader, who was born Mohandas Gandhi in Gujarat in 1869, became known as Mahatma, or "great-souled," for his efforts toward social and political progress for his countrymen.
