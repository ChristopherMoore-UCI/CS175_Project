The IOC expelled 10 members in 1999 following the bribery controversy in Salt Lake City's bid to host the 2002 Winter Games, and its president Jacques Rogge believes FIFA should take similar action. -- The head of the International Olympic Committee has urged soccer's ruling body FIFA to take a tough approach against corruption when it deals with the World Cup bidding scandal. Two members of FIFA's executive committee, Amos Adamu and Reynald Temarii, have been provisionally suspended following allegations they were prepared to accept bribes in exchange for their votes for deciding the 2018 and 2022 hosts. "He [Blatter] was so kind to call me when the whole issue emerged and he kept me informed about what he had done and the decision that had been taken by FIFA," Rogge said. Blatter has already spoken out about the negative impact he believes the situation has had on the bidding process for the upcoming World Cup bids.
