-- Two Finns and one Austrian believed to have been kidnapped by al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula last December in Yemen have been released, the Finnish government said. Details of the kidnappings were "murky, but it looks like they were kidnapped by AQAP militants under the protection of tribes," a Middle Eastern diplomat told CNN. The Finns, identified as Leila and Atte Kaleva, and the Austrian, Dominik Neubauer, were freed and were safe in Austria. The three had been abducted in Sanaa, Yemen, in December, the Finnish foreign ministry said. The governments of Finland and Austria worked together to achieve the captives' release.
