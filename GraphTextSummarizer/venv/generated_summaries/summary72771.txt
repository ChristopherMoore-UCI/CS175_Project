-- Three months after a thyroidectomy to remove cancer and one month after radioactive iodine to treat it, Julie Seitz found herself in an operating room again, this time for a lumpectomy to remove breast cancer. "If I have something else happening, I am going to find a reason to give them a deadline, because things happen much quicker." Don't rely 100% on mammograms Even if they must pay for it out of their own pocket, Seitz recommends that women undergo a mammogram every other year, along with an ultrasound. Brawley agrees that mammograms are not foolproof but cautions that ultrasound and MRI screenings are meant to get a better look at something, not to replace a mammogram. The American Cancer Society recommends annual mammograms for women starting at age 40. When, not if Seitz believes that a sea change is needed on how cancer is viewed: People should think of it as "You are going to get cancer, so how can you stay on top of tests and getting checked and getting monitored so you are diagnosed earlier?"
