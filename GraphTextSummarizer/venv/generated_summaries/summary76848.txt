-- Bayern Munich's France international midfielder Franck Ribery has suffered another injury setback in his battle to return to first team action. However, after spending almost 80 million euros on new players last summer, Nerlinger insists his club has "reached the limit" as far as signing new players is concerned. Bayern have offloaded Luca Toni to Roma, Andreas Ottl and Breno to Nuremberg and Alexander Baumjohann to Schalke, but director of sport Christian Nerlinger claims that is just the tip of the iceberg. His knee and toe caused the most frequent problems and it is the latter which has forced him to miss the first session of Bayern's winter training camp in Dubai. Bayern president Uli Hoeness has already revealed the Frenchman will be sold in the summer if he does not extend his contract beyond 2011, although an exception still may be made to Bayern's wage structure to keep hold of the 26-year-old.
