-- Cuba's Fidel Castro on Tuesday said he would publish a new book in August on the fighting more than 50 years ago between his ragtag rebels and the 10,000-strong army under former dictator Fulgencio Batista. Castro said the 25 chapters contain photos, maps and illustrations of the weapons used during a series of battles that lasted 74 days in 1958 and paved the way for his bearded revolutionaries to declare victory on January 1, 1959. Castro said he would now start work on a book covering the second half of the fighting, called "The Final Strategic Counteroffensive." He has spent most of the last four years in seclusion, writing frequent essays called "Reflections of Comrade Fidel" for state-run media. " "I didn't know whether to call it 'Batista's Last Offensive' or 'How 300 Defeated 10,000,' which would sound like a science fiction story," he said.
