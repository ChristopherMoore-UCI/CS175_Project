A debt restructuring deal to solve Detroit's economic woes is likely to mean extreme cuts to public services with retirees receiving just a fraction of their pensions, if plans proposed by emergency manager Kevin Orr go ahead. In the film, fictional Detroit is propped up by a multinational corporation, called Omni Consumer Products (OCP), which runs everything from the hospitals to the police force.
