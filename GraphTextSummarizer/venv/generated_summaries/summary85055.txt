-- Brooke Mueller, the ex-wife of actor Charlie Sheen, was arrested early Saturday in Colorado and charged with assault and cocaine possession, police said. The couple was involved in an alleged domestic dispute in Aspen on Christmas Day 2009 that resulted in felony charges against Sheen. Mueller was found and arrested after midnight at another bar, Escobar, according to Aspen police. She was released after posting an $11,000 bond, said Aspen police. But she is more widely known as the ex-wife of Sheen, with whom she has twin sons.
