In recent weeks, the regime has pardoned hundreds of political prisoners, approved the participation of the pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi and her party in April elections, and pledged to pursue a peace deal with an ethnic rebel group. U Gambira was taken away from a monastery in Yangon by about 10 men in plainclothes who said they were from the "Yangon Division," said U Thika, a monk who witnessed the events. -- An activist monk detained by Myanmar authorities Friday was freed hours later after being questioned at a military base in Yangon, a fellow monk said Saturday. U Gambira was one of the leaders of anti-government demonstrations that rallied tens of thousands of people in 2007. U Thika said he believed the reason U Gambira had been taken away Friday may be related to a recent effort by U Gambira to break into his old monastery, which was locked after the 2007 protests.
