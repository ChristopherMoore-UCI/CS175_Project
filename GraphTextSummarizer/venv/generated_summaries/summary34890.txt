-- More than 2,000 firefighters rushed Tuesday to save hundreds of homes near Yosemite National Park, which are threatened by a blaze alarming for its size, speed and the fact it's striking so early in California's wildfire season. The Carstens Fire "is exhibiting extreme behavior to include fire whirls and strong adverse winds," reported California's Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, which is known as CalFire. It has magical powers and I can't leave." CNN's Miguel Marquez reported from Mariposa, California, and Greg Botelho reported and wrote this story from Atlanta. This is June," said Gary Wuchner, fire spokesman for Yosemite National Park. At least 800 structures are imperiled by the blaze, with some residents taking up shelter at Mariposa Elementary School.
