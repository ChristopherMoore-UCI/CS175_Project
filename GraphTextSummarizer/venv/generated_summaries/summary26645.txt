-- Top seed Caroline Wozniacki secured the eighth WTA Tour title of her career after a straight sets victory in the final of the inaugural Danish Open in Copenhagen on Sunday. Meanwhile, Svetlana Kuznetsova and Agnieszka Radwanska will contest the final of the WTA event in San Diego after both players won their semifinal matches in straight sets. Zakapolova threatened a comeback when she led 4-2 in the second set, but the Dane rallied to take it to a tie-break, which Wozniacki won to add the title to her triumph at Ponte Vedra earlier this year. Two-time grand slam champion Kuznetsova -- who is unseeded after dropping out of the world's top 20 following a disappointing year -- eased to a 6-4 6-0 victory over fifth-seeded Italian Flavia Pennetta. but I was also playing with spin and mixing it up and not letting her dictate," Kuznetsova told the official WTA Tour website.
