The agency said Graves, along with 29-year-old Wildrego Jackson, who was arrested nearly a month ago, were involved in abducting 14-year-old Ayvani Perez on September 17 in Clayton County. Phone calls abductors made to Ayvani's family demanding ransom and drugs allowed authorities to trace their phone records, which they said led to Jackson's arrest the next day. Also wanted in connection with Ayvani's abduction was 40-year-old Juan Alberto Contreras-Rodriguez, a Mexican national that authorities busted in a 2012 anti-drug trafficking raid. -- Federal authorities have arrested a third man they said was linked to the September kidnapping of a Georgia teenager. In a press release Wednesday, the FBI said it arrested 28-year-old Tony Maurice Graves on Friday on a charge of conspiracy to kidnap.
