A Thai judge fined dozens of Rohingya refugees from Myanmar who pleaded guilty Wednesday to charges of illegal entry after escaping from their own country a month ago -- amid allegations that other Rohingya have been dumped at sea by the Thai army. The refugees arrived by boat on the Thai shore, and Thai police said many had severe burns from a fire that broke out on board their craft after it left neighboring Myanmar, also known as Burma. Other boatloads of Rohingya have allegedly been set adrift after being towed out to sea by Thai authorities.

The Thai government has said that "there is no reasonable ground to believe" that the Rohingya are fleeing Myanmar because of persecution.
