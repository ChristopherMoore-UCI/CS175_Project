"It will reduce the amount of plastic from being sent to landfills and/or incinerators, beautify our environments and create sustainable plastic products," said environmental engineer Naji Khoury of Temple University College of Engineering. The ability to recycle 100% of plastic could remove the need to sort through materials and reduce the need to produce fresh plastic. Using pyrolysis, a technique in which heat is applied in the absence of oxygen to decompose materials, the university says it was able to break plastic down into its basic elements. Polly Sattler, executive director of GreenPlate, a nonprofit environmental organization dedicated to reducing the use of plastics in society, says what people need to know is that many of the materials collected have a lot of potential value and are sold. "There are currently no commercial recycling plants that can deal with domestic mixed plastic waste, so the system we are developing will be the first of its kind in the world," Marks said.
