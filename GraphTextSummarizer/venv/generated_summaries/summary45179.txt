Compaore said he stepped down to preserve peace in Burkina Faso -- a key partner for Western countries in the campaign against Islamist militants. Upon his resignation, Compaore appealed via Twitter for "free elections to be held in Burkina Faso within 90 days at the most." France, the former colonial ruler of what is today Burkina Faso, welcomed the President's resignation and called for elections to happen quickly. The military's leadership will support Lt. Col. Isaac Yacouba Zida as interim President until elections can be held, according to a military statement broadcast by the country's TV stations. That came a day after Zida and the top military official, Gen. Honore Nabere Traore, both claimed that they were in charge following the resignation of President Blaise Compaore, who stepped down Friday amid violent protests demanding an end to his 27-year rule. Compaore and his family, meanwhile, departed the country and arrived in neighboring Ivory Coast on Saturday, the latter nation's state-run Agence Ivoirienne Presse reported.
