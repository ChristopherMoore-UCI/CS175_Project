Culprits: Powdery mildew, brown patch, dollar spot, and fusarium patch; or red thread. Dog urine is high in nitrogen, which can "burn" turf, creating a good-sized yellow patch. If weeds are too plentiful to be pulled, check your garden center for a "weed-and-feed" blend of granular fertilizer and herbicide that will kill weeds without harming turf types commonly grown in your area, or look for an organic fertilizer with corn gluten. But as in most battles, the best defense is a strong offense: doing everything right to cultivate healthy turf. To be sure that's what you've got, cut a square foot of infected turf and roll it back, looking for pale, half-inch- to inch-long C-shaped bugs.
