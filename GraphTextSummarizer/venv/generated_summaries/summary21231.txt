-- A court's investigation into alleged financial irregularities by football club Barcelona in its purchase of Brazilian superstar Neymar should be expanded to include tax evasion by the club, a Spanish prosecutor argued Wednesday. The request to expand the investigation came Wednesday in a eight-page writ from the prosecutor, who alleges that he's "become aware of a series of economic transactions by the club, and in favor of various companies, related to the signing of Neymar da Silva Santos Jr., based at times on simulated contracts. Barcelona has confirmed to CNN that one of those signatories was former club VP, and now President, Josep Maria Bartomeu. The investigation originally came after season-ticket holder Jordi Cases complained that the amount paid to bring Neymar from Brazilian club Santos was more than the reported fee of 57.1 million euros. The prosecutor alleges that the club avoided paying 9 million euros (more than $12 million) in taxes on Neymar's signing and transfer, corresponding to contracts signed in 2011 and 2013, through a series of financial maneuvers.
