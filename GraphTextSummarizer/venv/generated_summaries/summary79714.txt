Meanwhile, Google is already a pro at such services, and it's packaging them along with great devices that are affordable and appeal to average users, not just the tech elite. Apple may make great hardware, but it's biggest challenge is still making reliable software and services. As a high-level executive at a very large tech company recently told me, no company can hope to be successful these days unless it can offer an ecosystem of software, services, and great devices to run them all on. Throughout the last year, Google has released a string of incredible hardware products, not just a bunch of virtual services you use through another company's device. And don't forget Google Glass, the promising, Internet-connected eyewear that should hit the market next year.
