Africa Cup of Nations runners-up Ghana were the other big winners on the night with striker Dominic Adiyiah claiming the Young Player of the Year award. The 32-year-old played a leading role as the Elephants qualified for this summer's World Cup finals, but the Ivory Coast disappointed in the recent Africa Cup of Nations where they were knocked out in the quarterfinals. Algeria, who upset Africa Cup of Nations winners Egypt to qualify for the World Cup where they are in the same group as England and also reached the semifinals of the Africa Cup of Nations, were named National Team of the Year. But Drogba's form this season for Chelsea in their bid to win the treble of Premier League, FA Cup and Champions League has been outstanding with 25 goals in all competitions. Drogba, who was not at the ceremony as he prepares for English Premier League action with Chelsea this weekend, will receive $20,000.
