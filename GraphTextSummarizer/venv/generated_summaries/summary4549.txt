-- Pilots for the Spanish airline Iberia resumed their strikes on Monday, forcing the cancellation of 124 flights, in a grievance over the company's new low-cost carrier, Iberia Express. Iberia Express currently serves just four routes, all in Spain: Madrid to Palma de Mallorca, Malaga, Seville and Alicante. Iberia, which had advance notice of Monday's strike, tried to place passengers, many returning from Easter vacations, on alternative flights. The union has offered for pilots to take deep salary cuts if flying for Iberia Express, but negotiations broke off last month. It launched Iberia Express aiming to cut the costs of operating those routes, an Iberia spokeswoman said.
