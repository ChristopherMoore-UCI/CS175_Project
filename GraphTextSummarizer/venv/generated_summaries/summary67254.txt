"I believe his tough-mindedness and leadership skills will be of great benefit to the company and its customers in the months and years ahead." Sony has faced an uphill battle in recent years. -- Sir Howard Stringer will step down as Sony CEO and president on April 1, the Japanese electronics giant announced Wednesday. The hacking of Sony's PlayStation network last year, compromising privacy data of millions of subscribers, added to the company's woes. Stringer, the Welsh-born former journalist and past president of CBS Television Network in the U.S., was named Sony CEO in 2005, becoming one of only a handful of foreign chief executives of a listed Japanese multinational company. "The path we must take is clear: to drive the growth of our core electronics businesses - primarily digital imaging, smart mobile and game; to turn around the television business; and to accelerate the innovation that enables us to create new business domains."
