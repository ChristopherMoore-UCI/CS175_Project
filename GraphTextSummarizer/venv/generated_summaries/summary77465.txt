-- A man caught on camera beating a woman in front of her young child has been charged on several counts of attempted murder, robbery, burglary and aggravated assault, Essex County, New Jersey, Assistant Prosecutor Jamel Semper said Friday. Custis is currently being held at the Essex County Correctional Facility on $750,000 bail, prosecutors said. The woman who was beaten told CNN affiliate News 12 New Jersey that she made a conscious decision to try to remain silent in an attempt to protect her daughter. The woman was later taken to an area hospital, where she was treated for a concussion, chipped teeth, and injuries to her face and legs, according to prosecutors. Shawn Custis, 42, allegedly forced his way into a Millburn, New Jersey, home around 10 a.m. on June 21 and brutally beat the woman while her young daughter sat motionless on a nearby couch.
