Before going to Las Vegas for the weekend, fraternity members involved in the sale of drugs sent text messages to their customers saying, "We're going to close out our inventory" and inviting them to "buy the cocaine at discounted prices," Mosler said. One student allegedly dealing cocaine was a month short of obtaining a master's degree in homeland security at the California school and worked under campus police as a student community service officer. Among those arrested, 75 were students, one of them a criminal justice major charged with possession of guns and cocaine, authorities said. Twenty-one people who are not students were arrested recently on a variety of drug charges, officials said. In all, authorities confiscated more than $100,000 worth of drugs, Mosler said.
