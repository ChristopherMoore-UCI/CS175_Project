Mourinho -- like Villas-Boas -- guided Porto to a trio of domestic and European honors in 2003, before winning two Premier League titles, one FA Cup and two League Cups as Chelsea boss between 2004 and 2007. Former AC Milan coach Ancelotti was dismissed after a trophy-less campaign saw Chelsea finish second in England's top division, despite delivering a league and FA Cup double the previous year. Villas-Boas, who guided Porto to a treble last season, has signed a three-year contract at Stamford Bridge and will replace Italian coach Carlo Ancelotti, who was sacked in May. "Chelsea football club is delighted to announce that Andre Villas-Boas will be the club's new manager," read a statement on the team's official website. The 33-year-old will become the youngest manager in the English Premier League. Garde was capped six times by his country and played for Lyon for nine years before moving on to Strasbourg and Arsenal in the English Premier League.
