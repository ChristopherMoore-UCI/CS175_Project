The Broadcast Committee of Advertising Practice, the industry body responsible for writing and enforcing advertising rules in Britain, said the commercials would be for pregnancy advisory services that give information about a range of options to pregnant women, including abortion. -- British TV channels could advertise abortion services for the first time under new advertising rules proposed Thursday by an ad industry group. New rules would relax the restrictions on advertising condoms, with the only requirement that they not be shown around programs intended for children younger than 10. Under current rules, condoms generally cannot be advertised on TV before 9 p.m. in order to protect younger viewers, the committee said. Gould reported a survey that showed young people believed TV was one of the most effective ways of encouraging them to use condoms.
