We avoid the 'Uncanny Valley' (digital characters that appear too lifelike) effect you usually see in most games." John Koller, vice president of marketing for Sony Computer Entertainment America, said it was important to bring in the crew from Sucker Punch before the PS4 was launched to give console builders a better idea how developers were going to use the new device. "I expect it to deliver the same open-world superhero experience the first two retail entries brought us, but in a way that harnesses the power of the PlayStation 4." Koller said this is just the beginning for what he calls blockbuster titles for the PS4, and explains there is a strategy to it all. However, a five-month delay for a blockbuster title could have spelled potential doom as it has for other new console starts (i.e.: Nintendo's Wii U). "We decided to essentially rework everything else, because the PlayStation 4 let us."
