Southwest had planned to handle the situation as "an internal vandalism issue," a memo from Mike Van de Ven stated, but a company employee called in a tip to ABC15, after information about the investigation was posted in a memo on the company's internal blog. CNN affiliate KNXV in Phoenix reported that multiple sources, who asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak on behalf of the company, have said "the markings appear to be Arabic words." -- Southwest Airlines is working with federal and local officials to determine who is responsible for vandalizing its planes with strange markings, a statement from the airline said Tuesday.
