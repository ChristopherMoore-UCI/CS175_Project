Delta Air Lines' CEO Richard Anderson said in a letter to the TSA that the move would add little value in terms of passenger screening efficiency "in relation to the additional risk for our cabin staff and customers." Despite opposition, TSA chief John Pistole said the changes will bring the United States into alignment with international rules and are in keeping with a "risk-based security" approach that will allow screeners to focus on items such as liquid explosives and improvised bombs that pose a greater threat to aircraft. The Transportation Security Administration's announcement last week that pocket knives and other previously prohibited items will be allowed in airline cabins starting in April has sparked an outcry among many concerned travelers, lawmakers and aviation professionals. A threat assessment determined that allowing small knives in cabins would not result in catastrophic damage to aircraft, the agency said. But after consulting with Federal Air Marshal Service leaders, the TSA opted to continue excluding knives that most closely resemble weapons, specifically knives with blades that lock in place, or have molded hand grips. By Monday afternoon, more than 20,000 people had signed a petition to WhiteHouse.gov calling on the TSA to keep knives off of planes.
