"The flight landed safely, and we requested paramedics meet the flight to assist a few customers who reported feeling ill," said United Airlines spokeswoman Karen May. Seven ambulances met the plane and 175 patients complaining of ear pain or nausea were checked out, according to the Chicago Fire Department. United Airlines Flight 1218 took off at 9:01 a.m., but shortly after it reached 15,000 feet, the pilot took it below 10,000 feet and returned to O'Hare International Airport, according to tracking website FlightAware.com. Passengers aboard a United Airlines flight from Chicago to Denver got sick from a cabin pressure issue that forced a quick landing, according to an airline spokeswoman. Records show it was delivered to United in March of last year. The cabin is pressurized to nearly 15 pounds per square inch, well above the normal operating levels, to confirm it properly seals.
