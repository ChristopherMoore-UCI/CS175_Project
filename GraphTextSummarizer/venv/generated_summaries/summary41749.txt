To finish off our Alaska adventure, we left Seward and drove 360 miles up to Denali National Park, home of the tallest peak in North America, Mount McKinley. Like fishing for king salmon on the Kenai River, or watching the northern lights while relaxing in natural hot springs, or downhill skiing in Hatcher Pass, or sailing along the Inside Passage, or panning for gold in the Tanana Valley, or ... For those looking for more elevation, Chugach State Park is just east of the city and has several trails. From there, we spent a day hiking alongside Exit Glacier in Kenai Fjords National Park. On our bus ride we saw bears, mountain goats, moose and coyotes.
