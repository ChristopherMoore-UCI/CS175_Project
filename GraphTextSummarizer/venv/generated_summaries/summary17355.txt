The Canadian coast guard began ferrying passengers on Sunday from a cruise ship that ran aground on an unmapped rock. The crew failed to dislodge the ship during high tide on Saturday, while Sunday, a coast guard icebreaker arrived to transport the people on board to land. No one of the estimated 128 passengers and 69 crew members were hurt or injured, said Theresa Nichols, a spokeswoman with the Canadian coast guard. The passengers are being taken to Kugluktuk, a small town on the shore of the Arctic Ocean, where accommodations have been arranged by the cruise ship company, said Nichols. "Weather remains favourable as passengers continue to enjoy onboard programming and hospitality," the company said in a statement.
