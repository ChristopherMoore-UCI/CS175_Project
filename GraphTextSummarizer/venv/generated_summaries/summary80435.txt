-- Indiana Gov. Mike Pence met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday, as part of a nine-day trip to the nation that's sure to set tongues wagging about his plans for the 2016 presidential race. South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, another Republican who has left the door open to 2016, visited Israel this weekend, physician Ben Carson was there last week and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, also contemplating a run, is planning another trip there in February. Netanyahu's Twitter account sent out a quick clip of the two during their meeting Monday in which Pence expressed support for Israel, and said he believes "the strong and broad and bipartisan support for the state of Israel...will be reflected in the decisions our United States Congress makes in the months ahead. " The meeting was part of a busy day in Israel for Pence, which included stops at a Holocaust memorial and a meeting with the Israeli minister of economy. Pence's office said Pence and his wife's expenses during the cultural visits are being paid for by Christians United for Israel, and the economic development portion of the trip is being covered by the Indiana Economic Development Foundation.
