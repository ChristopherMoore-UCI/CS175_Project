Early data shows space shuttle Atlantis, poised for launch Friday, escaped damage from two lightning strikes Thursday afternoon, NASA said. Currently, the launch time of 11:26 a.m. Friday remains unchanged, despite only a 30% chance of favorable weather, according to NASA. Ahead of that, engineers will determine whether the lightning affected systems, the external tank, main engines or other components. On board will be a four-person, veteran crew of astronauts, headed to the international space station with a load of supplies. One bolt emanating from a severe thunderstorm struck a water tower 515 feet from the pad; the second struck the beach nearby, the space agency said in a statement.
