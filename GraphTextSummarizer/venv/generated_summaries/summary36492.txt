In a statement posted on The Harvard Crimson -- the Website for the daily newspaper at Harvard University where Bo, 24, is a graduate student -- he said he wanted to answer some of the charges leveled against him; among them that he did poorly academically, that he entered prestigious colleges because of his connections and that he drove a red Ferrari to pick up a date. Bo's 'party boy' son under scrutiny "My tuition and living expenses at Harrow School, University of Oxford and Harvard University were funded exclusively by two sources -- scholarships earned independently, and my mother's generosity from the savings she earned from her years as a successful lawyer and writer," he said. -- Bo Guagua, the son of embattled Chinese Communist cadre Bo Xilai, has issued a statement defending his actions and his academic record following allegations his college "party boy" image had contributed to his father's fall from grace. Photographs of a bare-chested Bo at college balls had presented a "party boy" image, but he defended his attendance at the functions as a normal part of college life. Bo also defended his academic record, saying that he had gained straight As in his school A-level exams when he was 18 and gained a 2:1 (second class, first honors) in Politics, Philosophy and Economics at Oxford University in England.
