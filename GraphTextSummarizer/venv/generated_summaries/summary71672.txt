It's not the best opportunity to grade yourself," said fourth seed Williams, who also beat 2008 U.S. Open girls' champion Vandeweghe in the final of the Stanford tournament in July before heading back to Wimbledon for London 2012. Wimbledon and Olympic champion Serena Williams defied windy conditions to thrash fellow American Coco Vandeweghe 6-1 6-1 in just 55 minutes on Tuesday to set up a match against experienced Spaniard Maria Jose Martinez Sanchez. The 32-year-old, unseeded after falling to 46th in the rankings after being diagnosed an auto-immune disease this time last year, began her bid by beating compatriot Bethanie Mattek-Sands 6-3 6-1. She will next play 58th-ranked Spaniard Silvia Soler-Espinosa, who reached the third round last year. The Williams sisters cruised into the second round of the U.S. Open but their fellow former world No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki became the highest-profile casualty of the women's draw in New York.
