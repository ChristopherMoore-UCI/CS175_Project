Kimberly Ann Crain, who taught third grade in McLoud Public Schools, faces 23 criminal counts, including manufacturing and possessing juvenile pornography, distribution of juvenile pornography and lewd molestation, according to a Thursday filing in Pottawatomie County district court. A search Thursday of Doby's home yielded a computer "among other questionable items," the FBI said.
