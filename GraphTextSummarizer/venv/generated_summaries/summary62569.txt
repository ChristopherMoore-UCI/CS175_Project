The hearing was postponed last week because Van der Sloot did not have legal representation. "It was a very tough moment," he told CNN June 8 shortly after leaving a courtroom inside the prison, noting that it seemed Van der Sloot was enjoying many privileges. His daughter was found dead in a Lima hotel room registered to Van der Sloot in May 2010. Police say Van der Sloot took money and bank cards from her wallet and fled to Chile, where he was arrested a few days later. "For the Van der Sloot case, we may be looking at five to seven sessions for the oral proceedings, one session per week approximately," said Giovanna Gismondi, an expert on the Peruvian criminal legal system now teaching international relations at the University of Oklahoma.
