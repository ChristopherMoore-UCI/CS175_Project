Acknowledging Hawaii's long odds to win the selection process, Ige and Caldwell are both suggesting an alternative proposal of splitting Obama's post-presidential home, with the official library in either Chicago or New York and a separate presidential center in Honolulu. "I would just note that the President chooses to spend his winters in Honolulu, not Chicago," said Hawaii's recently elected Gov. David Ige, who touted the islands' appeal as the First Family's annual refuge during the holiday season. Add to that the state's large Asian-American population, and a Hawaii presidential library would neatly reflect Obama's goal of pivoting U.S. foreign policy to Asia, Ige argued. Still, Ige acknowledged his state is an underdog in its competition with the three other remaining proposed bids to win the multimillion dollar project: two in Chicago and one in New York. Presidential libraries are intended for researchers and historians, not foreign tourists and families on vacation, a source close to Hawaii's bid conceded.
