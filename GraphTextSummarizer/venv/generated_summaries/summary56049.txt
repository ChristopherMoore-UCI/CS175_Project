Obama held what has been dubbed an "urban economy summit" in the Oval Office with a group including the Rev. Al Sharpton, NAACP President Benjamin Jealous, and National Urban League President Marc Morial. Expand the small business administration's Community Express Loan Program; • Provide a stronger focus on communities with high unemployment; • Invest $500 million for housing counselors to work with people who are delinquent on loans; • Expand summer youth jobs programs by investing up to $7 billion to employ 5 million teenagers; • Create 100 "urban job academies" to train the chronically unemployed. The thorny intersection of race and the economy topped the political agenda Wednesday as President Obama huddled with key African-American leaders at the White House. The cornerstone of the civil rights leaders' plan calls for $150 billion in TARP (Troubled Asset Relief Program) funds to be redirected to state and local governments to hire workers to provide critical services in underserved communities. The group urged Obama to spend money initially reserved for bank bailouts on areas suffering from chronically high unemployment, according to sources familiar with the attendees' plans.
