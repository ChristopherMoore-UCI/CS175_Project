Lorenzen Wright, 34, who played 13 seasons in the NBA, has not been seen or heard from since July 18 when he visited his ex-wife and their children in Collierville, near Memphis Collierville police spokesman Mark Heuberger told CNN that Wright's mother reported him missing on July 22. "A red flag has not come up yet, at least (as) of today, that suggests any harm has come to him," Heuberger said Tuesday "Our detectives have talked to a lot of people -- former coaches, players, sports agents -- and continue to follow leads given by the public," Heuberger said, "and we're working very close to the family." He played with the Los Angeles Clippers, Atlanta Hawks, Memphis Grizzlies and Sacramento Kings. Wright, who has six children, completed his degree at the University of Memphis in 2003, according to the official NBA website.
