Hamilton started the race 20th on the grid, having crashed out in qualifying with a brake problem, but fought his way back to claim a third-place finish, behind winner and fellow Mercedes driver Nico Rosberg and runner-up Valtteri Bottas. " Hamilton is now 14 points behind Mercedes teammate Rosberg at the top of the drivers' standings after the German won his home race. However, after having time to review the race later that night, Button was keen to stress that his criticism in the heat of the moment had been unfair on his former McLaren teammate. -- Jenson Button may have hit out at Lewis Hamilton after Sunday's German Grand Prix, but he admitted to overreacting following the former teammates' collision at Hockenheim. Hamilton's drive, though, was halted after he damaged his front wing when attempting to pass Button's McLaren on lap 30.
