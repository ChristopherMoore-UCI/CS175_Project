-- Sweden's royals will soon be welcoming an American into the family, after the royal court announced Thursday the engagement of Princess Madeleine and Christopher O'Neill, a wealthy New York financier. Madeleine reportedly moved to New York in 2010 to get over her split from ex-fiance Jonas Bergstrom, which came just two months before her sister's wedding. Love struck quicker for O'Neill, who said that "from the very outset, I immediately felt something special with Madeleine." Princess Madeleine said the proposal, earlier this month, had been "very romantic and intimate" but that they wanted to keep the details to themselves. The couple, who live in New York, met through mutual friends, Madeleine said, in an interview released by the royal court along with the engagement announcement. The couple will remain in New York for the time being but have not ruled out a move to Sweden in future.
