Noriega and his attorneys had argued that the United States was violating the Geneva Convention by not sending him back to Panama, where he was seized by U.S. troops after the United States invaded that country in 1989. "I received high praise from the U.S., Interpol and other countries who all benefited from my fight against drugs," Noriega said. Noriega, who has been a prisoner since being toppled in a U.S. invasion more than 20 years ago, was also fined 2.2 million euros ($2.7 million), the amount he was accused of laundering in drug trafficking profits through French banks. But another lawyer, Antonin Levy, said Noriega would get credit for the 32 months he served in a U.S. prison during a court fight over his extradition to France to face the charges. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton cleared the way for Noriega to be sent to France in April after he spent more than 20 years in a U.S. federal prison.
