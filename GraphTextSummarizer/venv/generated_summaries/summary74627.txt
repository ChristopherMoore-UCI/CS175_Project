This is because Americans understand that every additional penny that goes into the pockets of low-wage workers is invested back into the economy right away to pay for basic necessities, such as groceries, medicine, gas and transportation costs, resulting in a ripple effect that benefits the economy, boosts consumer demand and creates new jobs. Walmart, the nation's largest private employer, announced last week that it will raise the wages of approximately 500,000 of its employees by lifting its base wage to $10 by 2016 for current workers (and to the same rate for new hires after six months training). To be sure, Walmart's announcement is an impressive development in the fight for better wages, not only because the retail powerhouse has earned a reputation for paying some of the lowest wages in the industry, but most importantly, because it was forced to make the change by its own workers. Their efforts are now starting to pay off, and no doubt, Walmart workers' success will serve as an inspiration to millions of other low-wage workers nationwide, making similar demands in the retail, restaurant and health care industries. Until they do, Walmart workers will keep up their fight -- emboldened by a major breakthrough that few thought was possible.
