Between 3,500 and 5,000 barrels of heavy crude leaked from a ruptured pipeline -- not 12,000 barrels, as previously reported, according to Exxon Mobil spokesman Alan Jeffers. "If you have been harmed by this spill then we're going to look at how to make that right," Exxon Mobil Pipeline Co. President Gary Pruessing told them. McDaniel said Tuesday he asked Exxon Mobil, the owner of the 60-year-old pipeline, to preserve all documents and information related to the spill and cleanup efforts. -- Exxon Mobil will pay all of the costs related to last week's oil spill in an Arkansas neighborhood, a company spokesman said Wednesday. Exxon Mobil met with displaced residents over the weekend to explain how they can make claims for losses.
