He stood by his position that condom distribution was not the answer to the AIDS epidemic, which could only really be dealt with by fidelity in marriage and chastity outside of it. When the pope commented during his African journey last year that condoms were not the solution to AIDS in Africa, he was seen to be just giving the same old knee-jerk Catholic moral response, so out of touch with reality. Yet for many, that big public "no" made them hesitate to engage in such conversations, and the Catholic Church has not shown itself adept at handling the public debate about condoms and HIV. However, he surprised many people by acknowledging that were a prostitute to use a condom to prevent infection, that should be seen as a step toward greater moral responsibility. People have presumed that in its condemnation of condom use, the Catholic Church is somehow encouraging irresponsible, unprotected sex.
