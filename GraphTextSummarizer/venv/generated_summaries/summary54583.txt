England, looking to win the four-match series by two clear wins to overtake India as world number one in Tests, were further boosted when India's leading strike bowler Zaheer Khan did not come out for the start of their second knock. His 33rd hundred in 154 Tests and fifth against England helped India avoid the follow on. Dravid reached his first Test century at the home of cricket, while Tendulkar made 34 as he bid for his 100th century in Tests. Despite their efforts, India were bowled out for 286 and England had extended their lead to 193 by the close of the third day, having reached five without loss in their second innings. It was Rahul Dravid, not Indian teammate Sachin Tenduklar, that claimed the batting honors Saturday, but England remained in charge of the first Test at Lord's.
