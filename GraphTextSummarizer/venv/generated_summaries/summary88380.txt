"(The law has) diminished access to and quality of education for many of Alabama's Hispanic children, resulted in missed school days, chilled or prevented the participation of parents in their children's education, and transformed the climates of some schools into less safe and welcoming spaces for Hispanic children," wrote Assistant Attorney General Thomas Perez, head of the federal department's Civil Rights Division. And many of those of Hispanic origin feel "unwelcome in schools they had attended for years," he added, basing these comments on interviews with students, parents, teachers and administrators. He points to data provided by Alabama officials that, he says, shows that "Hispanic students absence rates tripled while absence rates for other groups of students remained virtually flat." " Perez also writes that "the rate of total withdrawals of Hispanic children substantially increased," with 13.4% of such children having dropped out between the beginning of the current school year and this February. Notably, the Alabama law as written allows students to be questioned on their immigration status, though this information was not intended to deny them enrollment in public schools.
