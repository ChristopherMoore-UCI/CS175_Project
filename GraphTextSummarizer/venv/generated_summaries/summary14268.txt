After days on the Internet and hours reaching out to reconstructive specialists in the United States, Pippi's mother discovered Genzyme, whose specialty is growing layers of human skin by cloning a 2-square-centimeter sample from a patient. But the Krugers were uncomfortable with their options for healing her skin: temporarily using skin from a cadaver or from a pig, or taking her small portion of undamaged skin and grafting it elsewhere. While complications and other setbacks remain a possibility, Rabie said Pippi could be well enough to begin physical therapy and rehabilitation by next week. A medical team led by reconstructive surgeon Ridwan Mia spent four hours Monday night removing wrappings from Isabella "Pippi" Kruger's body, according to spokeswoman Ilze Rabie. She screamed as her skin burned and "bubbled," according to her mother, Anice Kruger.
