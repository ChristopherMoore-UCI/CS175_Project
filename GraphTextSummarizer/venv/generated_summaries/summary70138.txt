The four others were killed in greater Yuma County, where the other person was injured, according to Yuma Police Officer Cruz Vidal. Around 11:30 a.m., Yuma County sheriff's deputies found Dyess dead off U.S. Highway 95 in Blaisdell, a community east of Yuma. According to Yuma police, an "elderly male" went into a business in the city limits and shot an adult male. Yuma is a city of more than 87,000 people, according to a 2006 U.S. Census Bureau estimate, out of nearly 200,000 people in the county. Police determined that these shootings were linked and identified the suspect as Carey Hal Dyess, a 73-year-old Yuma man.
