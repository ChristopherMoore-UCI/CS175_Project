The collegiate society has existed since 1832 and has prominent alumni such as former President George W. Bush and his grandfather, Sen. Prescott Bush. The skull, crossbones and accompanying book of Skull and Bones members between 1832 and 1877 were "withdrawn from sale due to a title claim," Christie's said in a statement Friday. This isn't the first time Skull and Bones has been entangled in a debate over human remains. Earlier this month, the World Archaeological Congress condemned the sale, calling the sale of human body parts an "affront to human dignity." Yale University's secret Order of Skull and Bones used the skull and crossbones as a ballot box, Christie's said in its advertisement of the item in an auction catalogue.
