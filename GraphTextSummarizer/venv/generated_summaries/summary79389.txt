-- EasyJet's no-frills aircraft seem an unlikely choice for cabin connoisseurs, but the airline says its customers do have preferences. It says window seats are generally the most coveted, with 59% preferring to gawp out of a lightly frosted lozenge of perspex than confront the reality of flying super economy. EasyJet says seventh row seats on its short haul routes are typically offered at rock-bottom rates of just a few dollars, hence their popularity. EasyJet notably introduced selective seating for all passengers only two years ago. See-through cabins and passenger pods: Is this the future of flight?
