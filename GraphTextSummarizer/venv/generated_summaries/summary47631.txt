Tim was going to recreate a machine like that and with no experience or talent for oil painting, Tim was going to try to do his own Vermeer. Tim figured that Vermeer had used a machine and a lot of hard work. Tim would first have to tear down the wall of his warehouse in Texas to put in windows for the proper light, build all the furniture himself to recreate Vermeer's room from the 17th Century, grind his own lenses, grind his own 17th century style pigments (many of which are illegal today because they're so poisonous), mix his own paint and after all that and more, then he could start the backbreaking and mind-numbing work of painting with his machine. Tim reckoned that Vermeer didn't just get a perfect photorealistic image in his head and move it to the canvas with a steady handful of talent. It had The Beatles trying different tempos, different lyrics and different ideas.
