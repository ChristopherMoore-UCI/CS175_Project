The separation of mother and son began when the estranged husband took the boy from the care of his mother's sister on what seemed like a routine outing, Amaya said. Amaya said she is planning to travel from her Wisconsin home to San Diego to see her son in person on November 24. Now that she knows her son's whereabouts, they have been exchanging chat messages on Facebook, with a San Diego church pastor helping translate David Amaya's messages into English and then translating the mother's responses into Spanish, the mother said. Amaya had spent years searching for her son on the Internet and on Facebook. Hearing her son's voice for the first time in 35 years -- though it was in the background -- was "very emotional," Amaya said.
