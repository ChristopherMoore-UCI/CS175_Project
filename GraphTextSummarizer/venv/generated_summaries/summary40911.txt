Kenneth Bae, who has been jailed in North Korea for 15 months, told reporters there that he committed a "serious crime" in the secretive nation and that he had not experienced abusive treatment by the regime. "He's not my usual son, kind of different," Myunghee Bae, mother of Kenneth Bae, told CNN's Chris Cuomo on Wednesday. In his remarks, Kenneth Bae asked the U.S. government, the media and his family to not make things worse by spreading "vile rumors" about North Korea. " Bae, of Lynwood, Washington, was arrested in November 2012 in Rason, along North Korea's northeastern coast. The imprisoned American man who allegedly confessed to crimes in North Korea is not the same son his mother remembers.
