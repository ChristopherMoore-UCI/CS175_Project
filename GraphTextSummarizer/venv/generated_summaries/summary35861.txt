In April, Archie Comics released the news that its lead character, Archie Andrews, would die in an upcoming issue of "Life With Archie." Kevin Keller, the first openly gay character in Archie Comics history, is a senator in the "Life With Archie" universe, and he's in favor of gun control. "Archie died as he lived -- a hero, representing the best in all of us," Archie Comics CEO Jon Goldwater said in a news release. The main Archie line, however, telling stories of Archie in high school, will continue. The story won't affect the overall Archie storylines, as "Life With Archie" takes place in an alternate timeline.
