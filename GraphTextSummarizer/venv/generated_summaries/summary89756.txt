London's The Independent newspaper reports that the imam told fellow Muslims: "Terrorism is terrorism, violence is violence and it has no place in Islamic teaching and no justification can be provided for it, or any kind of excuses of ifs and buts. The Independent: Sheikh issues fatwa against all terrorists Minhaj-ul-Quran: Profile of Dr. Qadri Diane Ravitch: The influential education historian, who served as assistant secretary of education under President George H. W. Bush, "is in the final stages of an astonishing, slow motion about-face on almost every stand she once took on American schooling," reports Sam Dillon in today's New York Times. Qadri said his aim was to set an important precedent that might allow other scholars to similarly condemn the ideas behind terrorism. The world needs an absolute, unconditional, unqualified and total condemnation of terrorism." The 600-page fatwa is arguably the most comprehensive theological refutation of Islamist terrorism to date.
