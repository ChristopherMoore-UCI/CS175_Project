Elgin Baylor on Sterling: 'Justice has been served' Shelly Sterling approves NBA plan for new Clippers CEO NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has asked the other 29 NBA owners to force Sterling, the longest-tenured owner in the league, to sell the Clippers. A family trust owns the Clippers, and his wife, Shelly Sterling, has indicated that she is a co-owner and wants to keep the team. Donald Sterling, a lawyer and billionaire real-estate investor, has not spoken publicly since the celebrity gossip website TMZ posted a 10-minute audio recording in which he chastises a woman for posting pictures on Instagram in which she poses with African-Americans, including basketball Hall of Famer Magic Johnson. On Tuesday, one of Sterling's longtime friends, former Los Angeles Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda, said the remarks were not surprising.
