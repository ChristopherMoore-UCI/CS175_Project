Knight said immediately after she paid for the iPad, she received e-mail confirmations from both PayPal and Sears. "They want to blame a third party, but the order confirmation e-mail I got was from Sears." "We want you to know that, unfortunately, today one of the Marketplace third party sellers told us that they mistakenly posted incorrect pricing information on two Apple iPad models on the Marketplace portion of the website. About six hours later, Sears sent her an e-mail to tell her that her order was canceled because of the mistake. Friday night, Sears posted a statement online telling customers the error was made by a third-party vendor and the deal will not be honored.
