Note: An earlier version of this article incorrectly said that President Obama was the first Democratic president to propose changes to reduce future Social Security benefits. His new budget, which proposes a method of calculating inflation that will reduce increases in Social Security payments, is a doozy. Yet the Obama budget eliminates the recent automatic cuts to the Pentagon budget, even as it cuts Social Security and increases Medicare premiums for middle-class seniors. Under his plan, as food and medicine gets more expensive, your Social Security check would grow only a tiny bit. On Tuesday, they presented the signatures of more than 2 million Americans opposed to cutting Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid benefits.
