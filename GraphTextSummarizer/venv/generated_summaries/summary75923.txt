As of Saturday, Texas Forest Service personnel were responding to at least 14,758 acres of new fires -- five of them major -- that broke out during the day. "With the winds that we've got today, it's hard to be aggressive with any suppression activities; it's just too dangerous to get in front of that type of fire," Texas Forest Service spokesman Marq Webb told CNN affiliate WFAA. Strawn's population of 764, the forest agency said, is endangered by a fire fanned by strong winds and fueled by "extremely dry" conditions in north central Texas. The forest service update, posted online at 4:19 p.m. Sunday, said "extreme fire behavior is being exhibited," though no additional information was immediately available. A blend of potent winds, dense growth of flammable material and low humidity have made this a challenging season for firefighters in the state, with 195 Texas counties banning any burning in a bid to prevent more blazes.
