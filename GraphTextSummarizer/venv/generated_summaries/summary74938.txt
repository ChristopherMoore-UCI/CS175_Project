Bullock apparently fled 45 minutes from the parish to a family member's house in Freed's car, police told CNN. Just a few days ago, the priest sent a note to his parishioners, thanking them for their support and prayers and wishing them a merry Christmas and happy New Year. It was mere hours before the slaying of the Rev. Eric Freed that an odd-acting Gary Lee Bullock had been in custody for public intoxication. " "Eric knew as well as anybody just how senseless violence could be," said William Herbrechtsmeier, a professor at Humboldt State University, where Freed was a lecturer. Freed had been part of the greater Santa Rosa diocese since 1999, establishing himself as a "great preacher" and an engaging teacher from his work in Catholic schools, said Msgr.
