It's a story you'd never see on Facebook.com, he argued, since pretty much all the status updates and photos he'd posted over the years were hidden beneath a gray button at the bottom of the page: "Older Posts." "All of the stories you've shared over time just fall off a cliff at the bottom of your (Facebook) wall and effectively disappear," company CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on stage at an event for Facebook app developers in San Francisco, where this story was retold. Bill Barol at Forbes wrote that Facebook users should be skeptical of this concept: "The news isn't that Facebook has figured out a new way to package your life and present it back to you," he wrote. Anyone who has friends of a child-bearing age likely realizes that many kids already have Facebook pages almost from birth -- or, at the very least, their early lives are detailed on their parents' pages. In the coming weeks, Facebook is going to start replacing peoples' profile pages with a new blog-like template, where photos and check-ins and status updates are strung along the backbone of chronology -- days, months and, here's the big leap, years. Timelines, which highlight all of a Facebook user's years, may make this even more apparent.
