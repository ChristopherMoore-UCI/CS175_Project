As President Obama continues to push for new gun control measures, new FBI data shows that January was the second-highest month on record for gun background checks. The figures typically show high numbers of background checks during the holiday shopping months of November and December, and the background check numbers usually decline in January. Federal law does not require background checks for "private transactions," such as sales between hunters. There also is often a spike in checks after a dramatic incident of gun violence. Many states have their own statutes requiring such checks for private sales.
