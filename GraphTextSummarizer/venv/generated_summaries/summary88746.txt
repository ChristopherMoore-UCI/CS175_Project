They raced to embrace life just like they raced (to) the fight against ... the raging fire on Yarnell Hill." Biden and other dignitaries -- including Gov. Jan Brewer and the state's U.S. Sens. John McCain and Jeff Flake -- joined relatives and a grieving community for the memorial, which paid tribute to the 19 elite firefighters who were overcome by a raging inferno on June 30. The 19 firefighters were Andrew Ashcraft, 29; Robert Caldwell, 23; Travis Carter, 31; Dustin Deford, 24; Christopher MacKenzie, 30; Eric Marsh, 43; Grant McKee, 21; Sean Misner, 26; Scott Norris, 28; Wade Parker, 22; John Percin, 24; Anthony Rose, 23; Jesse Steed, 36; Joe Thurston, 32; Travis Turbyfill, 27; William Warneke, 25; Clayton Whitted, 28; Kevin Woyjeck, 21; and Garret Zuppiger, 27. The 19 firefighters killed while battling an Arizona wildfire last month understood what few did, Vice President Joe Biden told thousands who attended their memorial Tuesday. Officials have said it appears the 19 were forced to lie down under fire shelters, blankets meant to protect against flames and heat, as a last resort after the fire suddenly changed directions. Opinion: When heroes face down fire -- and fate "These men were some of the strongest, most disciplined, tenacious, physically fit men in the world -- an elite unit in every sense of that phrase," Biden said.
