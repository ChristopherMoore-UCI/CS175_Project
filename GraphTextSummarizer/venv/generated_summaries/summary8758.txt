Last October, the World Health Organization (WHO) officially declared air pollution to be a carcinogen, connecting it directly to lung cancer as well as bladder cancer. Air pollution remains stubbornly difficult to eliminate, in part because of the vagary of the wind itself, which separates the victims of pollution from its source. And bad air doesn't just hurt the lungs â€” a raft of studies have connected air pollution, especially soot, to cardiovascular disease, even triggering heart attacks. Rising levels of ozone pollution have been linked to warmer temperatures, which will make it that much tougher to fight smog in the future. According to a new report from the American Lung Association (ALA), nearly 148 million Americans live in areas where smog and soot particles have led to unhealthy levels of pollution.
