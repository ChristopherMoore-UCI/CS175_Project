The U.S. military held a "Day of Reflection" on Friday for troops in Japan after allegations that two U.S. service members committed sexual assaults on the southern island of Okinawa. She said reported sexual assaults committed by U.S. servicemen on Okinawa have continued despite years of promises to prevent them. "As responsible members of the Japanese community, and consistent with the values of our military, we will continue to do everything possible to prevent incidents," said Lt. Gen. Bruce A. Wright, commander of the U.S. forces in Japan. "We take this allegation very seriously and the Army does not tolerate sexual assault." U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Christopher Hill met Thursday with Japan's foreign minister and expressed regret over the recent incidents. Japanese Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda has condemned the incident as "unforgivable," and the allegation prompted the U.S. military in Japan to form a sexual assault prevention task force.
