According to Saudi human rights activists, this latest demonstration was the result of growing anger over the arrest of dozens of female protesters in Buraida earlier in the week. -- About 160 people were arrested by Saudi security forces early Friday morning in Buraida for unlawfully protesting outside that city's Bureau of Investigation and Prosecution, according to the Saudi Press Agency. "And we're demanding the ouster of Interior Minister Mohammed Bin Nayef." After spending the night on the scene, Saudi human rights activists say the women and their children were arrested late Tuesday evening after putting up three tents and vowing to continue their sit in. Buraida, the provincial capital of Qassim Province, is considered part of the ultraconservative heartland of Saudi Arabia. When asked in late January about demonstrators' claims that their relatives are political prisoners who should be released, Interior Ministry Spokesman Major Gen. Mansour Al-Turki told CNN that Saudi government officials would not comment on cases currently being "looked at by the courts."
