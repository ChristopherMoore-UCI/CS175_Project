It capped a fine day for jockey William Buick and trainer John Gosden, who triumphed in three of Friday's races. The Queen's filly Estimate won the Queen's Vase (Group 3) for her first Royal Ascot winner since Free Agent in 2008. In the Coronation Stakes, the day's feature race for three-year-old fillies, the pre-race trio of favorites Homecoming Queen, Laugh Out Loud and Samitar set a strong early pace. Homecoming Queen, who won the 1,000 Guineas in similar front-running style, was aiming to help Joseph O'Brien to his second win at Royal Ascot after So You Think on Wednesday. Fallen For You sprang a surprise at Royal Ascot to win the Coronation Stakes in convincing fashion from Starscope and Irish History.
