"This week, we detected unusual access patterns that led to us identifying unauthorized access attempts to Twitter user data. However the company offers tips for all of its users going forward, including using strong passwords that mix numbers and symbols with upper- and lowercase letters, not using the same password for multiple accounts, and disabling Java. The social network said in a blog post Friday afternoon that approximately 250,000 user accounts were potentially compromised, with attackers gaining access to information including user names and email addresses. The Department of Homeland Security recently warned users about the issue and suggested they disable Java in their browsers unless "it is absolutely necessary. We discovered one live attack and were able to shut it down in process moments later," said Bob Lord, Twitter's director of information security, in a post.
