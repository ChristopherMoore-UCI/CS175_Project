"What Rony and the Magic Leap team have created is nothing short of remarkable and will forever change the way we interact with images and information," a member of the startup's board of directors and co-founder of special-effects and props company Weta Workshop. Magic Leap is making "what we believe will be the most natural and human-friendly wearable computing interface in the world," said CEO Rony Abovitz in a written release from February, when the company secured $50 million in investments. On the website's "Team" page, where most startups brag about the experience and talent of their employees, Magic Leap lists no names, just offbeat titles like "artificial intelligence gurus," "software ninjas" and "computing hobbits." Now, Google and other major tech investors are preparing to pour $500 million into the Florida-based company, according to tech blog Recode. And they're claiming that the product they're keeping tightly under wraps will trump anything that's been offered by existing companies like Oculus, the virtual-reality company Facebook bought this year for $2 billion.
