Maclaren said its Volo, Triumph, Quest Sport, Quest Mod, Techno XT, Techno XLR, Twin Triumph, Twin Techno and Easy Traveller models -- which retail between $100 to $400 -- were affected. In a separate statement, Maclaren's European arm said that no recall was being issued in the European Union, where there had been fewer reported injuries, despite higher sales. British company Maclaren said the recall concerns Chinese-made models on sale in the U.S. that open with an "umbrella" mechanism. "There are a lower number of similar reported incidents amongst the considerably higher number of Maclaren buggies sold in Europe.
