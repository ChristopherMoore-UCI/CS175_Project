The United States didn't adopt the practice until the 20th century -- for a brief time during World War I, again during World War II and on a state-by-state basis in the years after the war. The idea for daylight saving came from legendary American inventor, statesman and founding father Ben Franklin who, in a 1784 letter to a French journal, suggested that Parisians could save thousands of francs annually by waking up earlier in the summer so they wouldn't have to buy so many candles to light the evening hours. Daylight Saving Time may bring health problems All options are on the table this weekend, when U.S. residents turn back the clock as part of the semi-annual daylight saving routine. The change affects all those in the United States except for people in Hawaii and parts of Arizona who do not observe daylight saving time. Dozens of other countries now observe some form of daylight saving as well.
