A slew of studies in the past two decades has found that low-income people spend a greater portion of their income on lottery tickets than do high-income individuals, meaning lotteries are a regressive way to collect tax revenue. After lottery winnings are paid out and administrative costs have been covered, the leftover money is transferred into state coffers to pay for state programs. But people only buy government lottery tickets voluntarily because private lotteries are not allowed to operate. In 2010, states collected an average of $58 per capita in implicit tax revenue from their lottery programs. This increasing reliance on lotteries to fund state governments is troubling, as these taxes disproportionately fall on low-income individuals.
