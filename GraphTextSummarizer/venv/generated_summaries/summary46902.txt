He was serving a life sentence with the possibility of parole for killing Los Angeles Police Officer Ian Campbell nearly 50 years ago. He and Smith disarmed both officers, took them hostage and drove to a remote onion field in Bakersfield, a town about 110 miles of north of downtown Los Angeles. That law was passed after the kidnapping and murder of the young son of aviator Charles Lindbergh in 1932. On the night of March 9, 1963, Powell and accomplice Jimmy Lee Smith were driving around Los Angeles, looking for a liquor store to rob. Campbell and his partner, Officer Karl Hettinger, pulled the two over in a routine stop.
