Neurofibromatosis is a terrible thing, but with an organization like the Children's Tumor Foundation, and with people like those who make Cupid's possible, I have an unwavering belief that nothing will stop us from ending this disease. This year, Cupid's was held in 18 cities, with countless volunteers dedicating their free time. Unfortunately, my form of the genetic disorder has caused thousands of tumors throughout my body, and pain that I never thought possible. Hanrahan, his fiancee, Tamara Forys, and Bobby Gill, to name just a few, take hours and hours of their spare time to make this race work. I would never have chosen to have this disorder or to fight this fight, but it does give a unique opportunity to see the best in people.
