India blamed the attacks on the Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, a Pakistan-based terror group allied with al Qaeda. During the raids, 10 men attacked buildings including the luxury Taj Mahal Palace and Tower and Oberoi-Trident hotels, the city's Victoria Terminus train station, and the Jewish cultural center, Chabad House. Authorities said Kasab was trained by the organization, which was banned in Pakistan in 2002 after an attack on India's parliament. Their bodies were embalmed and kept in a hospital morgue as some local Muslim groups refused to bury them in their graveyards, saying the attackers were not true followers of Islam. Mohammed Ajmal Kasab, a Pakistani, was convicted on Monday of murder, conspiracy, and waging war on India.
