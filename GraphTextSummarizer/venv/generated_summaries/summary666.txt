"Due to escalating violence in central Bangkok, including gunfire near the U.S. Embassy, demonstrations in Chiang Mai, and other incidents throughout Thailand, U.S. citizens should defer all travel to Bangkok and defer all non-essential travel to the rest of Thailand," the U.S. State Department has warned. Following protests that have paralyzed parts of Bangkok for months, the army surged on Wednesday into Lumpini Park, with armored personnel carriers crushing bamboo and tire barricades, while protesters hurled M79 grenades at soldiers. As well as advising against travel to Bangkok, the United Kingdom's Foreign Office warned of protests and violent incidents in popular tourist destinations such as Pattaya, Chiang Mai, Chiang Rai and Ayutthaya. Bangkok turned into a war zone Wednesday, as Thai military forces cracked down on anti-government protesters, ending a tense standoff that has troubled the capital for weeks. The chaotic day left at least five people dead, as Bangkok residents endured an edgy and unsettled night.
