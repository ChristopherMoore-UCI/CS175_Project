" Garth Brooks hopes friends in high places can save Irish shows " Brooks promised to announce a world tour on July 14 and he hinted that the first new music under his Sony deal would be out around the end of the month. Fans have only seen him perform since then at a few benefit concerts and a weekend residency in Las Vegas. The Dublin shows had been planned for Croke Park Stadium, a football arena that can hold more than 90,000 fans, on five consecutive nights during the last week of July. The council approved Friday, Saturday and Sunday shows, but rejected licenses for Monday and Tuesday night concerts.
