The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention opposes malarial therapy, and many medical experts have criticized Heimlich's testing methods, including his testing on human patients. In the early 1950s, Heimlich started looking at how to help patients who had lost their ability to swallow due to a damaged esophagus. Put simply, Heimlich believes purposefully injecting patients with the deadly disease and letting it go untreated for a few weeks will strengthen patients' immune systems. Dr. Henry Heimlich says the editors told him they were considering the "Heimlich Method" or the "Heimlich Maneuver. Henry Heimlich says there have been cases where individuals used the Heimlich Maneuver to save a drowning victim or stop an asthma attack, and stands by his own studies that he says show malaria therapy has promise in improving the lives of HIV/AIDS patients.
