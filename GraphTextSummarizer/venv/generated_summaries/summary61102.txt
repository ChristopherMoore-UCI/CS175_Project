" While China's continued effort to be able to sustain military operations far from its shore are concerning to the U.S. military, "China's ability to sustain military power at a distance, today, remains limited," the report says. As in the past, the U.S. program to sell military equipment to Taiwan continues to create tension with China and has led to cessation at times of military relations between the two countries. Its naval muscle is also being flexed with additional nuclear powered submarines, and it has nearly completed a navy base on Hainan Island, "with direct access to vital international sea lanes," which will allow for "stealthy deployment of submarines," the report says. The assessment notes that China has the most active ballistic and cruise missile program in the world, including developing anti-missile technology. The Chinese could start building their first aircraft carrier this year, and China has started to train pilots to operate off such carriers.
