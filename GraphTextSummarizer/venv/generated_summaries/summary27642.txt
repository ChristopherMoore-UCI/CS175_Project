Pratt wore his Star-Lord costume to visit Boston Children's Hospital in February, and Evans donned his Captain America duds to visit Seattle Children's on Saturday, bearing gifts in the form of Marvel action figures and accessories. "Meeting Captain America and Star-Lord is an experience our patients will always remember," Seattle Children's said. "Captain America" actor Chris Evans met some "true superheroes" on Saturday at Seattle Children's Hospital in a visit with "Guardians of the Galaxy" star Chris Pratt. The superhero actors met Oskar Beechum, 7, who has been at Seattle Children's for four months for epilepsy treatment. The bet: If Pratt's team -- the Seattle Seahawks -- won the Super Bowl, Evans would visit Seattle Children's Hospital dressed as Captain America.
