-- Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev visited islands claimed by both Russia and Japan on Tuesday, provoking an angry reaction from Tokyo. Following Japan's defeat in World War II in 1945, the Soviet Union annexed the four southernmost islands, which previously belonged to Japan. He held a meeting with the governor of Sakhalin and visited Kunashir Island, which is near Japan's large northern island of Hokkaido. Ever since, the islands -- called the South Kurils by Russia and the Northern Territories by Japan -- have been the subject of dispute. Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Osamu Fujimura said Tuesday that Russia was taking the "wrong position" with the visit.
