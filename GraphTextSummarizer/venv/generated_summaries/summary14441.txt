The Venezuelan National Assembly granted El Zabayar a leave of absence to travel to Syria, and President Nicolas Maduro praises him as a hero. El Zabayar was born in Venezuela, but his parents are from Syria. El Zabayar, the Syrian-Venezuelan lawmaker, has a rather rosy view of the current situation in Syria, where a popular uprising spiraled into a civil war in 2011. In a recently published open letter to President Barack Obama, the Venezuelan leader called a possible attack against Syria "unfair, disastrous and terrifying." What makes the photo particularly striking is that the 49-year-old legislator is in Syria supporting President Bashar Al-Assad.
