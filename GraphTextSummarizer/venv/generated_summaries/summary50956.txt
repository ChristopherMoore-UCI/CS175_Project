Box office preview: 'Monsters University' eyes a monstrous debut; 'World War Z' hopes to go viral The director, Marc Forster, is a filmmaker whose work I've never particularly liked (he made the genteel "Finding Neverland," the overblown "Monster's Ball," and the Bond dud "Quantum of Solace"). "World War Z," which may be the most entertaining and accomplished zombie thriller since George A. Romero's "Dawn of the Dead" (1979), has touches of that suspenseful high-tension claustrophobia. "World War Z" is epically scaled, but it's not a messy, noisy, CGI-bogus, throw-everything-at-the-audience sort of blockbuster. "World War Z" turns the prospect of the end of our world into something tumultuous and horrifying and, at the same time, exciting. "World War Z" is rooted in the current mood of economic panic and terrorist fear and impending chaos.
