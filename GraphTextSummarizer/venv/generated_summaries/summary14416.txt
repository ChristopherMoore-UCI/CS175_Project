I examined security at a wide range of potential targets inside the United States, including chemical plants, liquefied natural gas facilities, biological research laboratories and nuclear power plants. Security at nuclear power plants is in the hands of private security companies hired to protect the facilities by the power companies that own them. Nuclear power plants were no exception. Morale among the guards at nuclear power plants is chronically low. An interest in nuclear power plants by al Qaeda or another terrorist group is not theoretical.
