A day after relaying pilots' accounts to investigators, National Transportation Safety Board Chairman Deborah Hersman provided more details Wednesday on what happened in the sky. Six of the jet's 12 flight attendants suffered injuries serious enough that they haven't been interviewed yet by investigators, Hersman said Wednesday. But they don't mean that pilots don't have a responsibility, Hersman said, noting that someone in the cockpit is typically charged with monitoring what's going on. " Co-pilots for airlines will need more training The final minutes in the air The man at the helm -- whom Hersman called the "flying pilot" and who was halfway through training on flying a 777 -- spent the day before the fatal flight at home and got about eight hours of sleep. Three flight attendants who were ejected from the plane were found on the runway too, Hersman said Wednesday.
