-- When 150,000 industry execs, entrepreneurs, salespeople, celebrities, publicists, tech reporters and hangers-on gather here for the annual Consumer Electronics Show, it's a five-day carnival -- even by Las Vegas standards. CES, the trade show that introduced the world to the VCR, the Xbox and the plasma TV, has lost some of its luster in recent years, but it's still one of the largest showcases for new gadgets and tech trends. Photographer Zoran Milich is wandering the halls of CES to capture its colorful sights for CNN. Long lines greet attendees in conference rooms, at taxi stands and at Starbucks. Crowds of laptop-toting journalists fight over precious power outlets.
