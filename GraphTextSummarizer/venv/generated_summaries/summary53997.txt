The exchange was a cold reminder of us of just how easy it is to flippantly do harm, and also of the dearth of understanding and sensitivity surrounding race and adoption I am a transracial adoptee and advocate for children and families, so the complexities of race and adoption resonate on a personal level. They are another reminder that adoptive families need to be always at the ready to support their children on matters of race and adoption. According to a 2007 National Survey of Adoptive Parents, about 40% of adoptions in America are transracial (most are international adoptions) and that number is growing. When transracial adoption is mocked, it only works to undermine the foundation adoptees and adoptive families are trying to build. Yet again, politics and race got mixed up together today, and this time with an added bonus -- adoption.
