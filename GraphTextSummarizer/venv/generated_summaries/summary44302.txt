In 2001, Cambodia passed a land law that allowed any Cambodian living peacefully on a piece of land for five years to apply for a land title. Twelve years ago, Myaeung Duong Kear bought land around Boeung Kak Lake -- a big lake in the center of Phnom Penh, now prized real estate. The Khmer Rouge regime banned private land ownership. In 2002, the World Bank undertook several land titling projects to help Cambodians obtain legal ownership of their land. When the Khmer Rouge lost power, many Cambodians resettled on plots of land wherever they could and essentially became "squatters."
