Halfway leader Mikael Lundberg of Sweden also posted a 69 to finish clear in second place, while Paraguay's Fabrizio Zanotti recorded a superb final round 66 to finish third another two shots behind the winner. Simpson, who hails from North Carolina, lies on a 15-under-par total of 195 to hold an advantage over halfway leader Tommy Gainey, who posted a 69. The victory came as something of a surprise after Fisher missed 20 of his first 21 cuts this season, although he had shown some improvement in recent events in Sweden and Ireland. Meanwhile, Webb Simpson fired a six-under-par 64 to claim a two-shot lead after three rounds of the Wyndham Championship in Greensboro, North Carolina. My form has been horrific, but golf's a funny game," Fisher told the official European Tour website.
