ISIS overruns Iraqi base The reports about the execution came as new details emerged about the killing of up to 300 Iraqi soldiers in Iraq's western Anbar province after ISIS fighters overran the base near Falluja this week. The news came as reports surfaced that ISIS fighters carried out a public execution of a well-known human rights lawyer, who took to Facebook to criticize the group's destruction of mosques, churches and shrines in Iraq. " In the latest round of strikes targeting ISIS refineries in Syria, fighter jets from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates flew alongside U.S. aircraft, hitting 12 locations, Kirby said. "As the President has said, it's going to be a long campaign, and it will be months -- perhaps years -- before ISIS is dealt a serious blow absent any sort of ground force to go in and root them out on the ground. Fighter jets carried out strikes on four ISIS warehouses near Fallujah, which were believed to house military equipment.
