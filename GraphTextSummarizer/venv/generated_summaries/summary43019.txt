-- The leader of Greece's extreme-right Golden Dawn party, Nikos Michaloliakos, is being held in custody after appearing in court Wednesday, the state-run Athens News Agency reported. Three other Golden Dawn lawmakers who have already appeared in court -- Elias Kassidiaris, Elias Panagiotaros and Nikos Mihos -- were released Wednesday pending trial. In 2012, Golden Dawn rode a wave of dissatisfaction among some Greeks -- spurred by internationally imposed austerity measures amid the country's deep financial crisis -- to win 7% of the vote and gain seats in Parliament for the first time. The singer's death has nevertheless led to renewed calls to ban Golden Dawn, which holds 18 of Parliament's 300 seats. Pavlos Fyssas, a popular anti-fascist figure and well-known hip-hop artist with the stage name Killah P, was the victim of a knife attack that was allegedly committed by a Golden Dawn supporter.
