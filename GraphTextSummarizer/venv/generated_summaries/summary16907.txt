Plus, Grassley said, "the only tool Congress has to make sure that federal judges do not abuse their discretion in sentencing too leniently is mandatory minimum sentences." In Grassley's world, the war on drugs is working and mandatory minimum laws are a tool for combating liberal activist judges. That means Grassley's been in Congress long enough to have been there when the idea of mandatory minimum sentences for federal criminal convictions was first introduced. Grassley connected America's drop in crime over the past decades partly to the use of mandatory minimum sentences. Citing a year when the number of state and federal prisoners had dropped, Grassley argued there was a corresponding rise in crime despite other contradictory evidence. But to anyone paying attention, what seems illogical is Grassley's ability to stand in the way of a strong bipartisan coalition of his colleagues and the overwhelming weight of factual evidence and public support.
