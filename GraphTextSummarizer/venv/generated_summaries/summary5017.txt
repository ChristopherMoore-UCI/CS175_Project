-- A suspect fired his gun inside the University of New Mexico Hospital in Albuquerque Tuesday, but no one was injured, the university and police said. "They confirm one person was in the hospital and shot his gun inside the hallway, but no one was injured," said Cindy Foster, a spokeswoman for the UNM Health Sciences Center. Witnesses told officers that a female patient was with her child when the woman's boyfriend entered the room, police said. Video shows the man leaving the hospital about an hour later, said police, adding that the search for the suspect continues. Police identified the apparent gunman as Cesar Dominguez-Garcia, 21.
