In the 22 years that Jay Leno hosted the "Tonight Show" -- give or take the spare months Conan O'Brien took the helm -- O.J. Simpson was the celebrity most often used as the butt of Leno's jokes. The TV veteran took aim at politicians and celebrities with equal zeal, landing family friendly barbs about Lindsay Lohan alongside wisecracks about Al Gore. Although the joke was occasionally on Leno in the press, the 63-year-old's late-night colleague, Jimmy Kimmel, made a great point with his goodbye tweet to Leno. But on Thursday, Leno departed "Tonight" with a simple, tearful farewell. (Interestingly enough, former President Bill Clinton was the biggest Leno target of all.)
