The platforms will hold spare parts to sustain station operations after the shuttles are discontinued. -- Space shuttle Atlantis launched Monday afternoon to deliver key spare parts to prolong the life of the International Space Station. The delivery will add years to the station's life after the space shuttle fleet is retired next year, according to NASA. " Some parts are for systems that keep the station from overheating or tumbling through space, according to NASA. "As the only vehicle large enough to carry many of the big pieces of equipment into space, several of the flights are devoted to the task," NASA said.
