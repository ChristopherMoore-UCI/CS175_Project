Editor's note: John Feehery has worked as a staffer for former House Speaker Dennis Hastert and other Republicans in Congress. Others will accuse me of going soft on a Democrat who quite clearly doesn't share the values of most Republicans. Unlike Rush Limbaugh, if Obama can get my 401(k) back to life, if he can get health care costs under control, if he can stop pollution, if he can get the manufacturing sector back on its feet, if he can make our country more secure while regaining for America the moral high ground, if he can find the cure for cancer and bring peace, love and understanding to the world, I am all for it. Republicans should come up with plans that insist on transformational change of the government bureaucracy, that require greater accountability from failing school districts, that target the high costs caused by frivolous medical lawsuits, that highlight job-killing union contracts and that insist on total transparency in government spending. How can I like Obama but not the Obama White House?
