-- A volcano in southwest Colombia erupted again Friday morning, raining ash on nearby residents and agricultural fields. The government's Geological and Mining Institute raised the alert level from yellow to red, and officials opened eight shelters for displaced residents. The volcano, near Colombia's border with Ecuador, previously erupted Saturday. The city of Pasto, which has about 35,000 residents and is more than 12 miles (about 20 kilometers) from the volcano's crater, received a heavy downpour of ashes Friday. The Galeras volcano, erupting here in January 2008, is considered the most active volcano in Colombia.
