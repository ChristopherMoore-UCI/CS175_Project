-- Under heavy criticism for a telling cell phone carriers to ban certain words in text messages, the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority went into damage control mode Wednesday. PTA spokesman Mohammed Younis Wednesday denied the existence of the plan, which has met with derision from mobile phone users in the country. In another conversation with CNN two days earlier, however, Younis acknowledged that the telecommunications authority had sent out a notice to carriers -- but said that the agency was giving the operators more time to come up with a shorter list. But the latest about face on text messages appears to mean the PTA will not act on the notice -- at least, any time soon. In the notice, which is available online, the PTA cited a law that bans the transmission of indecent and obscene messages.
