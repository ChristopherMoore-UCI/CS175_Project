"He was really intense and always prepared on set," said Matalon, who made the movie for a mere $10,000 as a student at New York University. " Matalon remembered the moment Gandolfini walked onto the set for the first time. "He was a great guy," said Matalon, who is an accomplished screenwriter, producer and filmmaker. Gandolfini didn't get paid for the performance in "Eddy," but he left a lasting impression on the director David Matalon. Gandolfini was 27 and working as a doorman at the time, said Matalon.
