Murder charges against an elderly woman with dementia were dropped in New Jersey Superior Court on Monday after evaluations by multiple doctors and experts determined that she was not fit to stand trial. "I think that's appropriate (that charges have been dropped)," Edwards told CNN, noting that Rosa's dementia had progressed so far that she seemed unaware of why she was in court. Rosa was diagnosed with dementia four years ago. While it is unclear what Fredricka Rosa's motive was, Edwards believes it may have been connected to abuse that Valpa Rosa reportedly inflicted on his family. Judge Terrence Cook dismissed the charges against Fredricka Rosa, 78, in Burlington Superior Court.
