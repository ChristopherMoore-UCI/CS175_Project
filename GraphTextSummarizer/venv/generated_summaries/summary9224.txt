When Miami-Dade police told Tyler Hayes Weinman someone was killing cats in the neighborhood, the 18-year-old reacted by laughing, according to a newly released arrest affidavit made public Monday. The teen answered, "They have to be either tranquilized or poisoned." Weinman came to the attention of authorities in late April, the affidavit states, as cats began to go missing in a suburban Dade County neighborhood called Whispering Pines just outside Miami, Florida. The arrest affidavit, which a judge gave prosecutors until Monday to make public, reads like a grisly horror movie and indicates Weinman was knowledgeable of and fascinated with dissection of cats. Weinman "became excited and animated" as he told the detective about cat dissection research he had discovered on the Internet, the affidavit states. -- A South Florida teenager accused of killing and mutilating 19 cats excitedly described to police how he dissected cats in class, and where to find cats for experimentation, according to police.
