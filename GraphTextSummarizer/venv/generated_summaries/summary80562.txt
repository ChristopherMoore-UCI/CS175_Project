Young grew to fame as the star of Disney's "The Famous Jett Jackson" and moved on to star in the 2004 movie "Friday Night Lights," along with roles in TV shows like "FlashForward" and "Smallville." -- Lee Thompson Young's "Rizzoli & Isles" character, Detective Barry Frost, was given an emotional farewell in Tuesday's episode. Young's Barry Frost has been written out of the show as a victim of a tragic car accident, and Tuesday's episode, appropriately titled "Goodbye," showed the rest of the cast coming to terms with their loss. Angie Harmon's character, Detective Jane Rizzoli, particularly struggled with her grief and gave a moving eulogy at Frost's memorial. The 29-year-old actor committed suicide last August, and his absence from the show has been treated with sensitivity.
