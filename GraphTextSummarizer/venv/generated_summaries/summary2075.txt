The players union's response will be led by NBA player-turned-mayor of Sacramento Kevin Johnson. The man alleged to be Sterling takes particular exception to a photo she posted to Instagram with NBA icon Earvin "Magic" Johnson. "The reported comments made by Clippers owner Donald Sterling are reprehensible and unacceptable," he said in a statement. Roeser said that Sterling is upset and apologizes for sentiments attributed to him about Earvin Johnson. We do know that the woman on the tape -- who we believe released it to TMZ -- is the defendant in a lawsuit brought by the Sterling family alleging that she embezzled more than $1.8 million, who told Mr. Sterling that she would "get even." TMZ does not say who made the recording or how the celebrity-centric website obtained it.
