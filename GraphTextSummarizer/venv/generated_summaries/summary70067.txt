Munoz told Univision he secretly recorded a meeting in 2008 with Acosta, who was then the cultural attache of the Venezuelan Embassy in Mexico. Univision interviewed a purported Mexican whistle-blower, a student at the National Autonomous University of Mexico named Juan Carlos Munoz Ledo. They called for an investigation after the Spanish-language TV channel Univision aired a documentary alleging that she was among a group of Venezuelan and Iranian diplomats who expressed interest in an offer from a group of Mexican hackers to infiltrate the websites of the White House, the FBI, the Pentagon and U.S. nuclear plants. According to a recording Univision aired as part of its report, Acosta is heard saying that she can send the information gathered by the hackers straight to Chavez. -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez said Friday that he has decided to close the country's consulate in Miami after the United States expelled a Venezuelan diplomat in the same city.
