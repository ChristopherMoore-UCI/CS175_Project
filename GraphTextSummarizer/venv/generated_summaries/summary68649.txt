In the complaint filed in Miami, Florida, Ashley Alexandra Dupre says she was vacationing in Miami Beach when she was approached by agents and representatives of the defendant, Joe Francis, and offered alcoholic drinks. " Dupre was the high-priced call girl, known as "Kristen," documented in court papers as the woman Spitzer arranged to meet at Washington's Mayflower Hotel in February. The deal fell through when Francis found he already owned video footage of Dupre. -- The call girl involved in the sex scandal with former New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer filed a lawsuit Monday suing the founder of the "Girls Gone Wild" video series for more than $10 million. But I think it's ironic that she charged Gov. Spitzer $2,000 for sex and she wants to charge me 10 million for taking some naked pictures of her," Francis told CNN.
