The U.S. Army's 3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment -- The Old Guard -- has posted watch at the Tomb of the Unknowns at Arlington National Cemetery every second of every day for more than 63 years. Members of the regiment earned new admiration this week for their unwavering dedication during Hurricane Irene. As the storm whipped the capital with driving sheets of rain, soldiers kept their vigil at the tomb, one hour at a time. " The foul-weather display even prompted some cross-service pride from George Gipson. Word of their service during the storm has prompted hundreds of comments on the regiment's Facebook page since Saturday, including plenty of "hooahs" -- the Army battle cry.
