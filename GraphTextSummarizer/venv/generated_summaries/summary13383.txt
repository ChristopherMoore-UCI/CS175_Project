"He basically lived out a fantasy I didn't know I had." Tension between airline companies, airline staff and air passengers seems to dip to new lows every year. Passengers whine about an increase of fees on such things as checked baggage, meals and use of blankets (the industry makes nearly $8 billion a year in such fees, says the U.S. Department of Transportation). Rarely does it happen, though, so when flight attendant Steven Slater lived the dream on JetBlue Flight 1052 at JFK on Monday -- yelling "it's been great!," grabbing a beer and jumping out the emergency slide into airline history -- Flight attendants don't need to be reminded their airline is struggling -- and face it, nearly all of them are -- so don't throw out the ol' "no wonder your airline is on the ropes" if they're out of cranberry juice. Keagle said attendants actually hate having to remind passengers about this.
