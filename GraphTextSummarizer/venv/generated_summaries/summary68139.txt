Competing as an amateur, Guan finished tied for 150th at last year's China Open event, which was won by South Africa's Branden Grace. From the city of Dongguan, Ye Wocheng finished two under par at the Western China qualifier to earn one of the three spots on offer for the China Open -- the tournament where Guan made his European Tour debut in April 2012. But the 12-year-old had done enough to ensure he finished third on the leaderboard behind joint winners Li Xinyang and Jin Da Xing. First there was Guan Tianlang, who at the tender age of 13 became the youngest player to participate in a European Tour event. Now 14, Guan will become the youngest player to compete in the Masters when he takes to the course at Augusta next month.
