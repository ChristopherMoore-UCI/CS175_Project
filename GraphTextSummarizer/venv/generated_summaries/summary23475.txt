The trial, now in its second week, has included prosecution testimony from a former hitman and Bulger colleague who testified that he and Bulger together carried out 11 killings. Martorano earlier testified that he, Bulger, and their associates were involved in the killing of O'Brien. Shortly after returning to Boston, Raso said, he was "asked" to team up with Bulger, Martorano and the gang, an offer Raso said he had "no choice" but to accept. " In the afternoon, the jury heard from Martorano's former bookmaker, Charles G. Raso, who testified that he paid "rent" to Bulger and his associates, including Martorano, in the amount of $1,000 a month for "law enforcement expenses," as the gang called it. He told the jury he was getting "bad vibrations" about a car that was trailing the two of them after they had met at a bar with a man described earlier in Martorano's testimony as a Bulger associate.
