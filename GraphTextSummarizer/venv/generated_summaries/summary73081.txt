After the Grand Canyon, Chicago's Willis Tower and, more recently, the Eiffel Tower in Paris installed glass walkways offering vertigo-inducing perspectives, London has followed suit. Visitors to the attraction can look down to see London's red buses and black cabs zip beneath their feet or gaze at the bridge's impressive steel latticework. Can the world get enough vertical drop views over familiar destinations? If they're lucky, or plan in advance, visitors will also get to watch the bridge being raised to allow tall shipping to pass beneath. The city's Tower Bridge, a 120-year-old crossing over the River Thames, is the latest structure to join the club with a see-through walkway that allows visitors to gaze down from 42 meters (138 feet).
