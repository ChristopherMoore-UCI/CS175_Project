"Ending a long outdated policy that stigmatized human beings and ignored modern medical information is a tremendous victory for human rights," Susan K. Dunn, legal director of the ACLU of South Carolina, said in a news release. "While the segregation of HIV-positive prisoners has long been an unnecessary and ineffective tool for preventing the transmission of HIV, it has had the profound effect of humiliating and isolating prisoners living with the disease. "Our medical staff has examined all the facets of this issue, and we believe it is safe to make a change in our current policy," department Director William Byars Jr. said. No date for the policy change is set, but officials hope it will happen in the next six months, department spokesman Clark Newsom said. The ACLU, which has campaigned to end such policies, hailed South Carolina's decision.
