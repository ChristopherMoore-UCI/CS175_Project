Last week the Electronic Privacy Information Center filed a petition with the Supreme Court asking it to stop the government's collection of telephone records of Verizon customers. In our filing with the Supreme Court, the Electronic Privacy Information Center asked a simple question that we hope the Court will answer: Is it legal for the government to collect so much information about so many people suspected of no threat to national security? They point out that the Supreme Court prefers hearing disputes after the issues have been considered by lower courts. They didn't, so we turned to the one Court that has the ultimate authority to say what the law allows. We anticipate that the Court will consider our arguments when it returns in early October.
