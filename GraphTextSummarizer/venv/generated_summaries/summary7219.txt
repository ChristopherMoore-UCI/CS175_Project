-- Government prosecutors have released a series of new photographs showing cash, weapons and even a grenade recovered from the Santa Monica, California, apartment where fugitive James "Whitey" Bulger and his long-time companion, Catherine Greig, apparently lived for 15 years while he was being hunted by the FBI. FBI Agent Michael Carazza testified that agents found 30 weapons inside the apartment, some of them hidden behind living room and bathroom walls. Bulger and Greig were known in Santa Monica as Charles and Carol Gasko. The evidence photographs show several handguns, one automatic rifle and a hand grenade the FBI says was recovered after it arrested Bulger in late June at the small apartment only a few blocks from the beach. The detention hearing was to determine whether Greig will be granted bail on charges of harboring a fugitive.
