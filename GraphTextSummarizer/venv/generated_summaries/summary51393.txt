They believe this land, Syria, is where God's judgment will come to pass." Read more: Syrian rebels using satire as a weapon Repeatedly, we heard the claim that this jihad -- the radical Islamists' fight against the Assad regime and, increasingly, in favour of the creation of an Islamic caliphate in Northern Syria, held formerly by chaotic but moderate rebels -- is a final calling. Turkey now has to reconcile the seemingly relaxed traffic of jihadis into their south to travel into Syria -- many of whose aim is to help establish an al Qaeda-friendly caliphate -- with the fact they can now see al Qaeda from their border. It's an odd experience flying in to Hatay, southern Turkey, on the border with Syria and its nasty and seemingly infinite war these days: there is a truly international flavor to the passenger manifests. One key group, Jabhat al-Nusra, was declared a terrorist organization by the U.S. in 2012, and now, as if to validate the Assad regime's earlier fiction, ISIS has become perhaps the pre-eminent group inside northern rebel-held Syria. It's not a crime to travel to southern Turkey, and there are many foreign aid groups here, so surely many people are traveling innocently.
