In recent weeks, throngs have taken to the streets nationwide after grand juries decided not to indict white police officers in the deaths of Michael Brown near St. Louis and Eric Garner in New York City. Jeff Roorda of the St. Louis Police Officers Association fired back, saying, "The U.S. Department of Justice has consistently described demonstrations where police officers were shot at and police had Molotov cocktails thrown at them as constitutional, protected free speech, but police officers are apparently not allowed to exercise their constitutional rights to express their support for a fellow police officer exonerated of wrong doing. In New York City, the Patrolman's Benevolent Association sent a form for members to sign and return to their PBA delegate requesting the mayor not attend their funeral if the officer is killed in the line of duty because of the mayor's "consistent refusal to show police officers the support and respect they deserve." The mayor and the speaker both know better than to think this inappropriate stunt represents the views of the majority of police officers and their families." A St. Louis police officer will be disciplined because he showed up at City Hall with a "Wilson" badge on his right arm, police spokesman Schron Jackson said.
