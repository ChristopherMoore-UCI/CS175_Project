The Atlantic agrees, dismissing "Britney Jean" as Spears' "most disappointing release yet, a snoozefest of shallow mid-tempos and limp club tracks that chase trends rather than invent them. That said, if you're a fan of post-2007 Spears, which includes the smash album "Blackout," then "Britney Jean" might be your cup of dance-pop tea. Rolling Stone gave Spears' effort three-and-a-half stars, appraising "Britney Jean" as continuing "the roll she's been on in recent years. As early reactions indicated, "Britney Jean" isn't quite as warm and inviting as Spears has made it sound. And the glimpses into Britney Jean Spears, the artist, are, frankly, neither interesting nor informative."
