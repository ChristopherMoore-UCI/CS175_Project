-- Europe's largest powers appeared Wednesday to be united in their goal of removing al Qaeda-linked militants from the West African nation of Mali, where Islamist rebels are fighting to overthrow Mali's government. The fighting has spurred the U.N High Commissioner for Refugees to prepare for a possible flow of refugees from Mali into neighboring countries of Niger, Mauritania and Burkina Faso. Italy said it is "ready for a logistical support operation" in Mali, Foreign Minister Giulio Terzi told a senate hearing on international missions Wednesday. Hollande has said France had three aims: stopping the "terrorist aggression" from the north; securing Bamako and safeguarding French nationals there; and enabling Mali to recover its territorial integrity. Fatou Bensouda said Mali's government asked the U.N. tribunal to investigate in July, after Islamists had taken control of much of the country.
