The storm previously known as Hurricane Igor sped past Newfoundland Tuesday, leaving behind downed trees, washed out roads and a desperate search for a missing elderly man. A gust of 90 mph (144 kph) was reported at Bonavista, Newfoundland, according to the Miami, Florida-based National Hurricane Center. Large swells associated with Igor are expected to affect the U.S. East Coast through Tuesday and the southern coastlines of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland for the next couple of days, the Hurricane Center said. It is expected to turn north-northeast and then north and to slow Tuesday night and Wednesday before heading northwest toward Baffin island. A hurricane watch remained in effect for the Newfoundland coast from Stones Cove to Fogo Island, and a tropical storm warning was in effect for the entirety of the coast.
