For the move towards private education in China not only reflects the aspirations of China's growing middle class but also a growing dissatisfaction with China's often tradition-bound curriculum.

Many education companies are publicly-listed companies and a new boom in online education is expected over the next three years, according to a report by Deloitte. For those that miss out on their gaokao, the years of tutoring and months of cramming could mean relegation to a provincial university and the oblivion of a major city "ant colony" -- the shared dormitory accommodation that awaits graduates trying to find work in China's urban centers. "The elite are looking at other options and that includes sending their children to private schools in China and also sending them to English-speaking schools, in particular boarding schools in Britain which have a very good reputation in China."
