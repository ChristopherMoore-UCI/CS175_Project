Group seeks investigation into Todashev's death Photographs of his son's body show that he was shot seven times, once to the head, said Abdulbaki Todashev. Ibragim Todashev was fatally shot early May 22 during questioning about a 2011 triple homicide in Waltham, Massachusetts, as well as his relationship with deceased Boston Marathon bombings suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev. " Official: Tamerlan Tsarnaev involved in 2011 slayings A U.S. government official briefed on the investigation said Thursday that Todashev had agreed to talk to authorities,and noted that he was never arrested or handcuffed. Abdulbaki Todashev doesn't believe his son admitted to any involvement in the Waltham triple homicide, saying "the FBI can say anything now because a dead person can't defend himself." A samurai sword was in the room when Todashev sat down with two Massachusetts State Police detectives and a Boston-based FBI agent, but it was moved out of his reach.
