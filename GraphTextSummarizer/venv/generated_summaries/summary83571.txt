Boston police say they've apprehended a Red Sox employee who absconded earlier with the costume of the team's beloved mascot, Wally the Green Monster. He was picked up while heading toward downtown Boston with what's described as a furry creature with a permanent grin, extremely large head, and green and orange hair, wearing a number 97 uniform. "Missing: Wally the Green Monster, If seen please call Boston Police," authorities tweeted. "It was just a big misunderstanding," said Zineb Curran, a Boston Red Sox spokeswoman. Earlier Friday, police put out a bulletin on Twitter asking the public for help.
