Tobey Maguire has settled a lawsuit that sought repayment of hundreds of thousands of dollars the "Spider-Man" actor allegedly won in secret high-stakes poker games at Beverly Hills luxury hotels, according to court documents filed last week. Bloom arranged "food, alcohol and massages" for the players and "arranged for the settlement of gambling winnings and losses between and among the players." Bloom, who is being sued by the trustee for $473,200, denied in a response to the court that she was involved in organized illegal gambling. Bilzerian, a top professional poker player known as the "Blitz," beat Ruderman for $100,000, which the bankruptcy trustee wants back, court documents said. Kaplan, whose poker skills are well known because of his frequent television appearances at professional gambling events, agreed to repay $27,000 of the $62,000 the trustee contended he was paid in gambling proceeds from the Ponzi scheme funds. "To obtain investments in the fund, Ruderman misrepresented to potential investors that Lowell Milken (chairman of the Milken Family Foundation and younger brother of Michael Milken) and Larry Ellison (the CEO of Oracle Corporation) were investors in the funds," federal court documents said.
