As an Afghan, Mati sees a side of life here that the NATO generals and politicians never see. There are dozens of young boys here -- thin and frail because of a lack of nutrition brought on by staggering poverty. As he leans under the hood of a wrecked car, torn plastic sandals on his feet, I know I cannot possibly understand the life this young boy is forced to lead in war-torn Afghanistan -- where jobs are few, pay is appalling, and young children must work rather than go to school and play with their friends. Nazer is one of the boy mechanics of the Sarai Malim yard in western Kabul. Mohammed's father Najibullah has a philosophical outlook tempered by the reality of life in this country.
