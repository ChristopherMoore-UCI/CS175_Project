A Luxy spokesman on Tuesday would only identify him as "Tim T." Among the app's current users are "CEOs, professional athletes, doctors, lawyers, investors, entrepreneurs, beauty queens, fitness models and Hollywood celebrities," according to the media release. (It is worth noting, perhaps, that the only written review of the app in the Google Play store on Tuesday was a 5-star entry by a user with the screen name "Tim T.") Spokesman Darren Shuster said the decision to keep "Tim's" identity private is likely due to negative feedback the app has received. Luxy claims that the average income of male users is $200,000.
