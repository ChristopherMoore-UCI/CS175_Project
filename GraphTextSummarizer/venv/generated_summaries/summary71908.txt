"You see a completely different person that's a lot happier, has more energy and is more active." Edgar couldn't agree more. But there were times when I just gave in and started crying," said Edgar, who lives in a suburb of St. Louis and is now 18. Mario, who carried 235 pounds on his 5-foot-7 frame, was inspired by Edgar's will to change. Mario has lost 70 pounds and continues to run alongside his brother, Edgar said. Edgar's typical breakfast became a peanut butter sandwich with honey and banana slices.
