-- Kenya's president declared two days of national mourning Wednesday for Wangari Maathai, the first woman from Africa to win the Nobel Peace Prize, who died Monday after a battle with cancer. Maathai founded the Green Belt Movement in Kenya, a tree-planting campaign to simultaneously mitigate deforestation and to give locals, especially women and girls, access to resources like firewood for cooking and clean water. Kibaki's announcement said Thursday and Friday would be days of national mourning for Maathai, with the national flag flown at half staff. In 2004, Maathai was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for her efforts to promote sustainable development, democracy and peace. Maathai, 71, was an environmentalist who had long campaigned for human rights and the empowerment of Africa's most impoverished people.
