"I was born during World Cup time and from there it was just about giving sequence to what I really enjoyed and that was playing football." -- When former Brazil international captain Cafu is asked why he became a professional footballer, he gives a simple reply. A rampaging right-sided defender with seemingly endless stamina, Cafu played in four World Cups, captaining Brazil to football's biggest prize in 2002 and starring in two others -- USA 1994, where Brazil won and France 1998 where they lost 3-0 to the hosts in the final. Two goals from an inspired Ronaldo settled the tie in Brazil's favor, securing a record fifth World Cup crown for the country. "I have no doubt whatsoever that Brazil will do a terrific World Cup and they will be (six time) world champions," he added.
