Sigurdardottir is Iceland's first female prime minister, although not the North Atlantic nation's first female head of state -- Vigdis Finnbogadottir became its fourth president in 1980. A former flight attendant who entered politics via the union movement, Sigurdardottir was minister of social affairs and social security in the outgoing Cabinet, which resigned Monday. -- Johanna Sigurdardottir was sworn in as Iceland's prime minister on Sunday, becoming the world's first openly gay premier and the first woman to take the post in Iceland. She has been a member of Iceland's Parliament for 30 years, and was in her second stint as minister of social affairs. Iceland has been in political turmoil since October, when its currency, stock market and leading banks collapsed amid the global financial crisis.
