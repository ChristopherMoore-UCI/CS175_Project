-- A group of Catholic activists gathered in front of a Manhattan cathedral Tuesday for the latest protest over a Vatican reprimand of America's largest organization of Catholic nuns. While praising the group's work on social justice issues, the Holy See blamed it for remaining "silent on the right to life from conception to natural death, a question that is part of the lively public debate about abortion and euthanasia in the United States." "Further, issues of crucial importance to the life of Church and society, such as the Church's Biblical view of family life and human sexuality, are not part of the LCWR agenda in a way that promotes Church teaching," the report said. Following a years-long "doctrinal assessment" investigation of the Leadership Conference of Women Religious -- which represents 80% of the Catholic nuns in United States -- the report found "serious doctrinal problems" and called for major reforms. It also noted public statements from nuns that opposed Catholic bishops. " "The sisters are wonderful people who work very hard, and yes, they do care about the poor, and they do care about social concerns, and the congregation of the dogma of the faith has come down on them really hard," said Eileen Sammon, one of the protesters gathered outside St. Patrick's.
