Source: Aaron Hernandez investigation turns to gun trafficking Bristol Superior Court Judge Richard Moses made the ruling during a hearing on Hernandez's finances in connection with a lawsuit filed by the family of Odin Lloyd, whom the ex-New England Patriot tight end is accused of killing, according to court documents. Hernandez, 24, has pleaded not guilty to a charge of first-degree murder in the June shooting of his friend Lloyd, 27, a Boston-area semipro football player who was dating the sister of Hernandez's girlfriend. A grand jury investigating allegations of gun trafficking against Hernandez is the same one that handed up the murder charge, a source told CNN in October. Prosecutors told CNN that Hernandez allegedly planned and carried out the slaying: Lloyd was shot five times with a semi-automatic .45-caliber handgun.
