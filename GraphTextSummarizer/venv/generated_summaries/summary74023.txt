CNN: Anti-retroviral drugs are life saving and you used access to them to shame the South African government and have them given to ordinary poor people. ZA: All people who live in South Africa have to deal with the crime and safety situation...the basic things, safe toilets, safe streets, safe lights, after school care and that's what the Social Justice Coalition which I'm part of (advocates for.) I'm the sort of person -- I really hope -- who tries to change things and who gives people a sense of dignity, of their own humanity. CNN: You refused to take anti-AIDS drugs even though you could, to make a point that 'listen, I might die in this fight until ordinary people get it.' The dignity that black people to a degree have -- no black person has to lose their family and go to jail for it like we did under the past laws, so that's one sense of it.
