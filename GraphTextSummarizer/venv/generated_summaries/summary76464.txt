"We as a country tend to lull ourselves into a false sense of security over the passage of time," said Andy Lamprey, vice president of the security firm Andrews International and a former Los Angeles Police Department senior SWAT supervisor. And then there's New York, where nervous residents of that normally steely city made nearly four times as many suspicious package calls the day after the Boston bombings than they did in a typical day the year before, New York police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said Tuesday. The interest in the Boston terrorism case "will last for a few days and perhaps a week, and then it will become a distant memory for most people," he said. Caught in a crush of people on his way into Atlanta's Turner Field, he couldn't help but think about what had just happened in Boston -- sports fans crowded into a small space, a bomb tucked into a backpack, and then death. Hundreds of National Guard troops remained on duty in Boston on Wednesday, backing up police.
