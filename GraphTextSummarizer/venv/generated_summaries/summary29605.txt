The bus with about 60 people ran off Interstate 26 about three miles west of Ridgeville, South Carolina, said state Highway Patrol spokesman Bob Beres. -- A bus taking a group of friends to Florida for a holiday cruise ran off the interstate and into trees early Monday, killing the driver and injuring 30 passengers, South Carolina police and a bus company employee said. The crash happened just after 1 a.m. ET, about 45 miles from St. Stephen, South Carolina, where the passengers boarded the bus, Beres said. The bus was chartered from Five Star Transportation in Bonneau, South Carolina, Beres said. The National Weather Service reported light rain in the area, but Beres said it was too early to tell if weather played a factor in the crash.
