Zhang Dejiang, a Chinese vice premier, will replace Bo as Communist Party chief of Chongqing, the biggest metropolis in southwestern China, the official news agency Xinhua reported Thursday. In recent years, Bo had pushed a series of aggressive political campaigns in Chongqing, including the "dahei," or anti-gangs initiative, which targeted mafia-like criminal groups. Bo, 62, had served as Chongqing party chief since November 2007. He also served as minister of commerce and mayor of Dalian, a progressive coastal city in northeastern China. The approach divided opinions in China, with some lauding its effectiveness and others criticizing it as heavy handed.
