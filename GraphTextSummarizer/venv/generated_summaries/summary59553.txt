Should Mac customers install anti-virus software by default like most Windows customers do? In looking into the effects of Mac Defender, Wired.com's sister publication Ars Technica did a thorough investigation on the state of Mac malware, speaking with 14 Mac support specialists. While Mac Defender does show that the problem is getting worse and people should be more wary about malware, it doesn't necessarily mean that every Mac user today should rush to buy anti-virus software, Miller said. And while 200 posts complaining about Mac Defender in Apple's support forums may seem like a lot, that's still a small fraction of the millions of Mac customers in the world. Though the conclusion is unclear, the moral of this story is to be wary that Mac malware is in the wild, and be cautious about installing sketchy software from unfamiliar sources.
