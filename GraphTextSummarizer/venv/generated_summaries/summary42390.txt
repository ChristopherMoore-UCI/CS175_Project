Jurors must fill out a daunting 20-page verdict form, marking on worksheets exactly which Samsung products infringe on Apple patents and vice versa. -- After three weeks, the closely watched Apple versus Samsung patent trial wound down Tuesday with four hours of closing arguments. Tuesday's closing arguments capped off weeks of testimony that included highs -- colorful stories from Apple executives about the iPhone's origin -- and lows -- jurors nodding off during drier discussions of software patents.

Samsung argued that Apple's approach didn't go deep enough to prove that individual devices infringed on patents, and dove into more technical detail.
