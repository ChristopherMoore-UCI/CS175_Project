I had never seen something like that before, and it was really interesting to experience all of this so close," said Mazur, who photographed the fight club as part of her work toward graduation from photography school. Under harsh lights in a private, rented room in Berlin, women face each other in violent, sometimes bloody battles of brute strength. The fighters are both beginners and professionals, anywhere from age 20 to 50, said photographer Katarzyna Mazur, who spent months documenting the club in 2013 and 2014. " Katarzyna Mazur is a Polish photographer based in Berlin. She also had to remember that the fighters pushing and pummeling inside the club have lives outside, too -- they're mothers, partners, friends.
