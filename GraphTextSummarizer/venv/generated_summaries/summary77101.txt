Thierry Henry has a snapshot that flew just over the crossbar while a quick free-kick from Xavi saw Lionel Messi sting the fingers of Andriy Pyatov in the Shakhtar goal -- and the keeper recovered quickly to deny the lurking Henry. Messi hit a fierce left-foot effort that Pyatov could only parry, and when the ball drifted out to Henry by the left touchline he took deliberate aim to loop a shot into the far corner but the Shakhtar keeper climbed just high enough to turn it over. -- A late goal from Pedro Rodriguez, with just five minutes remaining of extra time, gave Barcelona a 1-0 victory over Shakhtar Donetsk in the European Super Cup final in Monaco on Friday. Shakhtar did not create a single opening in normal time while Barca at least showed some intent in a match of few chances. Bojan Krkic, on for Henry, could have wrapped it up with two chances before, having barely threatened, the Ukrainians were denied a blatant penalty when Ilsinho was felled.
