As a result of poor management and lack of emission controls, Aruba Petroleum created a "private nuisance" to the Parr family by producing harmful air pollution and exposing them to harmful emissions of volatile organic compounds, toxic air pollutants and diesel exhaust, the lawsuit said. Op-ed: Make sure fracking is done right Aruba Petroleum argued to the jury that it consistently met state regulatory standards for air emissions and that there was no evidence its fracking of the wells harmed the Parr family in any way. In a statement released after the verdict, Aruba said "natural gas development has long been prevalent in Wise County," and dozens of companies operate hundreds of wells there. According to the lawsuit, Aruba Petroleum had 22 natural gas wells within a 2-mile radius of the Parrs' property, with three wells in close proximity to their Texas home. During discovery, Gilde said that "substantial evidence" showed that Aruba Petroleum was a factor in causing the Parrs' health problems.
