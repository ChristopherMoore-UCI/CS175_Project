Our political system, with these kinds of power brokers at their helm, has produced great legislation. (Even Spacey's character was responsible for education reform in season one and entitlement reform in season two.) While serving as Senate majority leader, Lyndon Johnson famously relied on his ambition and thirst for power to produce some rather notable legislative accomplishments, such as the Interstate Highway Act of 1956 and the Civil Rights Act of 1957. There have also been great legislative leaders whose ambitions made important contributions to Congress. Abraham Lincoln guided the nation through the brutal Civil War and brought end to the horrendous institution of slavery.
