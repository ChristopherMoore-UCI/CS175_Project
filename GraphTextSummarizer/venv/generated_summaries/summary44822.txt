"Band of Joy" -- named after Plant's first band with late pal John Bonham -- smartly takes some cues from "Raising Sand." The closest he comes is "You Can't Buy My Love," first recorded in 1965 by R&B singer Barbara Lynn. Robert Plant's 2007 album with pop-bluegrass songbird Alison Krauss, Raising Sand, did something 25 years of solo records never quite managed. He returns to the late, great Townes Van Zandt (whose "Nothin' " was a highlight on Sand) for the bleak "Harm's Swift Way," working a metaphor that turns the idea of time into a woman beyond a man's control. Plant uses an A list of country voices and players (Patty Griffin, Buddy Miller) and an inspired mix of vintage and modern songs.
