"Additionally, CDC and APHIS inspectors determined that Tulane primate center staff frequently entered the select agent lab without appropriate protective clothing, which would increase the risk of bringing the bacteria out of the lab or becoming infected themselves. The CDC says the primate facility can resume that research when Tulane officials show inspectors that: • Entity-wide procedures exist to ensure animals accidentally exposed in the future are managed appropriately; • All personal protective equipment procedures are thoroughly reviewed and revised appropriately to lessen the risk of future breaches; • All Tulane primate center personnel are trained on any new or revised protective clothing procedures; and Melioidosis "is predominately a disease of tropical climates, especially in Southeast Asia and northern Australia where it is widespread," according to the CDC website. Inspectors from the CDC and the U.S. Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service said the misuse of outer garments "could have led to the bacteria clinging to inner garments and getting carried out of the select agent lab where research was being conducted with the bacteria on mice," a news release said. The misuse of outer protective garments may have led to the exposure of a potentially deadly strain of bacteria at the Tulane National Primate Research Center near New Orleans, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday.
