Prioritize: Take an honest look at your average week, identify your inefficient uses of time and eliminate the things that don't serve your goals. But my point is that change starts with a decision followed by baby steps along a new, consistent trajectory that, over time, can lead to dramatic results. The immediate result was a rather surprising and unexpected increase in my energy levels, leading to a very gradual return to exercise, building up slowly over an extended period of time. One day at a time: Large goals can seem insurmountable. Personally, I cannot overemphasize the difference this has made in my own life, a secret weapon for enhanced athletic performance and overall long-term wellness.
