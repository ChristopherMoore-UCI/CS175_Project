Owens said there's a "possibility" Davis was being harassed at work, though he stressed that investigators had not yet identified a motive. Investigators later found a man witnesses identified as the shooter in his home with a gunshot wound to the head, said Sheriff Dempsey Owens of the Montgomery County Sheriff's Office. The shooting happened at the McBride Lumber Co., about a mile north of Star, North Carolina, about 50 miles south of Greensboro, Owens said. Davis, also hospitalized at the university facility, "knew who he went after," Owens said. Both the fourth victim and the alleged shooter were in critical condition, Owens said.
