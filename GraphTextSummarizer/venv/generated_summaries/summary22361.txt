-- Former Argentina coach Diego Maradona has agreed a two-year deal to manage Dubai-based Al Wasl, according to the club. ''Al Wasl Sports Club is proud to announce the appointment of Diego Armando Maradona as head coach of Al Wasl Football Club, in a momentous development that will see the football legend lead the team for the next two seasons,'' a statement reported by AFP said. The club's vice-chairman Marwane Ben Bayatt, who conducted discussions with Maradona, added: ''Al Wasl Sports Club has become synonymous with achievements of this caliber, and we are very pleased to be welcoming Maradona to a long line of accolades in the club's history. Maradona represented his country 91 times as a player, scoring 34 goals, and led Argentina to a World Cup triumph in 1986. Maradona was fired after Argentina's crushing defeat to Germany and has been linked with a number of jobs in England and Iran since.
