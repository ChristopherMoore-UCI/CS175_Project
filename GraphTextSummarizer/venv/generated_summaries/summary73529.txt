Malema was banned from participating in party activities this month after he gave a speech critical of President Jacob Zuma. "It is under President Zuma that we have seen the youth of the ANC being traumatized, being expelled from their own home," Malema said, according to an ANC statement. He faced a string of charges, including sowing party division by comparing Zuma to his predecessor, Thabo Mbeki, and urging that the government of neighboring Botsawana be toppled. Malema has also been the subject of a criminal investigation by the national revenue service over allegations that he used his political position to influence the awarding of government tenders. The suspension followed a speech in which Malema suggested that Zuma was running the party in a dictatorial and intolerant way.
