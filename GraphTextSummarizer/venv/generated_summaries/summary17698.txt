"While playing host to the world isn't new for us, the number of visitors we're welcoming in recent years is new," Bloomberg said during a ceremony in Times Square, while surrounded by cheering tourism officials. New York expects to draw more than 50 million visitors by the end of 2011 -- a record for the city, Mayor Michael Bloomberg announced Tuesday. Tourism is a huge moneymaker for the city, generating $32 billion in visitor spending and $48 billion in economic impact, Bloomberg's office said. "New York City's quality of life has contributed to this great success, and we are confident we will sustain the success of our tourism industry in the months and years ahead," Bloomberg said.
