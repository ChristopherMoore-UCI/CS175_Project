-- The memorials and tributes to the late Nelson Mandela have grown way past the flags flown at half-staff and the thousands of flowers and candles left at South African embassies throughout the world. If this were a contest of creativity, the winner would likely be a massive sand sculpture of Mandela's face and the South African flag at a beach on the Bay of Bengal in Puri, India. In Paris, the front of the Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs was draped with an enormous portrait of the former South African President, who died Thursday at age 95. And in Johannesburg, people continued to stream to Mandela's home, bringing flowers and ribbons to add to the growing wall of color there. The Omni Hotel in downtown Dallas also used lighting to create a South African flag on its faÃ§ade in commemoration.
