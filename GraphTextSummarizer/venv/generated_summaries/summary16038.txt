Mark Bateson, an archivist in Sandwich, southern England, found the previously unknown version of the Magna Carta -- which established the principle that everybody, including the king, was subject to the law -- after historian Nicholas Vincent had asked him to look for a separate document dealing with a local forest that he was researching. "The fact that they [Magna Carta and Forest Charter] are both there in Sandwich is particularly interesting because there is no royal forest in Kent. "Through the American Declaration of Independence, continuing in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Magna Carta still underpins individual liberties worldwide," said the town's mayor, Paul Graeme. To own such a document, and the Charter of the Forest, is an honor and a great responsibility." "What matters is Sandwich now becomes one of a very small number of institutions -- there are only about a dozen -- that own a Magna Carta," said Vincent. I think, from his point of view, it was all a bit of a shock," said Vincent, professor of medieval history at the University of East Anglia.
