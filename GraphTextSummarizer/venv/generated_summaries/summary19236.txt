Officer Jeff Stenroos of the Los Angeles Unified School District Police Department had said he was shot in the chest on January 19 in the west San Fernando Valley. But Thursday night, Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck said Stenroos had been arrested on a felony count of filing a false police report. He said the shooting happened when he got out of his squad car to check on a man peering into parked vehicles near the El Camino High School. Beck said detectives followed up on more than 350 clues, carried out several neighborhood canvasses and distributed "countless" fliers seeking information. The alleged shooting prompted an hours-long lockdown of several schools as police scoured the area looking for the shooter.
