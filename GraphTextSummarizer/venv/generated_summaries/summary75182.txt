Josh Brumberger said he told Edwards that Hunter seemed a "little nutty" and her video work was "shoddy and unprofessional." Edwards insisted Hunter should receive health insurance, even though she was a consultant, Brumberger said. -- The trial of former presidential candidate John Edwards took a dramatic turn Wednesday when his daughter abruptly left the courtroom during testimony about a fight between her mother and father over his affair with a campaign videographer. Edwards is accused of using false and misleading campaign disclosure reports to conceal from the Federal Election Commission more than $900,000 in donations -- $725,000 from Rachel "Bunny" Mellon and $200,000 from the late Texas lawyer Fred Baron. Cate Edwards left during the testimony of Christina Reynolds, former research director for Edwards' 2008 campaign. Reynolds was recounting an October 2007 confrontation between Elizabeth and John Edwards at the Raleigh, North Carolina, airport after the National Enquirer reported the candidate was having an affair with Rielle Hunter.
