The 50-year-old admitted earlier this year to using deer antler spray which contains small extracts of growth hormone IGF-1, a substance listed on the PGA's list of banned products. That statement led the PGA to rule that Singh should no longer face a ban, ruling: "Based on this new information, and given WADA's lead role in interpreting the prohibited list, the Tour deemed it only fair to no longer treat Mr.Singh's use of deer antler spray as a violation." " Ye is coached by Englishman David Watson, who as a junior played alongside future Ryder Cup players Justin Rose and Lee Westwood. "We're always all helping each other out, and turning to one another for advice," explained Ye, who at 12 years and 242 days will beat the record for the youngest competitor at the China Open set by Guan last year. The PGA sanctioned Singh but the Fijian golfer appealed, saying he did not know the product contained banned substances.
