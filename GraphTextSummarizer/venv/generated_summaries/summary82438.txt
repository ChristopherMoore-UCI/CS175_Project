Reigning double world champion Sebastian Vettel, who started from 11th place on the grid in his Red Bull, battled wearing tires in the closing stages of the 56-lap race and dropped from second place to fifth. Hamilton's third successive third place finish has taken him to the top of the world championship standings, two points clear of teammate Button. Previous leader Fernando Alonso could only take ninth place in his Ferrari and slips to third in the title race. Stopping only twice to change tires, Rosberg was always in control, the last challenge to his supremacy disappearing when Button's third stop in his McLaren cost him time. He crossed the line 20.6 seconds clear to become the first winner for the famous German marque of Mercedes since the legendary Juan Manuel Fangio in 1955 in Italy.
