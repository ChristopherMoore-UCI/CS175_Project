At a Wednesday morning news conference, Reed said Atlanta city road crews began pretreating streets at 9 a.m. Tuesday, ahead of the day's snowfall. -- Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed on Wednesday defended the city's handling of a snowstorm that crippled traffic and left motorists stranded for hours a day earlier, and partly blamed local businesses, saying they contributed to gridlock by letting workers leave at the same time. He said city crews -- which have 30 spreaders and 40 snowplows -- had finished treating "Priority 1" areas such as bridges and exits, and their current focus is helping state crews clear the freeways. " Reed said schools and businesses let people go at roughly the same time early Tuesday afternoon as the snow was starting. At the news conference, Reed said 791 vehicle accidents -- "14 with injuries" -- were reported in the city since Tuesday's snowfall.
