-- Brazil playmaker Kaka confirmed his transfer from Italian side AC Milan to Spanish club Real Madrid, in a move worth a reported $100 million. "Ricardo Izecson dos Santos Leite, Kaka, now plays for Real Madrid following the deal reached with AC Milan," Real Madrid announced on its Web site. The Serie A club's owner revealed on Italian television station Rai, he would meet with the Brazil playmaker at the start of next week to thrash out Kaka's future. Milan president Silvio Berlusconi had told Kaka that he had to decide on his future on Monday. Galliani had said there was no chance of English club Chelsea -- who appointed former Milan coach Carlo Ancelotti as manager on Monday -- swooping in to beat Real for Kaka's signature.
