Full of mysterious nooks and crannies as well as grand spaces, the Alhambra attracts around two million visitors a year, according to the Patronato de la Alhambra in Spain, the organization that looks after the complex. "It is a site that gets many visitors, we can say that it's a major tourist destination," said Maria del Mar Villafranca, director of the Patronato de la Alhambra. The Alhambra, a fortress and palace in the Spanish city of Granada was begun in the mid-13th century by the Nasrid Emirs of Granada, the last Muslim rulers in Spain. "It's a very important part of the Alhambra, for its symbolic value being a part of the oldest area of the complex," explained Villafranca.
