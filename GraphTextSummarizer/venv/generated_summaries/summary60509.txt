Subpoenas have been served on eight insurance companies -- Prudential Financial Inc., MetLife Inc., Genworth Financial Inc., UnumProvident Corp., Northwestern Mutual, Guardian Life Insurance Company of America, New York Life Insurance Co., and the MONY Life Insurance Co. -- though the entire life insurance industry is under investigation, according to the attorney general's office. He said MetLife is not the issuer of the Service Employees Group Life Insurance program provided to members of the armed forces, but the company does provide life insurance policies for civilian federal employees under a program called Federal Employees Group Life Insurance. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates said he learned Thursday that families of deceased military members did not get a lump-sum payment for life insurance policies. The accounts in question include Prudential's Alliance Account and MetLife's Total Control Account. "The possibility that life insurance companies may be profiting inappropriately from these service members' sacrifice is completely unacceptable," the VA said in a statement.
