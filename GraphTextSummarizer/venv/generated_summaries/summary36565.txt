"The actions that led to the closing of this afternoon's lecture prevented any exchange of ideas and deprived the campus and the Providence community of an opportunity to hear and discuss important social issues," said Brown University President Christina H. Paxson. -- Brown University was forced to cancel a speech by NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly on Tuesday after protesters shouted at him on stage about stop- and-frisk policies and racism, an online video shows. After nearly 30 minutes of disruption by activist students and members of the community, school officials made the decision to close the lecture and clear the auditorium, according to a statement from Brown University, which is in Providence, Rhode Island. "The conduct of disruptive members of the audience is indefensible and an affront both to civil democratic society and to the university's core values of dialog and the free exchange of views," Paxson said in the statement. Kelly was to deliver a lecture on "Proactive Policing in America's Biggest City," with nearly an hour set aside for direct audience questions afterward, according to the statement.
