Along the way, we intend to continue to call attention to the facts and witnesses that will shed light on Ms. Driscoll's true character, motivations and history," Rusty Hardin said. Kurt Busch, NASCAR's 2004 Cup champion, lost both appeals of his indefinite suspension and will miss Sunday's season-opening Daytona 500, the auto racing circuit said late Saturday. Busch twice challenged NASCAR's decision Friday to ban him after a Delaware civil court found he likely committed domestic violence against  former girlfriend Patricia Driscoll. Busch was accused by Driscoll of grabbing her by the throat and slamming her head into a wall three times while they were in Busch's motor home at Dover International Speedway in October. Hardin has said Driscoll lied during her testimony and she had tried to intimidate witnesses.
