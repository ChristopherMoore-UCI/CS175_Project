Police investigating the alleged prostitution ring referred the Washington incident, which they believed could qualify as gang rape, to the Lille prosecutor earlier this year after hearing the testimony of the Belgian woman. The former IMF chief hit the headlines in the United States last year over a separate case involving attempted rape allegations in New York. The young Belgian woman whose testimony was the basis for the inquiry has withdrawn her previous statement and said she will not press charges, a statement from the Lille prosecutor's office said. "Given all these elements, the offense of rape could not be made, and the Lille prosecution decided to proceed no further with the case, on the ground of 'no offense'," the statement from the prosecutor's office said. But the prosecutor's office said Tuesday that the Belgian woman's lawyer had stated in August that his client did not want to give any judicial statement on this matter.
