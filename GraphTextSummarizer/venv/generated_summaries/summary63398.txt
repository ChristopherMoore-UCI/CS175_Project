The US delegation was led by Ben Rhodes, a speechwriter who has become one of Obama's closest foreign policy confidants, and Ricardo Zuniga, the top National Security Council expert on Latin America. The Cuba bombshell is also another indication of the growing geopolitical opportunities opening up for the Obama administration as global oil prices collapse. Taken together, Obama's approach to Cuba and Iran could decide whether he leaves the White House as a global statesman or as a president with unfulfilled big ideas. Since the early days of his first presidential run, Barack Obama made a pledge -- to talk directly with America's enemies -- that most other politicians found naive. In the twilight of his administration, Obama's Wednesday announcement on normalizing relations with Cuba represented his last best chance to turn this idea into a doctrine that outlives his presidency.
