-- London's Heathrow Airport will introduce more body scanners within weeks, and all British airports must have equipment to detect explosives by the end of the year, British Home Secretary Alan Johnson said Tuesday. " Speaking on the BBC, Brown said the devices will be put into place gradually, as will checks of carry-on luggage for traces of explosives for passengers boarding flights at British airports. British airports will also use more sniffer dogs to try to find explosives, Johnson said in a speech to the House of Commons. Johnson said the government was directing airports to carry out more random searches of passengers because metal detectors cannot spot explosives without metal parts. "It is an issue of grave concern that the explosive device was not detected by airport security in either Lagos (Nigeria) or Amsterdam (Netherlands)," which AbdulMutallab passed through en route to Detroit, Johnson said.
