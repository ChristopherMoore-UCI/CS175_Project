" Accused of detaining judges The Islamabad High Court had ordered Musharraf's arrest on Thursday in a case in which he is accused of illegally ordering the detention of senior judges in 2007. -- A day after he made a swift exit from an Islamabad court when a judge revoked his bail, former Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf appeared before a magistrate on Friday and was formally placed under house arrest. The development is the latest setback to Musharraf since the former military ruler returned to Pakistan last month to fight a series of court cases against him and re-enter the country's turbulent political scene by seeking to run in upcoming elections. Farmhouse arrest After appearing before the magistrate on Friday, Musharraf was allowed to return to his farmhouse, which has been converted into a "sub jail" where he is being held under house arrest, according to his lawyer, Ahmed Raza Qasoori. His arrest also highlights the increased willingness of Pakistan's judiciary, who clashed with Musharraf during his time in power, to pursue cases against high-profile figures previously considered to be untouchable.
