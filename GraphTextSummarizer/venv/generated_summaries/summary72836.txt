Barahona, who was in custody in the Palm Beach County Jail, suffered a self-inflicted injury after deputies told him to get ready to go to a court hearing Thursday morning, West Palm Beach Police spokesman Scott Chase said. Chase Scott, spokesman for West Palm Beach Police, told CNN that officers were executing a search warrant for evidence in the home of Jorge and Carmen Barahona. Earlier Thursday, Barahona was taken to a hospital Thursday after he "attempted to harm himself," police said. "He was immediately checked by emergency personnel and it was decided he was OK to appear in court." However, Barahona "refused to cooperate" by not speaking and the judge decided to delay the hearing until another date, Chase said. Barahona told police that in dousing himself with gasoline, he inadvertently got some on the boy, Olsen said Wednesday.
