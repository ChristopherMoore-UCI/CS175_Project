Raney said that while police do not know why Pardo, 45, decided against his plan to flee, they speculate it may have been due to the burn injuries Pardo received after setting fire to the home where the slayings occurred. "The information we have so far is that Mr. Pardo was married to the daughter of the resident of the house," Raney said.
