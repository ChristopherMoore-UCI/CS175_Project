Marc Marquez held off Valentino Rossi to claim the opening MotoGP race of the season in Qatar on Sunday, picking up where he left off last year. Rossi told BT Sport. "I enjoyed a lot that race, especially after the injury," Marquez told BT Sport. Marquez took control in his Repsol Honda with nine of the 22 laps remaining but nine-time world champion Rossi caught him with two laps to go in his Yamaha. The lead changed hands a few times until Marquez led entering the final lap -- and Rossi couldn't get close enough to pass him again.
