Last week, Romney reaffirmed his position on gay marriage, saying marriage "should be a relationship between a man and a woman. While 50% approve of same-sex marriage, a further breakdown of the numbers shows a significant gender gap: 56% of women say couples of the same gender should be legally allowed to marry, while 42% of men feel the same way. More than 30 states have voted in favor of constitutional amendments that defend the traditional definition of marriage as a heterosexual union. In an interview that aired Tuesday on ABC's "The View," Obama wouldn't commit to fighting for the the repeal of the Defense of Marriage Act -- a federal law that defines marriage as the legal union between one man and one woman. "This is going to be a big contrast in the campaign, because you've got Gov. (Mitt) Romney saying we should actually have a constitutional amendment installing the notion that you can't have same-sex marriages," Obama said in the interview, recorded Monday.
