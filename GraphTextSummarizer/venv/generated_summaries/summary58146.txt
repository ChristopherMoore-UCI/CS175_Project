"Voter approval of the way police are handling terrorism is through the roof and overall approval for police in general and for (Police) Commissioner Ray Kelly is undented by criticism," said Maurice Carroll, director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute. Most New Yorkers believe the city's police act appropriately in dealing with Muslims, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released Tuesday. Critics of NYPD treatment of Muslims claim the police are denying Muslims basic civil rights, and perpetrating ethnic and religious profiling. In the poll, taken amid a tumultuous public debate surrounding the police department's surveillance of Muslims, 58% of respondents found no fault with police actions toward Muslims. Hooper said those numbers are positive, but added, "Our basic position is that civil and legal rights are guaranteed by the Constitution, and not subject to the changing nature of public opinion in times of crisis and national security."
