GOP Sen. George LeMieux, who was appointed to the Senate after former Sen. Mel Martinez unexpectedly stepped down last year, is not seeking a full term. Failure to do so could have serious ramifications for President Obama as he tries to look past the health care debate and tackle global warming, ballooning budget deficits and a range of other politically contentious issues. The GOP knows that presidents typically lose House and Senate seats during midterm elections, and is banking on that fact to block much of Obama's agenda. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, is struggling to manage Obama's more progressive agenda while also seeking a fifth term from his traditionally conservative state. Obama's replacement, Sen. Roland Burris, was immediately tainted after being tapped to fill Obama's vacancy by Rod Blagojevich, the state's scandal-plagued former governor.
