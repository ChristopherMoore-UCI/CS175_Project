The black caucus and most of black America (with the exception of Tavis Smiley and Cornel West) had remained silent for two years about the devastating economic impact of the recession on black people. But those of us who are journalists would be wrong not to question why black America is so willing to tolerate such openly unbalanced treatment when other groups would never accept it. It was not until the Iowa caucus win by Obama that many black Americans started to believe it was possible for a black man to become president. But the reality is that black America is in a crisis that civil rights icon Marian Wright Edelman last week called "the worst since slavery." So the deeper question is not why President Obama took the tone he did, but why black America tolerates it.
