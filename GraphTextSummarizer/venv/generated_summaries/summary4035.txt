Ilias Kasidiaris of Greece's far-right party Golden Dawn caused a national uproar with his actions during a popular morning television talk show. Kasidiaris and other candidates appeared on ANT1 TV to discuss the June 17 elections. When a candidate from the Communist Party of Greece, Liana Kanelli, stood and waved a newspaper toward Kasidiaris and told him to get out, things got worse. Rena Dourou of the Coalition of the Radical Left, also known as Syriza, stated that Kasidiaris' party would take Greece back 500 years, video shows. Kanelli is a well-known former journalist and was a deputy in the Communist Party for many years.
