To qualify, visitors must bring a picture of their ex -- or anyone who has  shunned them -- then rip it up and throw it in a smoking cauldron, spokeswoman Kate Edwards told CNN. With that in mind, a London tourist attraction is offering visitors the chance to curse former boyfriends, girlfriends or spouses -- and get a discount on the entry price at the same time. "It's very therapeutic, but it means in times of the credit crunch, you get money off as well," she said. "Hex your Ex" is the Valentine's Day promotion at the London Dungeon, a house of horrors that takes visitors through elements of the city's bloody, gruesome, and torturous past. "If you happen to be single or freshly shunned, this is a way to move on and have a great way of doing it," Edwards said.
