" Adler's Appetite played their final gig on New Year's Eve, and just weeks later, Adler began jamming with singer Jacob Bunton, guitarist Lonny Paul and bassist Johnny Martin. " After the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame ceremony, Adler voiced tremendous frustration with Axl Rose, calling him an "a**hole" and pledged never to talk about him in public again. The new group dubbed themselves Adler, and they cut their debut LP, Back From the Dead, in a matter of weeks. " When he returned to Los Angeles this past April after Axl Rose's no-show at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony, Adler's attitude started to change. Right around the time it was becoming clear that Guns N' Roses weren't going to reform at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Adler broke up his band Adler's Appetite.
