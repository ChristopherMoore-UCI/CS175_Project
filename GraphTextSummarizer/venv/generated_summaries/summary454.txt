Now, under the new recipe, they're made with "a standard, traditional Cadbury milk chocolate," said a spokeswoman for Mondelez International, a spinoff of Kraft Foods, in a statement. The chocolate eggs, filled with a cloying "yolk" of yellow and white fondant, were originally made in the United Kingdom with Cadbury's signature Dairy Milk chocolate. Kraft acquired British candy maker Cadbury in 2010 for roughly $19 billion. The change applies only to Cadbury eggs sold in the United Kingdom. "We have always used a range of milk chocolate blends for different products, depending on their shape or consistency," the spokeswoman said.
