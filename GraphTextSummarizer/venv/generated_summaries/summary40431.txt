"A Thousand Words" -- $3.8 mil Next weekend, a little movie called "The Hunger Games" is coming out, and with some of the best tracking numbers ever seen a week before release, the hugely anticipated adaptation will likely score one of the best opening weekend's of the year -- maybe ever. Considering "The Lorax," which cost $70 million to produce, is headed for a final domestic gross right around $200 million, it's no surprise that Universal and Illumination Entertainment are now getting to work on an animated version of "The Cat in the Hat." Disney's expensive misfire "John Carter" dropped by 55 percent in its sophomore frame to third place and $13.5 million. The strong debut marks a return-to-form for star Jonah Hill, whose live-action comedic catalog seemed less impressive after unremarkable box office performances from "The Sitter" ($30.4 million total) and "Get Him to the Greek" ($61 million), and a slew of more dramatic roles in "Cyrus," "Moneyball," and "Funny People." Over on the limited release front, Will Ferrell comedy "Casa De Mi Padre" proved to be the most caliente smaller title, drawing in $2.2 million from just 382 locations, enough for a sturdy per theater average of $5,759. Jason Segel/Ed Helms collaboration "Jeff, Who Lives at Home" proved less appealing, earning $840,000 from 254 theaters, though that was way better than Nicholas Cage thriller "Seeking Justice," which found $260,000 from 231 theaters.
