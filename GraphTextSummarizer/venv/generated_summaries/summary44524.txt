Unveiled by London's Mayor Boris Johnson, the sculpture created by German-born conceptual artist Hans Haacke portrays a skeletal riderless horse with an ribbon-shaped electronic ticker tied to its left leg showing live market data from London's Stock Exchange. Everybody sees it." "There are other statues and the idea of having the empty plinth which has been made available periodically for artists is a great idea," added Haacke. From an iconic marble statue of a heavily pregnant disabled artist to the more recent giant blue cockerel, London's Fourth Plinth art project has always provided a controversial modern twist to the traditional landmarks around London's Trafalgar Square. "'Gift Horse' is a startlingly original comment on the relationship between art and commerce and I hope it will stimulate as much debate as other works that have appeared on the plinth," Johnson said. One of London's most famous landmarks, Trafalgar Square is popular with tourists.
