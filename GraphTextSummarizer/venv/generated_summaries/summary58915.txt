-- President Barack Obama touched on his recent announcement of support for same-sex marriage, saying at a New York City fundraising event Monday that he believes marriage equality "strengthens families. Recent polls show Obama with a significant lead among women against Republican rival Mitt Romney. Mitt Romney helped create more jobs in his private sector experience and more jobs as Governor of Massachusetts than President Obama has for the entire nation. Obama's commencement speech came just two days after Republican rival Mitt Romney gave a commencement address at the evangelical Liberty University in Virginia, where he made social issues a main theme of his remarks and touched on the marriage storyline. "We admire his courage, like the courage he showed last week in affirming his belief in marriage equality," Martin, who announced two years ago that he is gay, said on stage, prior to introducing Obama.
