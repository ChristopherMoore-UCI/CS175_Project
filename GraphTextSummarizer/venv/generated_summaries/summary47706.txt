The report, released Tuesday, says a remedy will be more Army participation in the Joint Terrorism Task Force, teams of experts drawn from law enforcement and intelligence agencies. Nidal Hasan, a Army psychiatrist and U.S.-born Muslim, is accused of the November 5, 2009, shootings, in which 13 people were killed and dozens wounded. Army Secretary John McHugh and Gen. George Casey, chief of staff of the Army, were at Fort Hood on Friday to mark the first anniversary of the shootings. After the shootings there were numerous reports of Hasan's outspoken opposition to the U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and to Muslims killing Muslims. The report acknowledges that members of Congress continue to press the Defense Department and U.S. intelligence agencies for what they knew about Hasan.
