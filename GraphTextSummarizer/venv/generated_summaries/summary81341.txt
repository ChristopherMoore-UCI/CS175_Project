Flying can be uncomfortable enough, so I believe in making airport time a bit indulgent. So if you have a long layover, take the tram to E Terminal, and maybe you'll have the added benefit of meeting a cute international man (or woman) of mystery. Concourse A (across from the food court) and C (opposite Gate C37) have an XPresSpa. I apply this title to travelers who weave their way in and out of airport terminals, bypassing lines, crowds and stress, and ultimately finding devilish gratification in knowing what others don't.
