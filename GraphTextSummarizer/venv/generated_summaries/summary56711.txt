It may seem strange to say this, but the reason that you and I as free individuals cannot access life-ending drugs is because governments have imposed rules that require prescription approval by physicians for such drugs. In jurisdictions where physician-assisted suicide is permitted and where proper safeguards are in place to prevent depressed or otherwise ineligible people from access to lethal drugs, physicians play a standard medical role of ascertaining applicants' eligibility for the appropriate medications. Hence I oppose physician involvement in capital punishment (via lethal injection) and all forms of euthanasia in which physicians are actively involved. In addition, I believe that people who are facing the end of life -- terminally ill patients such as Maynard -- and those suffering grievous and irreversible pain should be free to end their life. But physicians are not actively involved in physician-assisted suicide.
