The truth is that the security of flights will be determined by the level of competency of our intelligence services and the bravery of average Americans, not by a silly scan and a ban on water bottles. What if we had no air security checks Even before the backscatter X-ray machines roll out to all the airports in America (they are in 70 airports so far), I am actively looking for people to make a bet with me about the future of these machines. This month the TSA introduced full-body scans that are little more than the realization of the back-of-the-comic-book fantasy of X-ray specs. Additionally, I think I speak for all travelers when I wonder why we have full-body scans, yet will still have to put our shoes through the X-ray machine. Specifically, I will bet that we will catch more TSA employees guilty of inappropriately forwarding full-body scans of celebrities or attractive women than we will terrorists.
