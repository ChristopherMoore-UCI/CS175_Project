We got some clear images showing that little Noah did indeed have pyloric stenosis and would require surgery. The best test for pyloric stenosis is an ultrasound exam, and I've developed reasonable ultrasound skills over many years of scanning and learning on the job. Also on Monday morning, we discharged little Noah (not his real name) from the hospital. As I scanned little Noah, one of my colleagues joked with me about doing the scan with the ultrasound in one hand and my textbook in the other. After the surgery, little Noah improved quickly.
