-- After a decade at the helm of one of the world's biggest football clubs David Gill will step down as Manchester United chief executive officer in June. "It has been the greatest privilege to serve Manchester United for 16 wonderful years -- the last 10 of which as its chief executive," said Gill, who joined United as finance director in 1997. " United co-chairman Joel Glazer said: "David has played a significant role in the success of Manchester United in his 10 years as chief executive and he can take great satisfaction in all that has been achieved on his watch, both on and off the field." United currently lead the Premier League table by 12 points from cross-city neighbors Manchester City with just 12 matches of the season remaining. After reaching the quarterfinals of the FA Cup with victory over Reading on Monday, United's current squad could emulate the team of 1999 which won an unprecedented Premier League, FA Cup and Champions League treble.
