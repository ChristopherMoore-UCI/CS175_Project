While reports of missing children are not unusual -- a Haleigh and a Haylee are two recent examples  -- several elements came together in the Caylee case to make it a high-profile news story, said Robert Thompson, who heads the Bleier Center for Television and Popular Culture at Syracuse University. So began the Caylee Anthony case, a mystery that became a nightly fixture on cable television and captivated true-crime buffs across the country. Casey Anthony didn't tell anyone for 30 days that her daughter, Caylee, was missing. During the search for Caylee, some say Casey Anthony didn't behave the way one would expect of a worried mother. When the crowd grew unruly, Cindy Anthony waved a hammer and George Anthony shouted back at the hecklers.
