For ten days, Vice President Xi Jinping has dropped off the radar of state-run domestic news media, which usually meticulously record official activities of senior leaders. In April, Bo Xilai, once considered to be among party royalty and a fast-rising star within the party, was stripped of his leadership positions for an unspecified "breach of party discipline." "Xi Jinping is already projected to be a weak leader because he doesn't have a power base of his own," said Lam, who predicted Hu Jintao will remain the head of the Chinese military for two to three years after relinquishing his party and state titles to Xi. Although most analysts agree the all-important 18th Communist Party Congress -- the meeting where a new generation of leaders, headed by Xi, is expected to be confirmed -- will be held in the middle of next month, the authorities have not announced the dates for the gathering of some 2,200 party delegates from around the country. Then Ta Kung Pao, a pro-Beijing newspaper in Hong Kong, reported that Xi would meet the Danish prime minister, Helle Thorning-Schmidt, on Monday and journalists were invited to cover the occasion.
