It simply proves that while covers may play some role in readers' preferences, it's what's between the covers that really counts." Updating a cover isn't new either, but using "iconic" or "object" imagery picked up speed a few months back in an effort to capture the momentum of "Fifty Shades." "It sends a visible signal that if you liked 'Fifty Shades,' there are other titles you'll like," said Monique Patterson, executive editor with St. Martin's Press, which is reissuing titles by best-selling authors Lora Leigh, Laura Reese and Opal Carew with new covers this summer. They have adopted strategies over years, with e-books and book covers, and they'll go out with a book regardless of the cover," she said. Romance readers, known for their voracious literary appetites, were among the first adopters of e-books, said Michelle Renaud, spokeswoman for publisher Harlequin, which has been carrying erotic novels since 2006. " 'Fifty Shades' readers and new readers of 'Bared to You' don't tend to self-identify as readers per se, and they want books they can take out in public, whereas romance readers don't care. " The "Fifty Shades" books were originally released as e-books by the Writers Coffee Shop, an independent publisher based in Australia.
