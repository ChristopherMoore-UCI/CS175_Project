"I spend half my time doing space exploration and half building boxes that can search for people in a disaster," said James Lux, who created FINDER at the JPL. FINDER would be able to detect heartbeats in similar situations, which could help dictate rescue efforts. Because disasters rarely announce themselves ahead of time, and only a handful of prototypes are available, FINDER hasn't been used in a real emergency. Until then, Lux is working to shrink the FINDER hardware and mount it on a drone or helicopter. To get these devices into the hands of more emergency response crews, a separate company needs to license the technology and manufacture and sell the gadgets, which would probably sell for about $10,000, said Lux.
