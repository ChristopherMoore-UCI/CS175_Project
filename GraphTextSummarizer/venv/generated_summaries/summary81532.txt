Jallow says all this wouldn't be possible without Riders for Health (RFH), a social enterprise working to transform healthcare delivery across rural Africa and provide outreach health workers with the transport they need. "Barry came back and said there are children in rural communities who really need to be reached because they need immunizations; women are dying in childbirth and then 30, 20, 10 miles away in ministry of health car parks there are motorcycles and ambulances that are simply broken because nobody has been trained to repair them, there's no supply chain of parts, there's no knowledge of transport maintenance," remembers Andrea, a mother of three and former motorcycle racer. Andrea says the wellbeing of rural communities changes dramatically once they get regular access to health services. "It made us angry, actually, that women and children are dying in rural Africa simply because an old technology like a motorcycle or an ambulance with this internal combustion engine can't be managed -- well, that's ridiculous, that is crazy. "We have shown that the maintenance of vehicles is absolutely critical if you are going to be able to solve the health issues of rural Africa," says Andrea.
