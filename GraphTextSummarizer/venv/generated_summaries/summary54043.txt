Singapore-based Edward Teather, the senior economist for ASEAN at UBS, said the Philippines has experienced "a virtuous circle of improved stability" with more investments, lower inflation, currency valuations going up and interest rates coming down. The growth surge was driven in part by a recovery of electronics exports after a decline in demand last year, while analysts say the economy was buoyed by strong domestic consumption. These jobs could leave the country structurally well positioned going into a slowdown; as wealthier economies seek to cut costs, they tend to increase outsourcing to low-cost, English-speaking markets like the Philippines. Other factors that have aided in the country's growth early this year are the transfer of operations to the Philippines from Thailand by flood-disrupted businesses, said Teather, as well as improved electronics exports. "About 70% of our economy is from consumption, so remittance is the key fuel behind that," said Haj Narvaez, Manila-based head of research for the Philippines at Credit-Suisse.
