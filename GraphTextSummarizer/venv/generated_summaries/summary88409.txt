Keith and Mary Hudson, who arrived at Church on the Rise in Westlake, outside Cleveland, to host two nights of "prophetic services," said they attend Perry's concerts even though they don't love the idea of people worshiping pop idols. Katy Perry's parents, who are evangelical ministers, mentioned their famous daughter a number of times at religious services in Ohio on Wednesday, but sidestepped the issue of her divorce from Russell Brand. "I'm sure that Katy's trending on the Internet was to get you here to church tonight," Mary Hudson said in her opening remarks. "What has taken place in my daughter's life has opened many opportunities to go in and be with guarded and gated people," he said. What would heaven be like without your children?" At the end, the Hudsons signed books, sold jewelry to fund a women's mission, and gave away samples of Katy's perfume, Purr.
