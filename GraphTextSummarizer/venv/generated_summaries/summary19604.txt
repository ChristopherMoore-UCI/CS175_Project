While Arizonans on both sides of the issue, as well as the nation at large, keep keen eyes on Phoenix as Brewer ponders her decision, the governor has hinted that the issue, for her, may come down to whether the ban or protection of freedom -- depending on how you view it -- needs to be enshrined in state law. " Arizona constitutionally outlawed same-sex marriages in 2008, and legal experts say nothing in present Arizona law would prevent a business owner from discriminating against gays and lesbians, making SB1062 unnecessary. Instead of having an honest discussion about the true meaning of religious liberty, opponents of the bill have hijacked this discussion through lies, personal attacks, and irresponsible reporting," said Cathi Herrod, president of the Center for Arizona Policy, which lent a hand in scribing the bill. In Tucson, Rocco's Little Chicago Pizzeria took to its Facebook page to post a photo of a sign reading, "We reserve the right to refuse service to Arizona legislators." But since Thursday, when the state House of Representatives OK'd the bill by a 33-27 margin and sent it to Brewer's desk, what's right for Arizona has become somewhat amorphous.
