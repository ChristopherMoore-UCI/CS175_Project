That launch had been timed to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the birth of founding leader Kim Il Sung, the grandfather of Kim Jong Un. Park, who has been visiting North Korea for decades, said conditions for ordinary North Koreans remain bleak, though there is not the mass starvation the country suffered in the 1990s. "In the big scheme of things, Kim Jong Un must have thought that North Korea would be taken more seriously (after a rocket launch). His eldest half brother said in his book that he was concerned Kim Jong Un would fail to satisfy North Koreans. The rocket launch allows Kim to establish military security for North Korea, said Park, and allows him to move forward with another priority: economic progress.
