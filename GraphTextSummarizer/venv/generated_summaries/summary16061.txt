-- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe and Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai asked their respective parties to shun violence on Friday, a rare expression of unity between the political rivals. About 30 MDC supporters were injured after suspected Zanu PF militia had disrupted a rally where Tsvangirai was scheduled to speak. In 2008, political violence ahead of the presidential run-off resulted in Tsvangirai pulling out, citing violent attacks and intimidation by the militia of Mugabe's faction. Tsvangirai accused the police chief, Augustine Chihuri, an ally of Mugabe, of asking police to protect only Zanu PF supporters. It came after disturbances Sunday between Mugabe's Zanu PF party and Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change in Chitungwiza near the capital of Harare.
