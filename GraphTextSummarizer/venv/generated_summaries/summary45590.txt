United Russia, the party of Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, suffered big losses in the election, but retained its parliamentary majority. Tens of thousands of Russians turned out in central Moscow and across the country Saturday to protest what they believe were rigged parliamentary elections. Rally organizers and Moscow city officials agreed to allow demonstrators on Bolotnaya Square in Moscow Saturday. Election officials on Friday released the official results: 238 seats for United Russia; 92 seats for the Communists; 64 seats for Fair Russia; and 56 seats for the Liberal Democrats. Protests occurred in Krasnoyarsk, Vladivostok, Chita and Khabarovsk in eastern Russia.
