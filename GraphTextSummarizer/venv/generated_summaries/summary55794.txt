The U.S. Department of Justice issued a statement Friday afternoon that said the department's Civil Rights Division, along with the the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Middle District of North Carolina and the FBI, have opened "a parallel preliminary inquiry" to determine whether any federal laws, including hate crime laws, were violated. " Karen Hicks, who has been in the process of divorce, said her husband had been at odds with various neighbors of various backgrounds over parking. Suzanne Barakat, Deah Shaddy Barakat's sister, said Friday on CNN's "The Lead with Jake Tapper" that a disagreement over parking didn't spark the killings, because her family members knew to avoid the "disputed" parking spot. Many of the victims' friends and relatives gathered Thursday for their funerals and for candlelight vigils on college campuses such as North Carolina State University in Raleigh, which is where Barakat met his future wife, and where she and her sister went to school. Even if most of her North Carolina neighbors didn't wear the same Muslim head covering that she did, Mohammad believed that there were "still so many ways that I feel ... embedded in the fabric that is our culture," meaning the American culture.
