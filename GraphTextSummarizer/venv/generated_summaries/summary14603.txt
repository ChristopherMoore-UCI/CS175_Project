The PGA Tour still have three major holders as members -- in McDowell, Schwartzel and Oosthuizen -- but with Kaymer, along with Chandler stars McIlroy and England's World No. 1 Lee Westwood, opting to concentrate on the European Tour instead, the PGA Tour lost out on the memberships of two the top three players in the rankings, and three of the top 10. The four majors are held by two South Africans, in Schwartzel and British Open winner Louis Oosthuizen, a German in Martin Kaymer (U.S. PGA Championship), and an Irishman in Graeme McDowell (U.S. Open). Chubby the fixer Chandler's evolution to a super agent began in his 15 years as a journeyman professional golfer, where he earned a reputation as a man who sourced cheap flights and did things on a budget. Tiger leaves IMG, stays loyal to agent At Augusta in April, it was Chandler who bear-hugged Charl Schwartzel as the South African celebrated Masters victory. No wonder Chandler was smiling when we met at London's exclusive Jumeirah Hotel -- dressed in a slick gray suit and open shirt after yet another day of wall-to-wall meetings.
