The United States is experiencing its biggest spike in West Nile virus since 2004, with 241 cases of the disease reported nationwide this year so far, including four deaths, health officials said last weekend, before the latest totals. There are no medications to treat West Nile virus or vaccines to prevent infection. "This declaration will expand our avenues for assistance in our ongoing battle with West Nile virus," Jenkins said in a statement. West Nile virus on the rise in the U.S. Insecticide spraying by planes will be offered to certain communities hit hard by the virus as long as those local governments request it, Jenkins told reporters. Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins declared the emergency in his capacity as director of the county's Homeland Security and Emergency Management and instructed the department to file a local disaster declaration with the state.
