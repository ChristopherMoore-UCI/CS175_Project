-- The fourth and final suspect in the fatal shooting of two Arkansas university students turned himself in Monday, University of Central Arkansas police said. " The shooting, which happened outside a dorm, prompted a campus lockdown and the cancellation of Monday classes. He is not a student at the university, said Lt. Rhonda Swindle of UCA campus police. Police released little details on the suspects other than the fact that they were not university students. When the campus lockdown was ordered, Knight was stuck with other students for several hours inside the library, she said.
