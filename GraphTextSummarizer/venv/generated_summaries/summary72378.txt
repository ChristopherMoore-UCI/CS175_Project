I also had a score to settle from last year, when Jorge beat me on the final corner, so I am happy to be back on the top step of the podium!" Lorenzo, meanwhile, revealed that he had struggled to maintain the same pace as his rival, and blamed their coming together for the loss of valuable momentum. Marquez was delighted with the win, having missed out to Lorenzo at Silverstone last year. Gradually the front five eased away from the chasing pack, but remained close enough to one another to throw up some heart stopping moments as positions changed lap after lap. Ducati's Andrea Dovizioso had gatecrashed the Honda-Yamaha power party on the starting grid, and the Italian took his increasing confidence into battle with Dani Pedrosa and Valentino Rossi. The contest reached an electrifying climax in the final moments, with Marquez and Lorenzo diving into an uncompromising dogfight.
