-- German Chancellor Angela Merkel defeated her foreign minister Sunday to win another four-year term, according to exit polls reported by German television network NTV. NTV reported Merkel's center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party received 33.7 percent of the vote, based on exit poll projections. Steinmeier, meanwhile, conceded what he called "a bitter defeat" for the Social Democrats. The two parties currently are in a coalition, with Steinmeier as foreign minister. Merkel favors cutting taxes to spur growth, while Steinmeier opposes tax breaks.
