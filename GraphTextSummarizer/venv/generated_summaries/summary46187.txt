Stancil had worked for Lane, the school's print shop operator, as part of a work-study program, but was let go from the program in early March because of poor attendance, college officials said. During the interview, and during a court appearance in Florida on Tuesday, Stancil said Lane deserved to die, accusing him of being a child molester who'd made advances in online messages to Stancil's 16-year-old brother. "No, I don't need one," said Stancil, who stood before the judge with his legs shackled and his arms handcuffed in front of him. "I don't give a f--- what you want," Stancil said, lunging forward and lifting up the table in front of him. Stancil is accused of killing an employee Monday at Wayne Community College in Goldsboro, North Carolina.
