Yet authorities said days ago -- and Maine Department of Public Safety spokesman Stephen McCausland reiterated Friday -- that there is no evidence of any break-in or kidnapping. When asked Friday about communication between authorities and Ayla's family, McCausland said, "There has been contact this week, and we hope that contact will continue. Despite below-freezing temperatures, divers searched two bodies of water in central Maine on Friday, looking for signs of a toddler last seen more than seven weeks ago. A website created by Ayla's family disclosed the police findings in a posting that same day, saying investigators told them the blood found was "more ... than a small cut would produce. " Testing on blood found in the basement of Ayla's home determined that some of it belonged to the girl, McCausland said Sunday.
