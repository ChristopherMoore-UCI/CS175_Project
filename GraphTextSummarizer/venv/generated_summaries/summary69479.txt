The seven-time European champions, held 1-1 by Dutch club PSV Eindhoven in last week's Champions League qualifier, took the lead in the 14th minute when Mario Balotelli set up midfielder Andrea Poli. The Argentina international was denied a first-half goal by keeper Angelo Da Costa, who also saved from Kwadwo Asamoah's header, but he made no mistake from close range in the 58th minute after being set up by Paul Pogba. Verona celebrated the end of the club's 11-year wait for a top-flight match, as veteran former Italy striker Luca Toni headed two goals to defeat last season's third-placed team Milan. That match was marred by racist chanting by some home fans, and as a result Lazio's opening home match this season against Udinese will be played with a section of the stands closed. However, Juve's bid for a 30th scudetto began with few scares against the only team to have beaten the Turin side home and away last season.
