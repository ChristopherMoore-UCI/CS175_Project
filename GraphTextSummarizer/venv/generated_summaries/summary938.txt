William H. Macy, who won best actor in a comedy series for his performance in "Shameless," was just the opposite, loose and jokey. The award was accepted by star Uzo Aduba, who earlier had won her own Actor (the SAG Award trophy) for female actor in a comedy. The Netflix show won for best comedy series cast. She emotionally thanked a number of the show's principals, including creator Jenji Kohan. One of the performers from "Orange Is the New Black" joked during the red-carpet preshow to the 21st Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards that the TV director would need a wide shot to capture the cast if the show won.
