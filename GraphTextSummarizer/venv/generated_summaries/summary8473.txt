" Larger crews will arrive in Moore on Saturday to help with recovery efforts, including cleaning up debris and fixing homes. The group owns cranes to lift heavy debris, and it has plasma cutters that can slice through steel beams and concrete. In the last six years, Agoglia's group has responded to more than 50 large-scale disasters, including the 2010 earthquake in Haiti and Hurricane Sandy in New York. -- When an EF5 tornado touched down in Moore, Oklahoma, this week, Tad Agoglia and his First Response Team of America were stationed at a hotel about 30 miles away, ready to take action. About two hours after the storm hit, they were already on the scene using their specialized equipment to dig through the rubble at Plaza Towers Elementary School.
