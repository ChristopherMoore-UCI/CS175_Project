Syrian opposition members, including human rights activist Wissam Tarif, also said the deaths likely stemmed from a rift within security forces. The Syrian government insists it is stopping "armed terrorist groups" who carried out a "massacre" in the city; opposition activists say the government's claims are a ruse to justify a crackdown on demonstrators demanding government reform, in keeping with the wave of political protests across the Middle East and North Africa this year. Despite the Syrian government's consistent refusal to give CNN and other international news organizations permission to enter the country, a CNN reporter crossed the Turkish border into northwestern Syria for a few hours Tuesday. As for Jisr al-Shugur, the Syrian military seized control of the town over the weekend, a network of human rights activists said Monday. "The Security Council has failed, so far, to react on Syria, which I think is extraordinary and disappointing," said Carne Ross, a former U.N. diplomat.
