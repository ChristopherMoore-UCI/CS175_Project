" Oberle was passionate about studying chimpanzees, his friend Anthony Reimherr told CNN affiliate KXAN. "Chimpanzees are known to be violent, and they can kill other animals. Neville Pillay, head of animal behavior at Wits University, said that violence in chimpanzees is not at all unusual. Witnesses to the attack said that Oberle went into a no-go area because he seemed to want to remove a stone close to one of the animals that could have been picked up and thrown around, Cussons told CNN. Pienaar told CNN that his preliminary findings are that human error is to blame, but he cautioned that his investigation is not complete and that he wants to interview Oberle.
