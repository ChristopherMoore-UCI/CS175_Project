Scam artists are calling veterans and posing as VA workers who need credit card information to update prescription information, as part of a scheme that fraudsters have recycled over the years. Other schemes targeting veterans and active members of the military have surfaced over the years, including high-priced life insurance sales, payday loans, car title cons, repair scams and fraudulent discounts. Scam artists are calling veterans and posing as VA workers who need credit card information. "VA simply does not call veterans and ask them to disclose personal financial information over the phone." "America's veterans have become targets in an inexcusable scam that dishonors their service and misrepresents the department built for them," said Dr. Gerald Cross, the VA's undersecretary for health.
