-- A U.S. trade spokeswoman said Tuesday officials are looking into a recent New York Times report that said China has halted shipments of rare earth minerals bound for the United States and Europe. U.S. trade officials recently said they would launch an investigation into whether China subsidizes and protects its clean energy producers in violation of World Trade Organization rules. "We've seen the news report and are seeking more information in keeping with our recent announcement of an investigation into whether China's actions and policies are consistent with WTO rules," said U.S. Trade Representative spokeswoman Nefeterius Akeli. The New York Times also reported that China has been blocking shipments of rare earth minerals to Japan for the last month. "We strongly support USTR's investigation into whether China is blocking exports of critical minerals to the U.S.," said Rep. Sander Levin, D-Michigan.
