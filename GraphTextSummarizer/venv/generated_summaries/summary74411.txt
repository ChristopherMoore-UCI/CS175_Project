The OITNB writer is also reportedly dating one of the show's stars, Samira Wiley, the actress who plays Poussey and who sometimes pops up in Morelli's Instagram feed. But on the set of "OITNB," where she helped shape the story of main character Piper (Taylor Schilling) and her relationships, "these small moments came into sharp relief," Morelli continued. According to TMZ, Morelli and her husband of two years, Steve Basilone, have now amicably split and have jointly filed for divorce. As Morelli wrote in an essay for Mic.com in May, writing for the Netflix hit helped her realize that she was gay -- even though at the time, she was married to a man. "I went through it all on set: I fell in love with a woman, and I watched my life play out on screen," Morelli wrote on Mic.com.
