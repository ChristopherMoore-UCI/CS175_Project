Neither event should have occurred on the Dreamliner, Deborah Hersman, chairwoman of the NTSB, said last week. -- After eight days inspecting the Japanese company that makes the lithium ion batteries linked to problems that have led to the grounding of Boeing 787 Dreamliners around the world, aviation authorities have found no serious problems with the devices.
