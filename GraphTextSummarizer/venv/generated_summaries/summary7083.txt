Scientists at the European Space Agency (ESA), which is leading a consortium that includes NASA to find out more about the composition of comets and how they interact with the Sun, believe that if enough sunlight falls on Philae's solar panels it could revive. Beginning Thursday, mission controllers will send what O'Rourke described as "blind commands" to Philae in the hope that the lander has enough power to receive instructions even if it can't respond. From lander pictures, mission controllers think Philae, which is about the size of a washing machine, is tucked up underneath a cliff face, affording it some shade.
