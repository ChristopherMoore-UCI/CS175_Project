"I don't know about the accuracy of lie-detector tests," England captain Andrew Strauss told the UK Press Association on Wednesday on the eve of his side's third Ashes Test against Australia in Perth. " Strauss' team also came under the spotlight when Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Ijaz Butt made accusations -- which he later withdrew -- that some England players had themselves accepted money to fix match results. Cricket was shrouded in controversy earlier this year when three members of the Pakistan team became the subject of match-fixing allegations during a tour of England. " As well as the possible introduction of lie-detector tests, other suggestions included the legalizing and regulating of betting markets in India, the inclusion of anti-corruption clauses in playing contracts and the non-inclusion of "tainted" players. The education of players should not be a meaningless formality; the message should be pressed home with regularity by figures known and respected by the players.
