The Drive to Stop Diabetes campaign includes awareness and educational efforts at NASCAR Nationwide races this year, as well as at several off track health and wellness initiatives throughout 2013. I will continue to drive two to three more Nationwide Series races with Roush Fenway this year with the Drive to Stop Diabetes paint scheme. I continued the twice-daily workout regiment and the strict lifestyle change to allow me to drive a successful 2012 season in the ARCA Racing Series, as well as participate in select NASCAR Camping World Truck Series events. So my family and I started a foundation called Ryan's Mission to help educate and create awareness about living with diabetes. In 2013, my dream came to fruition; I was signed with Roush Fenway Racing as a development driver in the NASCAR Nationwide Series.
