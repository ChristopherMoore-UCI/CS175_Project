It will house a vast array of 9/11 artifacts, including "photographs, videotapes, voice messages, recovered property, clothing and other personal effects, workplace memorabilia, [and] incident-specific documents," among other items. -- Work on the National September 11 Memorial Museum has been halted over a budgetary dispute, delaying its opening, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg said. Bloomberg blamed the holdup on "disagreements" with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which is responsible for a portion of the project's financing. Work has basically stopped," Bloomberg said during a press conference Thursday. Bloomberg's disclosure of the setback came the same day the National September 11 Memorial & Museum Foundation announced that more than a million people have visited the site since it opened on the 10th anniversary of the attacks.
