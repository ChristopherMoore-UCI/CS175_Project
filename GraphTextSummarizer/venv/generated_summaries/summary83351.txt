But all eyes were left on Isinbayeva, who made three unsuccessful attempts to break her own world record of 5.06m. It was her third world championship title in the discipline. Bronze behind Suhr in the London Games last year was also a disappointment, but she has now gained redemption on home soil. Ukraine's Ganna Melnichenko won the women's heptathlon after holding off a determined challenge from Canada's Brianne Theisen Eaton, who is the wife of newly-crowned world decathlon champion Ashton Eaton of the United States. Olympic 800m champion David Rudisha was missing from the event he has made his own, breaking his own world record on the way to gold in London last year. Isinbayeva's gold was the second of the day for the hosts after Olympic champion Elena Lashmanova crossed the line first in the women's 20km walk.
