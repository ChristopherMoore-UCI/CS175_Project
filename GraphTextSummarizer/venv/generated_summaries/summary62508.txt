The problems caused by the war on drugs are even more damaging to societies than those caused by drug use per se. It emphasizes the need to shift from a strategy of eradication and interdiction of drugs to one focused more on drug abuse prevention and treatment. That comes as no surprise as a growing number of policy experts, pundits and politicians have reached that conclusion, including former Secretary of State George Shultz, former Mexican President Vicente Fox, and former Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso. The reality is that the strategy of drug prohibition, not drug use itself, is responsible for many of those pathologies. Thanks largely to Washington's pressure -- drug prohibition is a global folly.
