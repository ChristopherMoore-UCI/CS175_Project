-- Charlie Sheen advises people to stay away from crack cocaine "unless you can manage it socially," which he told a radio interviewer Monday he could. During the interview, the actor said "it's hard to say" how long he's been clean, saying he doesn't use the term "'sober' anymore, I'm not in AA, I don't believe in it." Dr. Drew Pinsky, a California-based addiction specialist, told HLN's Jane Velez-Mitchell that Sheen's rationalization of his substance abuse issues are an example of what he called "stinking thinking." Sheen said in Monday's interview that he was surprised by what he called a "forced hiatus." "I believe August of 2014 at this pace, I don't know," Sheen joked Monday. " While Sheen doesn't like to use the term "sober," he said Monday, "It's off and on, you know."
