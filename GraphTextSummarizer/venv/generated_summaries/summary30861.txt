Kamara got the shock of life when he walked into a room at the New York Stock Exchange and was greeted by Yankee brass and players, including star lefthander C.C. Sabathia along with Hall of Famer Reggie Jackson. "One time he was standing for class president and people came out with, 'Mobama, Mobama!' The Yankees celebrated Kamara's survival and community spirit here, where he has lived since coming from Sierra Leone, with the team's annual Project HOPE program. The last thing 18-year-old Mohamed Kamara from Sierra Leone expected was to be honored by the New York Yankees, but there he was, tossing out the first pitch at a Yankees-Detroit Tigers game last week. He didn't know it then, but his surprise itinerary would next include a chat with Mayor Michael Bloomberg, a visit to the United Nations to meet the ambassador from Sierre Leone and to stand on the rostrum of the General Assembly, plus that trip to Yankee Stadium to throw out the first pitch at the Yankee-Tigers contest Wednesday night.
