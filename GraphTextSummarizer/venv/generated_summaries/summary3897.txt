The entertainment network laid an egg on the red carpet Sunday in its lead up to the Golden Globe Awards when it listed Fox's 1991 diagnosis with Parkinson's disease as a "Fun Fact." "We understand the serious nature of the disease and sincerely apologize." Fox appeared on the red carpet with his wife Tracy Pollen. Not for E! and especially not for Michael J. Fox. As his Parkinson's progressed, Fox continued to act, although less regularly until his TV show debuted in the fall. "We regret the insensitive classification of Michael J Fox's Parkinson's diagnosis during our E online live stream," the network said.
