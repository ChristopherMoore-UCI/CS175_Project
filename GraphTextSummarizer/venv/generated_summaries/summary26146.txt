Tsarnaev's Instagram account wasn't widely known; CNN spoke with several friends of his who said they were unaware of its existence. Instagram makes clear in its terms of service that it will turn its records over to law enforcement officials when it receives a valid subpoena or search warrant. -- Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's Twitter account and VK Russian social networking profile have drawn heavy public scrutiny, but he left another, more hidden social media trail: a deleted Instagram account that sources close to him tell CNN once belonged to the accused Boston bomber. The digital traces that remain show that Tsarnaev added a "like" on several photos referring to Chechnya that were posted by other Instagram users. The Instagram account, with the user name "jmaister1," no longer exists, and friends of Tsarnaev's say it was deleted only recently.
