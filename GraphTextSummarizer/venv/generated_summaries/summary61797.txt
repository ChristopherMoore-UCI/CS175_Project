The comedy took an exciting turn for fans on Monday when Barney (Neil Patrick Harris) and Robin (Cobie Smulders) got engaged, leaving Ted (Josh Radnor) to search for new love after eight will-they-or-won't-they-moments between him and Robin. Ricky Gervais' 'Derek' trailer posted "There's still Ted Mosby, who is just the best friend in the world to Robin and to Barney, and he's still out there searching," Thomas said. If Barney and Robin have gotten to the place we've always promised and are heading toward a wedding potentially, what's in store for Ted? It sort of feels like a mini season finale even though it's just a midseason finale. How does he move into his future if we are watching Barney and Robin move into theirs?
