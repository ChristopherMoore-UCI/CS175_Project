"People at one time wanted to showcase all of the things they are buying and now they are stopping and really thinking about it." Brett Wright, co-founder and chief creative officer of Uptown Magazine, is also seeing evidence of that attitude shift. Renowned hairstylist and salon owner Philip Pelusi said he, too, has seen the focus shift to more bang for the buck during the economic downturn. Howard said he attributes the rush to downsize in part to the 24-hour news cycle, which continues to pepper the public with bad news. "People didn't have access to the constant drumbeat of news that they have now," he said.
