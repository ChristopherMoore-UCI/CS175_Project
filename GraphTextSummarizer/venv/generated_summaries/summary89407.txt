Bangkok faces worst flooding yet "As these megacities grow, more people are forced to live on exposed land, often on flood plains or other marginal land. Some of the world's fastest growing population centers in Asia and Africa are at greatest risk from the impact of climate change, according to a new report. The analysis, which forms part of Maplecroft's fourth annual Climate Change and Environmental Risk Atlas, also assesses climate impacts on towns and cities. But, as recent back-to-back batterings from typhoons has shown, it is very vulnerable to climate change and has the highest exposure to extreme weather of the top 20 fastest growing cities in the world, according to the report. Six out of the 20 fastest growing cities worldwide, including Calcutta, India, Manila in the Philippines, Indonesia's capital, Jakarta and Addis Ababa in Ethiopia, were also classified as at "extreme risk" by the CCVI.
