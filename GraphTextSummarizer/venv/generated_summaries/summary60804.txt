-- A new report from accountancy firm Deloitte has revealed that English Premier League wages are continuing to rise at a quicker rate than club revenues. In publishing their 20th Annual Review of Football Finance, Deloitte also revealed that revenues broke the two billion euro barrier ($2.9 billion) in season 2009/2010, although this was offset by the fact that wages now take up 68 per cent of that revenue. Rawnsley added: "Premier League clubs should still be well placed to comply with UEFA's new financial fair play regulations, as the Premier League remains the top revenue generating league in Europe. The report also confirmed that Chelsea have the largest individual wage bill, with total spending of $252 million, followed by Manchester City ($193 million) and Manchester United, who spent $191 million on players' wages in the 2009-2010 season. This shows an increase of 49 million euros ($71m) on the previous year, although that improvement is tempered by a 64 million euros ($93m) rise in wages, taking total payroll costs to 1.4 billion euros ($2 billion).
