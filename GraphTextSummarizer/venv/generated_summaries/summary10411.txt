Now a senior fellow on health care for the watchdog group Center for Media and Democracy, Potter writes a blog on health care reform. Wendell Potter once was a vice president in the public relations department for insurance giant Cigna. The former vice president of corporate communications at insurance giant Cigna, who left his post, says  the industry is playing "dirty tricks" in an effort to manipulate public opinion. Potter described how underwriters at his former company would drive small businesses with expensive insurance claims to dump their Cigna policies. Instead, the company released a written statement saying officials agree that health care reform is needed.
