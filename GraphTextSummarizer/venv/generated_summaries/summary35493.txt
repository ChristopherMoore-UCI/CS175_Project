Even the professionals can sometimes seem as fallible as ordinary hackers, but Goldberg believes that what separates the superstars of sport from the average person is an almost superhuman ability to "mono focus" on tasks. "My feeling is that it is really upstairs, that putting issues have to do with what's going on between the golfer's ears," says Dr. Alan Goldberg, a leading American sports psychologist who has worked with many players on the men's and women's U.S. circuits. So, just as top golfers need to do more than just drive a ball 300-plus yards, success in any sphere depends on combining physical capability with mental focus. Non-golfers can take this tip from Moran and apply it to a host of everyday tasks: "Seeing and feeling and performing a skill in your mind's eye, using your imagination to rehearse and practice it to perfection." It worked to brilliant effect for Keegan Bradley, who became the first professional to win a major with it earlier this year, but Goldberg believes that golfers who switch will make only temporary gains.
