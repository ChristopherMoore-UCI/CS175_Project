Today, flight data recorders use computer chips to record information about how the plane is working in flight. Flight data recorders capture a wide array of data, including altitudes, air speeds, headings, engine temperatures, flap and rudder positions. When the expected battery life runs out, possibly around April 6, the job of finding the flight data and cockpit voice recorders -- to which the beacons are attached -- will get significantly harder And, thereby, so will the job of solving the mystery of Flight 370. " Some have suggested designing flight data and voice recorders that detach from the plane on impact or shortly before impact. The next-generation pingers emit pings that can be heard 6 to 10 miles away, said Anish Patel, president of beacon manufacturer Dukane Seacom Inc. Uplinking information from plane to satellite before a crash The Air France crash spurred U.S. aviation safety officials to look into uplinking critical flight data to orbiting satellites from airplanes flying across oceans.
