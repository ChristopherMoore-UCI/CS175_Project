Although Tea Party candidates castigate earmarks, government spending and pork barrel politics, all of those who are victorious will represent constituencies profoundly affected by the money that Congress allocates every year. Like most Tea Party activists, O'Donnell has embraced the anti-Washington rhetoric that has been popular among congressional candidates in the current political climate. Unless Congress passes government reforms such as publicly financed elections to change that process, Tea Party politicians will either have to deal with it or languish. When pushing for signature legislation such as health care and financial regulation, the administration and Congress cut deals with the interest groups he once derided. During the Democratic primaries, Obama had differentiated himself from Sen. Hillary Clinton by blasting her for an "Inside the Beltway" mentality, depicting her as someone who, like her husband, was too willing to cut deals and too cozy with the interest groups that lurk on K Street.
