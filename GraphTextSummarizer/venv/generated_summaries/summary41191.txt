Ice harvesters often developed "ice man's knees," which were bruised and bloody from days of shoving solid ice. His name was Frederic Tudor, and 30 years later, he would ship nearly 200 tons of ice halfway around the globe to become the "Ice King." Tudor desperately explained how the cold blocks of ice could be used in the stifling Caribbean heat, but islanders weren't convinced. Perhaps it was his Yankee entrepreneurial spirit, or perhaps monomania, but Tudor was obsessed with the idea that ice would make him rich. The truth is that people never knew they needed ice until Tudor made them try it.
