Polls also show that an overwhelming 76% of voters, and 56% of Republicans, agree with the president  that the solution to our fiscal woes should include a mix of spending cuts and tax increases. The party cannot see beyond its insistence on protecting the rich from paying even a single penny more, while welcoming draconian cuts to programs that hurt the middle class and the most vulnerable, especially in the areas of education, health care, innovation and job growth. Zelizer: If spending is cut, GOP will get the blame Instead of trying to find a way to avoid these steep cuts, and to keep faith with their newfound concern for the middle class, Republicans are doubling down on the "my way or the highway" mentality that put them in an electoral hole to begin with. In his GOP rebranding speech, Cantor said: "We will advance proposals aimed at producing results in areas like education, health care, innovation and job growth." Construction jobs, manufacturing jobs, first-responder jobs -- all well-paying middle-class jobs, will get cut.
