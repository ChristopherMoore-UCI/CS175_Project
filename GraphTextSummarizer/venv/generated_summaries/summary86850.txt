Pierre-Pierre said it will be important for Haiti to choose a finance minister who has experience in the private sector, whose partnership with the government will be key to Haiti's future. "Too often in Haiti, we have loaded the government with good bureaucrats (and) not enough people with private sector experience." The inability to form a working government had raised concerns about Haiti's ability to move forward after a devastating earthquake in January 2010. President Michel Martelly, who took office in May, congratulated his new prime minister, saying that the installation of new leadership was a step forward in implementing change in Haiti. -- It has been nearly a year since Haiti held elections, but it was not until late Tuesday night that the troubled nation finally was able to form a new government.
