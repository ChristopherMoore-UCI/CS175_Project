Lohan was supposed to be performing community service at a downtown Los Angeles women's center, but the judge said Lohan posted nine excused absences at the center since her last court hearing on July 21 -- and performed, at most, only two hours of service. -- A Los Angeles County judge revoked probation for Lindsay Lohan on Wednesday after reprimanding the actress and her attorney in court for Lohan's failure to comply with her community service. Judge Stephanie Sautner's ruling, once Lohan made bail, the actress must perform 16 hours of community service a week -- over a minimum of two days a week -- at the Los Angeles County morgue before her probation violation hearing November 2. At one point during the hearing, Los Angeles city attorneys Lisa Houle and Melanie Chavira asked the court to revoke Lohan's probation and impose jail time because of Lohan's failure to do the community service. After the hearing, Lohan publicist Steven Honig released a statement: "Lindsay is hoping this matter will be resolved on November 2 and the court will reinstate probation and allow her to continue fulfilling her community service."
