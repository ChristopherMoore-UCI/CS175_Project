Boehner noted that previous executive action by Obama to halt deportations of some undocumented children led to the current border crisis by "giving false hope to children and their families that if they enter the country illegally they will be allowed to stay." In his statement, Obama announced he was ordering a shift in security resources to border regions, and he promised the additional action he can take "without Congress but within his existing authorities to fix as much of our broken immigration system as we can." The President also sent Congress a letter asking that legislators work with him on providing additional money and leeway to deal with the situation on the southern border.

"The failure of House Republicans to pass a darn bill is bad for our security, is bad for our economy, is bad for our future," Obama said.
