" Bronfman, the son of Canadian liquor mogul Samuel Bronfman, became chairman and CEO of the Seagram Company in 1971. Bronfman died of natural causes, according to Jonathan Cohen, a spokesman for the family's Samuel Bronfman Foundation, named after his father, a wealthy liquor mogul. "He was the first of his kind, a titan of industry that dedicated himself fully to advocating, advancing and encouraging the Jewish people," said Dana Raucher, executive director of the family's foundation. Edgar Bronfman was surrounded by family when he died, Cohen said. Bronfman is survived by his wife, Jan Aronson; his brother, Charles Bronfman; his sister Phyllis Lambert, four sons; three daughters; 24 grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.
