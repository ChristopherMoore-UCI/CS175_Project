Fortunately, there are good fish -- fish that are healthy to eat and responsibly caught in ways that are good for the health of other fish and our oceans. Plus healthy fish are caught or farmed responsibly, which prevents endangered fish populations -- yes there are many -- and ensures that dolphins or other sea creatures aren't harmed by fishing nets. According to SeafoodWatch.org, a helpful resource on these issues, healthy fish must have low levels of mercury and provide high levels of Omega-3s (the good oils our bodies can and should be getting from eating fish). Responsible fish eating won't solve all our ocean and fish problems around the globe. With the world's fish supplies already cut down by environmental hazards, mass fishing technologies like bigger boats and bigger nets have cut the fish population even further, which in turn limits reproduction and natural repopulation.
