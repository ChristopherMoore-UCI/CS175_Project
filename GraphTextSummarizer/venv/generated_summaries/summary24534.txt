Ratings have decreased in recent years, as the show's producers have tried several new judges -- this season's include Mariah Carey and Nicki Minaj -- to join Jackson. To put all of the speculation to the rest, after 12 years of judging on 'American Idol,' I have decided to leave after this season," Jackson said in a statement, released through his representative. In his statement Thursday, Jackson said he was "very proud of how we forever changed television and the music industry." "It's been a life-changing opportunity, but I am looking forward to focusing on my company, Dream Merchant 21, and other business ventures," he added. Fox representative Jill Hudson says the network has no comment on Jackson's announcement. Still, "American Idol" could take solace having already left other renowned TV shows -- "Seinfeld," "All in the Family" and "M*A*S*H" among them -- in its wake having been America's most popular program for the most consecutive seasons.
