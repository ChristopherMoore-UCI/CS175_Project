News of the latest planned launch does not come as a complete surprise to North Korea watchers. South Korea will work closely with the international community, including fellow members of the so-called six-party talks on North Korea -- the United States, Japan, China and Russia -- to stop Pyongyang's "provocative act," it added. "The path to security for North Korea lies in investing in its people and abiding by its commitments and international obligations." It said North Korea had acted with utmost transparency on its last "peaceful scientific and technological satellite launch," and would "fully comply with relevant international regulations and usage" this time too. " It would be also in direct violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions 1718 and 1874, under which North Korea is barred from testing ballistic missile technology, she said in a statement.
