But those who prefer their Winter Olympics to be held in places that actually feel like winter, and require the wearing of hats and jackets, can look forward to the 2018 games in Pyeongchang, South Korea, where daytime highs rarely go above 0 C (32 F) and night-time lows average -11 C (12 F). These mountain peaks rise over 2,300 meters, and since air temperatures generally cool with height, it means these venues stay 5 - 10 C (41 F - 50 F) degrees cooler. This was the case on Monday, when Sochi reached a balmy 15.9 C (61 F) -- warmer than any other Russian city by more than 1 C. Compare that to the coldest location in Russia -- Siberia's Jikimda, which hit -50 C (-58 F). Most people think of Russia in winter and picture the snow-covered cathedrals of Moscow, where average temperatures in February range between minus 10 Celsius (14 Fahrenheit) and minus 4 C (24.8 F) and all but require the wearing of those iconic fur hats. Like Vancouver, Sochi is a coastal town and has a much warmer climate than the surrounding areas, including the "Mountain Cluster" venues where the skiing, snowboarding, and sliding events -- bobsled, skeleton and luge -- are taking place.
