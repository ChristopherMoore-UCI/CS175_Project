If the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 caused a rift in China-Malaysia relations, the two countries appear to have put it behind them. According to Hong Kong's South China Morning Post, China's Ambassador to Malaysia sought to distance these "radical views" from his country's official position. Lee Hwok Aun, an economics lecturer at the University of Malaya, agreed bilateral trade is not expected to fall off as Malaysia's primary exports to China consist of electrical components and raw materials such as crude rubber and palm oil -- critical to China's own economy. According to Malaysia's Ministry of International Trade, China was Malaysia's largest trading partner for the fifth consecutive year in 2013. Tourism numbers were equally positive, with 1.79 million people visiting from China last year -- an increase of 14.9% from the previous year.
