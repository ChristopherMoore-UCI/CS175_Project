Name: Veronica Noone, 33, an online interactive designer at University of Maryland-Baltimore County who lives in Perry Hall, Maryland. Noone believes the outside motivation of having a child made it easier for her to lose weight because she was also being healthful for her son. "I didn't have to be perfect," she says about her plan to lose weight. After college she gained more weight, topping 200 pounds. After she had her baby, she decided to lose the post-baby weight and the extra pounds she'd been carrying years before that.
