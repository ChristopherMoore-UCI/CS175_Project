While overall beer sales dropped slightly, craft beer enjoyed 17.2% growth last year. "Where this can go over the next 20 years is going to be huge as people's palates change and more and more people begin to appreciate craft beer," says Hall. Despite that upswing, craft beer still only captures 7.8% of the overall beer market, which still leaves plenty of room for industry growth. Growth in the industry has inspired entrepreneurs like Hall to create business based on craft beer tourism. According to the Brewers Association, a craft brewer is defined by being small (six million barrels of beer or less), independent and using traditional ingredients in their beer.
