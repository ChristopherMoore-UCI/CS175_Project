Gombe, in northeastern Nigeria, is one of the sites that has faced repeated attacks blamed on the militant Islamic group Boko Haram. Either one or two suicide bombers struck outside a stadium Monday in Gombe, Nigeria, after President Goodluck Jonathan ended a campaign rally at the site and had left, officials said. Fwaje Atajiri of the Gombe Police Command said six people had minor injuries. The bomber was "a long distance" from where the rally had taken place, due to security measures, Atajiri said. But rescuers and medical sources said both women were suspected to be suicide bombers.
