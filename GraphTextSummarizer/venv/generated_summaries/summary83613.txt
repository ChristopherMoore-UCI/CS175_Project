As he and his five cohorts pursue educational and athletic endeavors around the nation, Beard hopes they won't be dogged by racial matters but that they'll be "superstars, not from being the Jena Six, but from whatever we go to college for." Howard and Parson have confidence Beard will succeed, no matter his occupation. Watch Beard describe his reaction Â» Alan Howard met Beard, the youngest of the African-American teens who made up the Jena Six, in January 2008 when he began representing him in a lawsuit filed by beating victim Justin Barker. "I promise you I will get you out of Jena, whatever it takes," Howard told Beard. Howard said his first impression of Beard -- that he had "tremendous character, tremendous resilience and tremendous potential" -- was so strong he invited the teen to live with his family in New England. Living with attorney Alan Howard, right, has afforded Jesse Ray Beard a bevy of new experiences.
