" Many New Orleans residents already live on the edge emotionally. Louisiana National Guard members arrive at the New Orleans convention center during preparations for Gustav. After the storm, the city lost -- and hasn't completely replaced -- many of its hospital beds devoted to mental health, and also many of its psychiatrists, psychologists and social workers, leaving it ill-equipped to handle its chronic caseload, let alone any spike in mental health care needs brought on by potential stressful events like Gustav. Still, New Orleans is not a complete wasteland in terms of mental health services. "Throughout the country, mental health is in crisis, and in areas that are impoverished and recently devastated like New Orleans, they are certainly struggling," says Mills, who is also an ER physician at the Louisiana State University emergency department at the University Hospital in New Orleans.
