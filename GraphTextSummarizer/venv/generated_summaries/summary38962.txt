The Multnomah County Sheriff's Office released a flier Friday with pictures of Terri Horman, who told investigators she last saw her stepson, Kyron Horman, 7, inside Skyline Elementary School in Portland on June 4. Jason Gates issued the following statement Friday on the decision to request information on Kyron's stepmother: "Detectives work in this case is exhaustive and they, along with Kyron's family, are asking for the community's assistance regarding anyone who saw not only Kyron, but also who may have seen Terri Horman and/or the truck she was driving that morning. In a brief phone interview with CNN, sheriff spokeswoman Lt. Mary Lindstrand said the focus of the investigation is not on Terri Horman. Kyron's family released a statement Friday urging the public to help bring him home. "At any time did you see Terri Horman at or near the school?" was among the questions in the form.
