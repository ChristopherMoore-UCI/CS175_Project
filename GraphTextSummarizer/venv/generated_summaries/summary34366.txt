-- Liverpool are waiting to learn the extent of the injury which prevented captain Steven Gerrard playing in the club's 2-0 win at West Bromwich Albion on Saturday, manager Kenny Dalglish has said. " Gerrard and Carragher are products of the Liverpool youth academy, with both players part of the team which earned a penalty shoot-out victory over Italian side AC Milan in the 2005 European Champions League final. Dalglish will hope to have the duo available for the home match against Swansea City on Saturday. England international Gerrard, 31, missed the match after picking up an infection in his right ankle, having only recently recovered from a groin injury which has restricted the midfielder to just four English Premier League appearances this season. Dalglish also faced questions on the fitness of former England defender Jamie Carragher, who was ruled out of the match at the Hawthorns with a calf strain.
