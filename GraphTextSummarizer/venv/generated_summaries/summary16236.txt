-- Tom de la Hunty took Dutch bobsledder Edwin van Calker to the Whistler Sliding Center track one last time Tuesday and asked his driver if he could do it. "This was my last chance to do something special," said the 33-year-old, who competed in the 2002 Winter Olympics and the 2004 Summer Olympics on the track team. The coach and his pilot walked the course, and de la Hunty told van Calker to think about it, giving him an hour to make a decision. But Arnold van Calker said the death had no influence, and Edwin van Calker agreed that the track was not to blame for his decision. Van Calker told his coach he just couldn't drive this track and so on Wednesday the four-man No. 1 sled from the Netherlands pulled out of the Olympics.
