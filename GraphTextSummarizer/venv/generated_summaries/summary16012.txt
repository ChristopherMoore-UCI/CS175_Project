The detection rate for noninvasive breast abnormalities improved at radiology facilities that adopted CAD technology, but, crucially, the rate did not improve for invasive breast cancers, the dangerous type that invade healthy tissue in the breast or other parts of the body. Is it really doing the job that the radiologists want it to do?" Health.com: Celebrities who battled breast cancer The Food and Drug Administration approved the first CAD software in 1998, after a series of small clinical studies found that CAD could boost breast cancer detection without causing an unacceptable number of false-positives, cases in which doctors mistakenly identify benign abnormalities as cancerous. The new investigation shared the same overall design, but the researchers addressed criticisms directed at the earlier study by including a larger number of CAD screens and by excluding mammograms interpreted in the first three months after a facility adopted CAD, when radiologists were becoming accustomed to using the technology. " Medicare pays doctors an additional $12 per mammogram for CAD over and above the reimbursement for the mammogram itself, which ranges from about $80 (for conventional film-screen mammograms) to $130 (for newer digital mammograms). "Women should probably understand that CAD is probably being used to interpret their mammogram and that it's probably not helping detect breast cancer earlier," says Joshua J. Fenton, M.D., the lead author of both studies and an assistant professor of family and community medicine at the University of California at Davis School of Medicine, in Sacramento.
