Roadside blasts in Helmand province, which is in southern Afghanistan, killed eight people earlier this month. Wednesday's attacks came a day after Taliban fighters opened fire on coalition fuel trucks in southwest Afghanistan, killing six drivers and injuring 10 other people, according to a local official. Civilian casualties in Afghanistan increased 23% in the first six months of this year, the United Nations said in a report released at the end of July. At least 40 of the ISAF vehicles burned in the attack in Farah province, said provincial government spokesman Abdullrahman Zhwandai. The attacker rammed his car, laden with explosives, into a military convoy in Lashkargah, Helmand province spokesman Omar Zwak said.
