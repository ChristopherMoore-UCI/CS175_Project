Economic growth suffers Transparency International says the extent of corruption within countries has an impact on their own economic growth, and there's a risk of problems being exported with trade and investment. It's based on perceptions of public sector corruption, from the perspective of business people and country experts. "The 2014 Corruption Perceptions Index shows that economic growth is undermined and efforts to stop corruption fade when leaders and high level officials abuse power to appropriate public funds for personal gain," Ugaz said in a statement. The Corruption Perceptions Index highlights the problems that emerging economies have with public sector corruption, misappropriation of funds and bribery, said Jose Ugaz, the chair of Transparency International, in a press release. Countries at the top of the index should make sure they don't export corrupt practices to underdeveloped countries," Ugaz added.
