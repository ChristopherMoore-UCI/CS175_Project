Under the conditions of his bail, Wright had to surrender his passport to police and must report once daily to Cape Town police, NATJOINTS said. -- A British journalist has been arrested in connection with the incident a week ago in which a fan entered the England football team's dressing room during the World Cup, South African authorities announced Tuesday. In the interview published June 20, Wright wrote, "As South African police hunted high and low for Pavlos, unaware of his name and scouring CCTV (surveillance camera footage) for his face, the man at the centre of it all was calmly sitting down to breakfast with the Sunday Mirror." He appeared in Cape Town magistrates' court -- the dedicated World Cup court -- late Monday and was released on bail of 3,000 rand ($393). The fan, Pavlos Joseph, was arrested after he entered the England dressing room following their goalless draw with Algeria.
