"The chef or cook already in preparing (a meal) puts salt on it, and the client without tasting it adds more salt on top," said restuarant owner Hector Toublanc. A study by European researchers released just weeks before the new Buenos Aires salt restrictions discounted the link between salt and hypertension. "On average, each Argentinian consumes 13 grams of salt daily, while according to the World Health Organization, you should consume less than five," Health Minister Alejandro Collia said when he announced the change last month. Hypertension, commonly known as high blood pressure, has been linked to high salt and sodium consumption, but there is still debate on the issue. In an effort to combat hypertension, which affects some 3.7 million residents in the province -- nearly a quarter of the population, the health department reached an agreement with the hotel and restaurant federation to remove salt shakers from the tables at their eateries.
