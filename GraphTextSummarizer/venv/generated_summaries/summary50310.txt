El Paso police said that while they were responding to the shooting, the El Paso 911 center "received numerous calls advising of shots fired near the border in Juarez, Mexico." Just about a mile separates downtown El Paso from Juarez. -- A bullet thought to have been from a shootout between carjackers and municipal police in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, struck a woman walking in neighboring El Paso, Texas, Tuesday morning, El Paso's mayor told CNN. Reyes said her school is about "seven or eight blocks" from downtown El Paso and she never heard gunfire from Juarez. In June 2010, the El Paso City Hall was struck by several rounds, which local police believe the shots may have come from a shooting in Juarez. El Paso Mayor John Cook said local police investigating the incident had not officially confirmed that the bullet came from Juarez, but they were "treating it as if it did," he said.
