This is an issue Jobs has raised in prior speeches, yet he freely addressed the point of comparison, saying Apple has activated 75,000 more iOS devices over the last 30 days compared to Google's last reported Android activation number. -- Apple's Steve Jobs gave quite a monologue Monday, dressing down competing makers of smartphones, tablets and software. "We believe integrated will trump fragmented every time." Later, Jobs criticized Google for not having a version of Android that plays nicely with tablets. Additionally, Jobs said tablet makers will have a hard time matching Apple's prices.
