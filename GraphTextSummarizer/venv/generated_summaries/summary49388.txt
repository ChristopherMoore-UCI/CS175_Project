There are a few schools of thought about the mechanism: Some think statins cross the blood-brain barrier, decreasing cholesterol levels and amyloid levels. But we should note, while tolerated well by most people, they do have side effects, including two potentially serious ones: â€¢ Liver damage: Occasionally, statin use causes an increase in liver enzymes and may cause liver damage. Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN chief medical correspondent: Alzheimer's disease is a progressive, neurodegenerative disease characterized in the brain by abnormal clumps (amyloid plaques) and tangled bundles of fibers (neurofibrillary tangles) made up of misplaced proteins. The most immediately promising benefit of statins appears to be their anti-inflammatory properties, which help stabilize the lining of blood vessels. Also, studies have shown exercise in general, especially in overweight people, can improve HDL levels.
