CNN's meteorology unit estimates, if winds blow as forecast, New York metro area airports could see average delays of two to three hours, and Boston's Logan airport could be even worse. Parts of upstate New York, including Buffalo and Syracuse, were seeing flakes on Tuesday night. "We have a sergeant assigned to each of the balloons," New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said. A massive storm that started in California soaked a huge swath from Florida to New England, with snow and sleet falling in pockets of Pennsylvania and New York. Sustained winds in New York -- where the thermostat should hit 55 degrees by 5 a.m. -- will reach 19 to 24 mph, with gusts blowing as strong as 55 mph.
