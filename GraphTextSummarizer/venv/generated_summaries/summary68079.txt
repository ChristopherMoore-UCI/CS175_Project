The settlement agreement, which holds the district responsible for implementation and oversight, resolves eight discrimination complaints alleging widespread harassment of Asian students at South Philadelphia High School, and will remain in effect until June 2013. The attacks followed years of harassment against Asian students at South Philadelphia High School, according to the complaints filed with the state and federal government. " Complaints were triggered by events on December 3, 2009, during which large numbers of Asian immigrant students from South Philadelphia High School were assaulted in and around the school throughout the day. The December 2009 boycott brought nationwide attention to the violence against Asian students at South Philadelphia. The Philadelphia School District on Wednesday signed a 2Â½-year civil rights agreement with the U.S. Justice Department to address anti-Asian immigrant violence at South Philadelphia.
