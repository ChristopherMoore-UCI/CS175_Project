The boys from Chicago's South Side also got hearty congratulations from outside the Windy City, including ex-Chicago White Sox great and baseball Hall of Famer Frank Thomas and longtime President Barack Obama adviser David Axelrod. Chicago's Little League team named for the baseball icon -- who broke his sport's color line -- is headed to the Little League World Series championship, after topping Las Vegas in the U.S. title game on Saturday. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel credited "their positive attitude and success on the field (for rallying) people from every neighborhood." Chicago entered its own contest Saturday as the underdog. That victory set off jubilant celebrations at the game in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, as well as Chicago, including among locals who cheered after watching the final outs at a Cubs game at Wrigley Field.
