Prime Minister: 'Terrorist' killed soldier 'in cold blood' Mayor: 'Combat soldier (killed) in cowardly ambush' Cirillo "was a very proud member of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders," Col. Lawrence Hatfield from that regiment told reporters Wednesday night. His life ended late Wednesday morning in downtown Ottawa, as he stood guard at the National War Memorial in ceremonial uniform with white gloves alongside another soldier at the National War Memorial. "It's said (the unit's) history is written in blood in so many different places." Ottawa's National War Memorial, though, wasn't supposed to be one of them. "They've had an immense fighting history," Bob Bratina, the mayor of Cirillo's hometown of Hamilton, Ontario, told CNN partner CTV. After his death became public, pictures began appearing online showing Cirillo recently at the memorial in his full ceremonial garb, kilt included.
