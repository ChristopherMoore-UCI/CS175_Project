Gillespie said his group has found many artifacts on Nikumaroro, including fish bones and a small "ointment pot." "You learn patience," TIGHAR executive director Ric Gillespie said Wednesday night about the findings. Lewis, who will discuss his findings Thursday, said in his report posted on TIGHAR's website that two procedures detected possible human mitochondrial DNA, but he was unable to repeat the result. Earhart disappeared near the island in 1937 while flying around the world with navigator Fred Noonan. TIGHAR has DNA samples from a female relative of Earhart that could be tested with any bones definitively found to be human, Gillespie.
