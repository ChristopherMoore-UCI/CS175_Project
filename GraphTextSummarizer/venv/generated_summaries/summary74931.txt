Bart, or "zombie cat" as the feline is now being referred to on social media, was discovered "unresponsive" by his owner last week lying in a pool of blood. It's like a plot line ripped from the scripts of "The Walking Dead" -- if the show's cast were made up of cats and took place in Florida. Bart was in bad shape, McCutchen said, with maggots covering open wounds on his body, and he had difficulty walking. "If we'd seen that cat on the road, we'd assumed he was dead," Nash McCuthchen with the Humane Society told CNN. But remarkably, McCutchen said, the kitty had no internal injuries, making the Humane Society able to treat him.
