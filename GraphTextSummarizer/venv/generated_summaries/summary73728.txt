But then there are the unaffiliated groups -- Hillary 2016, Hillary Clinton Super PAC, Hillary FTW, Hillary PAC, Madam Hillary 2016 and more. Although America Rising PAC has become the top Republican super PAC against Clinton, there is also Stop Hillary PAC and a handful of other small groups. -- A group of pro-Hillary Clinton super PACs had it all figured out a few months ago: One would handle the email list, another the rapid response and another would spearhead the big-dollar fundraising. That grassroots mission statement is similar to what Ready for Hillary founders said when in 2013, strategists talked about getting young progressives so excited that their enthusiasm would compel Clinton to run. The problem is that you can't control their message, so someone could go out there and start running ads who thinks they are helping Hillary Clinton, even though she might not like the message."
