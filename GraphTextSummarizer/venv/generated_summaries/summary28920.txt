In other words, what we're looking at is: -- A transfer of Greek and other southern European debt to all the people of Europe. A Greek default would trigger, in effect, a bank run on every governmental institution in southern Europe, the biggest bank run perhaps in the history of the world, bigger even than the run triggered by the failure of Lehman Brothers in September 2008. The European Union will have to assume responsibility for the debt of southern European countries. -- Big government spending cuts especially in southern Europe, but also everywhere else. And if markets get the idea that the politicians of northern Europe will flinch from the Super TARP, then the bank run could start very fast.
