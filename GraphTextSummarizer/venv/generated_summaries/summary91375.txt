And it also points to the woeful lack of understanding on the part of most Americans -- those who would dismiss Guillen's words and Cuban exiles' reaction to them as irrelevant -- about the Cuban-American experience, versus the understanding that Americans have of the Jewish experience. Castro is not Hitler, but Le Batard's claim that Castro is "our Hitler" -- a sentiment echoed by many exiles -- points unavoidably to the fact that the way Cuban-Americans feel about Castro is a lot like the way Jews feel about Hitler. " Dan Le Batard, a journalist for The Miami Herald, explained, "Without getting into comparison shopping on atrocities ... for Cuban-Americans, he's our Hitler." Older Cubans still recount with great pain their memories of Castro's infamous "paredons," or firing squads, to which he summarily subjected thousands of his enemies at the beginning of his revolution. Beatings during detention have also been reported." Dr. Bernie Fernandez, a renowned Cuban-American doctor in Miami and CEO of the Cleveland Clinic Florida, recalled that when he was 5 and living in Cuba, his father Bernardo, a doctor, became disillusioned with the Castro regime and sought permission to emigrate. Indeed, if Guillen had expressed his love and respect for Hitler instead of Castro, his punishment would have been immediate and severe -- and no one would be dismissing his statement as irrelevant.
