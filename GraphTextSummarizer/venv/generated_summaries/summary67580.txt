First reported as extending five acres, the fire eventually grew to 50 acres, said Hillsborough County Fire Rescue spokesman Ronnie Rivera. The National Weather Service had issued a hazardous weather outlook for the area, warning that "dry fuels and low relative humidity will result in favorable conditions for the spread of wild fires. Conditions had improved enough to allow for I-75 traffic to resume moving northbound; southbound traffic was still stopped because of poor visibility. By 3:15 p.m., the fire was contained -- although, by then, a mobile home was destroyed and several vehicles had burned, according to Rivera. Video on CNN affiliate WFTS's website showed white smoke rising near the highway -- as throngs of vehicles in one direction sat seemingly at a standstill -- and mingled with puffs of clouds on an otherwise picture-perfect spring day.
