Even the oft- heard local phrase "Keep Austin Weird" is not an endorsement of the town's many hippies and hipsters, but instead a slogan of the Austin Independent Business Alliance to promote small businesses. For proof, head to Congress Bridge in Austin, Texas where hundreds of thousands of bats gather between March and October. During March in Austin, there is live music and then some. But stopping by the Driskill each evening for a nightcap, the only ghosts I saw were those of children past who've grown up to be tipsy and tarted up young adults raring to take on Austin's abundant nightlife. Like a gangster buying turkeys for his neighborhood on Thanksgiving, at SXSW, big business throws concerts and gives away booze to the culture it co-opts and profits from.
