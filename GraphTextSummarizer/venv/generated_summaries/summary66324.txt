During a trip to the mostly Muslim nation of Albania, Pope Francis rebuked militants who act in the name of religion, saying no one can act as the "armor of God." "Let no one consider themselves to be the 'armor' of God while planning and carrying out acts of violence and oppression," Pope Francis told diplomats at the presidential palace. He denounced those who have perverted religious spirit and who are engaged in violence that prevents harmony between people of different faiths. On his way to the palace, he rode through the streets past multitudes of cheering fans and onlookers in an open Pope mobile. "May no one use religion as a pretext for actions against human dignity and against the fundamental rights of every man and woman, above all, the right to life and the right of everyone to religious freedom."
