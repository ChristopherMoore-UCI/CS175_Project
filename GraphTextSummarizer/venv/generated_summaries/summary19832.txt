Judge Murilo Mendes originally sentenced Joseph Lepore and Jan Paul Paladino to four years and four days in prison, but then Monday commuted the sentence to community service to be carried out in the United States. -- Two American pilots involved in a plane collision over the Brazilian Amazon that resulted in the deaths of 154 people were sentenced to community service, a Brazilian judge ruled. The sentence stems from a September 2006 incident where, according to court records, the Legacy 600 jet the two were piloting made contact with a Gol Airlines Boeing 737. The case caused controversy between the United States and Brazil when local officials confiscated the pilots' passports. Brazilian officials say that the pilots turned off the Legacy's transponder, something that the pilots flatly denied during a videoconference.
