The contest against Guinea, whose players have spoken of their determination to do well for a country devastated by the Ebola virus, showed the familiar frailties that have hindered an Ivory Coast team boasting star names such as Yaya Toure, Wilfried Bony and Gervinho. Just before the hour mark, a bad situation for the Ivorians seemed likely to become worse when Gervinho -- who had shown more purpose than most of his teammates before the break -- was sent off for needlessly lashing out at Naby Keita. But there were more questions than answers for coach Herve Renard, who took over from Sabri Lamouchi after the team's failure to make it through the group stages of last summer's World Cup in Brazil, after this 1-1 draw. Seydou Doumbia came to the rescue when he rounded off a well-worked move to equalize after 72 minutes, steering his shot into the bottom corner after Bony's neat control and layoff. He showed that he was unafraid to make bold changes when he brought off Toure with five minutes remaining, with the Manchester City star looking decidedly unimpressed as he made way for Cheick Doukoure.
