"The combat dolphin program in the Crimean city of Sevastopol will be preserved and redirected toward the interests of the Russian navy," state-run Russian news agency RIA Novosti reported Thursday. The U.S. Navy in San Diego also trains dolphins and sea lions to help protect its assets and find dangerous objects underwater. Harnessing the military power of animal intelligence Ukraine was using outdated military equipment for the dolphin program and planned to disband it next month, RIA Novosti said. Weeks after Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimea region, it plans to take custody of dolphins in the nation as well. They detect sounds and objects in murky waters that human beings can't, making them uniquely effective at highlighting dangers on the sea floor.
