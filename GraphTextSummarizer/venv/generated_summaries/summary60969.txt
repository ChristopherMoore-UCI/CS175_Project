A former Florida A&M University band member has been sentenced to more than six years in prison for organizing the hazing that killed drum major Robert Champion Jr. Dante Martin, 27, was one of 15 people charged in the 2011 hazing incident. A medical examiner ruled Champion's death a homicide, saying he suffered multiple blunt trauma blows and internal bleeding from the beating. The initiation requires pledges to run down the center of the bus while being punched, kicked and assaulted by senior members, band members have said. I don't hate you at all," mother Pam Champion said. In court Friday, both Champion's mother and father addressed Martin.
