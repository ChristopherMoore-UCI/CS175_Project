"Someone should not be able to walk into a restaurant and order a plate of an endangered species," said U.S. Attorney Andre Birotte Jr. Authorities do not yet know where the meat came from. During the last visit in March, officials with the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration observed the activists asking for "kujira" or whale meat. Critics say that Japan's research is actually a pretext for retrieving whale meat to be sold in markets and restaurants. Armed with a hidden camera, the two women captured the waitress serving them whale and horse meat and identifying them as such, a federal criminal complaint said. While it is considered a delicacy in Japan and some other countries, meat from whale -- an endangered species -- cannot be sold legally in the United States.
