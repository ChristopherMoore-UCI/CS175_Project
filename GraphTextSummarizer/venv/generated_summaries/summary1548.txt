South Indian Muslim composer A.R. Rahman won an Academy Award for best song for "Slumdog Millionaire's" anthemic "Jai Ho," Ahmad observed. Ahmad, who was born in Pakistan and grew up in New York, has set himself an ambitious goal -- not only fighting Muslims' own misconceptions about their religion, but reclaiming the very word "jihad" from extremists. "He said to me, "The Quran promotes cultural diversity, so why not play with rockers?'" Ahmad's done some high-profile collaborations of his own, including recording a song with American rocker Melissa Etheridge. And Ahmad's mentor, Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, performed with Peter Gabriel and Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder. " "My music takes equal inspiration from classic rock like Led Zeppelin and the Beatles and also Sufi poetry," he said, citing a mystical Muslim tradition.
