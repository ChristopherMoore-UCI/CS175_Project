"I think people are going to look back at this Paralympic Games and for the first time really, truly believe that Paralympic sport is not just inspirational, it's hard-core sport," said Pistorius. This would be yet another triumph for the London 2012 organising committee whose chairman, Lord Coe fervently believes that the British public will never view sport nor disability in the same way after this summer's Paralympics. The achievements of Kenya's Mary Zakayo have also helped change attitudes to Paralympic sport in Africa. "Because of my success in field events, more women with disabilities in my community and in Kenya have shown interest in sports," Zakayo says. The Star newspaper in Pistorius' home nation captured an emotion reverberating around the globe saying that the Paralympic Games have marked a watershed in the way the planet views disability.
