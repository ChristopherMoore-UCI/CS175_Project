-- A fourth person who died while in the custody of Bahrain police in recent days may have been tortured "Four detainee deaths in nine days is a crime, not a coincidence," said Joe Stork, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch. "Bahrain is flagrantly violating the most basic human rights by arbitrarily detaining hundreds, keeping their whereabouts secret, and covering up the reasons for deaths in custody," Stork said. The human rights agency did view the body of another person who died in custody -- protester Ali Isa Saqer -- and said it showed signs of "horrific abuse" and torture. Human Rights Watch said there were at least two other people who have died in the custody of police in Bahrain recently.
