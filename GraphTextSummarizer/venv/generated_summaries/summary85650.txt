" Ice storms covered parts of the state Friday, with moderate snowstorms expected to continue into Saturday morning, the National Weather Service said. In western Louisville, three adults were found dead Friday morning of apparent carbon monoxide poisoning from a generator the family brought indoors, Mayor Jerry Abramson said. The emergency reflects the challenges faced in states such as Kentucky, where many rural and remote regions struggle to keep warm and dry under dire weather conditions. "Western Kentucky has obviously been hit very badly by this storm," Beshear said Friday. The storm caused the largest power outage in Kentucky's history, with more than 607,000 customers out of power.
