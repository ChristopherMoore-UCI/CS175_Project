As students and teachers trickled back to school Thursday, the community turned out to show support. The first shot hit the ceiling, said New Mexico State Police Chief Pete Kassetas. "I told her last night she didn't have to go if she didn't feel like she wanted to, and she said, 'well, I can't be scared to go to school,' is what she told me this morning," Florence Dosher Nieto told CNN affiliate KRQE. "They have a counselor in every single classroom," Martinez told CNN affiliate KOAT. They held up signs with the words "Love," "Hope," "Faith," and "Courage." Gov. Susana Martinez greeted the students as well.
