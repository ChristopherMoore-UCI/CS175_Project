In recent years, Anonymous has been involved in some of the most high-profile cyberattacks on the Web -- hobbling the websites of governments and businesses, hacking into sites to reveal private data and, along the way, getting dubbed cyberterrorists by authorities in the United States and elsewhere. " While official news sites in China made no mention of the hacking claims, the matter was raised at a briefing of China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs Thursday.
