-- A typhoon off the coast of the Philippines is fueling monsoon rains, which flooded the capital city of Manila and could trigger flash floods and landslides, forecasters said on Wednesday. The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration said that the western part of Luzon will experience monsoon rains on Wednesday, which could cause flash floods and landslides. "More than half the city and about 75% of metro Manila area had floods," she said. Veronica Lon, a CNN iReporter, said about 35% of metropolitan Manila is submerged under water and hundreds of families are in evacuation centers. The Philippine government said Typhoon Kabayan was expected to enhance the monsoon over the entire island of Luzon, where Manila is located, according to the country's National Disaster Risk Reduction Management Council.
