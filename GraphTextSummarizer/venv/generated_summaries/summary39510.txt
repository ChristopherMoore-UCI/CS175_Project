Compared with this loss of private sector demand, the stimulus was about $700 billion, excluding some technical tax fixes that are done every year and have nothing to do with stimulus. The collapse of the bubble in nonresidential real estate cost the economy another $150 billion in annual demand, as did the cutbacks in state and local government spending as a result of lost tax revenue. Contrary to what Republican politicians tell us, private businesses don't run out and create jobs just because we throw tax breaks at them and profess our love. If the government doesn't create demand, then we will be doomed to a long period of high unemployment -- just as we saw in the Great Depression. In a world where politics makes further stimulus impossible, work sharing is our best hope.
