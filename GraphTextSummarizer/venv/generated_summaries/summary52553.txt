According to Paradon Patthanathabut, national security adviser to the former government, the protest encampment of the populist "Red Shirts" had been cleared with military assistance. Armed soldiers in green camouflage rushed about, blocking entrances and exits as military vans, apparently carrying factional leaders, drove away. Soon, television programming fell silent, and Army chief Gen. Prayuth Chan-ocha took to the air to confirm the news of a military takeover after five hours of talks meant to find a solution to Thailand's festering political crisis. Traffic was jammed downtown -- not unusual for rush hour in a city of nearly 7 million people. At first, everything seemed routine -- an uneventful end to a second day of meetings between Thailand's bitter political rivals.
