"The NCAA takes any allegation of point shaving very seriously because sports wagering threatens two of our core principles -- the well-being of student-athletes and the very integrity of intercollegiate sport. "We are very concerned by the point-shaving allegations involving Auburn University men's basketball program and have been in contact with the school and the FBI since the issue arose in February," the NCAA said this week in a statement. The NCAA says it has contacted the FBI after point-shaving allegations were lodged against Auburn University's men's basketball program. "Auburn officials were made aware of a rumor regarding an allegation two weeks ago and immediately reported it to the FBI, the NCAA and the (Southeastern Conference). " Auburn also says it has contacted the FBI.
