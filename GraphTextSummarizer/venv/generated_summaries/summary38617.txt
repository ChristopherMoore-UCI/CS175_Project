-- Tens of thousands of people marched through Chile's capital Thursday, demanding lower tuition and other reforms in the nation's education system. "The education policies must be redesigned," Jaime Gajardo, president of the College of Professors, told CNN Chile. But protest organizers said massive marches were necessary to make the government take notice. High school students in Chile have also been conducting sit-ins and protests. Police said at least 70,000 people took to the streets in Santiago, CNN Chile reported.
