The distance is rarely run by top-level athletes, though in 1997 the previous year's Olympic 100m champion Donovan Bailey of Canada took on 200/400 gold medalist Michael Johnson in an unofficial clash to determine the "world's fastest man" -- but the American pulled up short with a leg injury. This time the Jamaican headed off fellow West Indian Daniel Bailey of Antigua (14.88) and third-placed Brazilian Bruno Barrios (14.91). -- Sprint star Usain Bolt gave sports fans a taste of what to expect at the 2016 Rio Olympics when he won an exhibition race on Copacabana beach on Sunday. Before Bolt set the record in 2009, the previous best over 150m was the 14.80 recorded by Italy's Moscow Olympics 200m champion Pietro Mennea in 1983. He won in a time of 14.42 seconds on a specially constructed track in hot conditions in front of a reported 3,000 spectators.
