The Swiss maestro swept aside world number two Andy Murray in straight sets in their semifinal match up and afforded Djokovic the same treatment with a 6-1 7-5 victory to claim his 16th Masters crown. -- Roger Federer sent out an ominous message to his rivals by claiming the Masters 1000 tournament in Cincinnati with a straight sets demolition of Novak Djokovic in the final on Sunday. Djokovic had played superbly to dispatch former world number one Rafael Nadal in their semifinal and had not dropped a set all week, but had no answer to the world number one. Federer was playing his second tournament since returning to the ATP Tour circuit after becoming the father of twin girls and was back to his peerless best ahead of the U.S. Open at Flushing Meadow next week. Federer duly served out the match to love, claiming his third Cincinnati title as his Serbian opponent netted a return after one hour and 30 minutes.
