Maryland's Court of Appeals ruling means that dog owners — and their landlords — are responsible for any injuries caused by pit bulls. " As founder and president of the Atlanta Underdog Initiative, Ami Ciontos carefully vets prospective dog owners before adopting out pit bulls. " Originally bred for bull baiting in England, pit bulls gained favor stateside for their athletic build and extreme tenacity, traits that made pit bulls the breed of choice among dog fighters, says Upshur. Pit bull owners, rescue groups and nonprofit organizations have criticized the ruling, which places breed-specific legislation back in the spotlight. The Baltimore Sun reports of early fallout from the ruling, including landlords threatening pit bull owners with eviction.
