"When you look at that parade on the day of the inauguration, every building that we will pass by ... has been surveyed, and that is done by the Countersniper Team," said Secret Service director Mark Sullivan. On Tuesday, in addition to the snipers, an estimated 8,000 police officers will be on duty, along with almost 1,000 FBI personnel, Transportation Security Administration screeners and others, including 10,000 National Guard troops. "I think we are ready," said Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff. There are fewer than 100 countersnipers in the unit, a Secret Service spokesman says. On Tuesday at the inauguration, members of the U.S. Secret Service's elite countersniper unit will be out in force, taking  roof-top positions along Pennsylvania Avenue and elsewhere as the presidential motorcade glides past throngs of people for the swearing in of Barack Obama.
