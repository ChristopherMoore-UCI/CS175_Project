-- John Isner of the United States and his French opponent Nicolas Mahut made tennis history at Wimbledon on Wednesday as they contested the longest grand slam singles match of all time -- and it is still to be finished. " Isner had match point at 59-58, but Mahut saved it with an ace and went on to level again. During the marathon fifth set, the pair surpassed the previous record of six hours and 33 minutes set at the 2004 French Open, when Fabrice Santoro beat fellow Frenchman Arnaud Clement 6-4 6-3 6-7 3-6 16-14. The giant Isner has also set a world record for aces in a match, sending down 98 with Mahut notching up 95. Mahut, who had appeared the less tired, said: "We played for too long, I don't know how many hours we played.
