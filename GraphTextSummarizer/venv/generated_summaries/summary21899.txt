-- Injuries continue to strike down the planet's top football players ahead of this month's World Cup in South Africa, with Dutch star Arjen Robben's participation in doubt and key Nigeria midfielder Jon Obi Mikel forced to withdraw. Coach Carlos Alberto Parreira's team will kick off the tournament against Mexico in Johannesburg's new Soccer City stadium on Friday. Nenad Milijas scored a penalty and Marko Pantelic scored in successive minutes just before halftime, while Eric Choupo-Moting reduced the deficit on 67. Ghana gave a full debut to Germany under-21 international midfielder Kevin-Prince Boateng, whose half-brother Jerome is joining English club Manchester City from Hamburg on a five-year contract from July 1. The 31-year-old has been ruled out of Saturday night's final friendly against Switzerland, and is battling to be fit for the Azzurri's Group F opener game against Paraguay on June 14.
