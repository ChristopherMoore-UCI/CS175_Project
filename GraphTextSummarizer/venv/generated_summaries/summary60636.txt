With the increased violence in Afghanistan, international observers say they have seen more and more children being recruited by armed groups and national forces. Suicide attacks have risen in Afghanistan since the U.S.-led invasion to topple the Taliban began in late 2001, after the 9/11 attacks on New York and the Pentagon. Shakirullah, 14, is convicted of planning to carry out a suicide bombing in Afghanistan. On this day, Shakirullah attends a rehabilitation class, easily lost in the crowd of boys with shaved heads. Rubbing his face with his hand, he says he now spends his time dreaming of his life back home in rural Pakistan.
