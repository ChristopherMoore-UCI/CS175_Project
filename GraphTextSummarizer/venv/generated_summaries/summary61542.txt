-- Passengers on Monday vented their fury at Eurostar management as train services between England and France were canceled for a third day, leaving thousands stranded. A later statement from Eurostar said tests on winter weather devices on trains had been successful and that if further trials went well Monday the operator hoped to have 26,000 seats available. The trains that broke down in the tunnel malfunctioned because the air inside was warmer than that outside the tunnel entrance in France, Eurostar spokeswoman Amelle Mouhaddib said. However, Nicolas Petrovic, Eurostar chief operation officer said a full service would not resume until after Christmas, according to AFP. As we suspected, the acute weather conditions in northern France have caused the disruption," Eurostar said.
