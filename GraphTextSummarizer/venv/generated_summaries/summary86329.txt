" Charles Kammer, a religious studies professor, says he was not surprised to learn that a majority of evangelical Christians support the use of torture in certain circumstances. A survey conducted by the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life found that white evangelical Christians are more likely to support torture than people who rarely or never attend religious services. What happens when people like Cordier, who rely on their faith in God and their flag, are asked if they would support torture against suspected terrorists? Cordier says some of his fellow prisoners lost their faith in God because of torture, but he didn't. Cordier says he would never support torture, but his views would make him a minority among a certain segment of Christians, according to a provocative survey.
