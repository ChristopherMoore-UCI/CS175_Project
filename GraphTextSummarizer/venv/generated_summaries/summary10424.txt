In second place, "Django Unchained" galloped away with a terrific $30.7 million over the Friday-to-Sunday period, bringing its total to $64 million since its Christmas day debut. Only time will tell whether "Les Mis" can match the impressive $170.7 million total of Chicago, which began a platform release in December 2002 and rode a wave of awards attention to box office glory, but for now, its prospects don't look miserable at all. After winning Christmas day and spending its first three days atop the box office, "Les Miserables" finished the weekend in third place with $28.0 million. Warner Bros.' $250 million fantasy prequel was held out of the top spot from Tuesday until Thursday by "Les Miserables," but over the traditional weekend frame "Hobbit" dipped only 11 percent to bring in $32.9 million, and its domestic total now stands tall at $222.7 million. Given its robust debut, "Django Unchained" will very likely become Tarantino's highest-grossing film ahead of 2009â€²s "Inglorious Basterds," which earned $120.5 million total.
