Firefighters have stopped the northward advance of the second-largest wildfire in recorded Arizona history and are now focusing on its eastern flank, crossing the New Mexico border to build suppression lines meant to starve the flames into submission, authorities said Monday. She, her daughter and her grandson were leaving Phoenix for home Monday morning, Kelvin Walker said. More than 100 law enforcement officers are working with the incident to ensure public and firefighter safety, as well as protect residents' property during evacuations, authorities said Monday evening. Residents were already moving back to the towns of Springerville, Eagar and South Fork after authorities lifted evacuation orders on Sunday. Light winds after dark and an atmospheric inversion will hold smoke at the surface overnight going into Tuesday morning, authorities said.
