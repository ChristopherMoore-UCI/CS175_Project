Most sports stars have chosen to stand for nothing, believing instead that donning a uniform on game day and dazzling the world with their superior athletic skills somehow fulfills their contribution as American citizens. The league can and often does, however, dictate how players can appear in public when at work (games, practice, press conferences), but only when the players are at league-sanctioned events, or in uniform. â€¢ Hall of Fame player and ESPN analyst Cris Carter, among others, spoke out on-air against child abuse in the wake of the Minnesota Viking Adrian Peterson child abuse story. The world is often an ugly place, but this slow rebirth of activism by professional athletes is a beautiful thing to witness: â€¢ LeBron James spoke volumes last year with his powerful #wearetrayvonmartin photo tweet featuring himself, Duane Wade and other Miami Heat players protesting with hoodies pulled tight over their famous faces in the wake of the shooting of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed African-American teen who was shot and killed by a neighborhood watch volunteer in Sanford, Florida. The NBA and other sports have also declined to fine or sanction players who have recently protested in some form for Trayvon Martin.
