His idea for natural cosmetics with healing properties came from trying to teach his students how the science they were learning in class could be applied in practical ways: "I teach chemistry so I showed my students how you can test a plant, and know the capacity of that plant to kill bacteria," says the young entrepreneur, who launched his company in a bid to supplement his income from teaching Nshimyumuremyi also wanted to use the local medicinal plants, used by some traditional healers, in a scientific way. Today, his company Uburanga Products, which makes herbal jelly and soap from local medicinal plants, is worth $30,000 and employs 12 workers. Ten dollars -- that's all that Rwandan science teacher Cephas Nshimyumuremyi had to start his business with two years ago. Like with many new businesses, the greatest challenge Nshimyumuremyi had to overcome was getting the word about his product out to a wider audience, without having money to advertise. "The $10 helped me to purchase the empty bottle in order to put my product on the market," says Nshimyumuremyi, winner of the Educat -- GT Bank Entrepreneurship Award 2014, a local business prize.
