Man's desperate search for wife, child in Philippines Finally on Thursday, they tasted rice -- the staple of Filipinos' diets -- for the first time in a week, after it was given out at the convention center for the first time since the typhoon struck. A queue of people, taking shelter from the fierce sun and intermittent rain under colorful umbrellas, snakes out of the remnants of the terminal building and into the wreckage-laden parking area. So much has changed over the past six days in this Philippine city on the Pacific Ocean, some 575 kilometers (360 miles) southeast of Manila. Clothes hang from the upper floors, and makeshift shelters constructed from storm debris have sprung up around it. Along some streets, groups sit among the stinking piles of wreckage, huddled around small fires cooking food.
