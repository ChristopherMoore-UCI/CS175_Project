The AAU got "cryptic, brief" e-mails -- signed only as "shrimp breath" -- on November 7, 8 and 9 -- that "alleged, in a very general way, that Bobby Dodd engaged in child sexual abuse," said the spokesman. "(Stout) told Mr. Dodd to go focus on your health, go through this surgery and we'll deal with this issue later," said Sachs. "Despite those denials, the AAU officers directed that Bobby Dodd leave the premises and leave his position (as president and CEO) for an indefinite period," said Sachs. "Bobby Dodd is no longer part of the AAU," said Sachs. In that meeting, Dodd claimed he'd gotten similar phone messages and insisted he was innocent, according to the spokesman, who said he'd spoken with several AAU officers at that meeting.
