"UEFA has decided that vuvuzelas may not be brought into stadiums at matches in UEFA competitions," a statement on the governing body's website said. " The plastic horns have divided opinion since July's competition in South Africa, with numerous English Premier League clubs banning them from their stadiums. -- The drone of the vuvuzela will not be heard in any European competitions after the continent's governing body banned them from all stadiums hosting UEFA matches. The plastic trumpets that were used by fans at the FIFA World Cup in South Africa, will be banned from the Champions League and Europa League, as well as all Euro 2012 Qualifying matches. In the specific context of South Africa, the vuvuzela adds a touch of local flavor and folklore," the statement read.
