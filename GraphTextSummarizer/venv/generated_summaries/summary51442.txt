Amesbury, Massachusetts-based John McInnis Auctioneers says it is auctioning off 723 lots of documents, photographs, letters and gifts from the estate of David Powers, longtime friend and special assistant to President John F. Kennedy. The mid-numbered lots focus on one-of-a-kind photographs from the 1960 campaign and JFK's ensuing presidency, some signed by first lady Jacqueline Kennedy. McInnis appraiser Dan Meader told CNN that the family engaged McInnis last May. Powers traveled with JFK from 1946 to 1963 and was the curator of the John F. Kennedy Library and Museum until he retired in 1994. "The auction is in chronological order, from the earliest to the latest stuff, to follow the lives of Dave Powers in relation to the Kennedy family," Meader said. The president's personal Air Force One bomber jacket, given to Powers in 1962 or 1963, gets its own catalog page, as does a May 29, 1963, birthday card signed by JFK's young son, John Jr.
