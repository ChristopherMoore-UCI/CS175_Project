With every delay, the global attention on Virgin Galactic intensifies to prove that it will accomplish what it set out to do years ago. Virgin Galactic refers to its space tourists as "passenger astronauts." They ignite the spacecraft's rocket engine, creating G-forces that pin passengers back in their seats, according to Virgin Galactic. It will be interesting to learn what really happens during the six minutes of weightlessness that Virgin Galactic says passengers will get on each flight. After the weightless portion of the flight -- if all goes according to plan -- passengers will strap themselves back into their seats before the spacecraft yields to the forces of gravity and begins its glide downward toward sweet Mother Earth.
