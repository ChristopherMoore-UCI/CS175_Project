A soldier and a comrade who came to his aid were stabbed Tuesday on the streets of Nice in southern France, officials said, the latest instance of French authorities coming under attack on their native soil. Officials cannot confirm he's related to Amedy Coulibaly, the man who killed a police officer in the Paris suburb of Montrouge, then took hostages in a kosher grocery in the French capital, a standoff that ended with him and four hostages dead. Estrosi tweeted that he wants French troops in Nice to be supplemented by reinforcements. French intelligence was aware of Moussa Coulibaly, 30, and alerted Turkish officials when he flew to Istanbul's Ataturk Airport from Rome on January 29, said an official in the Turkish prime ministry. They were among the French military forces who have been out on the streets around sensitive sites following last month's terror attacks that included the massacre at the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo.
