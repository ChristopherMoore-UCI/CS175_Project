But considering that next weekend is Halloween weekend, and there won't be a "Saw" movie (or any other horror film) to compete with it, "PA3" may actually hold up fairly well. Both movies, along with "The Ides of March" in fifth place, dropped only about 30 percent from last week -- an indication of strong word of mouth. Horror films are frequently saddled with underwhelming grades from the market research firm, but by comparison, "PA2" earned a more respectable "B" rating. In semi-wide release, the G-rated basketball drama "The Mighty Macs" opened to $1.1 million at 975 theaters, for a paltry per-location average of $1,090. And the Sundance drama "Martha Marcy May Marlene," featuring a breakout performance by Elizabeth Olsen, grossed $138,000 from four theaters for a superb $34,500 per-location average.
