The United Nations has declared famine in six areas of southern Somalia, including Mogadishu. -- Somalia has the world's highest mortality rate for children under age 5, according to data released by the United Nations Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation. Now we anticipate this number of deaths will be even greater," said Rozanne Chorlton, UNICEF representative in Somalia. "Somalia's child mortality rate in 2010 stood at 180 deaths per 1,000 live births, which now ranks worst in the world," the United Nations Children's Fund said in a media statement Friday. Somalia has been plagued by constant violent conflicts and has recently been hit by a devastating famine.
