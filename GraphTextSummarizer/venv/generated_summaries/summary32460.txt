Today, more than 80% of children around the world receive a complete course of life-saving vaccines during their first year of life. Vaccines have nearly eliminated polio, and significantly reduced the incidence of life-threatening diseases such as measles, pneumonia and severe diarrhea. In Pakistan and Nigeria, female health care workers risk their lives to get polio vaccines to children in areas of conflict. With vaccines, children have a much better chance of growing up healthy and becoming productive members of their community. Without vaccines, children are vulnerable to many deadly and disabling diseases.
