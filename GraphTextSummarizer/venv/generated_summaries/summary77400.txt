The agreement ends a class-action lawsuit that NAD filed in 2010, claiming that Netflix's website was a "place of public accommodation" that was out of compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act. "The National Association of the Deaf congratulates Netflix for committing to 100 percent captioning, and is thrilled to announce that 48 million deaf and hard of hearing people will be able to fully access Netflix's Watch Instantly services," said NAD CEO Howard Rosenblum in a press release accompanying the decree. In June, however, Netflix definitively lost that argument, when a Massachusetts federal judge ruled [PDF] that the new law was meant to "complement, not supplant" the Americans with Disabilities Act. The agreement says that Netflix will put captions on new content within 30 days by 2014; within 14 days by 2015; and within 7 days by 2016, "and shall strive to reach a point at which Conforming Captions are provided simultaneously with launch at all times." Netflix provides its service on more than 1,000 devices; its captioning service works on most, but not all, of those. Netflix said that the ADA didn't apply in this case, because it was superseded by a new law directing the FCC to set rules for online captioning.
