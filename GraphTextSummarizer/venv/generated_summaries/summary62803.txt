" Though Action Comics No. 1 is best known for the Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster story that created Superman, the issue -- which has been rarely reprinted in full -- has several other tales inside. There's "Chuck Dawson," foe of crooked cattlemen; "Zatara: Master Magician," "champion of law and order"; and "Scoop Scanlon, Five Star Reporter," who uncovers corruption with the help of photographer pal Rusty James. David Tosh, an auctioneer specializing in comics with Heritage Auctions in Dallas, says that posting a full scan of a classic comic is "unusual," but he believes it's beneficial to everybody -- including DC Comics, which owns the rights to Superman. Nevertheless, when it comes to historical work, Superman -- who will return to the movies next year with DC stablemate Batman -- still reigns supreme. But even if you don't have that kind of dough, you can see what the historic issue -- rated 9 out of 10 by CGC Comics, an independent grading authority -- looks like thanks to a scan the company posted on its website.
