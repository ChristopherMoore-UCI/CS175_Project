In the storm's path Its outer bands have already brought rain to the northern Philippines, where authorities have issued storm warnings for more than 15 provinces. Packing winds as strong as 260 kilometers per hour (162 mph) on Friday, Super Typhoon Usagi is forecast to plow through the Luzon Strait that lies between Taiwan and the Philippines on Saturday.
