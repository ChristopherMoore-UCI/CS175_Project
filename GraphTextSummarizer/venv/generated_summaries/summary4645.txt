"This is an extremely difficult time for the people of this new nation, and it is crucial that aid agencies have the resources they need to save lives in the coming months," said Toby Lanzer, UN Humanitarian Coordinator in South Sudan. In places like Bor, conflict had become a part of life, except perhaps for a brief time after South Sudan was born. In the South Sudan city of Bor, memories of 1991 are playing out in real time. South Sudan's breathtaking descent into widespread conflict comes a little more than two years after the nation was ushered into existence with help from international powers after decades of civil war between separatists in the oil-rich south and Sudan's government in Khartoum. More than two decades later, after South Sudan achieved independence from Khartoum, after it became the world's newest nation, people are again dying.
