Meanwhile, a Misrata opposition council member accused Gadhafi of using Libyan state television as an effective command-and-control center after NATO airstrikes damaged lines of communications and made troop control difficult. A witness in Misrata said NATO planes were flying overhead Saturday, but he had not seen evidence of bombing. " In Tripoli, four thundering explosions were heard Saturday evening -- believed to have been caused by NATO airstrikes -- followed by about 30 minutes of sustained anti-aircraft fire. Ahmed Hassan of the Misrata opposition council said at least five people were killed and 44 others were wounded Saturday, after one witness saw a hail of rockets fall on the central Libyan city. Medecins Sans Frontieres said Saturday that it had evacuated nearly 100 people by boat from Misrata.
