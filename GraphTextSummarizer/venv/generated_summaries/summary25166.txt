As President Obama battles slumping poll numbers and multiple world crises, twice in the past few days he has laid part of the blame for an anxious public at the feet of the media. Also in 2012 during a commencement speech at Barnard College he told the students: "No wonder that faith in our institutions has never been lower, particularly when good news doesn't get the same kind of ratings as bad news anymore. In part, we're just noticing now because of social media and our capacity to see in intimate detail the hardships that people are going through. In 2012 while discussing descriptions of his image as aloof, he told Time magazine, "My suspicion is that this whole critique has to do with the fact that I don't go to a lot of Washington parties and, as a consequence, the Washington press corps maybe just doesn't feel like I'm in the mix enough with them, and they figure, well, if I'm not spending time with them, I must be cold and aloof." " But at the same time he blamed the explosion of social media for accentuating this concern.
