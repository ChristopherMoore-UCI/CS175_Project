The complaint also names five other top Bush administration officials: former assistant attorney general Jay Bybee; former deputy assistant attorney general John Yoo; former Defense Department general counsel William J. Haynes II, former Undersecretary of Defense Douglas J. Feith and Vice President Dick Cheney's former legal counsel, David S. Addington. Garzon has investigated human rights abuses of former military governments in Chile and Argentina, Islamic terrorists operating in Spain, the armed Basque separatist group ETA, as well as major drug traffickers. -- Prosecutors will recommend that a Spanish court drop its investigation of six former officials in the administration of U.S. George W. Bush for alleged torture of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay, Spain's attorney general said Thursday. Yoo, the author of a memo which critics say authorized torture, testified before the same subcommittee soon after in June 2008, saying that his role in the administration had simply been to provide legal advice. Former Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales and five other ex-Bush administration officials are accused in the human rights group complaint of allegedly sanctioning torture at the Guantanamo Bay detention center.
