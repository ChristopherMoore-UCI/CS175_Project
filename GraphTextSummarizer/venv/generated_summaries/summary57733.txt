The revelation came from attorney Londell McMillan, who also corrected a report that he was one of the lawyers Katherine Jackson replaced Thursday. Katherine Jackson's legal team has asked that a member of the Jackson family "have a seat at the table" as a third executor. "The evidence precipitated the change and the need to take it in a new direction." Contrary to statements made at court Thursday, McMillan was not one of the lawyers replaced, Katherine Jackson said Friday. Katherine Jackson's objections, instead, have centered on what her lawyers said were possible conflicts of interest by the two men named in the will as executors. The Jackson estate is currently controlled by John Branca and John McClain, who would become permanent executors unless Jackson's will is challenged.
