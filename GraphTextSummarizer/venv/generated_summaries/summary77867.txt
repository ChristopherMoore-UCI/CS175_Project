"The question why am I racing this race as opposed to other dirt races is because of the charities involved and to support Tony Stewart and his foundation," says NASCAR driver Brian Vickers. -- NASCAR driver Carl Edwards is currently at the top of the Sprint Cup leader board, but another driver is leading the pack in charitable endeavors -- two time champion Tony Stewart. Five time NASCAR champion Jimmie Johnson says he's proud of Stewart's charitable efforts and that racing for these hospitals really hits home for him. When asked if he accepts the title of role model in his charitable efforts, Stewart humbly answered that he hopes he's been one. Ryan Newman races for Stewart's NASCAR team, Stewart-Haas Racing, and is an eager participant.
