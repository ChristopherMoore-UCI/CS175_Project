The administration said Southers is a senior fellow at the University of California-Los Angeles School of Public Affairs and holds a bachelor's degree from Brown University as well as a master's degree from the University of Southern California, where he is currently pursuing a doctorate in policy, planning and development. Those employees include some 45,000 screeners, known as transportation security officers, who provide security at 450 airports nationwide, and an undisclosed number of federal air marshals -- plainclothes officers tasked with preventing or interrupting hijackings. "Out of the new management team, I would say he was the most well-received and most well-liked." McClain said Southers brought more weaponry to the department's tactical team, increased the focus on intelligence, and had the team train with security forces from Israel's El Al Airlines. In addition to serving as assistant chief of the Los Angeles Airport Police, Southers is associate director at the Center for Risk and Economic Analysis of Terrorism Events at the University of Southern California. His name had been floated for the federal job earlier this year and was warmly received by unions and airport screeners, who say Southers will embrace collective bargaining for screeners.
