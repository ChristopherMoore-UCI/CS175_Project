"Putin really believes that he's basically crushed the opposition, that he doesn't have to worry about them anymore," Dougherty said, calling the move a commentary on Russian society that now has relative political stability after major anti-government demonstrations in 2011. -- Less than two months before the world focuses on Russia for the Sochi Olympics, President Vladimir Putin is handing out "get out of jail free" cards. " Pussy Riot's 2012 performance of a "punk prayer" at a Russian Orthodox cathedral criticized Putin, who was prime minister at the time. A new amnesty law introduced by Putin allowed two members of Russian punk band Pussy Riot to leave prison on Monday, two months before the end of their two-year sentences for a performance critical of the President. "President Putin obviously used this amnesty option to (brighten) up his image before the Olympic games," said Pyotr Verzilov, the husband of Tolokonnikova.
