If you're simply looking for the best deal on discount tires, my advice is to go with the name synonymous with savings, Wal-Mart. One of the great advantages to buying discount tires through Wal-Mart is that you can order the tires online and have them sent to any one of their tire and lube stores for free. Tire Rack can be a great choice for discount tires if you keep your shipping cost down and you find a cheap mechanic. When I ordered a set from Tire Rack in the past, I got a set of good tires for a great price. Since Tire Rack is an online company and they don't own any air wrenches themselves, you can search through a list of mechanic shops right on their Web site who will accept your delivery of tires and will put them on the car for you at their designated price.
