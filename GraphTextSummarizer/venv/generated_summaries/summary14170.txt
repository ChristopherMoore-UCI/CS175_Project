"I believe this cash management plan is a sound one," Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx wrote to state highway administrators. The Transportation Department is now warning states that it will use a different method for distributing money to them once the fund balance dips below $4 billion in less than a month. For motorists, that could mean everything from renewed encounters with axle-crunching potholes to more congestion as traffic is managed more tightly on outdated bridges. The current two-year law allowing the government to send from the trust fund expires in September, a deadline that can be extended if more money is found. This all means less money spent on gas and less money collected in related taxes.
