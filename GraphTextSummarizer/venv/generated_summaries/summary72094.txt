-- Australia's iconic Tasmanian devil -- widely known as trouble in Looney Tunes cartoons -- has been put on the country's endangered list, environmental officials announced Friday. "My decision to uplist the Tasmanian devil is based on advice from the Threatened Species Scientific Committee, which lists the devil facial tumor disease as the major threat to the devil," Environment Minister Peter Garrett said in a statement. Devil facial tumor disease is one of only three cancers known to spread like a contagious disease, according to the Tasmanian government's Web site. "The animals in this breeding program could play an important role, if ever needed, in helping re-establish healthy wild populations in Tasmania. The Tasmanian devil's future is threatened by a contagious facial cancer that has killed large numbers.
