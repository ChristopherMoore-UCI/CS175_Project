Read the full story on CNN Hero Eddie Canales:  Young football players injured, but not forgotten I met up with Eddie Canales, who was with his son Chris as well as several Gridiron Heroes and their families and caregivers. Being at that game that day made me remember why I liked football, although watching it alongside Canales and his Gridiron Heroes was a powerful reminder of the game's risks. Growing up in Colorado, I'd been an avid Denver Broncos fan, but living in New York and busy with work, I hadn't followed football much in the past decade. Eddie was excited about the gesture of support from the "governing bodies" of Texas high school football.
