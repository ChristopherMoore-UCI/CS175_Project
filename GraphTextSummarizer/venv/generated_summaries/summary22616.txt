But as even Democrats exult an election which saw, for the first time in history, women and minorities net the majority of House seats on their side of the aisle and a record 16 Democratic seats in the Senate, political experts warn against premature celebration. New U.S. House: Women and minorities to the left; white men to the right Democrats are the minority in the House and do not have control of that chamber's most powerful committees. While the Senate has a greater share of women in leadership positions, there are no Republican women in top leadership roles. "The most traditional measure (of political power) would be leadership positions, not just ranking positions on key committees but any membership on these committees," Lawless said. However, with such dramatic demographic and ideological differences in the House â€” women and minorities make up the majority on the left, white men are the majority on the right â€” Congress is likely headed for more partisan gridlock, said David Wasserman, House editor for the Cook Political Report.
