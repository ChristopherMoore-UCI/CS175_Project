In a recent interview with CNN, a top Mexican tourism official said that in spite of the violence, tourism in Mexico last year was "very robust." Rodolfo Lopez Negrete, chief operating officer of the Mexico Tourism Bureau, said, "Major tourism destinations that we have in Mexico, whether you refer to sun-and-beach resorts or inland destinations, those are perfectly safe." Lopez Negrete said violence mostly occurs in "border towns with the United States, in the northeastern section of our country." -- A top Mexican official says Mexico's drug policy is not a "war" against drug cartels, but a comprehensive strategy of the federal government to dismantle criminal organizations while at the same time strengthening institutions. Poire, who recently spoke on the issue of drug violence in Mexico at Harvard University in Boston, addressed the criticism on his blog. In a blog published by the Office of Mexican President Felipe Calderon, National Security Spokesman Alejandro Poire says the main objectives of the Mexican national security strategy are to strengthen the rule of law and reduce crime. The warning issued Friday strongly urges Americans to "travel only during daylight hours throughout Mexico, to avoid isolated roads and to use toll roads whenever possible."
