Afterward, NRA leaders said they would work with local officials to get more qualified armed guards in schools, while sharply resisting proposals to ban assault weapons, limit the size of gun magazines and to expand the system of background checks for firearms purchases. Still, the organization has a challenge, given the horrific nature of the Newtown massacre -- coming on the heels of several other mass shootings -- and the high priority that Obama is placing on gun control. The gun rights organization also posted a web video that month asserting Obama's attempts to enact gun control laws would result in the "confiscation" of people's firearms. The NRA efforts include advertisements such as the one, broadcast in mid-January, that described Obama as an "elitist hypocrite" because his two daughters are protected while at school by armed federal agents and yet he is "skeptical" about having armed personnel at all schools. It also has competition in terms of ads, with groups such as MoveOn.org and Mayors Against Illegal Guns taking to newspapers and the airwaves themselves to push for stricter gun control measures.
