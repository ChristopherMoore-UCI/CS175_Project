Ms Lagarde endorsed quantitative easing by central banks such as the US Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan, but said that rich economies should use fiscal policy more aggressively so there was less pressure for interest rates to stay low. " Emerging economies were growing fast, she said, but low interest rates in advanced economies were prompting them to build up debt and foreign exchange exposure that could cause trouble. "Over the past five years, foreign currency borrowing by firms in emerging markets has risen by about 50 per cent," said Ms Lagarde. In keeping with the IMF's imposition of a restructuring on Cypriot banks, she said "the priority must be to continue to clean up the banking system by recapitalising, restructuring or -- where necessary -- shutting down banks." A three-speed global economy faces risks from a currency crisis in emerging markets or unsustainable debt in the US and Japan, IMF managing director Christine Lagarde has warned.
