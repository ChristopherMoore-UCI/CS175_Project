This fragile coexistence -- sharing a soccer field with drug gangs -- could be a small step toward what Honduras and its neighbors must do to create peace in Central America. With the United States working hard to stop trafficking in the Caribbean and South America, Central America -- with its disruptive violence and high rate of impunity -- became an attractive alternative route. Forget ideology: It's all about dollars It's easy to say the increase in drug trafficking in Central America caused the spike in violence. Overrun by drug violence, San Pedro Sula is the second-largest and most violent city in Honduras -- a country that's the current murder capital of the world. In Central America, officials estimate that drug dealing is a factor in 60% of the killings, but it's not always clear who's killing whom and why.
