The best way to overcome this impulse is to put your self esteem into stellar work habits instead of results. When you practice this kind of self discipline regularly, you'll naturally stand out from the pack -- because most people avoid the hard stuff. It's not about enjoying self discipline -- it's about adopting a few new ways of thinking that simply make discipline easier to endure. To keep yourself motivated, take pride in sticking to your work habits, rather than looking for immediate results. And by just doing something, you create movement and momentum that will lead to progress and results.
