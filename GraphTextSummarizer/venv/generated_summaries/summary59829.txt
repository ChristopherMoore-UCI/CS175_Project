As part of the Catlin Seaview Survey, teams from the University of Queensland, Indonesia's Sam Ratulangi University and Indonesia's Institute of Sciences spent time underwater over several weeks near the city of Manado to record data and map reefs in what the survey says "could become one of the last refuges on Earth for coral reefs." "Regions like Manado in the Coral Triangle could, by the middle of the century, be one of the only places on Earth where coral reefs will exist," says Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, chief scientist of the survey and director of the Global Change Institute at the University of Queensland. "Understanding the structure and function of such reefs is of the utmost importance if we are to underpin their resilience to global change. How coral reef maps are made The coral mapping effort employs a Seaview SVII underwater camera, which has a rod and propeller attached to the back to create a sort of photo scooter. According to experts, about 40 percent of the world's corals have been lost in the last three decades due to climate change and human activities.
