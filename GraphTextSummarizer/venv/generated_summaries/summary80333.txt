Bulger faces 19 counts of murder, along with conspiracy to commit murder, extortion, narcotics distribution and money laundering charges, the FBI said. "Any claim that the FBI knew Mr. Bulger's whereabouts prior to the FBI's publicity efforts this week are completely unfounded," FBI Special Agent Richard DesLauriers said in a statement. A tipster called the FBI's Los Angeles office on Tuesday, and the information led authorities to the apartment, said Steven Martinez, FBI assistant director in charge in Los Angeles. Assistant U.S. Attorney Brian Kelly said that, based on a conversation with Greig, prosecutors believe Massachusetts political figure William Bulger will help pay for his brother's defense. Tom Fuentes, former FBI assistant director, told CNN's Anderson Cooper that the agency is capable of protecting the tipster no matter how the information came in and there is no reason for a ruse.
