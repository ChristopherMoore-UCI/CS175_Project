Kubica took the wheel in national rally championship events towards the end of last year, including two for Citroen, and will be driving with a specially adapted gearbox to compensate for his hand injury. The accident in February 2011, during a rallying competition in Italy, left Kubica with limited use of his right hand and with doubts about his future at the highest level of motor sport. " Kubica's season will get underway at the Rally Islas Canarias -- the third round of the FIA European Rally Championship later this month -- before he opens his campaign in the WRC 2 at April's Rally de Portugal. Kubica was considered one of the most promising drivers in F1 before his crash, winning the 2008 Canadian Grand Prix with Sauber before switching to Lotus Renault for the 2010 season. Citroen team principal Yves Matton said Kubica deserved to succeed in his comeback because of his fighting spirit.
