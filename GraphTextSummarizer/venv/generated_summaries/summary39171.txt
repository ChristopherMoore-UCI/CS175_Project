Federer, who has a home in Dubai, was looking to regain his title from Novak Djokovic, who will now be top seed, with Murray also in the field for his first tournament since Australia. Australian Open champion Federer is set to be sidelined for up to six weeks and may not return to action until a big hard court event in the United States in March. -- World number one Roger Federer is suffering from a lung infection and has pulled out of this week's $2 million ATP tournament in Dubai. He is set to play at the Masters Series event at Indian Wells which starts on March 11, but may have to wait until the following tournament in Miami. Federer, who won his 16th grand slam when beating Britain's Andy Murray in Melbourne, has been advised by a doctor not to play for at least a fortnight.
