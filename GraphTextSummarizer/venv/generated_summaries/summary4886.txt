The boy's mother -- Julia Bennett, 33 -- was shot once in the back and died from the injury, said Miramar Police spokeswoman Tania Rues. "What we do know is that last Wednesday, shortly after 7 o'clock, we received a 911 call from a gentleman stating that his 2-1/2-year-old son accidentally shot his mother -- the boy's mother," Rues told HLN's Vinnie Politan. "Oh God, I can't believe this." Rues said the State Attorney's office will decide whether to file charges. The boy's father could face charges of negligence, she said. Rues said investigators will talk to the toddler about the shooting, but that "due to the age, we're not expecting to get much."
