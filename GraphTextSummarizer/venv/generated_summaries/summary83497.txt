-- Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Justice is denying reports that a Saudi court sentenced a man to be surgically paralyzed as punishment for having paralyzed another man, with the ministry adding that the judge in the case had "dismissed requests for such punishment." In 2010, local media reported the case of a 22-year-old man who was paralyzed in a fight, saying he had subsequently requested paralysis as punishment for the man he'd fought with. This is not the first time a "paralysis as punishment" sentence has made headlines in Saudi Arabia. After the initial reports, the Saudi Ministry of Justice denied that paralysis had ever been considered as punishment in that case. News about the case first surfaced in local Saudi media last month.
