Numerous other studies have found benefits for kids who spend more time with their families, such as fewer delinquent behaviors and less likelihood to give in to peer pressure, the study notes. Parents who have a son and a daughter generally spend more time alone with the child of the same sex, the Penn State study found. So in some cases, dads spending more time with certain kids may be the result of the kids being more social -- not the cause of it. While increased time with Dad showed key benefits for self-esteem and "social competence," time with Mom did not show the same correlations. "It's very rare to have longitudinal data over such a long period of time for four members of a family," said Ann Crouter, dean of Penn State's College of Health and Human Development.
