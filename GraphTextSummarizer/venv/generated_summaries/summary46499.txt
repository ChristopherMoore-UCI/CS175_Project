Before this incident, the most Reynolds ever made on PayPal was "a little over $1,000" selling a set of vintage BMW tires on eBay. Rich, as in more than a million times richer than Mexican telecom mogul Carlos Slim. Money that would make Reynolds -- who also sells auto parts on eBay in his spare time -- the richest man in the world by a long shot. "This is obviously an error and we appreciate that Mr. Reynolds understood this was the case," PayPal said in a statement. PayPal admitted the error and offered to donate an unspecified amount of money to a cause of Reynolds' choice.
