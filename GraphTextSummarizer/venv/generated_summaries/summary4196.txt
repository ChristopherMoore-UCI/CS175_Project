In December, police shot and killed eight people who attacked police station in western Xinjiang, and a separate clash left 14 Uyghurs and two police officers dead. "We call on Chinese authorities to immediately account for the whereabouts of Mr. Tohti and his students and guarantee Mr. Tohti and his students the protections and freedoms to which they are entitled under China's international human rights commitments, including the freedom of expression. " Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Hong Lei said at a regular briefing on Thursday that Tohti "is suspected of violating the law and committing a crime" and that police have placed him under criminal detention. The U.S. State Department said Tohti, who has been outspoken in support of human rights for China's ethnic Uyghur citizens, had been taken into custody along with at least six of his students. The arrival in Xinjiang of waves of Han Chinese people over the decades has fueled tensions with the Uyghurs.
