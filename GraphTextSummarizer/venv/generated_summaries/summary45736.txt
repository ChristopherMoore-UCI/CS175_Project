Professional climbers Tommy Caldwell and Kevin Jorgeson are in the middle of tackling this most difficult of challenges at Yosemite National Park's El Capitan. Follow their journey on Caldwell and Jorgeson's Instagram accounts, Caldwell and Jorgeson's Facebook accounts and YouTube. That's why Caldwell and Jorgeson have spent several years planning and practicing their climb, assembling a support team that helps feed and care for them as they make their way up the wall. They sleep at night in pitched tents suspended on the wall, with Caldwell waking up twice per night to apply lotion to his hands. A Yosemite National Park official confirmed that if they succeed, Caldwell and Jorgeson would be the first to successfully free-climb the smooth cliff face.
