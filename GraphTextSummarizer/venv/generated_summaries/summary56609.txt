The law is now cited as one cause behind a projected 90,000 children from Central America and Mexico who will cross the U.S. border alone or with other children this year, a huge increase over the 39,000 that the Border Patrol detained last year. Congress has been deadlocked for years on how to reform immigration laws. Every case is different, and because of a law signed by President George W. Bush in 2008, children fall into a special class. As such, refugees can apply for asylum in the United States, a process that could take years. The U.S. law ensured that children who came to the country got a full immigration hearing instead of being turned away or sent back.
