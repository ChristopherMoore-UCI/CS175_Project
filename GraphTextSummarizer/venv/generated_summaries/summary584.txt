-- U.S. Air Force officials called off their response late Friday afternoon at a Tucson, Arizona, base after reports that an armed man had entered an office building, the U.S. military branch said in a statement. All base personnel were leaving via a "controlled release." "With the help of the Tucson emergency services communities, Airmen were successful in maintaining the safety and security of the Desert Lightning Team," the Air Force said, alluding to the name used for Air Force personnel based in the arid southern Arizona locale. He added that the building, where the gunman was once thought to have entered, has been secured after authorities went through it room-by-room. No shots were ever fired and law enforcement teams are on site, said the official, who had direct knowledge of the situation from conversations with base officials but did not want to be identified. Maria Hawke said in an e-mailed statement that members of the department's SWAT team, hostage unit and bomb squad are near the site on a "stand-by" basis in case they are needed.
