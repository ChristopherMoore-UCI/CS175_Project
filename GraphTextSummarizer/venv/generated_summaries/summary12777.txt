Olazabal's Europe will be looking to defend the trophy they won in 2010 when the 39th Ryder Cup match begins at the Medinah Country Club in Illinois on September 28. Seve, who won a record 50 European Tour events during his 33-year playing career, passed away aged 55 in May last year after a prolonged battle with a cancerous brain tumor. Javier Ballesteros, son of five-time major winner Seve, finished on six-under par to clinch the three-round amateur Madrid Open. "My father always told me that you have to play with what you got, and that's what I did," 22-year-old Javier, a law student in the Spanish capital, was reported to have said by AP. -- Golf fans grew accustomed to the sight of Seve Ballesteros lifting trophies aloft during his glittering career, and his son Javier is continuing the family tradition.
