This would seem to be strong ground for Perry to stand on: the tea party as modern Maccabees. Perhaps worse, Perry said: "Chanukah reminds us of the power of faith to sustain a nation and ensure the security of our ally, Israel." As the Maccabees learned long ago, and as modern Israelis well know today, faith is never a guarantee of national security. On Tuesday night, Texas Gov. Rick Perry -- long a public fan of Judaism -- marked the beginning of the Jewish festival of Hanukkah by comparing it to the Boston Tea Party, which was celebrating its 241st anniversary the same day. Its leaders took on the imperial title of "king" and took Greek names, and fought among themselves just as the Jewish rulers had before the Maccabees took over. When they recaptured the Temple, they were taking it back not only from the Seleucids, but from the assimilationist Jews who had (in the minds of the Maccabees and their followers) corrupted the old ways of worship.
