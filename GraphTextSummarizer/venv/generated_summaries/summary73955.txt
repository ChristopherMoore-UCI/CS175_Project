The hotel says room fees at opening will be from JPY7,000 ($60) for a single room to JPY18,000 ($153), the highest possible price after bidding, for a triple room. Amenities provided in rooms will be kept minimal. Instead of air-conditioning, a radiation panel will detect body heat in rooms and adjust the temperature. Instead of being presented with a fixed price, guests will bid for rooms during peak season. The highest bidders will secure rooms, though there will be a price cap on bidding.
