This year, that rivalry is being formally recognized with the newly-commissioned Prestbury Cup, to be awarded to the country with the most winners and named after the first Cheltenham Festival, organized in 1902 at Prestbury Park racecourse. In the day's feature race, the Champion Hurdle, 9-1 shot Jezki led home a memorable one-two for leading owner J P McManus, edging out My Tent Or Yours, ridden by man of the hour AP McCoy. Although jumps racing carries a lower social status than flat racing in the United Kingdom, its following is arguably bigger. One of the fancied runners in Friday's Gold Cup -- the highlight of the festival and the most prestigious jumps race in the British racing calendar -- is trained by a man who has been charged with possession of anabolic steroids and who is due in court next week. -- Flat racing has Royal Ascot; tennis has Wimbledon; football has the FA Cup.
