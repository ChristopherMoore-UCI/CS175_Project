Notre Dame Director of Athletics Jack Swarbrick confirmed Friday that the football players are wide receiver DaVaris Daniels, defensive back KeiVarae Russell, defensive lineman Ishaq Williams and linebacker Kendall Moore. "Integrity is at the heart of our mission and academic misconduct will not be tolerated at Notre Dame," university President the Rev. John I. Jenkins said in a statement. -- Several University of Notre Dame students, including four football players, are being investigated over academic fraud allegations, the university said. We are also examining ways of better conveying to students that they can avail themselves of legitimate academic assistance without resorting to cheating." Notre Dame said in the statement it has evidence that students had submitted papers and homework that had been written for them by others. CNN reached out to Notre Dame athletic department officials in an attempt to get statements from the football players, but the university did not immediately respond.
