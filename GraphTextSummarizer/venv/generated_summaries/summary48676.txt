Sugar in the raw is no better than regular sugar. In the past four years, cereal brands have cut back on sugar, the milk industry recently lowered amounts in the chocolate milk served in schools, and Walmart is aiming for 10% less added sugar in select foods by 2015. "Sugar is an important part of our lives," says Dr. Miriam Vos, assistant professor at Emory University School of Medicine. Faux sugar won't cause blood-sugar spikes or weight gain -- and all the potential health ills. Some sweeteners, like raw honey and sucanat, have trace nutrients, but they're all the same as white sugar in terms of calories -- and some contain even more calories.
