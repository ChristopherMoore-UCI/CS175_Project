Dispersants are a common product used to clean and control oil spills in the ocean. Experts say dispersants, while toxic, are much less toxic than oil. The result is tiny oil droplets that can biodegrade more quickly than a mass of oil. The chemicals can also contaminate the skin of ocean-farmed fish if their cages are near where dispersants are used, according to the International Tanker Owners Pollution Federation, a nonprofit group that offers technical guidance on cleaning up spills. Dispersants are usually used on the surface of the ocean and distributed by aircraft flying over an oil spill.
