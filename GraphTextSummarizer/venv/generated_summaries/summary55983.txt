But the guitar Dylan played on that mythic afternoon went missing for the next 47 years -- until recently, when a team of PBS researchers told New Jersey resident Dawn Peterson that she had it in her home. "It's his guitar until he makes an affirmative act to give it to someone else or sell it," says lawyer Josh Grier, who represents artists including Wilco. "It's so important, historically and culturally, that I couldn't have imagined Bob Dylan would have just left it on an airplane," he says. " History Detectives also called in Dylan memorabilia collector Jeff Gold, who often helps auction houses authenticate items for sale. In 2005, Peterson wrote to Bob Dylan's management and requested that he waive any claim to the guitar.
