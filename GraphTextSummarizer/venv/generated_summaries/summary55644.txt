Orlando Sanford International Airport has been trying to get approval since last year to join the TSA's Screening Partnership Program, which helps airports hire qualified private screening companies to enforce security protocol set and overseen by the TSA. The TSA administrator is required to approve airport applications for the program if security is uncompromised, cost efficiency is maintained and the screening of  passengers and property is not negatively impacted. Orlando Sanford International Airport saw close to 1.6 million passengers in 2011, compared with more than 35 million passengers at neighboring Orlando International Airport. There are now 16 participating airports, including San Francisco International and Kansas City International. This is a TSA program created by congress," said Larry Dale, the airport's president and CEO.
