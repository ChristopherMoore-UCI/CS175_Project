Fast-falling snow caused tractor-trailers to jacknife and prompted state authorities in New York to ban commercial traffic on Interstate 84, a major east-west highway. Police said the Bobcat compact tractor equipped with a snowplow was backing up and struck the woman about 10:40 a.m. in a parking lot in the rear of Fei Long Market. -- A pregnant woman was killed Thursday after being struck by a privately owned tractor clearing snow in a parking lot, but her baby boy was delivered by cesarean section, authorities said. The nearly full-term boy -- weighing 6.6 pounds -- was in critical condition at Brooklyn's Maimonides Medical Center, where his 36-year-old mother was pronounced dead on arrival after being struck as she was loading groceries into her car. The incident occurred during New York City's sixth winter storm of the season.
