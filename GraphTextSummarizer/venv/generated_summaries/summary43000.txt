Among 2013 films, Man of Steel had the second best debut of the year behind Iron Man 3, which started with $174.1 million in May. Man of Steel garnered a fantastic $29,731 per theater average from its 4,207 locations. What 'Man of Steel' gets wrong about Superman Man of Steel also clobbered the debut of 2006′s Superman Returns, which opened with $52.5 million and earned $200 million domestically against a $270 million budget. For Cavill, Adams, and the rest of the cast — which includes Russell Crowe, Diane Lane, Kevin Costner, Laurence Fishburne, and Michael Shannon — Man of Steel became their best ever opening weekend. In about one week, Man of Steel will likely have surpassed that film's domestic total. Audiences were 56 percent male and 44 percent female, a more even gender distribution than Iron Man 3, which had a 61/39 percent male/female split on opening weekend.
