In late 2000, the Marine Corps grounded the Osprey fleet after two more crashes: one in Arizona that killed four crew members and 15 passengers and another in North Carolina that killed the crew. Lt. Col. Matt Glover of Austin, Texas, had led the 8th Special Operations Squadron since May 2011, according to the Hurlburt Field website. "The challenges of the 8th Special Operations Squadron's demanding mission require new leadership to maintain the highest levels of precision and to reliably support the ground forces which count on the 8th SOS to safely accomplish their missions," Slife said in a statement, without providing details. Officials were no longer confident in his effectiveness, said Col. Jim Slife, commander of the 1st Special Operations Wing. The Army began developing the Osprey in 1982, though the program was nearly scrapped in 1989 when Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney sought to cancel it because of ballooning costs.
