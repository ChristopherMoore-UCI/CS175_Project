"We urge the relevant authorities to ensure that justice is, belatedly, delivered to the many victims of human rights abuses committed under the government of Mr. Duvalier. "The cases of human rights abuses we documented in Haiti are likely to be only a small proportion of what really happened during Duvalier's rule," Javier Zuniga, a special adviser at Amnesty International, said last year. -- Human rights activists decried Tuesday a Haitian judge's decision not to try former dictator Jean-Claude "Baby Doc" Duvalier for human rights violations. The investigative magistrate overseeing the case, Carves Jean, ruled that Duvalier will face trial on corruption charges stemming from his 15 years in rule but not for human rights abuses, the Haitian Press Agency reported. Amnesty gave the public prosecutor in the Duvalier case 100 documents that it said detailed cases of human rights violations.
