Bosnian Serb president Radovan Karadzic is now on trial at the tribunal in The Hague. "This includes Ratko Mladic, who presided over the killings and remains at large," he said, referring to the former Bosnian Serb army commander. Fena news agency reported that Boris Tadic, president of Serbia, also attended the burial memorial of the genocide victims and promised to find Serb war criminals. Sunday's burial was attended by top international officials, including a U.S. delegation whose members read a statement from President Barack Obama. The massacre of men and boys occurred when ethnic Serb troops overran the United Nations safe area.
