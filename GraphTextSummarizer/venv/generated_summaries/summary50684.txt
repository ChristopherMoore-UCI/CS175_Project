The two deadliest attacks Thursday were in the towns of Iskandariya and Yousifiya, south of Baghdad, an Interior Ministry official said. Iskandariya, part of Babil province, is about 25 miles (40 kilometers) south of Baghdad. In Baghdad, three bombs attached to civilian vehicles caused casualties. One of the bombs detonated on a highway in eastern Baghdad, killing the driver in the car and wounding two civilian bystanders. In northern Baghdad, a driver was wounded when a bomb attached to his vehicle exploded.
