Now 52, Botti's not only built a successful career as a trumpeter, he's also worked with some of the music industry's biggest names, from Frank Sinatra and Paul Simon to Joni Mitchell and Natalie Cole. What transpired was so affecting that it left viewers with chills and brought Colts wide receiver Reggie Wayne to tears. The Grammy-winning musician was on the field at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, to perform the national anthem for November 3's "Monday Night Football." His performance during Monday night's game pushed Wayne to eighth place on the all-time receiving yards list, ahead of James Lofton. His most recent release, "Impressions," won the Grammy for best pop instrumental album in 2012.
