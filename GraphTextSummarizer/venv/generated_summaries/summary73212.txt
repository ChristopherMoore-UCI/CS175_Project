Not only aren't U.S. officials refusing to back down against ISIS in Iraq, they are signaling that they might go after the group in Syria. On Wednesday -- months after a Florida man killed himself in a northern Syria suicide bombing and a day after news broke that Douglas McAuthur McCain, a 33-year-old man reared in Minnesota, died fighting for ISIS -- a coalition of Syrian opposition groups announced that its forces had killed another American in battle. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki added that U.S. authorities knew about McCain's ties to ISIS. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki, who was among those who reported McCain's death, said the U.S. government is "looking into" this latest reported American casualty, even if it hasn't confirmed his death. Still, the idea of more Americans fighting for groups like ISIS, and more of them dying, wouldn't be surprising.
