"Leon stated he decided to fly the plane into the United States with the expectation he would be shot down and killed by United States military aircraft," according to an FBI affidavit. " Missouri state troopers initially took Leon into custody, accusing him of illegally flying into U.S. airspace. U.S. F-16 fighter jets intercepted Leon near Michigan's Upper Peninsula border with Wisconsin and tried repeatedly to draw the pilot's attention, authorities said. About 10 p.m. ET, with only about 30 minutes of fuel left, Leon landed the four-seater plane on a dirt road in southern Missouri, parking it under what appeared to be a bridge or culvert -- apparently to hide it -- a federal law enforcement source said. Leon told investigators that "he has not felt like himself lately and has been treated recently by a psychiatrist," it reads.
