Former President Bill Clinton and actor Morgan Freeman made the case for the United States in Zurich, Switzerland, where FIFA executives voted Thursday. Qatar, which promised a carbon-neutral World Cup, complete with air-conditioned stadiums, will become the first Middle Eastern nation to host the tournament, the largest sporting event in the world each time it is held. "Maybe America's best claim to this World Cup is that we have the only nation you can put the World Cup that can guarantee that no matter who makes the finals, we can fill a stadium with home-nation rooters," Clinton told FIFA executives before the voting. "It would have been fantastic for the growth of soccer in our country" at a time "when it's primed to take the next step forward -- or the next step back," the North Carolina pastor said. "Millions of U.S. soccer fans worked hard to bring the World Cup to our country," he said.
