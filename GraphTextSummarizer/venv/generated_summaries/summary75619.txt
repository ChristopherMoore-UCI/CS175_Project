In a July 2006 UNICEF report on child soldiers in the nation, the agency reported that "as many as 30,000 children may be associated with armed forces or groups as fighters, sexual slaves and camp-followers." Of those children, the report estimates, "30 to 40 percent of children associated with armed forces are girls." In Haiti, UNICEF and local officials report that kidnapped children are being raped, tortured and murdered. "It is everyone's duty to ensure children are safe from harm, and governments have a responsibility to enact and enforce measures that provide a protective environment for all children," the agency said in a statement released Friday. In the Central African Republic, the agency reports that armed gangs terrorize farms and communities, kidnapping children and holding them for ransom. The agency recently received reports that Iraqi children have been recruited by militia and insurgent groups.
