Trouville said that since the state of Florida moved to crack down on "pill mills" by banning doctors from directly distributing controlled narcotics, pharmacy sales of controlled substances have skyrocketed. "Each registrant (pharmacy) was filling prescriptions far in excess of legitimate needs of its customers," said DEA Special Agent in Charge Mark Trouville during a press conference Monday in central Florida. -- Agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration raided two CVS pharmacies in central Florida over the weekend, removing controlled substances and suspending the stores' ability to handle or distribute drugs such as painkillers oxycodone and hydrocodone. "Cardinal Health did not fulfill its due diligence to insure controlled substances were not diverted into other than legitimate channels," Trouville said. "CVS/pharmacy is unwavering in its compliance with and support of the measures taken by federal and state law enforcement officials to prevent drug abuse and keep controlled substances out of the wrong hands," said CVS spokesman Mike DeAngelis.
