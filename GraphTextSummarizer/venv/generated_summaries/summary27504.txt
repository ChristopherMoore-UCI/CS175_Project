Veronica Vecellio, its gorilla program coordinator, said she developed the desire to work in her field after seeing "Gorillas in the Mist," the 1988 film which popularized Fossey's story. "It's what inspired me." Staff at Karisoke, which have observed the animals for more than 40 years, study the behavior of 10 groups of gorillas -- including those initially named and studied by Fossey, and their offspring. "Studying Dian Fossey, it's really clear how one person can really make the difference," said Vecellio. The world's largest mountain gorilla population, thought to number less than 500 animals, is found in a mountainous region known as the Virungas, incorporating Volcanoes, Uganda's Mgahinga Gorilla National Park, and Virunga National Park in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
