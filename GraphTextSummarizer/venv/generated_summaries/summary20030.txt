In 2005, Cassini found that fractures called "tiger stripes" in the south polar region emit water vapor jets rich in salt, lead author Luciano Iess of Sapienza Universit√† di Roma in Rome, Italy, said in a press conference Wednesday. "As far as whether one should go first to Europa or Enceladus, I look at this as a kind of a cornucopia of habitable environments in the outer solar system," study co-author Jonathan Lunine of Cornell University said in a press conference Wednesday. Measurements from the new study and previous Cassini data suggest the moon's south pole has an ice layer on top of water on top of silicate rock. Callisto and Ganymede, also moons of Jupiter, may also have oceans under ice. What we think is there The north pole of Enceladus has a thickness of ice around 30 miles, with solid rock beneath it.
