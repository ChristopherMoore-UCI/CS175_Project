CNN's Anderson Cooper will reveal this year's Top 10 CNN Heroes during the 8 a.m. hour of "New Day." This is the eighth year CNN has conducted its annual search for CNN Heroes. Last year's Hero of the Year was Chad Pregracke, who has dedicated his life to cleaning up the Mississippi River and other American waterways. This year's tribute show will again be held in New York and hosted by Cooper at the American Museum of Natural History. Each will receive $25,000 and be honored at "CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute," a globally broadcast event that airs December 7.
