"Not everyone is willing to do all this hard work and then put it out in the open for everyone to benefit from," wrote David Bellis, who has listed the names, graves and inscriptions compiled by Lim on his website, Gwulo, which is dedicated to historic Hong Kong. A "fanatical friend" from the UK spurred her on to the cemetery project after Lim had dedicated a chapter of her last book, "Discovering Hong Kong's Cultural Heritage: Hong Kong and Kowloon" to the Happy Valley cemeteries. Hong Kong was "a hard, unhealthy place to live," Lim said. Hong Kong wasn't really "happy" or a place for European women, Lim said. "It's full of stories, this cemetery," said Lim, who now splits time between Hong Kong and England.
