Despite the prospect of U.S. missiles on Al-Assad's doorstep and a weakening regime, U.S. intelligence officials said the Syrian leader is showing no signs of giving up. One Washington official said missiles came close to the border of Turkey, a NATO member and staunch U.S. ally. Threats would include Syrian strikes inside Turkey and fighting between the government and rebels that extends into Turkey. He spoke after arriving Friday at Turkey's Incirlik Air Base, a U.S. Air Force installation about 80 miles from Syria's border. U.S. intelligence believes the decline has accelerated in recent weeks.
