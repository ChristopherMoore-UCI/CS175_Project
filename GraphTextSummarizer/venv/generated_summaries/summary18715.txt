Folks who choose helping jobs that may have a high level of stress are fueled by other motivators, like wanting their work to have meaning. Rather than discouraging people to take on jobs that might have a lot of stress, let's instead encourage those who are designed for those jobs to do them. If you're prone to stress, perhaps you're just as likely to feel stressed out whether you work as a librarian, a massage therapist or a commercial airline pilot (No. 4 on the stress list). My media friends couldn't help noticing that public relations professionals, reporters and photojournalists all made it into the top 10 for stress. And whether every police officer, firefighter and member of the military faces the same amount of stress.
