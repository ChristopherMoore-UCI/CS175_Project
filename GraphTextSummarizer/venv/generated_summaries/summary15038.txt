Comic book writer Genevieve Valentine penned a blog post explaining the scene in which Selina is seen kissing Eiko Hasigawa, who has taken on the mantle of Catwoman in recent months, while Selina has taken on the role of a crime boss. "Eiko has offered a moral challenge -- and we know Selina loves a challenge -- but has also unexpectedly given Selina trust and support at a time when those are in desperately short supply," she wrote. But it turns out we didn't know all there is to know about Selina Kyle, aka Catwoman. This week's "Catwoman" #39 comic revealed that Selina is bisexual. Valentine has been building toward this moment in the comic's storyline and saw the character of Eiko as a good opportunity to establish Catwoman's sexuality once and for all.
