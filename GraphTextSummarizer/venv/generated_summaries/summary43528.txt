The "Late Late Show" host shuffles off the stage Friday having hosted an eccentric decade of shows, a program that was often under the radar but always quietly, distinctively ... Craig Ferguson. He started interviews by ripping up the blue cards other hosts depend on, and if his guests wanted to talk about religion and existence -- like Stephen Fry, who was the only guest one night in 2013 -- or nothing in particular -- like frequent visitor Kristen Bell -- he just went along with it. "His show was unlike any other late night show, and I'm telling you, to be unique in the world of television -- virtually impossible," Letterman said when Ferguson made his announcement. Little was expected of a guy formerly known as Mr. Wick on "The Drew Carey Show," but Ferguson cut his teeth in Edinburgh's fringe scene, notably as a character named "Bing Hitler." (Fergusonian tangent: Ferguson was also a punk rock drummer, and the singer in his band was Peter Capaldi.
