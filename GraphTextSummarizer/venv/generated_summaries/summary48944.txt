-- A man tried to enter the hospital room of Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi overnight, as the leader recovered from being hit in the face Sunday. His night was "worse than previous ones," spokesman Paolo Bonaiuti said, though he attributed Berlusconi's unease partially to his enforced absence from work. There has been a climate of hatred against Berlusconi in recent months, the interior minister said, with many anti-Berlusconi Web pages.
