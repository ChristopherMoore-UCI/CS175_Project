Perhaps the most surprising finding from these programs is that hospice patients live a month longer on average than similar patients who do not receive such care. Managing end-of-life care for patients like Brittany Maynard is never simple. Unlike hospice care, assisted suicide is obviously a final and irreversible act. Over the past couple of months she had been hospitalized several times with extreme shortness of breath due to congestive heart failure and treated with intravenous drugs. For such patients in those rare cases, I support assisted suicide as practiced in Oregon.
