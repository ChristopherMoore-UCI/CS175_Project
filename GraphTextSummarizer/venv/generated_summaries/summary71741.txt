After doing hours of research, Melissa, Barry and Brynn came up with their own diagnosis: mast cell disease. For instance, Brynn has mast cell activation syndrome, meaning her mast cells act strangely, but they're not growing in number. Not everyone with mast cell activation syndrome has it as bad as Brynn does. Melissa Duncan, a paralegal by day, dons a mask and surgical gloves before disinfecting the area around the tube that's connected to Brynn's jugular vein. "New day, new crisis," Brynn quips as she tells the story, as if it's about her first day of college or a shopping trip gone wrong.
