" Doping scandal costs Armstrong sponsors, charity "Rabobank has come to this decision following publication of the report from the American doping authority USADA last week," its statement said. -- The world of professional cycling suffered another blow Friday, as Dutch bank Rabobank announced it is to end its sponsorship of pro cycling teams in the wake of the Lance Armstrong doping scandal. " In its report, the anti-doping agency made public testimony from Armstrong's teammates and others who said Armstrong was among team members who used banned performance-enhancing substances and tried to hide it from testing officials. The USADA report is part of its request to international cycling officials to strip Armstrong of his seven Tour de France titles. Armstrong is already banned from competing in events sanctioned by U.S. Olympic governing bodies.
