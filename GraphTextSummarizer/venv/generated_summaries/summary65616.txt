"A car bomb went off at 9:18 a.m. in the parking lot of the Fuzhou city prosecutor's office, followed by a blast at 9:20 a.m. at the Linchuan district government building and another car bomb at 9:45 a.m. near the local drug administration building," said Zhang Baoyun, a spokesman for the government of Jiangxi province, where Fuzhou is located. Last September, clashes between residents and officials in Yihuang, a county in Fuzhou, gained national attention. Authorities are still investigating the explosions, while the injured -- including three in serious condition -- are at local hospitals, Zhang said. At least six people were injured in the blasts, which occured within a half hour of each other, local officials told CNN. One died in the hospital, prompting widespread outrage that eventually forced provincial authorities to sack several local officials.
