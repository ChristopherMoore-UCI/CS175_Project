Snowden's asylum options dwindle Bolivian defense minister: U.S. government was behind Snowden rumor Choquehuanca said authorities from the South American country are investigating the source of the false rumors about Snowden. In 2011, Morales said he was worried that U.S. authorities would plant something on his presidential plane to link him with drug trafficking when he attended a United Nations General Assembly meeting. Bolivian officials say their country's presidential plane had to land in Austria on Tuesday after false rumors circulated that former U.S. National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden was aboard the aircraft. A history of tense relations It isn't the first time Bolivian authorities have accused U.S. officials of trying to meddle with their presidential plane. Snowden has admitted leaking classified documents about U.S. surveillance programs and faces espionage charges in the United States.
