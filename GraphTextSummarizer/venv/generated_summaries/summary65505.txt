FIFA has campaigned long and hard to try and remove overt political gestures from football, suspending national football associations when their internal politics impinge on the game whilst strongly disapproving of actions on the field of play that may harm football's impartiality. " High profile players like Thierry Henry and Samuel Eto'o also lined up to praise Kanoute's actions, according to Spanish newspaper Marca. I am sure that all Palestinian children, who love Spanish football, will be moved by this gesture. "[Kanoute] has shown himself to be very brave by supporting our region in a public act like he did," Mahmud Aluanen, a spokesman for the mission, told Radio Marca. Footballers have always made political gestures.
