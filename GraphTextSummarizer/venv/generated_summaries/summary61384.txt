Neil Diamond will donate royalties from his song "Sweet Caroline," which has been played at every Boston Red Sox home game for more than a decade, to the One Fund Boston, the singer said on Twitter on Wednesday. The singer recorded the song in 1969 as an homage to Caroline Kennedy, the daughter of the late President John F. Kennedy. Diamond was at Fenway Park on Saturday to lead the crowd in what has become a stadium tradition of singing the tune during the break in the eighth inning before the Sox come to bat. The fund has raised more than $23 million as of Wednesday. I bring love from the whole country," he told the Sox faithful.
