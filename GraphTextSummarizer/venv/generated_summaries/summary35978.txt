-- A Massachusetts man taken into custody in a law enforcement sweep after the Times Square bombing attempt last year was deported to Pakistan Saturday, Customs officials said Sunday. Aftab Ali, also known as Aftab Khan, pleaded guilty to charges of unlicensed money transmitting and immigration document fraud in a plea deal that included his deportation, a statement from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) said. "Investigators obtained evidence that Khan had provided $4,900 to Faisal Shahzad, who was later convicted of carrying out the bombing attempt," ICE said. "Khan borrowed the money and transferred it to Shahzad in February 2010 as part of a 'hawala' transaction in which Khan's family received an equivalent amount of money in Pakistan," the statement said. ICE agents accompanied Khan, who lived in Watertown, Massachusetts, on a flight from Boston to Islamabad, Pakistan, Saturday, the agency said.
