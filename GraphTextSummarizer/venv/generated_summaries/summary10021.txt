What's more, those who have watched all 20-plus hours of the David Frost-Richard Nixon conversations, which form the center of "Frost/Nixon," recently report that they're overwhelmingly dry and dull, with the ex-president ably stonewalling questions that were not to his liking and indulging in elaborate self-justification on those that were. Frost may be out of his depth, but he's not about to let it cramp his style; he's delighted when the ex-president admires his slip-on Italian shoes. On the last day of 12 interview sessions, as had been agreed, British journalist Frost finally broached Watergate. That exchange made Frost's reputation and sealed Nixon's public ignominy. Frost was a lightweight -- that's one of the reasons Nixon and his people agreed to the interview.
