Opposition politicians, who have boycotted parliamentary sessions since February 1, have called for new elections for a totally fresh start in Romania -- and not a more incremental step of a new prime minister appointed by President Basescu, and with it a new government. Later Monday, President Traian Basescu appointed Mihai Razvan Ungureanu as his pick to be the nation's next permanent prime minister. The resignation makes Romania the sixth European country to see a prime minister fall amid the debt crisis sweeping European Union member states. "We made this decision in order to alleviate the social and political situation in the country, (and) to not lose what Romanians have won with so much suffering -- the country's economic stability," said Boc, who had been prime minister since 2008. Announcing his resignation on television, Prime Minister Emil Boc said he is not the kind of person to hang on to power, and that it is time to make space for another government.
