Ferrari posted a statement on their website on Wednesday that read: "Ferrari will carry the flag of the Italian Navy on the cars driven by Fernando Alonso and Felipe Massa in this weekend's Indian Grand Prix. Both Fernando Alonso and Felipe Massa will carry the symbol on their livery, a move that has been interpreted as a message of support for two Italian navy officers arrested after an incident that resulted in the death of two Indian fishermen in February. He wrote on his official Twitter page: "Congratulations to Ferrari for displaying the the Navy's symbol at the India GP. As for matters on the track, both Ferrari drivers trail behind reigning world champion Sebastian Vettel, who was quickest in both the morning and afternoon sessions. AFP reported that Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone had said the matter should be dealt with by India's national motorsport association, the Federation of Motor Sports Clubs of India (FMSCI).
