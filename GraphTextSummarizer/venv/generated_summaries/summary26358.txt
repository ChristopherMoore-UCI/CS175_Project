But there was some consolation for the United States sprinters as the women's squad took gold ahead of Jamaica in the women's 4x100m relay, with Ukraine taking the bronze medal. However, a bizarre incident on the final changeover saw American third leg runner Darvis Patton crash to the ground after colliding with Harry Aikines-Aryeetey -- who was running the Great Britain anchor leg -- ruling out both teams. There was a surprise result in the men's triple jump where American Christian Taylor recorded the fourth largest jump of all time to pip Britain's defending champion Phillips Idowu. The men's marathon title went to Kenya's Abel Kirui, who finished nearly two-and-a-half minutes ahead of his team-mate Vincent Kipruto -- the biggest winning margin in world championship history. Ethiopia's Dejen Gebremeskel took bronze after his compatriot Imane Merga was disqualified for stepping inside the curb.
