-- Is child obesity a form of child neglect? Many people claim that child protective services agencies often abuse their authority and act hastily, without respect for families or what's best for the child. In the absence of actual abuse, taking a child away from his mother and placing him in foster care is not in anyone's best interests -- not the child, not the mother and not the rest of society which will have to deal with the emotional fallout for years to come. Was this an instance of child abuse? Others defend the agencies, and claim that it's better they err on the side of caution when dealing with the safety of children.
