"I can tell you this time last year we were paying approximately $36 a case," says manager Jay Holmes. Some U.S. airlines have announced they are restricting the service of limes on flights and Mexican restaurants are absorbing greater costs. "We have just generated a technology in Morelos which will launch in September," says Agriculture Ministry official Rafael Ambriz Cervantes. For Mexican producers like Juan Leana Malpica who have not been hit by shortages, all this represents a big payday. Officially, lime prices are in a spiral of hyperinflation, the national average jumping at a monthly average of around 50% this year.
