Rohingya asylum seekers One particular area of concern, according to the State Department, are reports of trafficking of Myanmar's Muslim Rohingya minority -- many of whom have fled ethnic and religious violence in the country in recent years and pass through neighboring countries, including Thailand. It said the country was a source, transit point and destination for trafficking, with ethnic minorities and citizens of neighboring countries at particular risk of exploitation in the sex trade and forced labor. Countries like Thailand and Malaysia will need to show "results" if they want to get off the State Department's list next year, CdeBaca said. For four years the U.S. State Department has warned Thailand that it hasn't been doing enough to combat human trafficking. "Human trafficking is one of the worst forms of human indignity and Thailand is committed to eliminating this inhumane exploitation," the Thai Ambassador to the United States, Vijavat Isarabhakdi, said in a recent press statement.
