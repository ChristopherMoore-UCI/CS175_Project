As the Affordable Care Act is implemented, greater health care coverage and access to health care will be cost effective over the long term. We know that people without insurance use emergency departments much more frequently, and for less urgent issues, than those with health insurance. As emergency physicians at one of the largest public hospitals in the country, we see firsthand how the lack of insurance and then access to a regular health care provider affects our patients, from the middle-aged black man with a stroke from uncontrolled and undiagnosed high blood pressure to the young black woman with breast cancer who chose to use her money to feed her children rather than seek health care. Many minorities have lower-paying jobs that do not offer health insurance, and because of the high cost of self-insuring, they choose not to purchase coverage.
