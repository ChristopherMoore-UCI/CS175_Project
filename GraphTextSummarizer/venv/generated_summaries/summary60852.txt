-- New York Yankees star Alex Rodriguez had a "consulting relationship" with a Florida anti-aging clinic accused of providing banned drugs to baseball players, but there's no evidence he did anything to violate baseball's Joint Drug Agreement, one of his attorneys told CNN Monday. Alex Rodriguez: 'I'm fighting for my life' Apparently in response to comments like these, Rob Manfred, Major League Baseball's executive vice president of economics and league affairs, sent Tacopina a letter on Monday, offering to waive confidentiality provisions. Attorney Joe Tacopina said Rodriguez was one of many athletes who consulted for Biogenesis. When asked why he wouldn't say unequivocally that Rodriguez didn't use performance-enhancing drugs, Tacopina again cited confidentiality considerations. Rodriguez is appealing a 211-game suspension that Major League Baseball levied against him this month, with the league accusing him of taking performance-enhancing drugs and having ties to the now-shuttered Biogenesis clinic.
