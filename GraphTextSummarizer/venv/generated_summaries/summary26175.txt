Some 70,000 workers took to the streets in central Greece last week for one last fight of resistance against the austerity. This has been a very messy process, with the troika leaning on the relatively new government to deliver what Greece had promised before the current administration came to power following the elections last June. He was suggesting that Greeks will soon see the flickering light at the end of the tunnel, with the full backing of German Chancellor Angela Merkel after her recent, high profile public show of support in Athens. The implicit agreement on the table: Greece delivers another $17 billion in cuts over two years from labor reforms and tops that off with a new 2013 budget. The first hurdle was the parliamentary vote last week, when the austerity measures were passed by just 153 votes out of 300.
