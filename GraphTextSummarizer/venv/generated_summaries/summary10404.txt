What Williams has accomplished with this progressive strategy -- a postmodern approach to the patriarchal voice-of-God news anchor -- is to prove that he isn't a stuffed shirt, that he is self-deprecating like Cronkite. " Cronkite was Brian Williams's all-seasons' hero, and Williams was one of the heirs apparent to the Cronkite tradition. Like Cronkite after the Tet Offensive of 1968, Williams gets on the airplane, travels to danger zones, ad-libs for hours on end seldom making a gaffe. Media critics have lauded Williams' two-act juggle: serious newsman and surprisingly funny clown. Maybe Williams needed to be reminded of which role -- newsman or showman -- was most important, which ball to favor in his juggling act.
