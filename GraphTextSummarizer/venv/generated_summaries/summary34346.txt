Fast bowler Zaheer Khan opened a window of opportunity for the hosts by snaring Dilshan and Sangakkara in successive overs in the final session, but Mahela Jayawardene (36 not out) and Thilan Samaraweera, five from a half-century, denied the home side further inroads as Sri Lanka ended on 275 for three, 151 in deficit. Ishant Sharma eventually severed that stand, forcing Paranavitana to fend at a delivery that moved away a touch and he edged to wicketkeeper Mahendra Singh Dhoni who held an excellent catch in front of first slip. Dilshan smashed 112 and featured in solid partnerships with fellow-opener Tharanga Paranavitana (35) and captain Kumar Sangakkara (31) as Sri Lanka completed a day of dominance. -- Opener Tillakaratne Dilshan scored a superb century as Sri Lanka forced their way back on the second day of the first Test against India in Ahmedabad. Zaheer had looked menacing with the new ball, but with little assistance from the pitch, Sri Lanka were off to a good start and Dilshan looked comfortable.
