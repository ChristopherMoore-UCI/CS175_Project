Some analysts say the largest U.S. network partnering with Apple could lure many defectors from AT&T, which was previously the exclusive carrier for the iPhone. In interviews and on commercials, AT&T is defending the loss of iPhone exclusivity by boasting of competitive advantages, including talk-and-surf and international use. This one isn't taking place on soap operas, but instead in commercials from AT&T and Verizon Wireless about Apple's iPhone. AT&T will begin running a new ad on national TV during prime time Friday night, a spokesman said. The most recent ad features Verizon's glasses-wearing mascot answering an iPhone, saying, "Yes, I can hear you now."
