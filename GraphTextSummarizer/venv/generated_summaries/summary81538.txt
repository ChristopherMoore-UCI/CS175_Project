Boat accidents are nothing new in remote areas of India, where ferries are often overcrowded and in poor condition due to lax safety standards. -- Authorities continued their search for bodies Wednesday, two days after one of India's worst ferry accidents claimed at least 100 lives. In 2010, a boat packed with Muslim pilgrims capsized in West Bengal in eastern India, killing at least 79. Officials said the number of recovered bodies was downgraded from 40 due to inaccurate statements from witnesses. We found some jumping onto the land, but about an hour later, bodies were floating and getting pushed to the bank," Motlef Ali told the Times of India.
