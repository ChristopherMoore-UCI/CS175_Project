The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay, citing reports, said the protests had been peaceful and that security forces used excessive force. Following a month of largely leaderless popular protests against the government, Tunisia's President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali fled the country on Friday. Libya's Moammar Gadhafi said he was "sad and hurt" after Ben Ali fled Tunisia, warning that the country was heading for "more unjustified chaos. Ben Ali was only the second president of Tunisia since it gained independence from France in 1956. Ben Ali claimed victory in five successive presidential elections since then, most recently officially taking nearly 90% of the vote in November 2009.
