"Through these arrests, we have been able to prevent a situation from occurring," Malena Rembe, head analyst at the Swedish Security Service, told CNN affiliate TV4 Sunday. -- Swedish prosecutors Tuesday asked a judge to extend the detention of four terror suspects, telling the court they were "planning to commit murder," according to legal documents obtained by CNN. Three men of Somali origin and one man born in Iraq were seized Saturday in a raid led by a SWAT team and backed by local police in Gothenburg, Sweden, the country's Security Service said. Lawyers for the other three did not immediately respond to CNN requests for comment. An art gallery in central Gothenburg was evacuated shortly before midnight local time, police said, but they declined to say whether it was connected to the arrests.
