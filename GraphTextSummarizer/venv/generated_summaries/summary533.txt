The alliance staged a protest outside the general prosecutor's office Sunday, calling for his removal from the post and accusing of him of negligence in trials of former President Hosni Mubarak and his aides. Protests have rocked Egypt's capital since a riot erupted at a soccer match in Port Said city Wednesday, killing more than 80. "Egypt is facing a dangerous situation that is not simple to deal with," Deputy Interior Minister Gen. Ahmed Gamal El Din said in a statement Sunday. Fires erupted at a nearby shopping center while more than 200 women demonstrated outside parliament, chanting anti-military slogans and demanding control of the country be handed over to civilian power. -- Demonstrators clashed with police outside the Interior Ministry in Cairo on Sunday as anger mounts over a deadly stampede at a soccer match that killed dozens last week.
