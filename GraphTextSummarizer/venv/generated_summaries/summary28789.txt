" Putin is clearly an isolated figure by Western leaders in particular at the two-day G20, after reports that Russian troops and heavy weapons are being sent across the Russian border to separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine. -- Russian President Vladimir Putin arrived in the northern Australian city of Brisbane to a scorching spring day, and a distinctly chilly reception. He told the Russian news agency in an interview on the eve of the Saturday and Sunday G20 that sanctions against Russia are against the principle of the World Trade Organization and undermine "the whole system of international economic relations." British Prime Minister David Cameron warned Russia on Friday to change its course regarding Ukraine. And Australia continues to show its anger towards Russia over the downing of MH17, which claimed the lives of 28 Australian citizens when the plane went down over Ukraine.
