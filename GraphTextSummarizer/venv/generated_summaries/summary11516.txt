Judge Mustafa Hassan Abdullah quit the case over a medical condition, Mubarak's lawyer Farid El Deeb told CNN. Morsy pleased about second trial Essam El-Erian, a senior adviser to Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy, said in January that the government looked forward to a second trial. Abdullah "submitted a medical report to the head of Cairo Cassation Court stating that he has medical problems with his eyes," El Deeb said. -- The judge in the retrial of deposed Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak recused himself Saturday, referred the trial to a lower court and then walked out of the courtroom. Mubarak will remain in custody at a hospital, El Deeb said.
