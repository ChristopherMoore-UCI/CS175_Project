-- David Beckham suffered an Achilles tendon injury before Clarence Seedorf scored in the final minute to give AC Milan a 1-0 win over Chievo on Sunday, a result that moved them to within a point of leaders Inter at the top of Serie A. Veteran England midfielder Beckham hobbled off the pitch in tears, reaching down to nurse his left heel, with TV network Sky Sports Italia reporting that he had suffered a suspected ruptured Achilles tendon injury. It's an important injury and we need to be able to judge how serious it is," Milan coach Leonardo told Sky Sports Italia. The win means Milan move to within a single point of leaders and city rivals Inter at the top of the table. A dramatic weekend in Serie A began on Friday night when leaders Inter had Sulley Muntari sent off in a shock 3-1 defeat at Catania. Roma remain in third position, six points behind Inter, after they were also held to a 3-3 draw, this time at struggling Livorno -- for whom Cristiano Lucarelli scored a hat-trick.
