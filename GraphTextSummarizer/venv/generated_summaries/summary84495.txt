Bennett's defense attorney Ben Wasserman told reporters after the arraignment that Bennett was removing dry ice from a plane's holding area because he was told the vapors were dangerous to an animal being transported in the cargo hold. Three plastic bottles containing dry ice were found, but only one had exploded, police said. When dry ice becomes warm, it transforms into vapor. -- Police on Friday arrested a second contractor employee in recent dry ice explosions at Los Angeles International Airport. On Sunday, dry ice in a plastic bottle exploded in an employee restroom, causing a brief shutdown of Terminal 2, the FBI said.
