The L.A. Galaxy midfielder, who has also played for Real Madrid and Manchester United, has played a pivotal role in bringing the Games to his hometown but was controversially omitted from Team GB's football squad last month. The former England star, who has 115 caps for his country, was part of London's bid team that won the right to stage the biggest sporting spectacle on earth back in 2005 and has worked closely with Games organizers since. "But it's exciting, I'm excited to be part of such a huge occasion for our country and for everybody involved in these Games. "It's exciting to have the Olympic Games in the East End of London and for myself to be part of that, I'm very honored. "It was seven years when this whole process started and being part of bringing the Games to a part of London where I grew up, its exciting to see everything come together," he added.
