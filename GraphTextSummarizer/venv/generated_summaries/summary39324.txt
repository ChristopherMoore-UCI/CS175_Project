The company began testing personalized searches that pulled information from Google accounts in 2012 with a select group of people. Google has spent years indexing the entire Web, but it has also been amassing huge amounts of information about the people who use Google products like Gmail, calendars and more recently Google+. People who use Google+ for their photos can ask Google to show pics from certain days or places. Not all of the experimental features from that trial are becoming available to everyone -- some tools like searching Google Drive files will remain in beta for now. The Google Now predictive search feature on mobile Google search apps automatically shows information it thinks you will need, before you search it.
