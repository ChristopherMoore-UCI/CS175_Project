Palermo keeper Alberto Fontana saved a penalty by Francesco Tavano at the end of the first half, and had to make several vital stops in the first opening period. Miccoli struck in the 76th minute with a shot from just outside the area with Livorno goalkeeper Marco Amelia partially unsighted by several players. Ezequiel Lavezzi inspired Napoli to victory against Udinese, netting twice and setting up the first goal. Genoa are at home to Catania, third-placed Juventus host bottom club Cagliari,  Sampdoria travel to Lazio, Parma play Atalanta and Reggina face fellow strugglers Torino. Pepe leveled the score on nine minutes, and then Napoli played with 10 men from the 36th minute after Paolo Cannavaro was expelled for a last-man foul.
