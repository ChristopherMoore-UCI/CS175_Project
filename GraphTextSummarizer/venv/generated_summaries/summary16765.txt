February is the third straight month of positive reports for Lohan, and a major change from recent years in which she was found in violation of probation for failed drug and alcohol tests, missed counseling sessions and community service work and a shoplifting arrest. She appears close to signing a deal to play the lead in a Lifetime network movie about legendary actress Elizabeth Taylor, who died last year. "Ms. Lohan, you're in the homestretch," Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Stephanie Sautner told the actress during a probation progress hearing Wednesday. But far fewer reporters attended Wednesday's hearing. The probation for last year's necklace theft conviction continues, but Judge Sautner said it becomes informal summary probation with no reporting requirements.
