-- Philippines Sen. Benigno "Noynoy" Aquino III announced he will run for president Wednesday, a month after the death of his late mother, the popular former President Corazon Aquino. Aquino, 49, is the only son of Corazon Aquino, who died on August 1, and the late Benigno "Ninoy" Aquino, a senator who opposed dictator Ferdinand Marcos and was assassinated in 1983 on returning home from exile in the United States. "I'm accepting the challenge to lead this fight," said Noynoy Aquino, the state-run Philippines News Agency (PNA) reported. At least one lawmaker was critical of Aquino's run, PNA said. Noynoy Aquino said his mother's supporters had urged him to make a run for the presidency in next May's elections.
