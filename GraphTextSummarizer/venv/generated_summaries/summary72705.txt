Moscow formally annexed Ukraine's southern Crimea region last week, days after the controversial referendum in which a majority of Crimeans voted to leave Ukraine for Russia. The U.N. General Assembly on Thursday approved a resolution calling the Crimean referendum to secede from Ukraine invalid. Earlier this month the House of Representatives approved Ukraine loan guarantees and is now voting on sanctions. Ukraine's elections are taking place against a backdrop of poor economic conditions, Moscow's annexation of Crimea and rumblings of discontent in the mainly Russian-speaking eastern regions. It's the latest indication of Russia's isolation within the international community over its actions in Ukraine.
