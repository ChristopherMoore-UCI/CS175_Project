"The combination of AT&T and T-Mobile would result in tens of millions of consumers all across the United States facing higher prices, fewer choices and lower quality products for mobile wireless services," said deputy attorney general James M. Cole in the Justice filing. That would ultimately make T-Mobile customers buy new phones that could function on AT&T's network -- unless, that is, you're okay with EDGE network service. The company claims it will improve wireless service for AT&T and T-Mobile customers, expand 4G coverage to more of the country and, most recently, add a significant number of jobs to the U.S. workforce. Posted to a T-Mobile message board this morning, one user's feelings nail the sentiment among consumers following Wednesday's announcement that the Justice Department is suing to block AT&T's proposed acquisition of the Deutsche-Telekom--owned wireless network. T-Mobile users generally responded positively to the news that they wouldn't be seeing the AT&T death star on their cellphone bills anytime soon.
