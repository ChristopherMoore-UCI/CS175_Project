What does it say about our capacity to care when we are barely moved by video shot on shaky cellphone cameras of innocent people being slaughtered, but we suddenly get a collective conscious because of a slick Hollywood production documenting a 25-year-old issue on the decline. Torture, rape, conscription; tent poles for the single, sad story on Africa that Western society has come to accept. In less than a week, Invisible Children (IC) has cemented the legitimacy of social media for global engagement if the Arab Spring hadn't already. In two weeks, IC will have millions of dollars; you will have a t-shirt and bracelet; and Uganda and Central Africa will be left wondering what just happened. I would have welcomed an opportunity for IC to partner with those of us visible and empowered to drive the conversation to its rightful audience, therein instilling a permanent sense of strong civic responsibility that is the basis of all modern societies.
