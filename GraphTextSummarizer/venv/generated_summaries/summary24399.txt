The shipper said it was a $37 piece of art craft being sent to the United States as a Christmas present. Deputy Special Agent in Charge Anthony Scandiffio of the Homeland Security Investigations said: "The recovery of the La Coiffeuse sends a strong message to thieves that the market to sell stolen antiquities in the United States is drying up." It was discovered by U.S. Customs and Border Patrol and seized by Homeland Security Investigations. The work of art, painted in 1911 by the Cubist master, was recovered when it was shipped from Belgium to the United States in December. In December, the painting came to the United States.
