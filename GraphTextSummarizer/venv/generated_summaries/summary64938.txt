"Any other race I don't think it would really matter but the Melbourne Cup is such an Australian icon that it is hard for them to stomach that it might be leaving Australian shores," he told CNN's Winning Post. Home-grown entries have been overshadowed by foreign contenders as a lucrative prize pot lures horses bred and trained mainly in Europe. Quarantine regulations also make it difficult for international trainers to bring in their own food so the horses have to get used to the local cuisine. "Which is not a help and they suffer from jetlag just the same as people do and they take quite a while to adjust," he told CNN's Winning Post. Kavanagh, like most Australian trainers, is not particularly sympathetic to the foreign horses' plight, but as long as the prize money remains high, it's likely that entrants will come from far and wide. Cup memories: The legs that stopped a nation British horse trainer Luca Cumani, who has twice narrowly missed out on winning the cup, says another reason why there are more international entries is because European horses tend to be bred for covering longer distances compared to their Australian counterparts. Bred in Ireland but owned and trained in Australia, Green Moon's victory will be sweet for local horse trainers and racing fans, who have seen the cup go to international entries in recent years. Six of the eight favorites in this year's race were from overseas and were dubbed by Australian media as "international invaders."
