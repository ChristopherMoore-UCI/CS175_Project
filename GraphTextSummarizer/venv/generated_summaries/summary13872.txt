Celebrating female athletes from the Arab world, a photo exhibition called "Hey-Ya (Let's Go!): Arab Women in Sport," has opened in London. Qatar and Brunei are also allowing female athletes to compete at the Olympics for the first time, making these Games a landmark for Arab women. "With the inclusion of the two athletes from Saudi Arabia in London, I think it's about to turn the corner for women too," Lacombe said. Lacombe says she hopes her portraits will inspire other young girls, who might become sports stars one day. Commissioned by the Qatar Museums Authority, the photos show athletes from many countries and feature Olympic competitors and non-Olympians alike.
