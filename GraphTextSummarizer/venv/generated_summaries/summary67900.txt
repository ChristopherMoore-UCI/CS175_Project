Two more celebrities have joined comedian Drew Carey in offering a reward to find those responsible for using the widespread ice bucket challenge trend to trick an autistic teenager into being drenched with a bucket of urine, feces and spit. http://t.co/ugqeLbu5ob Bay Village is a suburb of Cleveland, Carey's hometown and the city where "The Drew Carey Show" was based. The stunt appears to be a spoof of the ALS ice bucket challenge in which participants get a bucket of ice water dumped over their heads. Jenny McCarthy and Donnie Wahlberg joined Carey on Sunday in offering $10,000 each over Twitter to find those behind the prank on the student from Bay Village, Ohio.
