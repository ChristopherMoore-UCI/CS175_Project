The first two weeks of the NBA's regular season have been canceled, as basketball players and management have yet to reach a deal on a new labor agreement, Commissioner David Stern announced, according to NBA.com. The commissioner had warned last week that such a cancellation may well be coming, at which time Los Angeles Lakers' guard and NBA Players Association President Derek Fisher acknowledged the stakes. Stern has said that last season was not profitable for most of the league's 30 owners, who want cost-cutting help from players. The two sides remain far apart, Stern said from the NBA meetings. Less than a week ago, the NBA canceled its preseason, which meant the loss of about $200 million in revenue, Stern said.
