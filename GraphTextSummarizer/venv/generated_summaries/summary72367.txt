The result means Chicago will face off against Las Vegas at 3:30 p.m. ET Saturday for the U.S. championship. The winner of that game plays for the World Series title on Sunday. While other girls have played in the World Series, none have gotten the same attention as the South Philadelphia resident and Taney Dragons standout. The 13-year-old became a national sensation after tossing a shutout -- giving up three hits and notching six strikeouts in the process -- to help Taney become one of the final 16 World Series contenders. The Sports Illustrated cover girl and her Philadelphia team are out of the Little League World Series after losing an elimination game Thursday night in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, to a squad from Chicago.
