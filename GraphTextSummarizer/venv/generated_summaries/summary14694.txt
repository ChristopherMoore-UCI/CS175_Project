The Chilean scampered into the area as Wilshere swapped passes with German World Cup winner Mesut Ozil, to fire low past Besiktas goalkeeper Tolga Zengin. After goalkeeper Vladislav Stoyanov was sent off in extra time, defender Cosmin Moti donned the gloves as the tie finished 1-1 on aggregate after extra time. Elsewhere, Spanish side Athletic Bilbao came from behind to eliminate Napoli, from Italy, and take its place in the European Champions League group stages for the first time in 16 years. Former Chelsea striker Demba Ba, who wasted several opportunities in the first leg, narrowly failed to poke the ball past Arsenal goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny as the Turkish side showed they could still pose an offensive threat. Ludogorets Razgrad, of Bulgaria, made the group stages for the first time after a fairytale penalty shootout victory over Romania's Steaua Bucurest.
