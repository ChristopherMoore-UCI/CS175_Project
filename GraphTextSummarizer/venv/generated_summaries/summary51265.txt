Such language is seen with greater, albeit varying, frequency on cable television, the Internet and satellite radio, which do not use public airwaves. Now the Supreme Court will weigh in on the "isolated" use of such words -- politely referred to as "fleeting expletives" -- and the power of government to clamp down on what it sees as pervasive indecent language on the public airwaves. "The crux of this case is whether the inconsistent way the FCC has regulated indecent speech gives writers, producers, and directors, as well as television broadcasters, clear guidelines for them to comply," said Schwartzman, whose group has filed legal briefs on behalf of the creative forces that provide programming for the networks. They say "s---t" is forbidden under FCC rules, but not "poop" or "crap," even though all those words are crude references to excrement. The appeals court ruling said the FCC did not adequately explain amendments to and enforcement of its "vague" policy on broadcasts of profanity.
