Hurley is the 12-year-old Connecticut boy whose misspelling of "Emancipation" during a Kids Week episode on "Jeopardy!" took social media by storm. Social media howls over 12-year-old's errant 't' on 'Jeopardy!' I eventually did return to "Millionaire" for a special series of shows honoring "zero dollar winners." And I know that Thomas' family, friends and social media supporters have to be thrilled that he got a chance to compete on national television. This young man got to do something that so many Americans would love to do, myself included: be a contestant on "Jeopardy!"
