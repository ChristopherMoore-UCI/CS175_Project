Syria's government has denied using chemical weapons, arguing its troops came under chemical attack by rebel fighters. U.N. weapons inspectors are expected to report their findings regarding a chemical attack in Syria early next week, sources said Wednesday, but a leading human rights group is already pointing its finger at government troops. Some of those photos included detailed measurements of a 330mm rocket so far seen only in the hands of government forces -- a model "compatible, and perhaps specifically designed, for the delivery of chemical agents. The U.N. team that investigated the attack is tasked with confirming whether chemical weapons were used, but its mandate doesn't include assigning blame for the attack. President Barack Obama told Americans on Tuesday night that he would put off punitive strikes on Syria to pursue the diplomatic opening from Russia.
