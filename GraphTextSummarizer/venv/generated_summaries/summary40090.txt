The Colorado Department of Transportation shut down highways across the southeastern part of the state because of snow and icy conditions. There were blizzard conditions in parts of western Kansas and southeast Colorado, with visibility of less than a quarter-mile, said Ariel Cohen, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma. A blizzard warning was in effect for those areas along with northeastern New Mexico, the northwest Texas panhandle and the Oklahoma panhandle, he said. Snow accumulations of up to 6 inches were likely, with higher accumulations expected across the northwest Texas Panhandle, Perry's office said. The DOT said U.S. 50 was closed because of blizzard conditions and "multiple accidents" in Colorado.
