Indonesia's government has since warned residents of West Sumatra province to stay alert and stay away from the coastline for up to five days because of the possibility of more earthquakes, Balanda said. Some of the missing might include people who are unaccounted for after fleeing to higher ground, said Henri Dori Satoko, head of the Mentawai Islands parliament. The hard-hit Mentawai Islands region is among Indonesia's myriad islands. An assessment team from the nonprofit group SurfAid International had reached the disaster zone, but the area's remoteness prevented further contact with headquarters in Sumatera Barat, Indonesia. Urgent needs are expected to include clean water, food, blankets, clothing, medical attention, emergency shelter and hygiene kits, said Ita Balanda, a program manager for the World Vision aid organization in Padang, Indonesia.
