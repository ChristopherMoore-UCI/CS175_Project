-- New court documents released Friday in the Colorado movie theater shooting reveal that suspect James Holmes "had conversations with a classmate about wanting to kill people" months before the July 20 massacre. "Fenton made initial phone calls about engaging the BETA team" in "the first 10 days" of June, but it "never came together" because in the period Fenton was having conversations with team members, Holmes began the process of dropping out of school, a source told KMGH. Holmes, 24, is accused of opening fire at an Aurora theater last month during a midnight premiere of the latest Batman movie, "The Dark Knight Rises," leaving 12 dead and injuring 58 others. They told KMGH that Fenton contacted several members of a "behavioral evaluation and threat assessment" team to say Holmes could be a danger to others, the station reported. She was so concerned about his behavior that she mentioned it to her colleagues, saying he could be a danger to others, CNN affiliate KMGH reported this month, citing sources with knowledge of the investigation.
