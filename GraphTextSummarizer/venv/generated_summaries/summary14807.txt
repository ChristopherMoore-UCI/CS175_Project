French composer Maurice Jarre wrote scores for films by Hollywood legends like John Huston, Alfred Hitchcock and David Lean. There are many composers of whom I know that are film composers by default, simply because it's a job; it's a good occupation. With films where the directors aren't so great, it's much more difficult to write good music. The late Academy Award-winning composer Maurice Jarre enjoyed a glittering career composing the scores to many classic films. But it is the French composer's work with British director David Lean -- the scores to "Lawrence of Arabia," "Dr Zhivago," and "A Passage to India," for which he won three Oscars --  for which he is best remembered.
