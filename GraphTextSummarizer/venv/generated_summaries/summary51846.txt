But concerns about privacy and payment mean many doctors would rather communicate with patients on the phone or face-to-face. Does the Affordable Care Act require doctors and hospitals to use electronic medical records? That's why many doctors don't communicate with patients via e-mail, and continue to send prescriptions and referrals via fax. The stimulus package, which pre-dates Obamacare, offers doctors, hospitals and some other health providers money to help them upgrade from paper to digital records, but the Affordable Care Act does not. More hospitals are starting to use electronic records to track patients, coordinate inpatient and post-hospital care and to record how well they're performing in an effort to win bonuses and avoid penalties put in place by the ACA.
