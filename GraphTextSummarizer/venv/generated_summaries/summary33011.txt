Daman styles each ensemble, putting different pieces together to create something unique, like Serena van der Woodsen's (Blake Lively) Jimmy Choo bag and Marc Jacobs laptop case, which peeked out of the tote. Thanks to countless pleas from fans, costume designer Eric Daman is bringing back Blair Waldorf's (Leighton Meester) headbands. Either way, fans will see Daman channel a different decade on the '80s-set "Sex and the City" prequel, "The Carrie Diaries," which is expected to debut on The CW in January. And while Daman notes many high points in his five years working on the series, his proudest moment came during season 2, when he watched his own creation walk the runway in "The Serena Also Rises. In the meantime, Daman is excited for fans to see what he's got up his sleeves for the last season of "Gossip Girl."
