The wheel, described only as "very big," was being towed back to California aboard a barge along with the spacecraft and "basking in the glow of being the first cheese to travel to orbit on a commercial spacecraft," company spokeswoman Kirstin Brost told CNN. co-founder Elon Musk hinted at the cargo after the capsule's successful splashdown in the Pacific Ocean on Wednesday afternoon, suggesting it had something to do with the British comedy troupe Monty Python. It was the first flight under NASA's Commercial Orbital Transportation Services program, which aims to develop commercial supply services to the international space station. The Dragon was launched into low-Earth orbit on Wednesday from Florida's Kennedy Space Center and splashed down about 500 miles off the coast of Southern California about three hours later.
