The informant also said Anderson had told him he takes the barrel with him when he moves from state to state. "Mr. Anderson is only wanted for questioning at this time," said Christina Garza of the Harris County Sheriff's Office. According to court documents, the tipster who led police to the body said Anderson had told him he had strangled a person and placed the body in the barrel. Last week, Harris County Sheriff's Office investigators received a Crime Stoppers tip about a body being in a barrel at a northwest Houston address. The remains were taken to the Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences for identification and to try to find the cause of death.
