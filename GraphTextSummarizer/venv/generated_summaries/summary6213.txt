In the Swedish city of Gothenburg, a group of civil servants began scaling back their work day to six hours this summer, as part of a government trial to see whether shorter work days can improve productivity and lead to employees taking fewer sick days. French technology company Atos is working towards eliminating internal email use altogether after research found only around of tenth of the emails staff received on an average day were useful. But initiatives like these are still very much the exception in Asia, where working hours are notoriously grueling. "We think that doing activities like this makes it easier for people to work here," Vincent Stolk, a junior art director at the company, told CNN by email. In 2011, Volkswagen began restricting email access for some of its employees in Germany when they were off duty.
