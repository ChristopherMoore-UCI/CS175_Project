Croatian Ivan Rakitic's 21st minute goal proving enough to secure three points and relieve the pressure on coach Gregorio Manzano. A win would have sent Villarreal up to third place but an 82nd minute strike by Uruguay's Sebastian Fernandez cancelled out Marco Ruben's 36th minute goal. Mourinho milestone as Real Madrid win Villarreal missed the opportunity to close the gap on Champions League rivals Valencia (who drew 0-0 with Sporting Gijon on Saturday), as they played out a 1-1 draw against bottom-of-the-table Malaga. Lola (81st minute) and Fernando Soriano (88th minute) completed a resounding win which lifts Osasuna out of the bottom three. Argentine Pablo Piatti had put Almeria ahead three minutes into the second half, but Deportivo's goalkeeper Dani Aranzubia scored a dramatic 95th minute equalizer.
