Dzeko was also involved in Liverpool's equalizer, as new signing Daniel Sturridge scored his fourth goal in six games despite an apparent foul by teammate Daniel Agger on the City striker. " Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard put his side head with a stunning volley in the 73rd minute, but Aguero -- whose injury-time goal against Queens Park Rangers in May ended City's 44-year wait for a league title -- embarrassed Reina soon after to leave the visitors in seventh place. -- Sergio Aguero earned Manchester City a long-awaited title in the final seconds of last season, and his manager hopes that Sunday's stunning effort against Liverpool means the 2012-13 Premier League crown is still a possibility. "Aguero's finish for the second was unbelievable but from our perspective we are bitterly disappointed he was in that situation," said Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers. "Two years ago Chelsea were nine points behind and when they went to play at Old Trafford two games from the end they were only two points behind," City manager Roberto Mancini told reporters.
