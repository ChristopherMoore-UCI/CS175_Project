-- It may seem counterintuitive, but federal aviation officials said Wednesday they will make the skies safer for air travelers not by punishing FAA employees who report making mistakes, but by protecting them from punishment. The FAA took a half-step in that direction in 2008, creating a nonpunitive reporting system for air traffic controllers. Safety advocates have long touted the benefits of nonpunitive systems, and some welcomed the FAA's announcement. On Wednesday, the FAA said it was expanding the program to employees who maintain radar installations and other systems. FAA officials said they used to be able to measure risk by counting accidents.
