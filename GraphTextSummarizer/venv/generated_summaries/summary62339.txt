Medvedev's trip to New Delhi follows similar trade-promoting visits by U.S. President Barack Obama, France's Nicolas Sarkozy and Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao. In their talks, visiting Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh reviewed cooperation in military, technical, energy, high-technology and telecommunications. At present, two nuclear power plants are being built in southern India with Russian assistance. India and Russia share a robust collaboration in defense, with Moscow supplying more than 60 percent of military hardware to New Delhi. Apart from 11 agreements the two countries signed during the Medvedev-Singh news conference, a contract for joint design and development of fifth-generation fighter aircraft was also being concluded on the margins of the current summit, officials say.
