Although many students first encountered "Speak" in high schools, it's now being taught in middle schools, Anderson said. For the 15th anniversary of "Speak," Anderson is lending her support  to the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network, a resource for survivors of sexual violence. "Speak" is about teen rape, the pressures of high school and the insularity of small-town life, but most importantly, it's about overcoming stigma, Anderson said. Fifteen years after its publication, society has shed some of the stigma associated with sexual violence, but the conflict at the heart of "Speak" still shows up in headlines, from Steubenville, Ohio, to Maryville, Missouri. Anderson said she wrote "Speak" based on her own experience of being raped as a teen.
