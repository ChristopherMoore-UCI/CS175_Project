Though caning is used as a supplementary punishment in Malaysia for at least 40 crimes, such as rape or immigration violations, it is not meted out by Malaysia's civil court for alcohol consumption. "Regardless of whether or not such penalties fall under Syariah law or civil law, we believe that these should be repealed, as they go against the fundamental human right to be free from torture and violence," said Haslinah Yaacob, vice president for the All Women's Action Society. The moderate Muslim country has a dual-track justice system, in which Islamic courts operate alongside civil courts. The caning would have been carried out within seven days of that, making her the first woman to be caned in Malaysia under sharia law. Kartika, a 32-year-old part-time model and mother of two, was visiting Malaysia from Singapore at the time.
