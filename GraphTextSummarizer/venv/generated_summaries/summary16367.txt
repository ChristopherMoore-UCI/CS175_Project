The computer, along with a letter from Apple co-founder Steve Jobs to its original owner, is believed to be one of only six working Apple 1s and one of only three on the open market. " Jobs and Steve Wozniak famously created the Apple computer in Jobs' family garage, building the device by hand and financing the company through the sale of Wozniak's fancy calculator and Jobs' VW camper van. The buyer, who chose to remain anonymous, is from the Far East, according to Uwe H. Breker of Auction Team Breker, which auctioned off a roster of vintage tech Saturday in Cologne. About 200 Apple 1s were built, and fewer than 50 are believed to exist still -- most of them not in working order. Saturday's lot also included the letter from Jobs to a Fred Hatfield at Computer Data Systems in Columbus, Ohio.
