Homicide rates in Central America and the Caribbean are nearing a "crisis point," according to a United Nations report. The U.N. report estimates the total number of homicides globally at 468,000 people in 2010 -- 36% took place in Africa, 31% in the Americas and 27% in Asia. "Organized crime -- especially drug trafficking -- accounted for a quarter of deaths caused by firearms in the Americas, compared to only 5% of homicides in Asia and Europe," the report says. Across Central America, homicide rates have increased in five out of eight countries over the past five years, with Honduras seeing homicide rates more than double between 2005 and 2010. "Globally, some 80% of homicide victims and perpetrators are men," the report says.
