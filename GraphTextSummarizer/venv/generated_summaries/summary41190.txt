The close race for world number one will continue at the Jamie Farr Owens Corning Classic in Ohio next weekend, but Kerr will skip the tournament to rest ahead of the U.S. Women's Open on July 8. "It's a dream performance," Kerr told the official LPGA Tour website. -- Cristie Kerr is the first player from the United States to top the women's world rankings after her runaway victory in the LPGA Championship at Locust Hill Country Club in New York. Kerr was claiming her 14th career victory on the LPGA Tour and winning her second major after the 2007 U.S. Open. Miyazato, who needed to finish in second place to keep top spot was impressed with Kerr's performance.
