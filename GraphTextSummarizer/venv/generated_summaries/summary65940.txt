The days of Japanese being ashamed to enter love hotels are coming to an end, though, Mansfield said. "The bad image that love hotels had has faded over time. "I'd hate to use the term "recession-proof," but it's certainly proven very resilient over the last six to nine months," said Steve Mansfield, CEO of New Perspectives, which operates six love, or "leisure," hotels in Japan. One man, who declined to be named, said: "I go to love hotels when I'm drunk and don't feel like going home." Whatever the reasons, the hotels have been doing well enough that Mansfield recently went to London, seeking investors to expand. Love hotels fill a need for privacy in a country where high population density often means couples have little time alone.
