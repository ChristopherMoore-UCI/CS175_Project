-- "Eat, Pray, Love" author Elizabeth Gilbert returns to her roots with her latest foray into fiction. I think the simplest way to describe it is that you can't invent drama when you're living drama. Gilbert: I just got so lucky after "Eat, Pray, Love," I had all these resources and all this freedom to be able to fund whatever I wanted to do with my life. In her free time, Gilbert stays loyal to the passions she immortalized in her best-selling memoir: yoga, travel and her husband, played memorably by Javier Bardem in the movie version of "Eat, Pray, Love." Elizabeth Gilbert:  It's inevitable that readers who came to know me, and who know my passions and my interests, will see aspects of me.
