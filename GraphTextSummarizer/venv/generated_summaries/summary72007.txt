Davis also reviewed Bulger's FBI informant file and found the quality of information "worthless." Soon after openly questioning the quality of Bulger's information, Davis testified that corrupt FBI supervisor John Morris, who was on the Bulger payroll, moved the top-echelon files closer to his Organized Crime Squad. Davis says he felt Bulger should have been terminated as an informant, but didn't aggressively pursue it with his superiors or anyone at FBI headquarters in Washington. Retired FBI Agent James Crawford testified that 10 days before Halloran and his friend Michael Donahue were murdered, he was approached by a woman described as having a "close relationship" with Steven "The Rifleman" Flemmi, Bulger's crime partner. Bulger is accused of committing, among them the death of Bulger crime associate Brian Halloran.
