In the final hours of a visit meant to demonstrate the deep societal ties between the U.S. and India, President Barack Obama briefly broke from his gushing praise for the new Prime Minister to make a soft but undisguised push toward gender equality and religious freedom. Speaking to an audience of students and activists in New Delhi on Tuesday, Obama declared the U.S. was India's best-suited partner as it makes rapid economic advances and appears poised to overtake China to become the world's most populous nation. During his remarks Tuesday, Obama said India must commit to reducing emissions that cause climate change, even as the manufacturing and power plants that produce that pollution drive India to new economic heights. White House officials say that the level of personal interaction between the leaders exceeded even their already high expectations, and that the relationship greased the way for progress on a civilian nuclear deal to allow U.S. firms to construct power plants in India. Obama traveled to India in the hopes of capitalizing on the deep personal warmth he's quickly developed with new Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whose effervescent welcome for the American President was covered enthusiastically and exhaustively by Indian media.
