Life throws rotten things our way each day. Pope Francis has, in this unlikely venue, given us his own Sermon on the Mount, his Ten Commandments for happiness and inner peace. (Exodus 20:8) Once a week, give a whole day to meditation, worship, family life, tending the needs of the spirit. Work for peace. He has prayed for peace and worked for peace.
