New York authorities continue to investigate the Ward incident, according to media reports. Stewart opted out of three races after his car hit Kevin Ward Jr., who was walking on the track during an Empire Super Sprints series race August 9 in New York. Authorities announced two days later that 20-year-old Ward, a New York sprint car driver, had died of "massive blunt trauma. My thoughts and prayers are with his family, friends and everyone affected by this tragedy." Ward, from Port Leyden, New York, was in his fifth season in the Empire Super Sprints series. Ward Sr. said the race was the only time he had ever seen his son get out of the car while it was still on the track.
