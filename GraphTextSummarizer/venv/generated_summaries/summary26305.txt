-- Chinese basketball star Yao Ming has suffered a fresh injury setback which could place his NBA career in jeopardy. The giant 7ft 6 (2.29 meters) center also sat out all of last season after fracturing a bone in his left foot and undergoing major surgery. The seven-time All-Star has a stress fracture in his left ankle, his Houston Rockets team announced on its website. Yao, 30, has been sidelined since November 10 after playing just five games in the current NBA campaign. Yao was the first pick in the 2002 NBA draft and has built up a reputation as one of its leading players during his career at Houston.
