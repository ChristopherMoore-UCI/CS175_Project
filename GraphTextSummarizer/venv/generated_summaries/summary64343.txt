I am 16-years-old and where I come from in Bangladesh, many girls my age grow quickly from children to adults because they are forced into marriage. Every girl should have the right to that life, but there are millions of girls in my country who are not so fortunate and are subjected to child marriage. Building awareness through films like "Girl Rising" that pressure governments to implement laws against child marriage and educating communities like World Vision does in Bangladesh. At the time when girls should be deciding on where to go to university, most girls in my country are deciding on a wedding dress. But yet, Bangladesh has the highest rate of child marriage among the south Asian countries.
