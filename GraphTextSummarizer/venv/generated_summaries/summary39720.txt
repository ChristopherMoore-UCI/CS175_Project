"The little church in Dyess, Arkansas, has been such an inspiration to me, and (so have) the people from Dyess," Cash said at the 40th reunion of Dyess High School in 1990, in a video exhibited at the Dyess Colony Museum. Cash and his second wife, singer June Carter Cash, had a son together. Before he changed the music industry with songs like "Ring of Fire" and "Folsom Prison Blues," Johnny Cash spent his hardscrabble childhood in the small community of Dyess, Arkansas. With the restoration of Cash's childhood home and nearby Dyess Colony Administration Building complete, work has already begun on the restoration of the historic Dyess Theatre adjacent to the administration building, to be used as a visitor center. Other furnishings and objects are of the time period and mostly contributed by donors, said Ruth Hawkins, director of Arkansas Heritage Sites at Arkansas State University.
