-- French President Nicolas Sarkozy courted far-right voters Monday in advance of a May 6 runoff against Socialist Francois Hollande, who won the most support in the first round of France's presidential elections. French Trade and Tourism Minister Frederic Lefebvre described Hollande as "the choice of the past," with other Sarkozy backers playing up the fact that Francois Mitterand didn't select him as one of his ministers during his 14 years as president, which ended in 1995. Hollande and Sarkozy now go to a second round because no one got a majority Sunday. Especially with neither of them close to a majority, who assumes the presidency hinges on what support Sarkozy or Hollande can get from those who didn't back them Sunday. In his speech Sunday night, Melenchon urged his supporters to "fight against Sarkozy" -- noting that he's not "asking for anything in exchange" from Hollande for siding with him.
