THE CRITIC Name: Jonathan Romney Credentials: Film critic for British newspaper The Independent on Sunday Cannes experience: 17 years It's heavily loaded with big names and the strange thing is that this year there are very few surprises in there. THE BLOGGER Name: Karina Longworth Credentials: Co-founder of Cinematical film blog and editor of Spout blog Cannes experience: two years She's shown skill at her version of costume dramas in the past with films like "The Piano," which won the Palme d'Or in 1994. I try to go and see films that I might not ever be able to see again. The line-up at this year's Cannes Film Festival is a cineaste's dream.
