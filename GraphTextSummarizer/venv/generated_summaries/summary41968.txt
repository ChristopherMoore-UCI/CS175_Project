Police officers are suing Knox's parents, Edda Mellas and Curt Knox, accusing them of defamation for their description of how Amanda was treated after her arrest in the murder of Meredith Kercher. Knox, 23, was sentenced in December 2009 to 26 years in prison for Kercher's death at the villa the two shared in Perugia, the central Italian town where both were students. Mellas and Knox were indicted in February on charges of libeling police in Perugia, the family's Italian attorney said. Knox won a legal victory last week when key DNA evidence from her murder trial was called into question. In a 146-page report, forensic science professors Carla Vecchiotti and Stefano Conti concluded that while Knox's DNA was present on the knife handle, tests for Kercher's DNA were unreliable.
