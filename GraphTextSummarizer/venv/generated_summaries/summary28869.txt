The scene in the aftermath of the assault, punctuated by images of grief-stricken people and blood-covered pavement, was recorded last month by opposition activists who braved the wrath of Syrian security and slipped into the suburban Damascus city to bear witness to the tumult with their cameras. Residents say Syrian security forces raiding a building in search of weapons wiped out members of several families. Syrians activists say the world needs to get one more glimpse of the horror and despair engulfing Syria. These latest sights, recorded by the activists at a dingy building in the dark of night, bear witness to the grim conflict in cities, towns and villages across Syria. Another man said security forces ordered men and women into two rooms and executed them, one after the other.
