Children's organization UNICEF issued a statement Monday saying: "Child marriages violate the rights of children in the most deplorable way. "Although the cause of her death was lack of medical care, the real case was the lack of education in Yemen and the fact that child marriages keep happening," said Seyaj President Ahmed al-Qureshi. Child marriage denies girls of their childhood, deprives them of an education and robs them of their innocence." A 12-year-old Yemeni girl, who was forced into marriage, died during a painful childbirth that also killed her baby, a children's rights group said Monday. Marriage means the girls are no longer a financial or moral burden to their parents.
