When police caught up with Hill on Saturday, he kept them at bay for eight hours atop a cliff in West Hills, said Officer Bruce Borihanh. On Tuesday night, West Valley police were called to a home on Hayvenhurst Avenue following reports of an assault with a deadly weapon. To take Hill into custody, officers used their stun guns on him - at which point he fell, Borihanh said. Then, without provocation, Hill grabbed a sword -- typically used as a prop -- and attacked one of the men, police said. When two men tried to intervene, Hill attacked them too, police said.
