Dubai, whose economy relies heavily on real estate, saw property prices slump as much as 60% during that time. Cayan Tower, which spirals at 90 degrees from the bottom to the top, was inaugurated on Monday with a spectacular firework display as it stands in the Dubai Marina, a man-made harbour. Analysts at property consultant, Jones Lang LaSalle, say real estate investment in the first quarter of the year has been "very active". Now Dubai, one of seven emirates making up the United Arab Emirates, is home to another record: the tallest twisted structure in the world. The world's tallest tower, the longest driverless public transit network, the largest illuminated advertising sign, to name a few.
