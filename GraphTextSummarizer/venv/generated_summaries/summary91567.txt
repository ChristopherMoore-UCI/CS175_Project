CNN's Claudia Rebaza, Richard Allen Greene, Sarah Brown and Dominique Van Heerden contributed to this report. "We've just been sitting, waiting in a plane meant to take off" this morning, she told CNN iReport. "Runways closed (and) lots of smoke," she told CNN iReport. Instagram user Shazia Shaikh took a photograph from the office where she works at Heathrow Airport of emergency vehicles surrounding a plane. The slides were deployed on the left side of the aircraft, indicating that the problem was with the right engine, said CNN's Richard Quest.
