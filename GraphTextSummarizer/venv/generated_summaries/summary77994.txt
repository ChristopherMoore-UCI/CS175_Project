Another is to expand the lawsuit against President Obama that House Republicans already approved to challenge his authority to implement Obamacare. One option GOP leaders are considering is passing a short term spending bill -one lasting a few weeks even -  that would avoid a shutdown and give them more time to decide how to respond to the President after he rolls out his plan, which is expected by the end of the year. The House and Senate need to pass a measure during the lame duck session to fund federal agencies, which will run out of money in mid-December. That leaves the clock ticking before the government runs out of money on December 11th. Congressional Republicans are vowing to fight President Barack Obama's plan to make immigration changes through executive action, but they are struggling with how to do that without triggering another government shutdown.
