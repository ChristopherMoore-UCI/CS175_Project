-- Authorities Tuesday recovered the body of an eighth missing snowmobiler buried in avalanches in southern British Columbia, a spokesman for the the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said. Authorities found seven bodies a day after avalanches in British Columbia, Canada. The mayor said temperatures as low as minus 30 degrees Fahrenheit in recent weeks had warmed up in the last two or three days to 25 degrees Fahrenheit. These two used their avalanche beacons to locate a third buried victim who they rescued after an additional 20 minutes of digging," police said. The mayor described the snowmobilers as upstanding citizens, most of them working in coal mines or as businessmen.
