In Wednesday's protests, police arrested demonstrator Diego Garcia, 26, who was accused of taunting officers, antagonizing a police dog and urging the crowd to join him. Rather than comply with officers, the man swung the gardening shears at the officers near him, according to police. On May 9, police received 911 calls about a man chasing people and waving a large knife, and after arriving on the scene, officers used a Taser on the suspect, Osman Hernandez, 26, who had no arrest history in Salinas, police said. From a distance, a witness took a videotape of the encounter between two police officers and the suspect, who walked away from police before being shot and killed. When police responded to a 911 call, the suspect was walking on Elkington Avenue and police noticed he had a large pair of gardening shears sticking out of his backpack, police said.
