-- New York police say they've found no evidence corroborating a claim by actress Amanda Bynes that she was sexually harassed after police were called to her apartment. Once inside, the officers noticed a bong and other marijuana paraphernalia sitting on a coffee table, which Bynes immediately started to throw out a window, police said. Bynes had headed back to her apartment by the time police arrived, but she let officers in when they knocked on the door, they said. "A credible civilian witness who was with the officers throughout told investigators that none touched Ms. Bynes inappropriately or otherwise engaged in misconduct at any time," a NYPD Internal Affairs representative said. Officers were called Thursday to her building in Manhattan's theater district after her building manager reported the 27-year-old was smoking an "illegal substance" in the lobby, police said.
