While smaller in size than many Obama rallies during the 2008 campaign, the crowd dwarfed the size of any rally held this cycle by Romney. President Barack Obama formally opened his re-election bid Saturday with two rallies in which he highlighted accomplishments over his three and a half years in the White House and argued that America can't afford to adopt Republicans' "bad ideas. In this 36-minute-long address, Obama said presumptive Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney would "rubber stamp" the congressional GOP agenda, telling the crowd that "we cannot give him that chance." "That's the choice in this election, and that's why I'm running for a second term as president of the United States," added Obama. While President Obama all but ignored his record over three and a half years in office, the American people won't. The most recent public opinion poll in Ohio, released earlier this week by Quinnipiac University, indicated a tie between Obama and Romney.
