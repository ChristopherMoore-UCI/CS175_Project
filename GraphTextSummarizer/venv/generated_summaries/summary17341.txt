'They are interested in killing' Ayesha Siddiqua, a Pakistani analyst and author of "Military Inc.," told CNN that Pakistan needs to rethink its approach to militant groups and whether any form of militancy is tolerated in the country. Earlier this year, the government held tentative peace talks with the Pakistan Taliban -- formally known as Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP -- but it suspended them after two brazen attacks around Pakistan's largest airport in Karachi in June.
