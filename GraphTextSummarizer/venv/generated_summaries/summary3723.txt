He joked about people asking him to comment on celebrity couples during interviews and getting tapped for dating advice at dinner parties. eHarmony uses advanced technology to create personality profiles to match prospective couples, and it was that element that convinced Waldorf to become an early investor. "This is a service that people come to with incredible expectations, that presents a challenge for us, because they want to meet their soul mate." Though he is passionate about eHarmony's ability to help people find love, Waldorf met his wife the old-fashioned way -- through friends! When I asked Waldorf about this, he said that in the future the company may look into providing different services, including same-sex, but that at the moment their research was designed specifically for heterosexual couples looking for marriage. Waldorf said the company had no connection to any religion and was open to people of all faiths who were looking for a happy long-term relationship.
