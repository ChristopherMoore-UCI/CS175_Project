"These are people from different resorts from every state from Hawaii, Arizona, Texas, New York where they were there when he was banned or they were assaulted or they claim to be escorts that were hired by Travolta," attorney Okorie Okorocha told CNN Wednesday. But Singer came out swinging hard against Okorocha on Wednesday, first questioning the suit's detailed description of the first incident in which Travolta allegedly groped a male massage therapist repeatedly and finally masturbated during the two-hour session in a bungalow at the Beverly Hills Hotel on January 16. A photograph of Travolta, which Singer said was taken at the New York fitting, bears a digital timestamp of January 16 at 4:30 p.m., although the time zone was not specified. Singer's claim that Travolta was on another side of the country and not with John Doe No. 1 will be easy to disprove, Okorocha said. "Our client will be fully vindicated in court on both of these absurd and fictional claims." Unless Travolta accepts an out-of-court settlement, the actor can expect to testify in public and on camera about the allegations, Okorocha said.
