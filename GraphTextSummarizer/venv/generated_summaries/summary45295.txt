Frankel made one of the toughest fields he has ever faced look pedestrian, defeating Fahrr and St Nicholas Abbey by a widening seven lengths to win the Juddmonte International at the racecourse in the north of England and extend his unbeaten record to 13. The view of Frankel receding into the distance is one that the likes of top jockeys Frankie Dettori and Joseph O'Brien are already familiar with. Tactical ploy Rival trainer Aiden O'Brien was determined, as ever, to halt Frankel's seemingly inexorable progress toward perfection, making the task something of a tactical puzzle by his use of pacemakers to assist St Nicholas Abbey. Despite losing a couple of lengths at the start, there were never any signs of panic from his jockey, a virtually motionless Queally. In the summer of 1972, Brigadier Gerard swept aside all comers in the same insouciant manner that Frankel does today.
