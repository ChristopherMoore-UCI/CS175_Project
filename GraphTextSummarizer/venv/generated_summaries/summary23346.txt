And earlier this month, Muslim protesters clashed with police after Friday prayers, leading to one death and extensive property damage. -- Al-Shabaab, a hard-line Somali rebel group that is on the U.S. government's terror watch list, has threatened to attack neighboring Kenya, according to an online audio recording. Muslim human-rights groups in Kenya have called for protests in support of cleric Abdulah Ibrahim el-Faisal, whom Kenya declared an unwanted person and deported earlier this month. Alfred Mutua, Kenya's government spokesman, has since said that el-Faisal has successfully been deported. He was then arrested on return to Kenya, further outraging some Muslim leaders.
