Black students in other Southern towns began to do the same, and lunch counter by lunch counter, drugstore by drugstore, department store by department store, Jim Crow was assaulted by the zealous actions of just a handful of students. Reining in this perk for the banks won't lower the cost of college, but it will make it easier for many students or parents to pay for it. On Thursday, we saw students begin this process by leading rallies in cities nationwide to protest rising tuition costs.
