-- Former world champion racing driver Michael Schumacher, who suffered severe head injuries in a weekend skiing accident in France, remained in stable condition Wednesday, his manager said. Schumacher, the most successful driver in Formula 1 history, suffered severe head trauma after falling while skiing Sunday in Meribel, in the French Alps. Kehm recounted more details Tuesday of how the accident happened, gleaned from Schumacher's son and friends who were skiing with him. In a statement released Tuesday, Schumacher's family expressed thanks for the outpouring of support from people around the world. The party was in an area of deep snow when Schumacher helped a friend who had fallen, she said.
