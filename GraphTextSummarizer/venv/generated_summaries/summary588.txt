-- While the educational prospects for poor children have improved in the 50 years since I was a young boy going to PS 99 in the South Bronx, our country continues to needlessly lose the talents of millions of children because of a failing, entrenched public education system. Taking care of children so they can succeed in school and life should be the floor, not the ceiling, of our expectations. If you really want to be branded as a radical, suggest that we provide better health care and other services for children. I believe that when large numbers of children fail academically, it is the responsibility of the adults around that child. For that reason, we have doomed massive numbers of children -- particularly those with the misfortune to be born poor -- to academic underachievement and having no real shot at the American dream of a comfortable middle-class life.
