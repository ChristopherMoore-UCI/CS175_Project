-- A British fugitive wanted for fleeing his 2009 trial on armed robbery charges was back in custody Sunday after a dramatic raid on a villa in southern Spain, British authorities announced Sunday. His accomplice, Stephen Devalda, was arrested in Spain in 2011 in a joint operation between Spanish and British authorities and has been sentenced to nearly 10 years in prison. Spanish police video of the raid shows Andrew Moran attempting to jump a poolside wall to escape officers during the Friday afternoon raid in Alicante, on the Mediterranean coast. Moran, 31, had been convicted in absentia of conspiracy to commit armed robbery for the 2005 holdup of a Royal Mail vehicle. He lived in Spain under a series of false identities, "frequently changing his appearance," Matt Burton, the organized crime agency's head of investigations, said in a statement announcing his capture.
