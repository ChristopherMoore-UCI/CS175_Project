-- Reality TV star Tila Tequila said she wants to bankrupt organizers of the "Gathering of the Juggalos" festival where an angry crowd attacked her with rocks and bottles last weekend. "I'm hoping this will be the last juggalos gathering that they will ever have," Tequila said Monday in an interview with E-Online. Video obtained by CNN showed Tequila standing her ground on stage for several minutes, continuing to perform her songs while several bodyguards tried to protect her. An angry crowd pelted Tequila with rocks, bottles and human excrement as she performed early Saturday, she said. Festival organizers did not respond to CNN requests for a response.
