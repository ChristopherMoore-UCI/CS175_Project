"This area wasn't hit by the quake, but we are feeling it." La Gonave is one of the poorest regions of Haiti, the most destitute country in the Americas, where the per capita income is less than $400 and 80 percent of people are living under the poverty line. The fishing boat speeds over blue waters of the Caribbean, leaving behind the devastation of mainland Haiti. The earth didn't rumble as hard in la Gonave on January 12, but people are feeling a different sort of aftershock. Neglected by the government for years, the residents of Isle de la Gonave call their island "the forgotten Haiti." Afraid of the sizeable aftershocks that continued to jolt the city, afraid of the death all around him, Anvousse took a boat back to la Gonave.
