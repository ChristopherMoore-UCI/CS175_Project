-- Lewis Hamilton crashed out of qualifying for the German Grand Prix on Saturday as Mercedes teammate Nico Rosberg took pole for Sunday's race at Hockenheim. Elsewhere, McLaren's Kevin Magnussen qualified in fourth with Daniel Ricciardo one place behind with Red Bull teammate Sebastian Vettel down in sixth. The German sealed his fifth pole of the season with a time of one minute 16.540 seconds edging out Williams' drivers Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa who finished second and third respectively. Rosberg currently leads the drivers' championship by four points from Hamilton with Red Bull's Ricciardo 67 points off the pace in third. Hamilton was lying in 16th place when he crashed out but will start Sunday's race in 15th after Sauber's Esteban Gutierrez, who qualified in 14th place, was hit with a penalty.
