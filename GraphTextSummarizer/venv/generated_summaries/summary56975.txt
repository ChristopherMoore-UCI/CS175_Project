Maduro's inauguration comes a day after Venezuela's National Electoral Council said it would complete 100% audit of votes cast in Sunday's election "to preserve a climate of harmony between Venezuelans." Maduro secured 50.8% of votes in the election while opposition candidate Henrique Capriles Radonski won 49%, election officials said earlier this week. Capriles had called for a vote-by-vote recount but said late Thursday that he accepted the decision by election officials to audit the tally. Nicolas Maduro's inauguration ceremony took a dramatic turn at one point as a man in a red jacket rushed toward the podium in Venezuela's National Assembly. Venezuela's state-run AVN news agency said at least eight people have been killed in post-election violence across the country. The government news agency tied the deaths to opposition protests and said the victims were all followers of Maduro.
