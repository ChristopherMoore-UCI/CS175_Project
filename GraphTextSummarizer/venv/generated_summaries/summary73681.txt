Phoenix VA officials denied any knowledge of a secret list, and said they never ordered any staff to hide waiting times. Support for Shinseki holding for now among Senate Democrats Rights group calls VA 'scapegoat' in scandal over wait times, care Shinseki 'mad as hell' about VA allegations, but won't resign CNN's Chelsea J. Carter, Greg Seaby and Greg Botelho contributed to this report. " The secret waiting list in Phoenix was part of an elaborate scheme designed by Veterans Affairs managers there who were trying to hide that 1,400 to 1,600 sick veterans were forced to wait months to see a doctor, according to a recently retired top VA doctor and several high-level sources who spoke exclusively to CNN. But even as the Phoenix VA's problems have riveted the nation's attention, numerous whistle-blowers from other VA hospitals across the country have stepped forward. As a result, the VA's Office of Inspector General has opened an investigation and three members of the Gainesville VA's supervisory staff have been placed on paid leave, pending the outcome of an investigation, VA Sunshine Healthcare Network (VISN 8) spokeswoman Mary Kay Hollingsworth said Monday.
