"Slumdog" is a classic rags-to-riches story about a young boy from the slums, Jamal Malik (played by British actor Dev Patel), who beats millions of other Indians to bag a coveted place on the country's version of TV game show "Who Wants to be a Millionaire?" Through the timely story of the young "slumdog," Boyle illuminates the contradictions of present day India -- the nuclear power that does not provide public sanitation for its population -- and Mumbai was the ideal city in which to do it. He takes the audience from the cheerfully money-grubbing micro-commerce of the slums where young boys charge slum dwellers to use filthy latrines, to Jamal's job as a "chaiwallah" (tea boy) in one of India's much-publicized call centers, and later, to the Indian game show phenomenon, "Kaun Banega Crorepati." Do you think Danny Boyle has captured India in "Slumdog Millionaire"? To achieve this feeling of being right in the middle of everything without disturbing the local communities too much, they used a variety of small digital cameras and digital stills camera. The director, who is renown for films like "Trainspotting" and "28 Days Later," had never even been to India before he and his crew traveled there to make the critically acclaimed Oscar contender "Slumdog Millionaire."
