West's high school and middle school were damaged. By Monday afternoon, a Facebook page "Prayers for West" had been "liked" nearly 80,000 times. In the days after the blast, officials in nearby school districts put their heads together to come up with a plan to help stranded students in West. To help the West students feel more at home, volunteers worked through the weekend to paint some of the classrooms with West's colors -- yellow and scarlet -- and some Connally students wore red to school, said Wesley Holt, a Connally spokesman. Firefighters and trucks from neighboring communities now fill the void at the West firehouse.
