New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio will not march in Monday's parade in Manhattan, and Boston Mayor Martin Walsh sat out Sunday's parade in South Boston. Sam Adams, owned by Boston Beer Co., pulled out as a sponsor for the Boston parade Sunday, and Guinness and Heineken pulled their sponsorships from the New York City parade Monday. The mayors of two major cities have opted out of marching in their cities' St. Patrick's Day parades, in what they call a show of support for gay groups that have historically been excluded from the events. "I'm disappointed that this year, I will be unable to participate in the parade," he said early Sunday. Walsh made his last-minute decision Sunday, the day of the parade.
