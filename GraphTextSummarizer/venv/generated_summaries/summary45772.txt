This is because they are unfortunate enough to follow an era where some of the biggest names in sport repeatedly shattered the illusions of cycling fans by failing doping tests. The world governing body came under intense pressure last year after failing to detect the behavior of American Lance Armstrong, who famously won seven Tour de France races only to reveal that he had been doping throughout in an interview in January 2013. Two months ago, the president of the International Cycling Union (UCI) -- Brian Cookson -- created the Cycling Independent Reform Commission (CIRC) with the intention of investigating both historic doping in cycling and allegations that the UCI had been involved in previous wrongdoing. Last month, he won the Tour of Oman -- which may prove an omen for some since Froome also won it in 2013. "It's a challenge for the new generation of cyclists to be able to show people that the sport really has turned around -- and that doping is not something that's done any more," he told CNN World Sport.
