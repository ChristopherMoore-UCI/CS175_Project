Just four weeks ago, Madeleine was forced to flee her village in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, walking 24 hours to get to Bulengo camp, on the outskirts of Goma town. For the past two months a steady stream of adults and children has been arriving here, trying to escape the vicious fighting between renegade militia groups that seems, once again, to be engulfing parts of eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. "Many of us have never re-found life," says Benjamin Mafuluko Mugaliya, the secretary of Mugunga 2 camp, five minutes drive from Bulengo. "People prowl around the camp at night," she says, sitting on her straw bed in the makeshift camp she is forced to call "home." Refugees have been fleeing fighting between renegade militia groups in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. Another 136,000 have fled to other camps around Goma and into Uganda, and the numbers are continuing to rise.
