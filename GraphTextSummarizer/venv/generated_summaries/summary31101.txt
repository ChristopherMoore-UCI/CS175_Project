The employment agreement said Rizzo could be involuntarily terminated only for a felony conviction or a crime involving moral turpitude, a legal term describing conduct contrary to moral standards. Los Angeles County prosecutors are accusing Rizzo of 55 counts of corruption charges, including that he allegedly gave nearly $1.9 million in unauthorized loans to himself, his assistant, council members and dozens of others, prosecutors said. The six elected officials facing charges are former Mayor Oscar Hernandez and former city council members Teresa Jacobo, George Mirabal, Luis Artiga, George Cole and Victor Bello, prosecutors said. Rizzo said he hasn't been convicted of a felony or a crime of moral turpitude. In the lawsuit filed Monday in Los Angeles County Superior Court, Robert Adrian Rizzo said his employment agreement as city administrator provided for continuous renewals under an "evergreen contract."
