-- Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg plans to spend $50 million of his own money to build a state-by-state grass-roots network focused on stemming the tide of gun violence by expanding the background check system for gun buyers. Of course, gun rights advocates often point out that people don't need guns to kill. Stronger background screenings of potential gun owners would be a good start to curtailing firearm deaths. I do not welcome the fears, but I do appreciate how the shootings have renewed the debate about gun control in Washington. That's just one reason for Congress to pick up the issue of gun control again.
