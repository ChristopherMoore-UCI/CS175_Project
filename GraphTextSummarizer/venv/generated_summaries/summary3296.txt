-- Dubai police have intercepted an illegal shipment of 16,000 pistols from Turkey to Yemen, Dhahi Khalfan Tamim, the Dubai Police commander-in-chief, said Thursday. "The huge amount of brand-faked hand guns along with additional bullet chambers, manufactured in Turkey, were carefully hidden among wrapped boxes carrying furniture in a container which was temporarily stored in one of Dubai's storehouses," a government statement said. Like a number of nations in the Middle East and North Africa, Yemen has experienced growing unrest. The country has been wracked by a Shiite Muslim uprising, a U.S.-aided crackdown on al Qaeda operatives and a looming shortage of water. "We shall not allow any criminal elements to use our territories to carry out any illicit plot that poses threat to peace and security of any country," Tamim said.
