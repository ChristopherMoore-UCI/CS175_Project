-- The number of confirmed cases of the H1N1 virus has jumped nearly 30 percent with 331 people being infected so far, the World Health Organization said Friday. Two more countries, Denmark and China, reported cases of the 2009 H1N1 "swine flu" virus on Friday, but they were still to be confirmed by the WHO. In addition to Mexico and the United States, the following countries have so far confirmed non-lethal cases: Austria: 1  Canada: 34  China: 1 Denmark: 1 Germany: 3 Israel: 2  Netherlands: 1  New Zealand: 3  Spain: 13  Switzerland: 1  United Kingdom: 9 An additional 642 cases are being investigated in the United Kingdom, and Spain has 84 suspected cases. The higher totals do not necessarily mean that incidence of the disease is increasing, but rather that health investigators are going through their backlog of specimens, said Dr. Keiji Fukuda, assistant director-general of WHO. The largest outbreak was in Mexico which had 156 confirmed cases, while there were 141 cases confirmed and one death in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
