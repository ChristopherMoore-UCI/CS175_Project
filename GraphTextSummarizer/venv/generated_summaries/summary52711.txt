Prior to the bladder infection, which Prince Philip contracted in early June, during events marking the queen's diamond jubilee, he spent four nights in a hospital over the Christmas holiday last year for treatment of a blocked coronary artery. -- Britain's Prince Philip, the husband of Queen Elizabeth II, was taken to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary in Scotland Wednesday after the recurrence of a bladder infection, Buckingham Palace said. However, he appeared in good form earlier this week as he fulfilled several engagements on the Isle of Wight, off the south coast of England. The longest-serving consort in British history, Philip married then-Princess Elizabeth in November 1947 in Westminster Abbey. Philip's next scheduled public appearance is alongside the queen as she opens the London 2012 Paralympic Games on August 29.
