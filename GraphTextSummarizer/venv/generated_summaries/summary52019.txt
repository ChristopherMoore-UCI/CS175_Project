-- Roger Federer finally clinched his first Paris Masters crown Sunday after a straight-sets victory over Frenchman Jo-Wilfried Tsonga. The world number four took just one hour and 26 minutes to record a 6-1 7-6 win and collect his 18th Masters Series trophy. It was Federer's 69th career title from 99 finals and he will now take a 12-match winning streak into the season-ending ATP World Tour Finals in London later this month following his victory in his home event in Basel. But Federer snuffed out any hope of a deciding set with an emphatic 7-3 win to move into second place on the all-time Masters Series titles list with 18, one behind Rafael Nadal. he said after becoming the first man to compete in the finals of all nine Masters Series events.
