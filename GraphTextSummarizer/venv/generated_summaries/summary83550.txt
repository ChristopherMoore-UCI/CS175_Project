Lost in all of the hoopla about Republicans needing to adapt to the country's new demographic, is the fact Romney captured the largest percentage of white votes since Ronald Reagan. If Democrats don't figure out a way to make their message attractive to white people, they could possibly lose the Senate. Well for starters, identify candidates to go after Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins' seat, because Obama won Maine. So any plan that does not include significant spending cuts is no plan at all. Granted, Democrats are proposing spending cuts -- but they have to be more bullish about their proposed cuts than they are about taxing the rich.
