Human Rights Watch has urged the court to go beyond the latest wave of violence and look into other possible crimes committed during years of conflict and civil war. -- The International Criminal Court on Monday granted the court's chief prosecutor permission to open an investigation into possible war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Ivory Coast during months of post-election turmoil last year. It said cases of murder, sexual violence and the use of child soldiers have been documented under the control of Gbagbo and the current prime minister, Guillaume Soro. "No one has been credibly prosecuted for the crimes during this period, and a 2004 U.N. Commission of Inquiry report on crimes during the 2002-2003 conflict also has been kept secret," a Human Rights Watch statement said over the summer. But Ivory Coast has accepted the jurisdiction of the court.
