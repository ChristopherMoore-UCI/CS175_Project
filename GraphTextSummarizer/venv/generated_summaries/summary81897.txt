But back to the BYU game, when Notre Dame players continued a post-game home tradition that happens whether they win or lose. It will be televised nationally on ABC, and the ratings will be huge, partly because of the game's magnitude, but mostly because of the staggering number of Notre Dame haters and lovers. Gipp was the Notre Dame running back who played for legendary Notre Dame coach Knute Rockne from 1917 to 1920 before his death from a throat infection. Notre Dame has other splendid players, such as future NFL tight end Tyler Eifert, athletically gifted quarterback Everett Golson and the speedy 6-6 and 303 pounds of Stephon Tuitt at defensive end. After they reached the front of the student section, they joined those who remained from the sellout crowd of more than 80,000 to sing Notre Dame's alma mater called "Notre Dame, Our Mother." Tears were everywhere.
