"Our greatest concern is that North Korea will try to use this existing plutonium to conduct another nuclear test," he said, referring to a 2006 effort by the North Koreans. The talks involved China, Japan, North Korea, Russia, South Korea and the United States. The United States leadership made a mistake by going to the U.N. because the North Koreans said on March 26 that if we went to the U.N., they would resume their nuclear program," he said, referring to North Korea's recent decision to launch a rocket despite international opposition. CNN talked to two top North Korea experts to gain insights into what North Korea may be signaling, what it is realistically capable of accomplishing, and what the developments mean for its relations with the U.S. Selig Harrison, the director of the Asia Program at the Center for International Policy, said the North Korean announcement about restarting its nuclear facilities should come as "no surprise" to the United States.
