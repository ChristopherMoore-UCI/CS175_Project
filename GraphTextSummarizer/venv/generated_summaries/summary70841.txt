Erdogan conceded Saturday that Turkish security forces had used tear gas excessively against demonstrators. International headlines have proclaimed her an "icon" of the movement against the government of Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan. Riot police moved in, lobbing tear gas and using pepper spray. Riot police around Ankara's central Kizilay Square brought in armored vehicles topped with water cannon in a show of force Tuesday evening, but the demonstrations throughout Wednesday were mostly calm. Zeinobia tweeted, "The woman in red in Turkey, I wish to wear such dress in downtown Cairo without fear, without protests, without sexual harassment."
