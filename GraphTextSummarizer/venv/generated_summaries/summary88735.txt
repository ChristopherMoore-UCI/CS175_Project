The student I mentor should receive financial help to attend college, and he will benefit from having a college education because he will earn higher earnings. The protesting students believe these budget-balancing attempts have harmed public education and made it even more difficult for students such as the one I mentor to get an education. Such questions were on the minds of the thousands of students who demonstrated last week against cuts in public education funding in California. If voters continue to resist higher taxes, then students fees and tuition will have to continue to go up. Fifty years ago, when its coffers were flush, California devised a master plan for higher education that made it possible for anyone who wanted a college degree to obtain one, mostly at taxpayer expense.
