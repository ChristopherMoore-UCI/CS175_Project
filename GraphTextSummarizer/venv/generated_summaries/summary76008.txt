Last year, an obviously exhausted Nadal lost in his opening match to compatriot Juan Carlos Ferrero. -- World number one Rafael Nadal continues to prove unbeatable on his favorite clay-court surface, as he won his fifth Barcelona Open title in a row with a straight sets victory over fellow-Spaniard David Ferrer on Sunday. Rafael Nadal lifts the massive Barcelona Open trophy for the fifth year in a row after his win over David Ferrer. The 22-year-old Nadal, who last week secured his fifth Monte Carlo title in succession, repeated that feat on home soil by winning 6-2 7-5 in a repeat of the 2008 final. "I could have never have imagined that I would win here for a fifth time," a beaming Nadal said after the match.
