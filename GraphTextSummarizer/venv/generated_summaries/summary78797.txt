The agency said the bad weather started in the Campidano area, in southwestern Sardinia, then spread across the rest of the island, with the worst affected provinces Olbia and Nuoro. Italy's state news agency ANSA reported that flooding from the storm -- named locally as Cleopatra -- forced many people to flee their homes, with thousands seeking shelter in public facilities such as gymnasiums. " Vargiu said a lot of money would be needed for Sardinia to recover from the storm, with many families and businesses affected. In lots of houses the ground floors are full of water, one or two meters of water, and a lot of families have lost everything -- their house, their car, their clothes, the furniture. Widespread flooding and landslides have blocked roads, and the agency urged motorists to drive only when necessary and to check road conditions before beginning a journey.
