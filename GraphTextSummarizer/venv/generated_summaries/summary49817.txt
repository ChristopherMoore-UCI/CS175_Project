Now, if it all seems a little weird to you -- the fact that there even exists a color of the year -- understand that Pantone, headquartered in Carlstadt, New Jersey, heralds itself as "the global color authority and provider of professional color standards for the design industry." Regardless, Pantone 18-3224, Radiant Orchid, is apparently the big color for next year. After all, this is the one color that will supposedly express "what is taking place in the global zeitgeist" Thus, to finally crown Radiant Orchid, Pantone searched the world over for design and color influences, pulling ideas from entertainment to technology. Purple is going to be big in 2014, at least according to our color overlords at the Pantone corporation who recently announced the upcoming color of the year: Radiant Orchid. Of course, Radiant Orchid marks is a drastic departure from 2013's wild and daring color of the year, Pantone 17-5641 Emerald.
