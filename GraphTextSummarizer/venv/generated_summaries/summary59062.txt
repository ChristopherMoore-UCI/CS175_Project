The terrain for most of the stage was flat and riders of his quality usually have little difficulty in staying with the main bunch, gaining shelter from other riders, but not for Talansky this day. It was to his probable disadvantage that a blazing sun finally shone Wednesday after the cool and wet conditions which have marked earlier stages and seen the departure of race favorites such as defending champion Chris Froome and two-time winner Alberto Contador to crashes. Heavy falls on previous days had rendered the former outsider for yellow jersey honors a relative passenger -- over 14 minutes adrift of race leader Vincenzo Nibali of Italy after the 10th stage ahead of Tuesday's rest day. The official Tour de France website reported he had quit and nobody could have criticized him, but moments later Talansky was back in the saddle, grimacing again and slipping even further off the pace. He came in 32 minutes and five seconds after Gallopin crossed the line and just inside the time limit, with riders having to finish within a certain percentage of the winner under Tour rules.
