The declaration says Supreme Council members "shall decide all matters related to military affairs, including the appointment of its leaders." The results of last weekend's runoff between Ahmed Shafik, the last prime minister to serve under Mubarak, and Mohamed Morsi, the Muslim Brotherhood candidate, remain uncertain. " Earlier Wednesday, the former ruler, ousted Egyptian strongman Hosni Mubarak, was removed from life-support equipment, his health improved a day after a state-run news agency reported that he was "clinically dead," his attorney said. Mubarak ruled Egypt with an iron hand and as a staunch ally of the United States, which gives the nation $1.3 billion a year in military aid. Prior to his sentencing, Mubarak was already suffering from health problems; he attended court on a gurney.
