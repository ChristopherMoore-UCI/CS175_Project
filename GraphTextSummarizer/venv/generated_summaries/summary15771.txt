The study doesn't attempt to explain why injury death is more common in rural areas than large urban ones, but some of the statistics are telling. According to a new study (PDF) published today in the Annals of Emergency Medicine, large cities in the United States are significantly safer than rural areas. The risk of injury death — which counts both violent crime and accidents — is more than 20% higher in the countryside than it is in large urban areas. The risk of firearm-related death showed no difference across the rural-urban spectrum for the population as a whole, but varied when divided up by age — firearm deaths were significantly higher for children and people ages 45 and older, while for people ages 20 to 44, the risk of firearm deaths were much higher in urban areas. But the numbers don't lie — as scary as we may think urban crime is, the threats that are prevalent in rural areas are statistically more dangerous.
