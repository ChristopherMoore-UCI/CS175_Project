"I do think that human rights and the question over Prabowo's record has made impact on voters, particularly on swing voters' or undecided voters' political behavior," said Usman Hamid, a former student activist in 1998 and masters candidate at Australian National University. " "Prabowo might be giving voters what they want to hear: a version of a muscular and assertive Indonesia whose wealth has flowed out of Indonesia and been seized by foreign countries. One survey group, Lingkaran Survei Indonesia, showed 53.3% for Widodo and 46.7% for Prabowo with 99% of its data, and another group, Center for Strategic International Studies reported 52% for Widodo over 48% for Prabowo, with 95% of its data. "Someone who is accused of making human rights abuses and fired from his job as a general, now talking about human rights, is problematic." "I think Prabowo has the character of a firm leader and at this point what Indonesia needs is a leader who is very strong," said Budi Satria, an Indonesian voter.
