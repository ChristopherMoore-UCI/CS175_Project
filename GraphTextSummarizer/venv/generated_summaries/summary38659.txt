The ring awarded to Muhammad Ali when he became boxing's first three-time heavyweight champion has been returned to Ali's former wife six years after she loaned it to a friend who was dying of cancer, her lawyer said. Porsche, who is a clinical psychologist at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, loaned it to Dr. William Young in summer 2004 after she learned he was suffering from cancer. The ring will eventually go to Laila Ali, the 32-year-old daughter of Porsche from her marriage with Ali, she said. When Porsche filed a lawsuit against the widow seeking the ring, Young counter-sued claiming it was given to her husband by Ali as a gift. "It's been a long road," said Veronica Porsche, who was married to Ali for 10 years.
