Annette Morales-Rodriguez, 33, is accused of killing 23-year-old Maritza Ramirez-Cruz and then cutting the baby from her womb last week, according to police and a criminal complaint. CNN affiliate WTMJ said that Ramirez-Cruz was expected to give birth on October 16. Morales-Rodriguez had not met Ramirez-Cruz prior to last week, when she offered the pregnant woman a ride in her car, according to the complaint. She then called 911 and told authorities she had just given birth to a child in the shower. Under the pretext of needing to change her shoes, the defendant drove Ramirez-Cruz to her home, where she hit the victim several times in the head with a baseball bat, the complaint says.
