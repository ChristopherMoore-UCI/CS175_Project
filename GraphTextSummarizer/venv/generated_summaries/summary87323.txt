-- The search for missing workers in a flooded Wales coal mine ended tragically Friday as rescuers discovered the fourth and final man's body The British government will carry out a full investigation into the incident, Welsh Secretary Cheryl Gillan said in a statement released Friday. Authorities identified the men as Phillip Hill, 45, from Neath; and Charles Breslin, 62, David Powell, 50, and Garry Jenkins, 39, all from the Swansea Valley. First Minister Carwyn Jones, who leads the Welsh government, paid tribute to the efforts of rescue workers and families of the miners before the discovery of the fourth was announced. Three other miners escaped Thursday after water rushed into the area where the men were working, apparently after they broke through to a neighboring abandoned mine, Rescue Officer Andrew Watson said.
