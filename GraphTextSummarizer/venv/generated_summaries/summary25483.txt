With America still engaged in combat operations in Afghanistan and some of its military personnel still in Iraq, Creamer is offering support to wives and families of soldiers, veterans and reserves as well as those in active service. During his time in the Navy, Creamer's father was primed for action twice -- in Vietnam and during the first Iraq War -- but never deployed. Paula Creamer has not been found wanting in that department on her journey from military kid to major champion. When Creamer graduated from high school and became a fulltime LPGA member in 2005, her cousin was on a tour of duty in Iraq. Cousin's call-up Creamer was 10 when her father retired, but he continued his role as a commercial pilot for American Airlines.
