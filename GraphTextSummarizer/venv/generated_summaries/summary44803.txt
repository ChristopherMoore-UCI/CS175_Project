'"If survivors' reports are confirmed, this will be the worst shipwreck of migrants in years, not an accidental tragedy, but the apparent deliberate drowning of migrants by criminal gangs who extort money for their desperate journeys," said IOM spokesman Leonard Doyle. "The numbers dying off Europe's coasts are shocking and unacceptable," said IOM director general William Lacy Swing. Two survivors interviewed by the IOM and Italian police in Sicily said the traffickers became enraged after the migrants -- who had already switched to small boats three times during their four days at sea -- refused to move to a smaller vessel. Authorities are also investigating reports that 200 more people are missing off Libya and that another 15 drowned off the coast of Egypt, the IOM said. The Palestinians' account was corroborated by several other survivors who were interviewed on the Greek island of Crete, the IOM said.
