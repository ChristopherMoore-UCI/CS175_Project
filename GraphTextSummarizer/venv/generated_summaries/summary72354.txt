Huerfano County District Judge Claude W. Appel gave Stanley-Dougherty a 32-year prison term, while Lee Grace Dougherty was sentenced to 24 years and Ryan Dougherty to 18. Lee Grace and Ryan Dougherty and half-brother Dylan Stanley-Dougherty were captured after a shootout with police in August and had pleaded guilty to related charges. Ruybalid said surveillance video from the bank in Valdosta showed Lee Grace Dougherty firing a MAC-10 machine pistol, and shell casings from the bank matched a weapon found with the group after their capture. Stanley-Dougherty fired an AK-47 rifle at pursuing officers during the chase, while his sister was shot in the right leg after pulling a gun on Walsenburg Police Chief James Chamberlain. "I pointed the gun at the cop." District Attorney Frank Ruybalid said she was educated enough to know better, and asked Appel to consider their entire cross-country flight from the law.
