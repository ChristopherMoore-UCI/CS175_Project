Parliament Square was relatively quiet late Thursday as mounted police pushed back the last knot of protesters. They argue the increase is not mandatory, that universities would not be bound to charge university students the full £9,000. -- Protesters enraged by a Parliament vote to triple university tuition rate caps, attacked a car carrying Prince Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, Thursday night. One final-year student, standing in front of police lines outside Parliamen on Thursday, told CNN he was there out of solidarity with students who may be priced out of a place at university. The attack followed a vote in the House of Commons to approve a plan to raise the existing cap on tuition rates charged by universities from £3,000 to £9,000.
