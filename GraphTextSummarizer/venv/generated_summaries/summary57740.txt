Despite tensions surrounding revelations of alleged U.S. spying on key EU figures, the talks officially kicked off this week. A survey commissioned by Germany's Bertelsmann Foundation expected U.S. incomes would rise 13.4% per head thanks to the TTIP, whereas those in Europe would only increase 5%. Large firms often talk up the merits of free trade but shy away from the cumbersome aspects that new trading environments often offer. What also remains unclear is the effect increased trade with the U.S. would have on intra-EU commerce upon which many member states are heavily reliant. It will not take kindly to their stranglehold over world trade.
