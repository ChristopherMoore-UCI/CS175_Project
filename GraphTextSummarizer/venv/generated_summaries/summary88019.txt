Van Persie's 29 goals this season have fired United to the English Premier League title, grabbing a hat-trick last Monday as they beat Aston Villa to clinch their 20th top-flight crown. Van Persie got up to coolly convert the penalty and draw United level. "It takes bottle to take a penalty when the crowd are booing," Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson told Sky Sports after the match. He left Arsenal in a $37 million switch to their EPL rivals in close season and the ill-feeling surrounding that move was reflected in the chorus of boos from the home fans every time he touched the ball. Lampard, who is one short of the all-time Chelsea career goal tally by former legend Bobby Tambling, struck home a penalty after Leon Britton had fouled Juan Mata.
