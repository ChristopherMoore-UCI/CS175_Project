-- English Premier League champions Manchester United have signed young Mexico striker Javier Hernandez from Chivas de Guadalajara. As part of the deal Manchester United will travel to Mexico and play a match to open the new 45,000 capacity Chivas Stadium in Guadalajara as part of their preparations for the 2010/11 season. "We are equally excited to play our first game in Mexico, opening the magnificent new Chivas Stadium in July." Hernandez has scored four goals in just four appearances for the Mexico national team and could make their squad for the World Cup finals in South Africa that begin in June. The 21-year-old, who is better known in his homeland as "Chicharito," will join the club for an undisclosed fee on July 1, subject to being granted a UK work permit.
