A judge in Mthatha, South Africa, dismissed an application by Nkosi Zwelivelile Mandela, which means the grandson must return the remains of the three Mandela relatives to their graves in Qunu. Nelson Mandela's grandson lost a court battle Wednesday against other members of his family over where three of the former South African leader's deceased children should be buried. The court battle played out as Nelson Mandela remains in critical condition at a Pretoria hospital. The grandson, also known as Mandla, is accused of exhuming and relocating the bodies in 2011 to Mvezo, Nelson Mandela's birthplace. He has maintained that the papers were not properly served on him and therefore he has as a result been denied the right to respond to the contents of the court application against him."
