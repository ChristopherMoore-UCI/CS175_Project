The U.S. intelligence community said Tuesday that Afghanistan's insurgents remain "resilient" and senior Taliban leaders "enjoy safe haven in Pakistan." And a NATO official noted that the "Taliban-led insurgency in Afghanistan has suffered dramatic losses of leadership and resources," insisting that "Taliban momentum has been significantly reversed. The Taliban are absolutely confident of victory, he said the report found, based on 27,000 interviews with more than 4,000 detainees ranging from senior Taliban commanders to Afghan civilians. Pakistan continues to support the Taliban in Afghanistan, a secret NATO report says, according to a journalist who has read it, despite years of Pakistani denials and American pressure to stop backing the insurgency. Adm. Mike Mullen testified in September that the Taliban and the Haqqani network, another militant group, had safe havens in Pakistan that they used to launch cross-border attacks on U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
