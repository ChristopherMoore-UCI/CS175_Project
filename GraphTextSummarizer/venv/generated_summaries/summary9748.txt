In a news release, Rep. Kendrick B. Meek, D-Florida, says such mistakes undermine the VA's effectiveness. The problem at the Miami VA facility comes on the heels of similar problems with endoscopies at the VA clinic in Murfreesboro. We want them to get tested," said Susan Warren, a spokeswoman for the Miami VA facility. "The VA is a model of the type of health care we provide our veterans, and when mistakes like this occur, it undermines the efficacy of the entire system," said Rep. Kendrick B. Meek, D-Florida, in a news release. " In Miami, the VA has opened "special care clinics" to test veterans who received the notice and to provide information.
