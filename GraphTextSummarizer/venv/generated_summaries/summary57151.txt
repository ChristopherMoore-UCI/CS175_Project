CNN spoke with Dr. Thomas L. Ellis, senior neurosurgeon at Wake Forest University School of Medicine, in North Carolina, United States, about the tumors sometimes known as "the monsters". Thoughts about the origin of these tumors have attracted much debate. Teratomas occur most often in the midline of the brain, therefore often obstructing and putting pressure on critical areas of the brain. Teratomas have been the subject of intense fascination among scientists because of their sometimes strange qualities -- some have been reported to contain hair, teeth, bone and, very rarely, more complex organs such as eyeballs. This can lead to loss of basic functions, but this loss can be temporary -- until the tumor is removed or reduced in size.
