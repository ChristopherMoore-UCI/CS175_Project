The children got sick after visiting the Opelika SportsPlex and Aquatic Center between June 12-18, said Dr. Mary McIntyre, medical officer of the Bureau of Communicable Disease at the Alabama Department of Public Health. The health department warns people not to swim if they have diarrhea; to avoid swallowing pool or lake water; and to shower with soap before swimming so that germs and bacteria do not end up in pool water. "It's not uncommon for recreational water illnesses to occur, particularly in the summer, because a lot of people are in the pools," McIntyre said. "We're recommending any children who did attend the splash park, until we can determine the full extent of the infection, not to swim in inflatable pools," McIntyre said. Illnesses linked to pools are commonly caused by germs spread through contact with contaminated water, the department said in a news release.
