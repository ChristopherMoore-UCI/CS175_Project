"I think the best thing Israel can do is to make sure President Ahmadinejad goes back to Iran safely and he continues to be the president of the Islamic Republic of Iran because he himself is causing more damage to the regime and helping Israel than any other Iranian president could," said Meir Javendanfar, a Middle East analyst. -- Mahmoud  Ahmadinejad is scheduled to visit Lebanon areas bordering  northern Israel  on Thursday as the Iranian president faces threats by a member of Israel's leadership. " The Iranian president is scheduled to visit Hezbollah stronghold villages such as Bint Jbeil and Maroun al-Ras, places that were at the heart of fighting in the 2006 war between  Hezbollah and Israel. The debate has raged in Israel on what to do when Ahmadinejad gets to those areas. But the visit to Beirut and now the scheduled tour of the border area has sent alarm bells for some in Israel.
