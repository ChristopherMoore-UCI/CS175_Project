An ancient Chinese system of summoning good luck, feng shui -- literally wind and water -- is part of the fabric of Hong Kong life. Causeway Bay benefits from what Kuek calls a "feng shui meridian" between four peaks and it's built atop two "dragon pulses" that flow into Hong Kong in the form of mountain ranges. It's hard to believe that Times Square, the crowded, traffic-clogged heart of Hong Kong shopping district Causeway Bay, enjoys some of the city's best feng shui. The run-up up to the Lunar New Year is the busiest time of year for Kerby Kuek, a feng shui practitioner who has published 15 books on the subject. And individuals often consult feng shui masters to decide on the best date to get married, give birth or move house.
