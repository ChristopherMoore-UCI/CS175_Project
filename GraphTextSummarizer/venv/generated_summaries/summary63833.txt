That is just human research: we've got biological research, we've got material research, combustion, particle physics -- the whole gamut of research we're doing every single day. Buskirk Dudley is one of 23 certified PODs who plan every minute detail involving space station research. She explains: "We've got cameras looking at all over the Earth from the space station that are helping with disaster research and coastal erosion. The success of ultrasound experiments by non-medical personnel in space has led scientists to believe that back on Earth, patients could be trained to perform their own ultrasound exams and send the images to doctors in situations where a medical facility is difficult to access. We watched as astronauts played football in space during the World Cup, we listened to Chris Hadfield croon his rendition of David Bowie's "Space Oddity," and we've all seen the odd space selfie snapped in zero gravity.
