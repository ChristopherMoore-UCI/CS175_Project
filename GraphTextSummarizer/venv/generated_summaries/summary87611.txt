Williams traveled to Moscow, where Snowden fled to escape prosecution for leaking classified documents that detailed U.S. surveillance programs. Snowden hasn't been able to leave Russia since U.S. officials charged him with espionage and revoked his passport. Edward Snowden sought to bolster his credentials during an interview with NBC "Nightly News" anchor Brian Williams. The one-hour interview, Snowden's first with a U.S. television network, is scheduled to air at 10 p.m. ET on Wednesday. "I was trained as a spy in sort of the traditional sense of the word -- in that I lived and worked undercover, overseas, pretending to work in a job that I'm not -- and even being assigned a name that was not mine," Snowden said.
