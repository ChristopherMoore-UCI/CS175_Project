A car bomb exploded in Hama Saturday, killing four people and injuring nine others, a source at Hama Police Command told SANA, Syria's national news agency. Al-Assad agreed to get rid of all of Syria's chemical weapons last fall to avoid a possible U.S. military strike against the regime. Syria has destroyed a majority of its chemical weapons material, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons said Saturday. Francois, a reporter, and Elias, a photographer, were on assignment in Syria for French radio station Europe 1 when they disappeared on June 6, 2013. In March, Syria submitted to the OPCW a revised proposal for its chemical weapons disposal with a deadline at the end of April.
