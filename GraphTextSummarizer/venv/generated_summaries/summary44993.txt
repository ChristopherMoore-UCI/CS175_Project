-- The Veterans Affairs health care system needs to be overhauled because of unresponsive leadership and a "corrosive culture" that affects the delivery of medical care, said a report delivered Friday to President Barack Obama. Nabors and acting VA Secretary Sloan Gibson met with Obama to discuss the findings. Dozens of others of VA centers, all around the country, also face a host of allegations like possible abuse of scheduling practices. CNN has reported that in Phoenix, the VA used fraudulent record-keeping -- including an alleged secret list -- that covered up excessive waiting periods for veterans, some of whom died in the process. The VA central office could solve this problem with more transparency and by taking a more hands-on approach with regional leaders, the report said.
