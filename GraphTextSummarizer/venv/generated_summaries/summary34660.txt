International agencies and nations were working to help thousands of people fleeing violence in war-ravaged Georgia, where 275,000 previously displaced people, refugees, stateless people and returnees had been living even before hostilities broke out last week between Georgia and Russia. Georgia proper is a particular problem because some of the people who fled to Gori in Georgia from South Ossetia when the conflict began found themselves in a conflict zone and had to go somewhere else. Many displaced people are headed to Tbilisi, where people are staying with relatives and acquaintances or at facilities available for the displaced. The number of people displaced by the warfare in Georgia is approaching 100,000 and the figure could rise, the U.N. refugee agency said Monday. "The number of people in need of our help is rising by the hour," said Lola Castro, director of the WFP for Georgia.
