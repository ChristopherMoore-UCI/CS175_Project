"Sodium thiopental was only made for medical use and to improve patients' lives," Hospira spokesman Dan Rosenberg said. But due to concerns with Italian authorities on the use of the drug in capital punishment procedures in the United States, Hospira announced in January it would stop producing sodium thiopental completely. The DEA seized "a quantity" of sodium thiopental Tuesday, and is now actively investigating the matter, spokesman Chuvalo Truesdell said. "Therefore, we solicit your assistance in either identifying an appropriate source for sodium thiopental or making supplies held by the federal government available to the states," the letter said. Hospira, the only domestic manufacturer of sodium thiopental, stopped producing the drug in August 2009 because of a shortage of raw materials, a company spokesman said in December.
