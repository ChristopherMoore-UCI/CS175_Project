Abu Khdeir was heading from his home to a mosque in the middle-class neighborhood of Shuafat in East Jerusalem for prayers around 4 a.m. on July 2 when three people forced him into a car and drove off, his father, Hussain Abu Khdeir, told CNN. During one of those clashes on July 3, Abu Khdeir's American cousin, Tariq Abu Khdeir, 15, was beaten by Israeli police. Defendants accused of other crimes against Arabs Two people indicted in Abu Khdeir's death -- the man and one of the minors -- also are accused of trying to commit crimes against Arabs in the East Jerusalem area on July 1, including trying to kidnap a 7-year-old and trying to burn cars, the Jerusalem attorney general's office said. Israeli authorities say the three abducted, beat and burned Mohammed Abu Khdeir, 16, "only because he was an Arab," the Jerusalem district attorney said. Amateur video showed Israeli police officers holding down, punching and kicking Abu Khdeir, a Florida resident who was visiting relatives.
