I, and many others, are optimistic about Libya prospects, but only if Libyans -- and international supporters and donors -- get the key components of the transitions right and do it right away. The various militias that helped bring down Gadhafi now represent competing centers of power and influence. Libya was the Arab Spring's first true revolution, the only one in which the revolutionaries now hold the levers of power. It further breaks down the psychological barrier of fear so many Libyans have continued to feel, left over from decades of dictatorial rule. For Libya's transitional government, the challenges today are just as daunting as they were last week.
