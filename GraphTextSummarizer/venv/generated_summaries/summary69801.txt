On Wednesday, U.S. Magistrate Judge Timothy Rice granted the U.S. government's request for an extradition certification "based on Breyer's role as a Nazi 'Death's Head Guard,' in the murder of 216,000 European Jews at the Auschwitz II-Birkenau death camp" and one other location from 1943 to 1945. "As outlined by Germany, a death camp guard such as Breyer could not have served at Auschwitz during the peak of the Nazi reign of terror in 1944 without knowing that hundreds of thousands of human beings were being brutally slaughtered in gas chambers and then burned on site," Judge Rice said in court documents released Wednesday. The U.S. case against Breyer dates to the 1990s, when federal authorities sought to strip him of his U.S. citizenship, arguing that Nazis were not eligible. Breyer maintained his citizenship, however, after he was able to establish that his mother was born in Pennsylvania and returned to Germany before World War I. After World War II, Breyer migrated to the United States in 1952 and claimed citizenship as a displaced person. He was facing 158 counts of contributing to murder, one charge for each trainload of European Jews who were forcibly deported to Auschwitz, in southern Poland, between May and October 1944, according to court documents.
