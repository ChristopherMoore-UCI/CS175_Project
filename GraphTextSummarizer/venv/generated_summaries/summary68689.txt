They were the latest in a string of attacks that are stoking fears of renewed warfare as U.S. troops prepare to withdraw from Iraqi cities. U.S. troops are slated to pull out of Iraqi cities at the end of June as part of an agreement that will see all American troops leave the country by the end of 2011. The latest attacks follow an April uptick in violence that made it the deadliest month this year for Iraqi civilians and American troops. Maj. Gen. Qassim Atta, the Iraqi military's spokesman in Baghdad, said the government remains determined to take over security for the cities when the Americans withdraw. But he said he would not paint a "rosy picture" of the situation Iraqi security forces face.
