Students en route to Yangon, Myanmar, to protest an education bill were met with violence from police Tuesday, according to multiple media reports and international watch groups. "They had decided they would drive into the city, meet with other students there for 15 minutes of talks and then disperse," Zarni said. Zarni said the students had been "given the red light" on proceeding to Yangon. "We all watched while a young man was beaten extremely hard and repeatedly by about three or four policemen in heavy riot gear," U Zarni, a spokesman for the Cooperative Committee for Trade Unions, told CNN. Students are seeking changes to an education bill that they say limits academic freedom and have been in negotiations with authorities, but these have been curbed because of the crackdown.
