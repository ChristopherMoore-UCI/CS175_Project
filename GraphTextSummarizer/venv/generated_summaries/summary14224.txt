NCAA reopens paper class investigation at UNC Whistle-blower in UNC paper class case files lawsuit UNC: The so called "paper classes" scandal involves hundreds of classes that never met and required little work, and even though many athletes were enrolled in them, UNC and the NCAA have been criticized for saying the issue had nothing to do with athletics. Wainstein said last week that his team has so far collected 1.5 million e-mails and documents, talked to 30 people in the athletic-academic areas of UNC and is looking at athlete transcripts going back to the 1980s. Nyang'oro's cooperation also led to the NCAA announcing it would reopen its investigation into academic fraud at UNC. Wainstein was hired this year by UNC to do another internal investigation, since past investigations pinning the sole blame on Nyang'oro have not satisfied questions and curiosity from the community and from critics of UNC who think the scope of the fake classes was much bigger than UNC admits.
