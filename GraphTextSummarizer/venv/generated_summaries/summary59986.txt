Brad Pitt talks about "soul mate" Angelina Jolie, life, and fatherhood in Parade magazine. The actor and star of the new film "Inglourious Basterds" opened up to Parade magazine about his thoughts on love, marriage and fatherhood. These days, Pitt said he's happy with his decision to become a parent with partner Angelina Jolie. "I liked to smoke a bit of grass at the time, and I became very sheltered," Pitt told Parade. Pitt told Parade he takes exception to anyone trying to dictate how someone should live and who they should love.
