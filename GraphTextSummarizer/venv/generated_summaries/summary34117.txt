Talking to CNN on Thursday evening, Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby noted Hagel's previous admission "that we probably could have done a better job keeping Congress informed. Captured in Afghanistan early in the summer of 2009, Bergdahl was freed almost five years later in exchange for five men who were being held at the U.S. military prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Bergdahl finishes with Army investigator Sen. Saxby Chambliss made no mention of Bergdahl -- including how he went missing, his time in captivity or his future -- in a statement Thursday on the GAO's findings. Susan Poling, general counsel for the U.S. Government Accountability Office, wrote in a letter to nine Republican senators that the Pentagon should have notified "the relevant congressional committees at least 30 days in advance of the transfer." Moreover, Poling noted that the GAO also concluded the Defense Department broke the law by using "appropriated funds to carry out the transfer when no money was available for that purpose." Poling noted that her office wasn't weighing in on Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel's decision to carry out the prisoner swap, but rather his "responsibility to comply with a notification condition on the availability of appropriations to transfer individuals from Guantanamo Bay." Following his release in late May, the Idaho native underwent medical care and mental counseling at an Army hospital in San Antonio before taking a desk job at Fort Sam Houston, according to military officials.
