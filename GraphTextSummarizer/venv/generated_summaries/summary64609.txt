But here's how the networks stacked up during premiere week (and for those who missed it, here's the role DVR played): Adults 18-49 NBC...2.9...+12% Fox...2.6... % NBC...8.2 million...+9% Fox... 6.9 million... -- For the first time in nine years, NBC has outright won the first week of the broadcast season among adults 18-49. Both networks are claiming victory, which is normal (though most in the industry believe the network that wins the adult demo has earned the greater glory since advertisers pay more to target younger adults). So far it's true, mainly due to the strength of adding "The Voice" to its fall lineup, as well as the strong performance of new drama "Revolution."
