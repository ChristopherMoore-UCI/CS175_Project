-- Prosecutors detailed acts of police brutality in their presentations Wednesday at the trial of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on charges he ordered protesters killed during the country's uprising last year. "The defendants before you in the cage are the actual instigators and are the ones who gave police officers the order to shoot," prosecutor Mustapha Suleiman said, according to his spokesman, Adel Saeed. Abu Bakr said that opening arguments Tuesday lasted an hour, during which prosecutor Mustapha Suleiman described Mubarak as "a tyrant who aimed to hand the rule to his younger son, Gamal, who promoted corruption in Egypt, allowing his friends and relatives to destroy the country without accountability." Abu Bakr said he expects a verdict before January 25, the date last year that the uprising began. Images of protesters included one of a man on the floor "with his brain spilled on the ground," Abu Bakr said. One video played for the court "shows a policeman loading a machine gun and firing directly at protesters, proving the use of live ammo," said Khaled Abu Bakr, a civil rights lawyer involved in the trial.
