In the South Sulawesi capital of Makassar, where protests are typically more violent, hundreds of demonstrators called for the resignation of Indonesian Vice President and former Central Bank Governor Boediono and Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs Sri Mulyani. "We know that corruption is the source of stupidity, poverty and social imbalance," protester Fadjroel Rachman said. -- Thousands of protesters gathered in several cities in Indonesia on Wednesday to push the government to deal with rampant allegations of corruption. The controversy began when critics accused President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and some of his political allies of benefiting from the bailout money. In a televised speech, he said, "I will lead the jihad against corruption," and called on everyone to join the rallies in an orderly and peaceful manner.
