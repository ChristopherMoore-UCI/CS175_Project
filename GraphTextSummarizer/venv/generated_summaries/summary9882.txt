Former F1 driver Michael Schumacher is no longer in a coma and has been transferred from a hospital in Grenoble, France, where he had been admitted after a skiing accident last year, his management said in a statement Monday. Schumacher ended up 9 meters (30 feet) from the edge of the piste, prosecutor Patrick Quincy said. As in previous statements, Schumacher's agent asked the media to respect the privacy of the F1 legend's family. In early January, a French prosecutor investigating the accident said that speed was not a reason for Schumacher's fall. "Michael has left ... to continue his long phase of rehabilitation," according to his manager Sabine Kehm.
