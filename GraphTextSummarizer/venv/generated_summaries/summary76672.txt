In the past, teams have either held their own special launches at their factories, or revealed their cars at one of the pre-season tests. Mercedes-Benz GP chief executive Nick Fry outlined the initiative at the Motor Sport Business Forum in Monaco. In a further effort to cut costs, the move will see all 13 teams on show in a special event in Valencia at the end of January. "I don't want to go into too much detail about what the plans actually are, but we have agreed between all the teams to do a joint launch and we do wish to turn it into a proper event," Fry told reporters. It is understood the new teams -- Virgin Racing, US F1, Lotus and Campos -- may struggle to have their cars ready by then, but they would certainly be present at the event.
