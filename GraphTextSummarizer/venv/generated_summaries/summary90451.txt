Ramesh Mahawar, the head of Mahawar Pharmaceuticals, and his son Sumeet are also accused of forgery, Sonmoni Borah, commissioner of Bilaspur district in India's Chhattisgarh state, told CNN on Friday. An Indian drug company executive allegedly tampered with and destroyed evidence after a dozen women died following sterilization surgeries, an official said Friday. The two men's arrests follow a police raid Thursday evening on a Mahawar Pharmaceuticals facility in Raipur, capital of Chhattisgarh state. Mahawar Pharmaceuticals produced the antibiotic, Ciprofloxacin, that the women took after Saturday's surgeries, Borah said. But authorities -- who are waiting on lab results to specify the women's cause of death -- could decide to bring more charges against them later.
