That run saw him beat Ferrer in the final of the Rome Masters, and he again denied the 29-year-old a 1,000-point haul in Monte Carlo on Sunday as he avenged his defeat at the Australian Open quarterfinals in January. He has won 30 of those on clay, putting him equal third in the post-1968 Open Era list alongside compatriot Manuel Orantes and Bjorn Borg. The 24-year-old extended his record of most successive titles in an ATP Tour event with his seventh success in Monte Carlo, boosting his leading tally of Masters Series crowns to 19. He won against serve in the third game of the second set before Ferrer fought back to lead 5-4, but Nadal broke him again to go 6-5 up and sealed victory when his opponent netted on the second match-point. may have dimmed slightly with two recent final defeats, but the Spaniard showed again on Sunday that he is the man to beat on clay.
