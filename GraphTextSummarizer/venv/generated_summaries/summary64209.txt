In the request the government argued, "The evacuation of the buildings could carry social, political and operational ramifications for construction in Beit El and other settlements." An official in Israel's Justice Ministry who was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter said the case of Beit El differed from other illegal settler outposts because it was home to dozens of families that would lose their homes if the demolition went ahead. The right-wing government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu asked the court for a three-month delay in carrying out the demolitions so a government committee can reassess the current policy of demolishing settler homes built on private Palestinian land. Many of the homes built by Jewish settlers in a neighborhood of the Beit El outpost are located on private Palestinian land. The Israeli government asked the country's high court Friday for a delay in the scheduled demolition of an unauthorized West Bank settlement outpost. " "They said clearly that they have reached a decision not to evacuate illegal construction on private Palestinian property," Sfard said.
