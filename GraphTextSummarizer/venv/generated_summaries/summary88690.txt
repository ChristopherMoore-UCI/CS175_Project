Studies show 23% of partners of people diagnosed with STDs are ever warned they might also be at risk. It's the kind of awkward moment a lot of men might prefer to forget, but for Bastani it was the impetus for starting his company, Qpid.me, a free website that lets users text and share their verified sexually transmitted disease results with potential partners. The U.S.-based service lets users notify former partners about chlamydia, gonorrhea and trichomoniasis. The app screens for STDs that result in physical symptoms such as syphilis, herpes and genital warts. Another STD tech tool helps people have difficult conversations with past lovers.
