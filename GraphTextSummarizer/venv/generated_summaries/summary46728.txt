Wesley Sneijder and Dirk Kuyt were the Oranje's outfield players from their starting 11 not to be booked by referee Howard Webb, while Johnny Heitinga saw red in extra-time for a second bookable offence as Spain won 1-0 at Soccer City on Sunday. Referee Webb also comes under criticism for failing to act tougher as he handed out a string of yellow cards without using the ultimate sanction until Heitinga was sent off deep into extra-time. The robust approach of the Netherlands side in the World Cup final has drawn a fierce rebuke from Dutch legend Johan Cruyff, who accused them of "dirty" play and adopting "anti-football" tactics. Manchester City midfielder De Jong, in particular, has come under criticism for his "kung-fu" style challenge which left Xabi Alonso nursing bruised ribs. Cruyff, who coached Barcelona after his playing days were over, believes Nigel de Jong and Mark van Bommel were very fortunate to avoid red cards for challenges in the first half.
