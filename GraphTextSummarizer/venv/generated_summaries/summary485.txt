-- Rep. Bill Cassidy, the Republican congressman running for the U.S. Senate in Louisiana, is taking heat from the left and the right after he said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid "runs the Senate like a plantation." " "I wish there was as much offense taken by Harry Reid running the Senate dictatorially, not allowing any votes which he does not personally approve of and the result of which he does not endorse," Cassidy said in a statement to the Washington Post. Cassidy, Maness and Landrieu will face off for the Louisiana Senate seat Nov. 4 in an open primary election. "Congressman Cassidy may not realize this but the language he used included a term that is incredibly offensive to many Americans and he should immediately apologize," Maness said in a statement. " But Cassidy's tea party-backed challenger Maness is still calling for an apology. Senate Democrats' campaign arm immediately tried to capitalize, firing off several emails to supporters about Cassidy's comments.
