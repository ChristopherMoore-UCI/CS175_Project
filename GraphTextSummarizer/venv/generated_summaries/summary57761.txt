The wreckage of this year's battles is strewn around Stepanovka and many other villages in eastern Ukraine. On July 28, amid battles between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian separatists for the area, a sniper from the Ukrainian National Guard shot dead Poznychenko's 36-year-old son as he tried to move his car to safety. The ceasefire agreed at the beginning of September only slowed the tempo of the fighting in eastern Ukraine, and sometimes barely that. At the same time, people grumble about the inability of the DPR to help them, and lament its lack of basic organization. The National Guard is widely hated; people accuse the army of random shelling.
