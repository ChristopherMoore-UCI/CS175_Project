Redditor Shystone has laid old paintings over Google Street View photographs to create a series of perspective-bending composite images of old and new London. We've seen projects similar to this before, but it works particularly well in a city like London, where history is built into infrastructure and architecture. It really is incredible how well paintings from artists like Canaletto and Balthazar Nebot reflect current-day London. What Google's army of photo collectors captured at Westminster Abbey on any given day in the 21st century will look different than what Italian painter Canaletto saw back in the 1700s. Look closely at Canaletto's 1749 painting of Westminster Abbey, and you'll see what looks like a painted tree in the upper lefthand side.
