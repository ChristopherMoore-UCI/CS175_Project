"I just got to thinking, we don't have a picture with Lane in it," the new mom told CNN affilaite KOCO. "July 13th 2014 was the absolute worst day of my life," Sharry posted on Facebook. Back in July, Sierra Sharry and Lane Smith were just about to become parents. "They asked me if I would be willing to 'play around' with capturing their first family photo by editing Taos' daddy in one of their pictures," Kayli Rene' Photography posted on Facebook. "Lane's not physically here with us, of course, but that picture represents to us that he is always watching over us and he will always be there for us no matter what," Sharry said.
