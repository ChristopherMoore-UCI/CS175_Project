Voters will be looking for the candidates to deliver answers on the pressing issues facing the nation, and Republican viewers will be watching for a candidate to take on President Obama in 2012. The former Utah governor sees the lack of enthusiasm with the current field as an opening, as long as GOP primary voters don't punish him for serving as Obama's ambassador to China. Here are five things to look for Monday night that will help shape the race for the Republican presidential nomination: Pawlenty vs. Romney: For months, we in the media have speculated that Tim Pawlenty is setting himself up to be the alternative to front-runner Mitt Romney, a fellow former governor. Expect Gingrich to follow Ronald Reagan's 11th commandment, which dictated "thou shalt not speak ill of any fellow Republican," and instead focus his criticism squarely on Obama. Pawlenty showed the sharpness of his political knife Sunday, when he accused Romney of devising the framework for Obama's health care law.
