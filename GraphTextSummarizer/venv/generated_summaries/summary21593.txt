The aftermath of 'Twirlgate' rumbled on at the Australian Open on Friday, with Canadian star Eugenie Bouchard saying she was fine with being asked to twirl -- if men were asked to "flex their muscles and stuff. And in a tweet posted Thursday, King wrote: "The Australian Open interviewer asking the women to 'twirl' on court is out of line. As it turns out, Bouchard's request for greater equality had already been granted before she pirouetted on court. Amid the controversy Bouchard retained her trademark cool after ousting Caroline Garcia Friday. Nadal's interview hasn't attracted much attention, but Billie Jean King, the 12-time grand slam winner and longtime advocate for equality, took note of the question to Bouchard -- and was less than amused.
