Arizona is among 10 states to pass laws with 20-week abortion bans, according to court records. Those groups said in their successful emergency appeal the ban would force doctors to wait until a woman with a high-risk pregnancy was close to death or would suffer major medical damage before terminating a high-risk pregnancy. Arizona HB 2036 places restrictions on and would criminalize most abortions performed after 20 weeks of pregnancy. The Arizona ban would also apply to women who have been informed the fetus would not survive after birth. "We are relieved that the court blocked this dangerous ban and that women in Arizona will continue to be able to get safe, appropriate medical care," said Alexa Kolbi-Molinas with the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project.
