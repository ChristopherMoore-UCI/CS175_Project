Crew members aboard a Delta Air Lines flight October 3 became suspicious of their child passenger and then found that he had no ticket or boarding pass. The Transportation Security Administration has said the boy went through security at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, although it has not explained how he did so without a boarding pass. The 9-year-old boy who sneaked onto a plane for a trip to Las Vegas is back in his hometown of Minneapolis, a family spokesman said Saturday night. Father: 'No one stepped up to help' 'He's got a behavioral problem,' dad says CNN's Janet DiGiacomo contributed to this report. Spokesman V. J. Smith would not provide details.
