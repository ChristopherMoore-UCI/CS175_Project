The arrests come amid a global effort to uncover corruption in the sport, which European police officials believe has reached some of the world's most high-profile games including World Cup qualifiers and UEFA Champions League matches. Singaporean authorities said some of the people they detained this week, including the suspected leader, are "the subject of ongoing investigations in other jurisdictions for match fixing activities. European police officials in February described their investigation as "the biggest-ever investigation into suspected match-fixing in Europe." A total of 380 games in Europe -- including World Cup and European Championship qualifiers -- were deemed suspicious, with 425 match and club officials and criminals involved from 15 different countries. Singapore police said earlier this year that Tan, considered to be a key suspect in the global match-fixing scheme, was helping them with their investigations.
