African immigrants brought boxing to Lyari in the 1940s, when Karachi was still part of British-ruled India. Round two is too close to call but Bilal wins the third and final round with lightning quick combinations and powerful right hooks. Bilal is obsessed with winning because, to him, boxing is more than a sport. For decades boxing has given thousands of Lyari's kids what the government has not -- a safe place to grow, learn and chase a dream. They're polite, healthy children who laugh and play, children who finish school.
