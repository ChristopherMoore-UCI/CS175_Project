Earls told CNN he was watching the third drag race of the event when one of the drivers started heading for a mud pit in front of the seating area. A Linn County Sheriff's sergeant told CNN affiliate KVAL three people in the crowd were hurt. He said, 'Oh my God, I can't believe what happened.'" KVAL reported the driver told authorities the rear wheels on his 1970 Ford spun out in the mud, and he crashed into a barricade. " Earls' video becomes jumbled as he runs to safety, but the screams of frightened spectators can be heard in the background. "The truck got a little wild and he hit the mud pit," Earls said.
