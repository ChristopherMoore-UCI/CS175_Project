The miners have been stuck since Thursday in the wildcat Cabeza de Negro mine in southern Peru. We're taking into account all the necessary security measures to avoid risks among the rescuers themselves," said Cesar Chonate, a regional head of Peru's civil defense agency, the state-run Andina news agency reported. Video from state-run TV Peru showed workers, wearing hard hats and headlamps, loading rocks into a pushcart by hand. -- Peru's president arrived Tuesday night at a mine in southern Peru, where he was expected to lead an operation to reach nine trapped miners. Mining is big business in Peru, which is a major world producer of copper, silver, gold and other minerals.
