"Given these stakes, it's regrettable that the President does not want to work with Congress to bolster his negotiating hand with additional sanctions, which would go into effect should Iran fail to meet its commitments." Rep. Adam Schiff, D-California, called the interim agreement a "meaningful step forward" and said new sanctions would be counterproductive. One of Iran's deputy foreign minister, Majid Ravanchi, told CNN Sunday that the enactment of additional sanctions from the U.S. Senate would "ruin the entire agreement." "As of that day, for the first time in almost a decade, Iran's nuclear program will not be able to advance, and parts of it will be rolled back, while we start negotiating a comprehensive agreement to address the international community's concerns about Iran's program," U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said in a statement Sunday. Senior Obama administration officials echoed that sentiment Sunday, but also said if Iran doesn't make good on its promises, the United States could decide to step up sanctions. "Imposing additional sanctions now will only risk derailing our efforts to resolve this issue peacefully, and I will veto any legislation enacting new sanctions during the negotiation," Obama said in a written statement.
