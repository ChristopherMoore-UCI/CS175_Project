Gray wrote Rafferty's obituary Wednesday in The Guardian newspaper. -- Singer Gerry Rafferty, famous for the 1970s hits "Baker Street" and "Stuck in the Middle With You," has died, his agent said Wednesday. The saxophone-fueled "Baker Street" drove sales of the album, which sold 5 million copies and made Rafferty an overnight millionaire, Gray wrote. Rafferty later joined another band, the Humblebums, with comedian Billy Connolly, Gray said. That same year, Rafferty started work at a butcher's shop and the tax office, playing music on the weekends with a school friend in a band called the Mavericks, Gray said.
