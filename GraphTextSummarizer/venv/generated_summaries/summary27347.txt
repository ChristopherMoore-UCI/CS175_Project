Authorities in Mexico City were surveying buildings, schools and hospitals to evaluate damage, Mayor Marcelo Ebrard said. The relatively low population near the epicenter of Tuesday's quake and improved building codes in the Mexico City area also may have been a factor, he said. At least 11 people were injured and hundreds of houses were damaged in the 7.4-magnitude quake, which struck midday Tuesday in southern Mexico near Ometepec, Guerrero. Nine of the 11 injuries occurred in Oaxaca state, which borders Guerrero and also suffered damage from the quake, said Mexican Interior Minister Alejandro Poire. -- Mexican officials were assessing damage Wednesday, a day after a strong earthquake left homes in ruins and rattled residents hundreds of miles away from the epicenter.
