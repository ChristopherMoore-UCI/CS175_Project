As the bitter winter cold retains its hold on the restive city, activists and residents say starvation and the lack of basic medical care claim lives regularly as Syrian troops and some opposition forces prevent the delivery of aid, according to a report from Human Rights Watch last month. -- As nearly 600 days under siege sap the life and dignity out of the Old District in the Syrian city of Homs -- leaving malnourished men with legs like noodles and soot-stained children to dig through homes turned into rubble for bits of firewood -- diplomats in a picturesque Swiss city bicker over aid. " "The regime is blocking all convoys of aid to Homs, and has been doing so for months. " "The world must help us; they can't watch us drown in a sea of suffering, pain and death and do nothing after more than one and a half years of being under siege" the Rev. Frans, a Dutch Jesuit and longtime Syrian resident, said in broken Arabic on social media. Over the course of several months, Syrian forces, backed by Hezbollah militants, moved in on the so-called capital of the revolution.
