Santa races are becoming as much of a tradition as candy canes and Christmas lights. Santa's weight is a longstanding tradition, said Tom Kliner, founder of Santas Across the Globe and the Fraternity of International Real Bearded Santas. During his elimination interview, he donned a Santa hat and told viewers his toned physique wouldn't stop him from bringing Christmas joy to children. If Santa isn't diabetic, Christmas magic really does exist. If you want Santa to be skinny, Cox said, make it happen: Tell your kids Santa is tired of eating cookies, and leave an apple out instead. "Having your own take on Santa might be the ultimate personalized Christmas."
