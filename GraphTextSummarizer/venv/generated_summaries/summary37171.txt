" After their painful defeat in Chicago the U.S. turned to one of the game's greatest ever players, Tom Watson, who was the last man to captain a winning United States team on European soil back in 1993.

McGinley was trumpeted for the role by McIlroy several times on Monday, and also by English duo Poulter -- one of Europe's heroes who inspired their dramatic comeback in Chicago last year -- and former world No.1 Luke Donald. Rory McIlroy as well as Europe's Ryder Cup talisman Ian Poulter, and on Tuesday night it was made official -- Paul McGinley will captain the continent against the United States in 2014.
