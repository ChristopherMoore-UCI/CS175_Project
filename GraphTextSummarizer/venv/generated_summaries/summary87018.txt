Nine cars of the Bengaluru-Ernakulam Express train derailed some 50 kilometers from Bangalore in Karnataka state at around 7.30 am local time, said Chandrashekhar Gupta, a spokesman for India's southwestern railway. Authorities say they are using new technology and training their workforce to try to improve safety standards. At least 11 passengers were killed when a train jumped the rails in southern India on Friday, authorities said. India's vast railway network runs 7,000 trains serving 13 million passengers every day, according to officials. Rescue crews have retrieved 11 bodies from the wrecked compartments, Gupta told CNN.
