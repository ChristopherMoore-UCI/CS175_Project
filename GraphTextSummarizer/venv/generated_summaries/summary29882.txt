England, and free Europe, were under terrible peril at the hands of Germany's Third Reich. Seventy years ago -- in the last week of June in 1942 -- an American from Midwestern farm country arrived in besieged London. Then, having been promoted to supreme commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force, Eisenhower would direct the largest combined sea, air and land military undertaking in the history of the world: Operation Overlord, the D-Day invasion of Nazi-occupied Europe. And so, on that day in late June, Dwight D. Eisenhower of Abilene, Kansas arrived in London with the new title of commanding general of the European Theater of Operations. And in this London summer -- a summer in a great city, free and proud -- perhaps there will be a few people who will pause if only for a moment to recall what once transpired, and who will close their eyes and offer the silent thought: May God bless the memory of Dwight David Eisenhower.
