-- Formula One teams will face a different challenge at this weekend's European Grand Prix as a new tire compound will be used in a race for the first time. The Italian firm's motorsport director Paul Hembery said the decision was a result of the track surface on the street circuit and also the likelihood of warm weather. Reigning world champion Sebastian Vettel leads the drivers' standing for Red Bull, 60 points ahead of McLaren's Jenson Button in second place.

"Tire wear on this circuit is likely to be quite high because of the track layout, the nature of the surface, and also the weather conditions," Hembery told Formula One's official web site.
