Mariano Francisco Herran Salvatti, who also was the attorney general in Chiapas for more than six years, is charged with embezzlement, criminal association and other acts of corruption, Chiapas Attorney General Raciel Lopez Salazar said. In that post, he was involved in the prosecution of more than 60 members of the Juarez drug cartel and the investigation that led to the 2001 arrest of former Quintana Roo Gov. Mario Villanueva Madrid for his connections to drug traffickers. "In Chiapas, the validity of the law also means that the culture of privilege has passed and justice is applied equally to all," Lopez said on the Chiapas government Web page. As drug czar in 1999, Herran and his wife escaped an assassination attempt when gunmen on motorcycles fired on his car in Mexico City. Herran's predecessor as drug czar, Jose de Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo, was fired in 1997 after an investigation revealed he had received payments from the Juarez drug cartel.
