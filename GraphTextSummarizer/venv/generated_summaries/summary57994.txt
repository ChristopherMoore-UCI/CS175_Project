The discounter put out a news release announcing "Groupon Celebrates Presidents Day by Honoring Alexander Hamilton," and offering $10 off of all local deals above $40. "The $10 bill, as everyone knows, features President Alexander Hamilton -- undeniably one of our greatest presidents and most widely recognized for establishing the country's financial system," the Business Wire release read. In case Groupon decides to give a $100 discount next year, Benjamin Franklin -- the face on the C-note -- was never a U.S. president either. Contrary to what the online coupon company claims, Alexander Hamilton was never a U.S. president. Hamilton, whose portrait does grace the $10 bill, was the first treasury secretary and is credited with laying the foundation of the U.S. financial system.
