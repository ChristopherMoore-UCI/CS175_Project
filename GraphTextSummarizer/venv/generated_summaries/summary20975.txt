-- World champion Thor Hushovd continued his superb Tour de France by powering to victory in Friday's 152.5km 13th stage of the race from Pau to Lourdes. Defending champion Alberto Contador, who lost a few seconds on the leaders on Thursday, remains seventh -- exactly four minutes behind Voeckler -- while the only change in the top 10 saw Belgian Philippe Gilbert, who led the race after the first stage, move up to ninth overall after attacking the peloton on the descent to the line to gain 50 seconds. And Hushovd used all his strength to catch the unfortunate Roy with just 2km remaining to win by 10 seconds, with David Moncoutie also catching and passing exhausted compatriot Roy, who was 26 seconds back in third place. However, unlike Thursday uphill finish, Friday's major climb came 42km from the end of the stage, with a long downhill descent before a flat finish into Lourdes. There was no change in the overall classification, with Frenchman Thomas Voeckler remaining 1:49 ahead of  Frank Schleck, with Cadel Evans 2:06 down in third position.
