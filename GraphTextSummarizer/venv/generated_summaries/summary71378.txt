"In recent days rumors have surfaced about the placement of bombs, new kidnappings, assaults, coup d'etats," Lugo said at a news conference Tuesday. In his capacity as commander-in-chief, Lugo named replacements for the heads of the army, air force and navy, according to a statement from the armed forces. -- Paraguayan President Fernando Lugo on Wednesday ordered the replacement of top military commanders, a day after publicly dismissing rumors circulating the capital about a military coup. Lugo, who was elected to a five-year term last year, is a former Catholic bishop. One day earlier, Lugo had addressed -- and dismissed -- reports of a possible coup.
