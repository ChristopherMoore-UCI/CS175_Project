Firearms are not allowed on campus, per school policy, according to Tozer. Officials called off a lockdown, which had been in effect as SWAT teams and other law enforcement authorities converged on the campus, after the suspect was detained about 12:45 p.m., said the university's media relations director, Tom Tozer. Tozer said he cannot confirm whether those involved were students. "We are advising people to proceed with caution with normal activities today," Tozer said. Meanwhile, police began hunting for the shooter on 25,000-student university's campus, in the central Tennessee city of Murfreesboro.
