Phil Rudd, the drummer for legendary hard rock band AC/DC, has pleaded guilty to charges of threatening to kill and possession of drugs in a New Zealand court. The 60-year-old Australian was arrested in November last year after police found methamphetamine and cannabis while executing a search warrant at his home in New Zealand. According to a court summary, Rudd fired several employees because the release of his solo album in August had flopped in the charts. " Rudd made several calls to his personal assistant over the following days, but he terminated the calls after realizing it was Rudd on the phone. In November, the court dropped the police charge of "attempting to procure murder" after prosecutors decided there wasn't enough evidence.
