-- Having to skip cancer therapy twice in the last two months due to a lack of drugs normally available through Greece's national health system, 45-year-old Morfo Karadona says a new fear has entered her life. The president of Greece's Association of Pharmaceutical Companies, Konstantinos Frouzis, who is also the vice president of Novartis Greece, warns that "companies are heading towards a dead end. "We are withholding medicines until they meet their obligations." Greece has among the cheapest medicines in the European Union and has just announced further price drops. Greece is a poorer country, and medicines there have always cost less so wholesalers have always sold them for more outside the country. In the center of Athens, in one of a handful of state pharmacies, people are looking for prescription drugs that hospitals no longer have in stock.
