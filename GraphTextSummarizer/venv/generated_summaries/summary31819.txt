He said that despite reports of Jamail and Raghdalin fighters being Gadhafi loyalists, "It is not 100% confirmed there are former regime elements in the towns." A Facebook page used by Gadhafi loyalists called "We Are All Moammar Gadhafi" is reporting shelling by "NATO rats" on Jamail and Raghdalin. But Sufyan said the people of Zuwara are "more than friends" with other Arab cities, like neighboring Zawiya, and blamed the tensions on discrimination by the people of Jamail and Raghdalin. The latest hostilities started when Zuwara fighters were among a group of more than 60 who were driving back home recently from the Tunisian border where they were posted, Sufyan said. They were intercepted by a large number of armed men, whom Sufyan described as Gadhafi loyalists.
