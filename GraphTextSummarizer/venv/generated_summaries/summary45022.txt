Flurries and light snow fell in Boston on Saturday night, and heavy snow was expected Sunday night through Monday. Upstate New York could see 9 to 18 inches of snow through Monday night, the National Weather Service said. Wind gusts could be up to 35 mph, bringing poor visibility and possible whiteout conditions, said CNN meteorologist Michael Guy. "I'm tired of it," said Boston University freshman Cameron Barkan, who has missed three days of class because of the storms. The murder trial of former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez was postponed until Tuesday, while jury selection in the trial of Boston bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was also delayed.
