The gunmen barged in during a lunchtime editorial meeting, separating men and women and calling out the names of employees they intended to kill, said Dr. Gerald Kierzek, a physician who treated wounded patients and spoke with survivors. The attack Wednesday on the Charlie Hebdo offices in Paris touched off three days of terror in France as authorities staged an intensive hunt for the suspects. Thursday morning As that search was ongoing, people dressed similarly to those in the Charlie Hebdo attack -- all in black and wearing bulletproof vests -- shot a female police officer in the Paris suburb of Montrouge. The gunmen said they were avenging the Prophet Mohammed and shouted "Allahu akbar," which translates to "God is great," Paris Prosecutor Francois Molins said. Social media responded to the terrorist attack with "Je suis Charlie," or "I am Charlie."
