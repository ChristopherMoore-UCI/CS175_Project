Pope Benedict XVI is distraught by news of a scandal involving allegations of sexual abuse in the Catholic Church in Germany, Germany's highest-ranking Catholic said Friday. " Zollitsch's meeting with the pope unfolded against the backdrop of a growing scandal involving sex-abuse allegations in Catholic Church institutions in Germany. Nearly every day since the end of January, people have come forward to report cases of sexual abuse by Catholic priests in the nation. After their meeting, Zollitsch said that the pope encouraged Catholic leaders in Germany to continue investigating the allegations. "Sexual abuse weighs extremely heavily in the context of the church because children and youth put so much trust in priests," he has said.
