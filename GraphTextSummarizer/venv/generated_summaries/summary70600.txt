So far those who are under investigation currently, either by the military prosecutor or by the civilian prosecutor, are all from the former officials of the government of Laurent Gbagbo, said Suleiman Baldo, a member of a U.N. investigation team on Ivory Coast post-electoral violence. But Human Rights Watch pointed out earlier Wednesday in a statement by senior West Africa researcher Corinne Dufk that "no one from Ouattara's camp had yet been arrested for abuses committed during the post-electoral conflict." President  Alassane Ouattara has recurrently promised no mercy for human rights abusers no matter which side of the conflict there are from. The Ivorian government announced the creation Thursday of a national investigation commission on the crimes perpetrated during the post-election crisis amid mounting pressure fom human rights organizations and the United Nations. Incumbent leader Laurent Gbagbo defied international calls to step down after he lost the election to Ouattara.
