" Bass, who now hosts SiriusXM's "Dirty Pop With Lance Bass," revealed on his show Monday that Collins reached out to him for guidance through a mutual friend, actress JoAnna Garcia. Just as Collins was so busy with basketball that he didn't ruminate on his personal life until the 2011 NBA lockout, Bass said he was too stretched performing with 'N Sync to focus on his personal life. -- As the NBA's Jason Collins made history by coming out as gay, he sought advice from someone who'd walked this road before: Lance Bass. By putting Collins in touch with people such as GLAAD's Wilson Cruz, Bass is aiming to help the athlete "get some really good information before he does these sit-downs, just so he doesn't put his foot in his mouth ... because this will live (on) for the rest of his life, and he wants to make sure it's good. The media crush that comes with such an announcement isn't the only part of Collins' story to which Bass relates.
