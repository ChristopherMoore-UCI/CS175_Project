Five percent of college women experience rape or attempted rape every year on campus. I also sat through sexual assault board hearings where clear cut cases of rape occurred and supported survivors when they found out that the perpetrator was found "not responsible." Recent interviews with university administrators show that they are highly reluctant to expel a student who commits rape (watch this eye-opening video). Furthermore, we need universities to have adjudication processes that are accessible to and trusted by students. During my tenure there, rape survivors would commonly tell me that they had wanted to file charges against their attacker but were told by administrators that their cases were more fit for mediation.
