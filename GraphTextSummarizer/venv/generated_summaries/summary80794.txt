At least 70 tents had been burned down by security forces since late Sunday night, according to witnesses. The most recent protests broke out Sunday when thousands of protesters took to the streets and were met with gunfire from security forces. Abdu Ganadi, a government spokesman, said security forces were rescuing colleagues who had been captured and beaten by protesters. -- Sanaa residents reported hearing heavy explosions and sporadic gunfire for several hours early Tuesday, one day after security forces set fire to tents and tore through demonstrators' camps in Freedom Square in Taiz with bulldozers, an activist and eyewitnesses said. Meanwhile, government forces launched airstrikes against Islamic militants in the coastal city of Zinjibar, where fierce fighting raged Sunday.
