" It highlights the Heydar Aliyev Center in Baku, Azerbaijan, as an example of an "extraordinary" concert structure: "The white building's curved, wave-like shape makes it seem as if it has been 'poured' into the landscape." Berlin's Philharmonie building, completed in 1963, also makes the list, as do the Cidade das Artes in Rio de Janeiro and Singapore's Esplanade Concert Hall. The United States and Spain both get two entries -- Los Angeles' Walt Disney Concert Hall "has the appearance of curved metal plates piled into one other and which ... make the design look like an outlandish fantasy," the report said. "These days concert halls also have remarkable architecture, offering audiences a great show even before they have taken their seats," the report said. That's how we should appreciate some of the world's concert halls, according to building data company Emporis. One surprising omission from the list of 15 is Sydney's famous Opera House.
