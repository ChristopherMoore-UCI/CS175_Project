-- Luiz Felipe Scolari is "obliged" to win the 2014 World Cup following his appointment as coach of the Brazil national football team for a second time on Thursday. Scolari led "La Selecao" to a record fifth World Cup triumph in Japan and South Korea 10 years ago and the former Portugal coach will be expected to win the trophy once again when Brazil hosts the tournament in two years time. Scolari, who had an eight-month spell in charge of English Premier League team Chelsea, is not the only World Cup winner returning to the fold. Scolari will be under pressure to deliver in 2014, with fans eager to avoid a repeat of the 1950 World Cup when Brazil lost out to Uruguay in the final match of the tournament. " Scolari's first spell as Brazil coach began in 2001.
