A North Carolina woman was cleaning out her garage and found an old Nintendo and a handful of games, including Stadium Events. Ultimate 11 was the final game in the Super Sidekicks series, a popular franchise of soccer games that sold very well. The mystery, as well as the fact there are only 12 known copies, make it a must-have for serious Atari collectors. Like the World Championships, players had six minutes to play for high scores on demo versions of Super Mario Bros. 3, PinBot, and Dr. Mario. The best players were then sent Atlantis II, a special edition of the game that featured faster enemy ships worth fewer points, making it harder to get a high score, but easier to determine the true champions.
