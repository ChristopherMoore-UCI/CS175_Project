David said his brother-in-law, who emigrated to the United States about four years ago with his wife and two daughters, has been abducted by ISIS in Syria along with several other members of the family he had hoped to bring to the United States to get them out of harm's way. He was too sick to leave his home when everyone began fleeing as ISIS fighters stormed the villages in northeast Syria about 30 miles from the Turkish border. ISIS has attacked numerous minority groups during a bloody campaign to create a vast caliphate across Syria and Iraq under its extreme version of Sharia law. David said his brother-in-law decided to return to Syria two years ago to be with them as they went through the process of applying for visas to the United States. They were taken hostage early Tuesday morning from Hassakeh in northeastern Syria.
