Nisman had alleged that President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner shielded Iranian officials accused of masterminding the bombing of a Jewish community center in 1994 that left 85 people dead. The prosecutor who replaced Nisman formally accused the President of a cover-up last week. Among those attending Wednesday's demonstration was Sandra Arroyo Salgado, Nisman's ex-wife, a judge who has maintained that he never would have ended his own life. But government officials say the accusations are politically motivated and that Nisman was killed in an effort to destabilize democracy in their country. The march was organized by six prosecutors to honor the memory of Alberto Nisman, a special prosecutor whose mysterious death a month ago has shaken the South American nation.
