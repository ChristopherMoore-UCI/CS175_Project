-- Cristiano Ronaldo scored twice as champions Real Madrid secured their first win of the La Liga season with a 3-0 defeat of Granada in the Santiago Bernabeu Sunday. In other matches Sunday, Rayo Vallecano drew 0-0 with Sevilla and Athletic Bilbao saw off Valladolid 2-0. They had to survive some nervous moments in the last few minutes as home goalkeeper Victor Valdes was called into action. A blistering shot from Adriano put Barca ahead after 23 minutes of the first half, but they were unable to press home their advantage, with Cesc Fabregas wasting a great chance after being put through. The Portuguese star was making it 150 goals in just 149 games for the Madrid giants, but he limped off in the second half after a hefty challenge which saw Borja Gomez sent off for a second yellow card.
