Goals from veteran players Didier Drogba, John Terry and Frank Lampard -- whose futures had seemed under threat during the short reign of the Portuguese coach -- helped send the tie to extra time. Chelsea held out comfortably in the second half of extra time to seal a famous comeback and give interim manager Roberto Di Matteo his third straight win since taking over from Villas-Boas. Napoli, who continued to be a threat, responded almost immediately with a goal to go ahead again on aggregate as Gokhan Inler swept home from the edge of the area. The Serbian defender's 105th-minute strike gave the English Premier League side a 4-1 second leg win over Napoli and passage to the last eight 5-4 on aggregate. Two minutes into the second half and they were two up and level on aggregate as captain Terry found space to head home Lampard's corner.
