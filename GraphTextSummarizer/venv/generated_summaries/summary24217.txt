Three consecutive days of rain, the heaviest in 57 years, caused the flooding, reported the state-run newspaper Daily News, citing the regional commissioner. Philippe Poinsot, director of the United Nations Development Programme in Tanzania, told U.N. Radio that the rains combined with high tide led to disaster in the densely populated coastal city. -- Heavy rains and flooding have killed at least 23 people in Tanzania and displaced more than 4,000 others, state-run media reported. President Jakaya Kikwete visited a camp for flood victims Thursday in Dar es Salaam. Shops were shuttered and residents scrambled to find higher ground.
