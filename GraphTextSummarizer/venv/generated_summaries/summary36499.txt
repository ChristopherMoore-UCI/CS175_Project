-- South Korea's Inbee Park says she will consider it a grand slam if she wins next month's British Open. "Yes, of course, I think so," Sunday's U.S. Women's Open winner told CNN World Sport when asked if success at the British Open would constitute a grand slam. When Zaharias achieved her milestone only three majors were on the schedule, while Mickey Wright (1961) and Pat Bradley (1986) are the only other players in LPGA history to win three majors in a season -- but the latter two women failed to achieve consecutive wins. South Koreans have won seven of the last nine major LPGA titles and Park is hopeful she can continue that remarkable run at St Andrews in August. By winning at the Sebonack course in Southampton by four strokes, the World No. 1 put herself in contention to become the first golfer -- male or female -- to win four major championships in a season.
