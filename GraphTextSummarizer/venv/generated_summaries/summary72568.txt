New York Times investigative journalist Raymond Bonner wrote that Elmore's case "raises nearly all the issues that shape debate about capital punishment: race, mental retardation, a jailhouse informant, DNA testing, bad defense lawyers, prosecutorial misconduct and a strong claim of innocence." During the appeal process, Elmore sat on death row for years, wondering when his time would run out. One of the most amazing death row stories we talked about during Wednesday's hangout surrounded a South Carolina man named Edward Lee Elmore. When he was 23, Elmore -- a mentally disabled African-American handyman -- was arrested in the 1982 rape and murder of an elderly white widow in Greenwood, South Carolina. Elmore's lawyers said it looked like evidence was planted that made Elmore look guilty.
