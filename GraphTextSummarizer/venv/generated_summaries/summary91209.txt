Awash in armed groups Residents and officials have blamed the violence that has gripped Benghazi on militant groups, including Ansar al Sharia. A retired military general led Libyan troops and other forces loyal to him in a deadly attack Friday against Islamist militants in and around Benghazi, Libyan media reported. The statement warned that any military aircraft flying over Benghazi will be targeted by army units, security forces and revolutionary forces under its command. International carriers including Tunisair, Royal Jordanian and EgyptAir canceled their flights to Benghazi on Saturday after authorities announced closing the airport on Friday night. Official Libyan security forces have struggled to deal with hostile militias, so the government has relied on other militias, many on the state's payroll, in an attempt to enhance security.
