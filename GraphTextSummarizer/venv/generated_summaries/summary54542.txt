-- A court in eastern China on Friday upheld the guilty verdict and life sentence against former high-flying politician Bo Xilai, effectively ending one of the messiest political scandals to hit the ruling Chinese Communist Party in decades. 'Hotel-line' prison awaits Court documents said Bo would be incarcerated in Qincheng Prison, a maximum-security prison in Beijing where former senior officials usually serve their sentences. The high court rejected Bo's appeal as it lacked any "factual or legal basis," court vice president Hou Jianjun told reporters in a press briefing, adding the court's decision is final. China's leaders are keen to put the case behind them ahead of an important Party meeting in November -- the third plenum of the Party's Central Committee -- when President Xi Jinping is expected to push for economic reforms. Wang Juntao, a political exile and former class mate of Bo, says the case has only raised his profile: "The Communist Party may have ended his career in the party, but it has given him a distinct political identity and charisma as a leftist.
