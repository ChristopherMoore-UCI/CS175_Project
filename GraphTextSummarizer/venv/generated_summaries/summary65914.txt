-- At least 19 schoolgirls died when fire erupted in their dormitory west of the capital, Kampala, late Monday, say police and school officials. School officials insisted that the doors weren't locked, while girls who lived there said they were. Mpigi is about 60 kilometers west of Kampala. Police said they were investigating the cause, but children who lived in the dorm said they heard an explosion shortly before the fire broke out. Authorities also found the bodies of two adults in the ashes of the blaze at Buddo Junior School in Mpigi.
