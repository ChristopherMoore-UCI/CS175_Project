Now authorities have been forced to erect signs around Doolin Harbor, County Clare, after a woman was hospitalized last Sunday by the feisty bottlenose dolphin -- the fourth such incident since May. Dusty has a checkered history in the area. " Clare County Council has now commissioned the IWDG to produce advisory posters warning people not to approach Dusty. Village suggest this could be because Dusty moved to Doolin Harbour -- which is much more heavily populated with swimmers than her previous hunting ground -- back in 2011. It has also asked lifeguards to put out red warning flags whenever Dusty is spotted in the area. In the latest incident, the Irish Whale and Dolphin Group reports that Dusty rammed a woman in the abdomen resulting in her hospitalization.
