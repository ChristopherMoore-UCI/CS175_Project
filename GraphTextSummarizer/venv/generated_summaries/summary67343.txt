-- While most photos are digital these days, there was a time when sepia-toned hard copies of pictures were regarded as precious relics -- and families would be thrilled to get their hands on any from times past. Seppo discovered his name was La Verne Swenson (which was also written on one of the bags the photos were in), but that there was no link between him and the nursing home. While Seppo has many more photos to go through, he said he feels happy that he has finally met with some success. He also managed to track down the Hunter family in Cloquet, Minnesota, and give Mickey Hunter photos of his great-great-grandfather he had never seen before. I also used stamps to discern time taken and where they were developed," Seppo said.
