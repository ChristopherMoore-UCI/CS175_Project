Welshman Bale, who wasted opportunities in the first half, finally found the target in the 55th minute at Carrow Road as Togo striker Emmanuel Adebayor set him up to fire past home goalkeeper John Ruddy. The comfortable victory lifted Tottenham four points clear of fourth-placed Chelsea in the standings and within seven of Manchester City and Manchester United at the top. It left Arsene Wenger's men in fifth place, 12 points behind Manchester City and Manchester United and five adrift of Spurs. Harry Redknapp's men also have a game in hand over all their nearest rivals and while qualification for next season's Champions League remains a more realistic expectation, the manner of their win in East Anglia would have again raised even greater hopes among their supporters. The home side have surprised a number of teams on their return to the top-flight but had few sights of goal on their home ground and did not win a corner until deep into the second half.
