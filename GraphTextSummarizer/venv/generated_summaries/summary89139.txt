The old advertising section that has been reinstated still says the company can place ads on the service and that "the manner, mode and extent of such advertising and promotions are subject to change without specific notice to you," leaving the company with some wiggle room for future changes. On Monday, the Facebook-owned app updated its terms of service to say companies could pay Instagram to use members' images in ads without compensating the photographers. -- After days of intense backlash from users over changes to its terms of service and privacy policy, photo-sharing service Instagram has backtracked. On Thursday, Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom said the company was switching one section of its updated terms of service back to its original text. Instagram claimed the update was to allow the company to experiment with possible future advertising options, and was not part of any current plan to sell images.
