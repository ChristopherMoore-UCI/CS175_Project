During a sedate hour of oral arguments, the justices stayed away from the specific claims of emotional harm made by Cooper, focusing instead on what the law says about qualifying for damages. To say that you get emotional distress for that as opposed to what I would call genuine privacy incursions, which state law covers, is a different question. The bench expressed confusion over which similar but competing terms used in other laws dealing with damages -- "general," as opposed to "special," "proven" as opposed to "presumed" -- may apply in the Privacy Act's unique use of "actual damages." "The argument you have made -- and I certainly understand it, that this is the Privacy Act and so it's precisely these types of damages that you would be concerned about -- really cuts both ways," said Chief Justice John Roberts to Cooper's lawyer. "Simply because a plaintiff may have suffered an adverse effect" from the privacy violation, said Feigin, "doesn't mean that the plaintiff suffered actual damages."
