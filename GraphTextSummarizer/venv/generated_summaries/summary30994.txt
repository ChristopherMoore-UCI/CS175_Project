-- Less than two weeks after suffering his third major heart attack, Gallagher told CNN he's suspending his comedy club career to improve his health and give him more time to work on new challenges.

"It's a plumbing problem, and once the plumber opens up the pipe you feel fine," he said in a CNN interview Saturday. Gallagher was awake and resting comfortably Sunday night at a hospital in Sedona, Arizona, Scherrer said.
