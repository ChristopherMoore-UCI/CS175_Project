The low approval ratings for Zelaya point to his thin election victory in 2005, according to Latinobarometro. Outside of Honduras, 24 percent of respondents in the other Latin American countries approved of the coup, the Latinobarometro survey found. Almost half of Hondurans polled -- 48 percent -- said they disapproved of the job President Jose Manuel Zelaya was doing before he was ousted in a coup on June 28, said the 2009 Latinobarometro survey. According to Latinobarometro, 58 percent of Hondurans disapproved of the coup, while another 28 percent said they approved of Zelaya's ouster. The annual Latinobarometro survey, named after the Chile-based non-profit company of the same name, is among the most highly regarded polls in the region.
