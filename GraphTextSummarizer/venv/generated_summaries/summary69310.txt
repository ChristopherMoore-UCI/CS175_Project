The civilians in the case include a former lawmaker from the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party, Nasiruddin Ahmed Pintu, and an Awami League leader, Torab Ali. "We had long been waiting for the verdict and it has cleansed the image of the force stained by the massacre," said Maj. Gen. Aziz Ahmed, who now leads the border guards. The dead also included the then-chief of the border guards, Maj. Gen. Shakil Ahmed, and his wife. Seventy-four people, including 57 army officers, were killed in the mutiny at the headquarters of Bangladesh's border guards in Dhaka in February 2009. Several thousand armed soldiers of the Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) unit took control of their own headquarters in the capital for two days and massacred scores of people, including officers of the Bangladesh Army who were stationed with the BDR.
