Baltimore County Police Chief Jim Johnson told reporters that SWAT team officers closed in on the suspect as he was "watching different channels" in a station editing room -- "watching you report this story as this incident unfolded." Aware that the suspect was watching on TV, Baltimore County Executive Kevin Kamenetz said, authorities decided against releasing any information publicly until after the incident. The unidentified 29-year-old man, described as mentally ill, was taken into custody without incident after his actions forced the lockdown and evacuation of WMAR and a nearby parochial school in Towson, near Baltimore, police said. -- A man who smashed a truck through the lobby of a Maryland TV news station and proclaimed himself God Tuesday was arrested hours later -- watching the ordeal unfold on the local news, authorities said. The official Twitter account of Baltimore County Public Safety said the first call from WMAR was received at 11:45 a.m. "We could view him watching TV," the chief said.
