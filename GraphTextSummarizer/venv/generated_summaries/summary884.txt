"There have been media reports for more than a year about a donation from Mr. Duvalier for Haiti earthquake relief, but the American Red Cross has no record of ever receiving any donation from him," said Laura Howe, spokeswoman for the Red Cross. His attorney in Haiti, Reynold Georges, told CNN that Duvalier had already transferred money to the agency. He said the three American lawyers were not involved in Duvalier's legal problems in Haiti. -- An American attorney representing Jean-Claude "Baby Doc" Duvalier said Saturday that the former dictator returned to Haiti in hopes of recovering millions frozen in Swiss bank accounts and channeling them through a U.S. intermediary to help rebuild his troubled homeland. But many people believe Duvalier's actions were motivated not by power but money.
