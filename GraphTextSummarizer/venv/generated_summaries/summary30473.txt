The National Thoroughbred Racing Association -- which describes itself as a broad-based coalition of horse racing interests -- notes there aren't yet uniform rules in the sport to regulate the administering of medication, or enforcement of existing rules and laboratory testing, though there is a movement to make such blanket rules. Animal welfare activists: Horse racing industry needs reform Reserving comment Clark Brewster, the attorney representing Asmussen and Blasi, said PETA's effort "has little to do with true accusation of wrongdoing and everything to do with condemning the horse racing industry as a whole. Horses in Asmussen's care received a thyroid drug to "speed up metabolism," muscle relaxants, sedatives and the diuretic Lasix to prevent lung bleeds during overexertion, the group alleges. The group said it has filed 10 complaints against Asmussen and others working with him in Kentucky and New York. "We pledge to continue to work in partnership with the Gaming Commission and all industry stakeholders to promote the safety, integrity and transparency of our racing." Churchill Downs issued a statement expressing concerns about the health of horses.
