Two other people have died in random shootings in Seattle in the past month, according to CNN affiliates. A second shooting, about a half-hour later near downtown Seattle, left a woman dead, authorities said. A female caller told dispatchers she saw a gunman assaulting a woman in a parking lot in downtown Seattle, then shooting her, stealing her black Mercedes and running her over as he sped away. In an interview with police, Adams said he had glanced at his phone when he heard gunshots, then sprung into action as he saw people scrambling around him. "If violence is a disease, our city is infected," said Paul Patu, of the city's Youth Violence Prevention Council, according to CNN affiliate KCPQ.
