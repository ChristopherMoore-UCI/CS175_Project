I am sorry that an attempt to acknowledge the spiritual significance to many of Sheikh Fadlallah and the views that he held in the latter part of his life, has served only to further entrench divisions in this complex part of the world." Earlier this week, CNN's senior Middle East editor, Octavia Nasr, left the network after a controversial posting on Twitter about Fadlallah. In later years, Sheikh Fadlallah mellowed in some of his views, and spoke out in favor of interfaith dialogue. "We believe that her credibility in her position as senior editor for Middle Eastern affairs has been compromised going forward," she said, and as a result CNN had "decided she will be leaving the company." The comments about Fadlallah, once closely associated with Hezbollah, ruffled diplomatic feathers. Fadlallah died Sunday and thousands of mourners filled the streets of Beirut, Lebanon, to pay tribute.
