Now, truth to tell, it's far more common in the UK for writers to shift audiences, adults to children or vice versa. In the U.S., adults who begin writing for children and then turn to writing for adults -- successfully -- are few and far between. Such a conversion to being a writer for adults after a novitiate as a writer for children is more common in England. Writing for children -- succeeding at writing for children -- is much harder than writing for adults, and an excellent internship besides. By and large, the British don't sentimentalize childhood the way Americans tend to -- at least, not since the Blitz brought an end to Peter Pan and Mary Poppins and other British nationals who no longer could fly over central London with impunity and song.
