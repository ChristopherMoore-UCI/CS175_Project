Last year, a Taliban commander in northwest Pakistan announced a ban on polio vaccines for children in the region as long as the United States continues its campaign of drone strikes. -- Seven teachers were kidnapped Thursday from Pakistan's volatile tribal Khyber Agency for having supported a polio vaccination campaign "They were not the polio workers, but they had been picked up by the unknown kidnappers for allowing polio vaccination in their school, Hira Public School," said Nasir Khan, the assistant political agent of Bara Teshil of Khyber Agency. At least 16 cases of polio have been reported this year in Khyber Agency; law and order problems in Bara have left it particularly vulnerable to the disease, which has been declared eradicated from adjacent India. The numbers fell from 198 in 2011 to 58 in 2012 but that progress has stopped: Pakistan is the only one of the three countries where polio is endemic to see its numbers go up this year, WHO's Aylward said.
