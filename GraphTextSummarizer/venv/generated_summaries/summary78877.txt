With reports of other incidents of teenage violence n schools, including the assault of teachers and rape of younger students, many South Koreans are asking, "what is wrong with our kids?" The answer, according to some analysts, lies within the hyper-competitive nature of South Korean society. -- It took two teenage suicide cases due to school bullying last year in South Korea for people to notice something was very wrong. The same group said last year that the number of counseling cases of students seeking help from suicidal feelings doubled from the previous year. He is now involved in creating a music video with other teenagers to raise awareness of school bullying, an issue he says that was not taken seriously until recently. "At school, students don't see their peers as friends but as competition and believe that they need to beat others," said Dr. Bae Joo-mi, a specialist at the Korea Youth Counseling Institute.
