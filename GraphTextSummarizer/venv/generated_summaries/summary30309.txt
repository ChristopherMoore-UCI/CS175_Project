Read about Congo's 'heartbreaking decade' Dr. Denis Mukwegi, the founder of the unit treating victims of sexual unit at Panzi Hospital in Bukavu, said there are many more women in hard to reach areas who are going without treatment and help. Read how women are raped as a weapon of war When the United Nations released a report stating it believed that over the last year 15,000 women had been raped in the eastern region of Congo, the consensus in Bukavu, the capital of South Kivu, was that there were many thousands more. Panzi has set up mobile clinics to try to get to these women in remote communities but as long as the violence continues to block roads and isolate communities, there will be many more women here, just out of reach and beyond protection. Trauma centers have been set up in both North and South Kivu by local communities and there are also local organizations working to reunite and rehabilitate abandoned children and child soldiers. Panzi receives outside funding from non-governmental organizations and the United Nations Children's Fund but it is fundamentally a Congolese run initiative and that's another thing about Congo that you are unprepared for; in the midst of the most extreme horror and cruelty Congolese are trying to help themselves and each other.
