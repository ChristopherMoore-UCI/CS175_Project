Australian police shoot dead teen 'terror suspect' Home-grown terrorism fears Authorities believe around 60 Australians are fighting in the conflict in Syria and Iraq, with around 100 more working in support roles within Australia. His arrest, in a joint operation by the Australian Federal Police and Melbourne Joint Counter Terrorism Team, came after searches at seven addresses in Melbourne suburbs. -- Australian police arrested a 23-year-old man in Melbourne on Tuesday on suspicion of funding a U.S. citizen who went to fight in Syria. Last week, the government introduced a new bill in parliament to imprison Australians found to be fighting abroad, or supporting terrorist actions. Officials have in the past expressed fears about "home-grown terrorism," the likelihood that Australians recruited to fight foreign wars could bring their training and philosophies home to carry out local attacks.
