The ailing Mubarak is on trial on charges of corruption and ordering the deaths of hundreds of protesters during the clashes last year that led to his downfall. " Khalil said she was planning to spend the night in Tahrir Square with her friends, hoping to put pressure on military junta to reaffirm their transfer of power on time, end military tribunals of civilians, increase wages and reimburse families of the of those killed during Egypt's upheaval. "This time last year, every person in Egypt was enslaved to Mubarak's regime, and those who dared speak or write about his tyranny paid a high price," said Yasmeen Khalil, a teacher. Egypt's revolution last year came on the heels of Tunisia's revolt that led to the ouster of that country's leader in January 2011. But the country's influential military, which stepped into the vacuum as Mubarak teetered last year, retains much of the decision-making power.
