Comedian Chris Rock delivered on his reputation for controversy as host of "Saturday Night Live" this weekend, but musical guest Prince is the one soaking up accolades for making history. The medley showcased songs from Prince's studio albums with band 3rdeyegirl and featured guest vocalist Lianne La Havas in what Rolling Stone called "one of the most explosive and most polished 'SNL' musical spots" in recent memory. Other memorable moments, for better or worse, included a mock diversity training video, "Women in the Workplace," featuring Rock as a "diverse person," and a sketch in which ISIS militants compete on on the ABC reality TV show, "Shark Tank." He poked fun at the Freedom Tower ("the 'Never Going in There' Tower") as a terrorism target, and said it was only a matter of time before September 11 becomes an excuse to offer $9.11 shrimp specials at Red Lobster. Instead, Rock dove right into the Boston Marathon bombing, the September 11 attacks, the commercialization of Christmas and gun control in his opening monologue.
