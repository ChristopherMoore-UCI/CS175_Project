Special agents from Immigration and Custom Enforcement's homeland security investigations unit conducted raids at 13 Danny's Family Car Wash locations in central Arizona, plus three locations tied to its outsourced staffing service provider, HR Betty, said ICE spokesman Andrew Munoz. -- A chain of Phoenix-area car washes that's raised thousands for local charities, including numerous law enforcement agencies, found itself the target of a sweeping raid Saturday by law officers. The 25-year-old business also has a "Cop Coffee" program, in which law enforcement officers pay 25Â¢ for any coffee or fountain drink inside a Danny's convenience store. Its website, as well as local news reports, tout that Danny's car wash locations have been sites of numerous fund-raisers.
