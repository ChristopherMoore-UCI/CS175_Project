Here, Anderson Cooper goes to the Congo where he covered the killings of endangered mountain gorillas. Mountain gorillas have been used to seeing scientists for decades,  but these are wild animals, and you have to be respectful. I've been visiting mountain gorillas since I was 17 -- I've probably been about six or seven times -- but each visit is extraordinary. There are about 700 mountain gorillas left in the world, according to Flora and Fauna International, an organization that acts to conserve threatened species and ecosystems, and they live in a lush forest that straddles Rwanda, Uganda, and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Ten mountain gorillas reportedly have been killed in the Democratic Republic of Congo in the last year.
