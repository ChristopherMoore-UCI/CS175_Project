Mitt Romney told Latino business leaders this week in Los Angeles that he is convinced the "Republican Party is the rightful home of Hispanic Americans," but added that "my speech today isn't about my political party." Weak standing among Hispanic voters To CNN contributor Ana Navarro, a Latina Republican, such equivocation contributes to Romney's weak standing among Hispanic American voters. Immigration advisers Another issue of concern to Latino voters involves Romney's advisers on immigration, Martinez said, noting concerns about the role that Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach could play in a Romney administration. In another past comment that could draw fire this week, Romney acknowledged at a private fundraiser in May the difficulty Republicans have in winning support from Hispanic American voters. Now, his opposition to Obama's move this summer to halt deportations of some children of illegal immigrants puts Romney at odds with a majority of Latino voters, especially younger ones in the fastest-growing demographic of the U.S. population.
