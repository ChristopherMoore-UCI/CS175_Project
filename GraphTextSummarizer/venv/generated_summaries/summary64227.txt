You can grow the bricks in almost any shape" Benjamin says the bio-bricks could be made to last as long as traditional materials, but believes architecture must embrace temporary structures. "In biology, complex structures achieve resource efficiency by putting things in exactly the right place, which is very difficult with made materials", says Pawlyn. Functional fungus New York firm Ecovative are producing materials that combine agricultural waste products such as corn stock with mushroom mycelium -- the roots of the vegetable. Mycelium effectively dies once its growth is complete, but Harrington is looking ahead to material that does not. Drawing on the natural accumulation of coral reefs, his team would install a steel frame in the deep ocean and leave it to attract material.
