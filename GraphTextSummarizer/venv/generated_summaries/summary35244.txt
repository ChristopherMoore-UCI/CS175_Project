With a lack of work in the forest, many elephants and their owners were forced in to the cities to beg, while others quickly became an essential part of the tourism industry working in elephant camps and circuses. 'Begging' elephants in Bangkok Dr. Jan Schmidt-Burbach, from the World Society for the Protection of Animals, says elephants working in the tourism industry can be subjected to terrible cases of animal cruelty. "The required extreme restraint of animals in the vast majority of elephant camps does not allow for free movements of the animals," he said. In an area famous for its tourist elephant camps, Chailert says her center allows elephants time to heal and live in self-chosen family groups. The 1989 ban on logging also meant that thousands of working elephants were left unemployed.
