Physicist Stanley Starr of NASA's Kennedy Space Center said for the time being, NASA's emphasis is on developing exploration technologies to be used once a craft is already in space. We can only make 3-centimeter-long nanotubes, but we need much more ... we think by 2030 we'll be able to do it." Goodbye, rocket man A space elevator is not the only non-rocket technology being investigated as a means of getting man-made objects into space. I don't foresee space elevator working in my lifetime," Starr said. "I would like to NASA establish a group, preferably networked from a number of NASA centers, that is actively looking new launch technologies and making recommendations for new investigations." According to the International Space Elevator Consortium (ISEC), space payloads would cost in the order of just hundreds of dollars per kilogram rather than the current $20,000 a kilogram that rocket technology costs.
