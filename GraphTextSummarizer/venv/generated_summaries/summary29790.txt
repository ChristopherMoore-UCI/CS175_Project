Other performers partaking in the benefit concert included Eric Clapton, Billy Joel, Alicia Keys, Kanye West and The Who. A spokesperson for Robin Hood tells CNN that the foundation will not have a final tally of how much the concert raised overall until Monday, but confirms that advance revenue generated from ticket sales, sponsors and corporate donations reached more than $30 million. Bruce Springsteen sang alongside Bon Jovi at the top of the show, while former Beatle Paul McCartney joined the grunge-rockers of Nirvana in the finale. The 12-12-12 Concert for Sandy Relief marked a historic night in music, not only due to its lineup of music legends but also unique collaborations between artists over the course of the colossal six-hour concert. Proceeds and donations went to the Robin Hood Relief Fund for Sandy victims.
