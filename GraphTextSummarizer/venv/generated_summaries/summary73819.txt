-- Famed film director Roman Polanski, wanted in the United States for having sex with a minor in the 1970s, was questioned this week by Polish authorities but allowed to leave after the interview. Polanski, who was in Krakow on Thursday, said he wants to film a movie in Poland, his parents' homeland, next spring. Polanski pleaded guilty in 1977 in California to having unlawful sex with Samantha Geimer, who was 13. Mateusz Martyniuk told CNN that Poland received a request from U.S. officials to arrest Polanski, and the Oscar winning filmmaker came Wednesday to the office in Krakow. Besides the Oscar win for "The Pianist," Polanski also received Academy Award nominations for "Tess" and "Chinatown."
