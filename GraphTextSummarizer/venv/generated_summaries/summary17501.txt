The report is expected in June, and police have cited fewer officers and limited budgets for hiring more officers since 2008 as causes for longer response times, the newspaper reported. Those harrowing events, provided by authorities, are now being investigated by Denver police, who are looking at how 911 handled the 13-minute emergency call and whether Kirk was using marijuana or another drug, authorities said Wednesday. Lance Kirk, brother of Richard Kirk, told KWGN that he was stunned to hear of the incident. Other neighbors told CNN affiliate KCNC that the couple's three young sons are all in grade school. At a court hearing Wednesday, Kirk, 47, was ordered held without bail on an accusation of first-degree murder, Denver court records showed.
