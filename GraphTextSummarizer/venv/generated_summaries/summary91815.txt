-- Chinese Super League club Shanghai Shenhua have pulled off an audacious transfer coup by signing former France international Nicolas Anelka from English team Chelsea. Anelka has rarely featured for Chelsea this season under new manager Andre Villas-Boas, and was almost certain to leave Stamford Bridge during European football's January transfer window after asking to leave. "This is not only good for Shenhua but also beneficial for Chinese football," club spokesperson Ma Yue told CNN. Anelka's international career came to a controversial halt during the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, when he was sent home in disgrace after clashing with coach Raymond Domenech. " No details were given about how much the contract was worth, but a club official denied reports that Anelka's weekly salary would be as high as Â£200,000 ($312,000).
