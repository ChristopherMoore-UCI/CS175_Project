August 2010: Theater struggles after fire The final cost to rebuild the theater and retrofit it to modern building codes: $4.5 million. The new space has been transformed from four blackened exterior brick walls and a heap of smoldering rubble to what theater production manager Ric Wallace describes as a world class music venue. "That's the first song that's been played in here in two years," said owner Wilmot Greene, a smile beaming from his face now that construction was complete and the music had returned. Starting with a blank slate also gave theater management the ability to make improvements. The still charred brick walls reverberated with music for the first time since a 2009 fire gutted the iconic Georgia Theatre.
