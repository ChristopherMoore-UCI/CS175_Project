"This serious prison sentence should go a long way towards convincing would-be terrorists that they can't hide behind the scenes, lend support to the violent aims of terrorist organizations, and escape detection and punishment," said Gary Shapiro, Acting U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois. Rana, a native of Pakistan, was found not guilty of providing support for the November 2008 Mumbai terror attacks in which more than 160 people were killed, including six Americans. Headley pleaded guilty in March 2010 to a dozen terror charges, including aiding and abetting the murders of the Americans in the Mumbai assault. David Coleman Headley, an alleged co-conspirator of Rana's, performed surveillance prior to those Mumbai attacks. Headley took part in the plot against the Danish paper, as well as the Mumbai operation.
