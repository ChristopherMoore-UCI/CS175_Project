MDNA, Madonna's first album as part of her new deal with LiveNation and Interscope, will hit stores on March 26th. An early version of "Give Me All Your Luvin" leaked to the internet in November, but this video debut will be fans' first chance to hear the completed version with vocals from M.I.A. You can watch a brief teaser clip from this video. The song, which will include guest appearances from Nicki Minaj and M.I.A., will be released as a digital single exclusively in the iTunes store the following day, and it will be performed on Sunday at the Super Bowl. Madonna will premiere the video for "Give Me All Your Luvin," the first single from her new album MDNA, on this Thursday's episode of "American Idol." (Rolling Stone) --
