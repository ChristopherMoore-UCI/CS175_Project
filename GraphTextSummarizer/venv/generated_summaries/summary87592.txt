I do want it to be perfect, and I want it to be something that I really enjoy and a product of my inspiration -- not a product of necessarily anything I've done before or anyone I've been before in regards to making records, because it's been a long time.

I wanted to bring those more alive, so I used that as the influence in regards to the fashion and the look of things.
