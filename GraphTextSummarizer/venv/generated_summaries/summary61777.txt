According to state-run news agency Xinhua, a document released by China's Supreme People's Court on Thursday stated that evidence and testimony obtained through torture and illegal methods such as forcing the accused to suffer extreme temperatures, hunger and fatigue -- must be ruled out by judges. He said in a statement posted on the organization's website, that this was the latest step China had taken in recent years to try to address the "most glaring" defects of China's criminal law system and one paper document was not likely to bring about major changes. -- China's top court has banned the use of torture to extract confessions, the latest in a series of reforms to its criminal justice system. "For one, it only speaks to the courts, while it's the police, a much more powerful institution than China's weak courts, that does the torturing," he said. Xinhua said that torture has been a practice of "widespread concern" and was used by some Chinese law enforcement personnel to wrap up cases quickly through forced testimony or a confession.
