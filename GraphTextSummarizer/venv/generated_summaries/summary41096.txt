SANTIAGO, Chile (Reuters) -- Chile called home its ambassador in Peru on Monday, as a dispute flared over disputed maritime territory between the South American neighbors. Peru and Chile are the world's top producers of fish meal, a cattle feed, and fishing is one of the engines of Peru's economy. But Peru says it was non-binding and rob it of 14,630 square miles (37,900 sq km) of fishing waters. Peru's foreign minister, Jose Antonio Garcia Belaunde, sought to downplay the row. Chile defeated Peru in the 1879-1883 War of the Pacific and seized a chunk of mineral-rich territory from its northern neighbor.
