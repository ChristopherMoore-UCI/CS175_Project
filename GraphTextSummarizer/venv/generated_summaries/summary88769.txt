The move would represent the first tender for East Jerusalem construction since March, when the Israeli government announced the construction of 1,600 housing units in East Jerusalem while U.S. Vice President Joseph Biden was visiting Israel. In a blow to efforts to keep direct negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians from faltering, the Israeli government is planning to construct new housing units in East Jerusalem, Israeli and U.S. sources confirmed Friday. The issues of housing construction in East Jerusalem and West Bank settlement building have been major sticking points in the newly revived direct talks between Israelis and Palestinians. The two neighborhoods are in the northern part of the city, but commonly considered part of East Jerusalem because they are located east of the Green Line, the armistice line that separated Israel from Jordan when Jordan controlled East Jerusalem and the West Bank prior to 1967. Israel seized East Jerusalem from Jordan during the Six Day War in 1967 and considers it part of its sovereign capital, a claim not recognized by many in the international community.
