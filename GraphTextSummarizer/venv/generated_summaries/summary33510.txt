Nick said Walmart hasn't asked for police to press charges. Walmart spokesman Brian Nick told CNN the chain cannot verify how long the boy was in the store but said this is definitely an isolated incident. CNN affiliate KTVT obtained pictures of the child's hideaways, one showing a makeshift bed between stacks of boxes. -- There in the baby section, behind boxes of strollers, was a 14-year-old boy with a secret. The station reported the youth appeared to have changed clothes several times, stashed away supplies and had even taken a fish from the pet department.
