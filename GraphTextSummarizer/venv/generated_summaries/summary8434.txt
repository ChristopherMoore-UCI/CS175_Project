-- Obvious observation number one: Judging by the high response rate of our last two columns on online dating, it sure seems like a lot of you out there are looking for love.

No, we're just going to lay down this general rule: When it comes to digital dating, you should go it alone in your snaps (unless you're a member of that new buddy system dating site, DuoDater).

Just a torso Why they're clicking "next": Yes, OK, Cupid recently did some study that shows that shirtless men are extremely popular when it comes to scoring ladies online, but that doesn't mean you should plaster your profile with pics of your abs and just your abs.
