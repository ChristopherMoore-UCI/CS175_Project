West, Rihanna and Jay-Z will debut Leno's new approach to musical guests. Jay Leno says immediacy is key to his new show, and he should have plenty of it for his prime time premiere Monday, when Kanye West is a musical guest. Leno could reprise his 1995 ratings-grabbing moment when he asked actor Hugh Grant, "What the hell were you thinking?" The rapper created a fan and artist uprising Sunday night when he jumped onstage at MTV's Video Music Awards to hijack singer Taylor Swift's acceptance speech. This is just the kind of "immediacy" Leno was talking about in a call with reporters last week.
