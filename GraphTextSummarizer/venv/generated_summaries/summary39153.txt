Starting this fall, MyNet will run two episodes a week, edited for broadcast standards, from seasons of the show that have previously aired on AMC. Though not one of the popular Big 4 networks, MyNet reaches 97 percent of the country and is likewise categorized as a broadcast channel mostly airing repeats of shows like "Monk," "House" and "Law & Order: Criminal Intent." But after protest from parents group the Parents Television Council claiming that rating was far too lenient for the show's graphic content, AMC switched "TWD" rating last year to the stricter TV-MA. NBC renews 'Grimm,' plus 2 more dramas MyNet confirms "The Walking Dead" on MyNet will be edited to meet broadcast content standards and will carry a TV-14 rating. And while we will never know what creative changes broadcast executives might have demanded of comic creator Robert Kirkman during a traditional network development process, we will get to find out what AMC's version will look like when edited for a more family friendly audience.
