The movie, due out August 7, promises a very different take on the classic Marvel comics characters, played this go-round by Miles Teller, Kate Mara, Michael B. Jordan and Jamie Bell. (The trailer also includes part of a scene that caused controversy after Joss Whedon called it "sexist" last week.) They also end up in another dimension, and we see the early flirtation between Sue Storm and Reed Richards as well. It features even more of star Chris Pratt. The movie is first in the rampaging-dino franchise since "Jurassic Park III" in 2001.
