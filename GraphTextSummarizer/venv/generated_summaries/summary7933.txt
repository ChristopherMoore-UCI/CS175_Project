"Ukraine will need China's economic cooperation, whether it's a friend of the EU and the U.S., or of Russia," said Wenfang Tang, of the University of Iowa. -- Vladimir Putin is seeking China's support in Russia's standoff with Western powers over Ukraine. In describing an earlier phone call between the foreign ministers of China and Russia, the foreign ministry in Moscow said Monday that there was "a broad convergence of views between Russia and China in connection to the situation in Ukraine and around it." Why Putin's move is no surprise Asked if China recognized the new Ukrainian government, he replied: "This requires a judgment to be made based on the laws of Ukraine." Spokesman Qin's equivocation shows the delicate balance China is trying to strike to maintain good relations with Russia without alienating itself completely from the United States and Europe. "In the past, China and Russia have often worked together to block international action (often led by the West) to address global crises, by claiming their respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty," said Paul Haenle, director of the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center of Global Policy in Beijing, noting their recent veto of sanctions against the Syrian regime.
