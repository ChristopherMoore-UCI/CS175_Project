I was concerned that the Jackass concept was old and tired, and its stars -- Johnny, Steve-O, Chris Pontius, Wee Man, Bam Margera, and Preston Lacy -- had run out of ideas. See the rest of The Cast and Crew of Jackass 3D at VBS.TV By mid-morning of my first day onset, Steve-O had been launched hundreds of feet in the air and the crew -- along with maybe $1 million worth of 3-D camera equipment -- had been coated with a fine spray of human and animal waste. I'd been on the Santa Clarita, California, set of "Jackass 3D" for about two hours, watching two gigantic cranes catapult a Port-O-Potty containing star Steve-O and gallons of fecal matter 10 stories in the air when the feeling struck me again. I went from having the feeling that I had one the best jobs in the world to being pretty sure the cast and crew from Jackass had it all figured out. Admittedly, I'm a longtime fan of the "Jackass" franchise, which was born out of an article for Big Brother magazine in 1999.
