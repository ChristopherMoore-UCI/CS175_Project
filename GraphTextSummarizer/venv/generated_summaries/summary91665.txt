An account of Wednesday's meeting, published under Castro's name, also appeared in the Cuban news agency ACN late Wednesday. -- Fidel Castro appeared "very well" during a meeting this week with Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, telling her that he watched President Obama's inauguration on television, Argentina's official news agency reported. "We talked about all subjects," Kirchner said of her Wednesday meeting with Castro. Castro said he believes Obama is "a sincere person with good ideas," Kirchner said in Cuba at the conclusion of a three-day visit, according to the state-run Telam news agency. Though photos sometimes surface, he has made no public appearances since then and handed power to Raul Castro permanently in February 2008.
