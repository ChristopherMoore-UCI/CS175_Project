The prospects for Bahrain's pro-democracy movement are bleak, especially without Western support. Bahrain enacts stiff laws against 'terrorism' before opposition protests Even during the 1990s intifada in Bahrain, I do not remember witnessing much trouble. None of my friends or their parents talked politics, and most Western expatriates like myself lived in safe, walled compounds, segregated and separate from Bahrain's villages. Unfortunately for Bahrain's pro-democracy movement, the U.S. are not going to risk upsetting the Bahraini government by pressuring for too much "meaningful" political reform. Like many Western expats who grew up in Bahrain, I was fairly insulated from local politics.
