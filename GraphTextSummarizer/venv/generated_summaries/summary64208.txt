I have a keen awareness now of the stress my disease places on my loved ones who provide me encouragement and tender loving care. One year after that mission, I left NASA for a job in the private sector supporting human space flight. Parkinson's disease is diagnosed by the process of eliminating other possible diseases. I continued my normal duties and was subsequently offered my third shuttle mission -- STS-76, which included a planned space walk. Having Parkinson's disease is no reason to stop living life to its fullest extent.
