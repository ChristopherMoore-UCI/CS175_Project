"The military will continue to be pro-American, because of its reliance on U.S. foreign aid and military assistance, and the Egyptians who would be running in the future will be smart enough not to bring conflict with the U.S.," said Ashraf Singer, a member of the Egyptian Council for Foreign Affairs who has also worked closely with Egyptian government officials. In November 2011, a few months after Hosni Mubarak had been ousted by the Egyptian revolution, the scientists predicted that in the final evolution of Egypt's transitional democratic phase, the military would allow for semi-free elections but would still act as custodians of the country and the true center of power in the short to medium term. Egyptians to take to streets again Abdollahian's team used complex computer algorithm logic games, that measure how people interact with one another, to draw different scenarios of how segments of Egyptian society, power brokers, religious sectors and other sociopolitical variables would affect the outcome of the transition. U.S. allies will take wait and see approach Abdollahian said the U.S and the European Union are taking a wait and see approach, and his upcoming forecast predicts the U.S. and its allies will "move cautiously and solely in support of the new government, but won't take a strong stance because of the risks of potential implications throughout the region. And that's what led us to where we are today," said Mark Abdollahian, a political scientist and co-creator of Senturion, a large-data predictive analysis model that's used by the U.S. State Department and other governments in predicting, preventing and stopping cycles of violence.
