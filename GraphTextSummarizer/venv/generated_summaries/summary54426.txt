Thompson says Jenner did not remain a presence in their lives after he married Kris Kardashian, mother of Kim, Khloe, Khourtney and Rob Kardashian. Jenner's star grew, and was a man that other men aspired to be, and someone women wanted to be with. Thompson, who had two sons with Jenner during their five-year marriage, was one of many relatives to cheer Jenner for publicly sharing what she had known for decades. They separated after going to therapy for about six months and Jenner began taking female hormones and removing his hair through electrolysis. Thompson wrote that she would not have married Jenner if she had known about his "gender issue" when they first met.
