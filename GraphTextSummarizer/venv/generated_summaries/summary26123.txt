It's only once we know all these things -- carbon-based touches not found in the Hasbro product -- that "Battleship" gets down to the business of hotshot combat between brave U.S. Navy fighters and aggressive alien visitors. But before getting to the hardcore blow-'em-up portion of the humans-versus-aliens warfare entertainment, we are given time to invest in the relationship between Stone Hopper ("True Blood's" Alexander SkarsgÃ¥rd) and his younger brother, Alex (Taylor Kitsch from TV's "Friday Night Lights") -- the former a courageous Navy officer of great character, the latter a corner-cutting showboater who is about to have his character entirely re-welded through the Navy challenges that await him. We see the emotional-zeitgeist logic in the special interest that Sam has taken in the physical rehabilitation of an Army veteran and amputee, authentically played by real-life Army vet and amputee Gregory D. Gadson. We understand that Alex loves a bombshell physical therapist named Sam (Brooklyn Decker), and that Sam happens to be the daughter of crusty U.S. Pacific Fleet commander Admiral Shane (Liam Neeson, barking but not biting). It's "Pearl Harbor" with greater intelligence, less hokum, and more aliens.
