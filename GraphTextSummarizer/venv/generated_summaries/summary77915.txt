Williams won both the French and U.S. Open titles last year, but also made headlines for an interview with Rolling Stone magazine in June where she made some unflattering remarks about an unnamed player widely assumed to be Sharapova, calling her "boring" and criticizing her choice of boyfriend (Grigor Dimitrov). -- They battled on and off court last year and now Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova are locking horns at the earliest opportunity in 2014. Sharapova responded saying Williams should concentrate on tennis rather than taking sideswipes at the personal lives of her opponents. Williams has won 14 of her 16 encounters against Sharapova and hasn't lost to the Russian in almost a decade. Williams, a five-time champion, last triumphed in Melbourne in 2010 while Sharapova's solitary success came in 2008.
