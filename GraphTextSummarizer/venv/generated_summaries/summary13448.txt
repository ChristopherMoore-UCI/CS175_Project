-- Country music singer Mindy McCready was hiding in the closet with her son when authorities took the 5-year-old boy into custody in Arkansas, officials said early Saturday. Authorities found Zander McCready and his mother in a home in Heber Springs, Arkansas, according to David Rahbany, the chief deputy U.S. Marshal in eastern Arkansas. McCready took her son from her mother's Florida home late last month and asked a court to restore custody to her out of concern over the boy's safety. McCready participated in the 2009 season of the reality TV show "Celebrity Rehab With Dr. Drew." "We just hope she does the right thing from here on out and that this is a wake-up call for her." McCready was not charged with a crime Friday, Rahbany said, adding it is unclear whether she faces any future charges.
