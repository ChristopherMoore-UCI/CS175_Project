Authorities were also investigating notes and videos Auvinen had posted on YouTube, the online video-sharing site. In rambling text posted on the site two weeks before the shooting, Auvinen called himself "a cynical existentialist, anti-human humanist, anti-social social-Darwinist, realistic idealist and god-like atheist. Police said that, when they first made contact with Auvinen, they told him to drop his gun, but he responded with fire. Police said all of his victims had multiple gunshot wounds, most to the upper body and head. " Sweden's King Carl Gustav XVI sent his condolences, as did European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso.
