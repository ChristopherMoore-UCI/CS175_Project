Dr. Arnold Klein denied in a CNN interview last month that he had given Jackson dangerous drugs. Jackson's June 25 death is also the focus of an investigation by Los Angeles police and the state attorney general's office. The coroner's office said it would abide by the request that "the cause and manner of death remain confidential," and referred all questions to Los Angeles police. Klein, who treated Jackson for decades, denied in a CNN interview last month that he had given Jackson dangerous drugs. The agents executed a federal search warrant at the Mickey Fine Pharmacy and Grill, and were expected to seize pharmacy records, said DEA spokesman Jose Martinez.
