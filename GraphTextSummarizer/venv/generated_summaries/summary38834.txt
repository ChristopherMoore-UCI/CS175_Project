U.S. President Barack Obama wrapped up his visit to South Africa on Sunday with a visit to the prison cell where anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela was held and a call to students to help build a new Africa. Sunday's visit was the first for the family members who accompanied him -- first lady Michelle Obama; the couple's daughters, Sasha and Malia; Mrs. Obama's mother, Marian Robinson; and a cousin, Leslie Robinson. Cape Town University was the site of a famous speech by Sen. Robert F. Kennedy at the height of apartheid in 1966, and Obama said the leadership of figures like Kennedy, the now-ailing Mandela and Indian independence leader Mahatma Gandhi -- who began his career as a lawyer in South Africa -- "stand as a challenge to your generation. It's the lifeline for families to meet their most basic needs, and it's the connection that's needed to plug Africa into the grid of the global economy," Obama said at Cape Town University. Obama told students that the American college campaigns against investment in apartheid-era South Africa in the 1980s inspired him to get involved in a public cause for the first time.
