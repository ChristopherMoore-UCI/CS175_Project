-- A reported tornado briefly touched down Friday afternoon in northern Alabama, causing damage and scares days after twisters proved deadly in Texas. The twister was part of a severe thunderstorm that rolled through the Southeast, prompting tornado warnings Friday afternoon. This severe weather struck two days after at least 16 tornadoes, according to the National Weather Service, ripped through parts of central Texas. The same storm system produced a tornado Thursday in Waskom, Texas, which is along that state's border with Louisiana. A couple of homes in Athens -- a community of about 22,000 people some 20 miles west of Huntsville -- suffered minor damage as the storm rolled through, said Rita White, spokeswoman for Limestone County's emergency management agency.
