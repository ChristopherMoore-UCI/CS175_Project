Egyptian court dissolves Muslim Brotherhood's political party "In order to avoid causing any embarrassment for the State of Qatar, which we found to be a very welcoming and supportive host, some symbols of the Muslim Brotherhood and its political wing ... have now honored that request," Darrag said. "We appreciate the great role of the state of Qatar in supporting the Egyptian people in their revolution against the military junta, and well understand the circumstances faced by the region," said Dr. Amr Darrag, a leading member of Freedom and Justice Party, said in a statement online. That caused Muslim Brother leaders to flee to Qatar, which supports the Islamic group. Several top members of the Muslim Brotherhood have been asked to leave Qatar, an Egyptian leader of the group said Sunday. The apparent sudden push from Qatar comes amid longstanding pressure against the Brotherhood in the region, which began with its ouster from authority in Egypt several years ago.
