Last season saw Barcelona reclaim the Spanish title and Real Madrid were disappointingly knocked out in the semifinal of the Champions League by Borussia Dortmund. Ronaldo, who had been linked with a return to the English Premier League with his former club Manchester United, revealed a verbal agreement had been in place with Real Madrid since the end of last season. -- Cristiano Ronaldo pledged his future to Real Madrid as he signed a new five-year deal Sunday which ties him to the Spanish giants until 2018. " With Ronaldo's current contract set to run out in 2015, the renewed deal is a considerable coup for Real president Florentino Perez. It led to speculation that he may be on the move, but under new coach Carlo Ancelotti, Real have made an unbeaten start to the current season.
