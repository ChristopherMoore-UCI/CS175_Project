In 2002 the National Academies of Sciences' National Research Council reported "contaminant exposures result from the intake of chemical contaminants (e.g., engine lubricating oils, hydraulic fluids, deicing fluids and their degradation products) into the Environmental Control System and then into the cabin." Of particular concern are toxic anti-wear agents in the oil, designed to prolong an engine's life, called tricresyl phosphates. Terry Williams hugs her two boys -- Jake, left, and Zack -- in 2006, before she says toxic cabin air made her sick. In its response to Williams' suit, the company said: "The potential for bleed air contamination has been known through the aviation industry for many years." That's butyric acid from engine oil, which itself is not highly toxic. Furlong said his team is a few months away from finalizing a blood analysis test that will be able to definitely confirm whether the study participants were indeed poisoned by toxic fumes.
