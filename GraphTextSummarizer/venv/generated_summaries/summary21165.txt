A lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against Carrier IQ, and phone makers Samsung and HTC, claiming that the app violates customer privacy. Many bloggers and smartphone customers fretted about the privacy issues raised by Carrier IQ, an information-mining app secretly installed on many phones. Sprint said it uses the app to root out network problems but can't see user activity. "Yet, it appears that Carrier IQ has violated this trust." "Okay, folks, before we complete this public lynching, is there any evidence that Carrier IQ actually transmitted inappropriate data?"
