-- A pedestrian was struck twice by vehicles in Queens and dragged for 17 miles by the second vehicle before police found him dead in Brooklyn, New York City Police Commissioner Ray Kelly told reporters Wednesday. Kelly said the van driver stopped at one point during the drive on New York City's highways and roads because he noticed the vehicle was not driving properly. No charges have been filed, Kelly told reporters Wednesday afternoon. The badly mangled body was discovered under a van after several passing motorists motioned the driver to pull over, Kelly said. But he failed to find anything unusual, Kelly said.
