-- Former Cuban President Fidel Castro threw his support behind Egyptian protesters Monday, hailing the "defeat of the United States' principal ally in the bosom of Arab countries. Castro was in power for nearly five decades after his own revolution defeated Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista in 1959. On the day of Mubarak's fall, prominent Cuban blogger Yoani Sanchez announced via Twitter, "Right now I feel like I am in Cairo. "We support the people of Egypt and their brave fight for political rights and social justice," he wrote. Cuban dissidents have also allied themselves with Egypt's young protesters, saying they too should try to use social media more to organize protests against the government.
