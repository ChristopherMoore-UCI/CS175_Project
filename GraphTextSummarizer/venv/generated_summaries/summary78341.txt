The commission is reviewing hundreds of thousands of pages of evidence, and is paying special attention to allegations that police tampered with statements and that misleading information was passed to the media, among others. The tragedy occurred when thousands of fans were let through a gate into an already crowded standing area, leading many to be crushed against metal fences and concrete walls. The investigation follows a private inquiry that found serious failings by police and emergency services. The private report, released last month, reviewed thousands of documents and cast doubt on the original inquest's finding of accidental death. It said it does not know how many officers and retired officers will be investigated.
