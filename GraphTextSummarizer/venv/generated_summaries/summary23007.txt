Did the United States weaken its own hand by showing that it will trade kidnapped U.S. soldiers for Afghan prisoners? The United States undercut almost every principle we claim to adhere to on negotiating with terrorists (in this case, the Haqqani network, the militant group that was holding Bergdahl, has plenty of American blood on its hands) and let out some very bad guys who are almost certain to direct any number of enterprises to attack Americans and weaken the U.S. efforts in Afghanistan. And the administration carried out the Bergdahl deal with its characteristic lack of tactical dexterity and smarts, failing to brief key members of Congress appropriately and perhaps even violating U.S. law. Does that mean paying any price and sacrificing countless Americans lives in the process? And here's why: Written or unwritten, traditional code or assumed values, in an America-initiated war there are American responsibilities and commitments to those who fight it.
