The airline noted that the eased restrictions apply only to domestic flights flown by its "mainline" aircraft, which means partner airline flights (such as US Airways Express flights) are not included. Add Southwest Airlines to the list of U.S. airlines that have received Federal Aviation Administration approval to allow passengers to use many portable electronic devices in all phases of flight. JetBlue Airways and Delta Air Lines moved quickly to get FAA approval to allow devices on board on November 1. Virgin America said it hopes to allow devices in all phases of flight this month. For takeoff and landing, laptops and other electronic devices that weigh more than 2 pounds must be secured in an overhead bin or under the seat in front of passengers.
