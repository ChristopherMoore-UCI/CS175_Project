Although we have many solutions in hand, we need to strengthen financing, policies, health care systems and service delivery to give more children the chance to survive and thrive. The U.N. Foundation's mHealth Alliance has been leading the working group on mobile health and child survival. Working with our partners, the U.N. Foundation delivers lifesaving vaccines and insecticide-treated bed nets to children, harnesses mobile technologies to improve maternal and child health, provides opportunities for women to voluntarily plan their families, empowers girls to build the future they want and provides clean cooking stoves that are safe and healthy for families and the environment. Yet, too many children continue to die, and we have more work to do, especially in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, where child mortality rates are the highest. We have provided nearly $200 million in grants to U.N. agencies and other partners, launched two new multistakeholder initiatives and engaged more than 300 partners and hundreds of thousands of individual people in efforts to reduce child deaths.
