"It's been a little over a year since we experienced the tragic death of Oscar Grant," BART Board President James Fang said. Initially, attorney John Burris asked for $50 million in a wrongful-death lawsuit filed on behalf of Grant's daughter. "This settlement is critical in our efforts to move forward," said Carole Ward Allen, a BART board member. The video showed then-Officer Johannes Mehserle, 27, pulling his gun and shooting Grant in the back as another officer kneeled on Grant. The Bay Area Rapid Transit train system late Wednesday announced the settlement over the killing of Oscar Grant, 22.
