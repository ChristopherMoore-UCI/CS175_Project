The gender-neutral robot was conceived by university researchers David Harris Smith and Frauke Zeller, who view its quest as part performance art, part social experiment. The robot employs artificial intelligence, speech recognition, social media and other tools to bum rides from motorists. It also can record conversations with people it meets -- with their permission -- as a sort of audio diary. And people have been recharging hitchBOT along the way by plugging it into their cars' cigarette lighters. "We have even seen hitchBOT lying in a camping bed under a blanket, and sitting on a toilet," they said, "so people certainly have fun with it." hitchBOT has a bucket for a torso, blue swimming-pool noodles for arms and legs and a smiling LED panel for a face, protected by a cake saver.
