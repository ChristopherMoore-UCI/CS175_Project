Stunned friends recall good deeds of killing suspect Bales is charged with 16 counts of premeditated murder, six counts of attempted murder, seven counts of assault and the illicit use of alcohol and steroids. The sergeant's lawyer, John Henry Browne, has said that steroid use will be a key factor in Bales' defense. Another investigator, Trayce Lang, testified Wednesday that she found steroids hidden outside Bales' quarters. The Army has said Bales is the sole suspect in the killings, but Afghan villagers in the area have consistently rejected the contention that Bales acted alone. Bales served three tours of duty in Iraq before being sent to Afghanistan and may have been suffering post-traumatic stress disorder, Browne said.
