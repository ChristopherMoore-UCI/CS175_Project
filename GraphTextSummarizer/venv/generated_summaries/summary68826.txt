The 20-year streak began with Republican George H.W. Bush's inauguration in January 1989 and ran through two terms for Democrat Bill Clinton and then two for Bush's son, George W., until Barack Obama took office in January 2009. "Clinton's husband was fairly popular in his last year or so in office and that wasn't true for Bush's brother or his father," Holland said. "Both Clinton and Bush would be saddled with last names that incite mixed emotions among current voters, but she has a natural demographic constituency that he lacks. "If the election were held in 2014, I think both Clinton and Bush would suffer from name fatigue stemming from an overall high level of dissatisfaction with government and all who have been part of it," Schiller said, citing a recent Gallup poll that found 65% of respondents dissatisfied with how well the government works. "So the question is, if you skip ahead, four more years, will there still be Bush fatigue?"
