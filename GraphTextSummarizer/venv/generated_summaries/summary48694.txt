At a recent taping for the 499th episode, host Joel McHale and executive producer K.P. Anderson spoke with reporters about the milestone and what Anderson called the "high-wire effect" of the live show. The show's fifth season features the return of "Community" creator Dan Harmon, and while McHale modestly underplayed his role in getting Harmon back, it has been said he was instrumental. "(Harmon) created the show and the show is in his voice, so to have it back in his voice I think was important," McHale told CNN. McHale said most guests enjoy their experience. "I would love for Prince (to come on)," McHale said.
