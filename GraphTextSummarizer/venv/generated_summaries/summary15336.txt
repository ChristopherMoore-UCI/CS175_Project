Local, state and federal investigators continue to look for Celina Cass, with searches being conducted "by air, by land, by water" in and around the girl's hometown of West Stewartstown, New Hampshire Senior Assistant Attorney General Jane Young said Sunday. According to the flier, Celina is 5 feet, 5 inches tall and weighs 95 pounds, with long brown hair and brown eyes. Friends have set up a Facebook page, "Missing Celina Cass," with one of the fliers serving as a profile picture. Young said Sunday that investigators consider this a "missing persons" case. She noted that authorities, which include FBI members, had received more than 400 leads as of early Sunday evening but, "at this point, we still have not discovered Celina."
