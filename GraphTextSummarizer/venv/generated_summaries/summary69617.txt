Now in his 30s -- he won't reveal his exact age -- Morgan owns Queen Victoria's family album, a large collection of Adolf Hitler photos and the largest private collection of photos of Abraham Lincoln. Morgan says the relationships he develops while researching historical photos pays off, such as when Gen. Ulysses S. Grant's great-great-grandson told him about an image in a family-owned album that showed Lincoln in front of the White House weeks before he was assassinated. The pop icon, a well-known buyer of historical artifacts, was searching for prints of Elvis Presley and Marilyn Monroe, Morgan said. The widow of the man accused of assassinating President John F. Kennedy says she's spent hours discussing history with Morgan, who owns the largest private collection of photos of JFK. Unlike most other Lincoln images, Morgan said, this was an unstaged photo captured after the photographer convinced a young Tad Lincoln to ask his father to step outside.
