Leveson confirmed what many people knew to be happening: that politicians, media executives and senior police chiefs were in each other's pockets and that the press serves largely the corporate, rather than the public, interest. First, the press barons, including News Corp's Rupert Murdoch and the Daily Mail's Paul Dacre, launched a vicious assault on Leveson's proposals, arguing that any form of statutory regulation constituted the end of "300 years of press freedom." -- One year ago, Lord Justice Leveson delivered his damning report on the "culture, practices and ethics" of the British press. There is no reason to think that anything has changed since the report was published and it will require action far beyond that of a public inquiry to tackle the problems that Lord Justice Leveson raised a year ago and that still wait to be adequately addressed. This reflects some of the weaknesses of the Leveson Inquiry, which heard a vast amount of evidence about the extent of corporate lobbying and intimate relations between media executives and ministers but shied away from making any meaningful changes to media ownership rules that might make individual companies less powerful and therefore politicians less likely to kowtow towards them.
