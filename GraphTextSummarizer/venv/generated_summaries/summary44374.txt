Team facilities could be open by Saturday, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said, if players approve the deal. Under the old agreement, NFL owners took $1 billion off the top of that revenue stream. -- National Football League owners approved a 10-year labor and revenue-sharing agreement with players, who late Thursday discussed key elements but did not vote on it. "I do feel good" about the prospects of resolving the situation, Falcons player representative Coy Wire told CNN before Goodell announced the terms. Current players can remain in the player medical plan for life, under the owners' plan.
