There may be a life-size polar bear in a cowboy hat and hula skirt standing in front of a tourist shop that makes for memorable souvenir photos, and one could argue that any item is for sale if you make the right offer, but if it isn't specifically there to be sold, it doesn't count. These are a collection of entertaining souvenirs that are, you might say, so bad, they're good. Seems reasonable, but consider the example of a German tourist who picks up an iPad while visiting New York's Apple Store. The jaunty little guy sports a Nova Scotia T-shirt, and while made in China, he reminds me of a lovely Canadian adventure lacking only in a real moose. (Finding kitsch-free souvenirs is a far more difficult task.)
