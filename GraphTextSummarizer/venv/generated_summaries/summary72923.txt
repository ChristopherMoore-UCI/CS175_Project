The Los Angeles city attorney decided Monday there was "a lack of evidence" to prosecute the singer for attempted robbery in connection with an argument with a woman at a miniature golf park last month, according to spokesman Rob Wilcox. A criminal charge in the egging probe is coming as soon as Monday afternoon, a source told CNN. But a Los Angeles prosecutor is expected to soon charge Bieber, 20, with vandalism in a separate incident, the egging of his neighbor's mansion, a source involved in the case told CNN on Monday. -- Justin Bieber is completely off the hook for an incident in which a Los Angeles woman accused him of trying to take her cell phone last month. "When something happens, we will let everyone know at the same time," Jane Robison told CNN on Monday.
