And that's what led to his death," de la Rionda said before going on to attack many defense arguments about what happened that rainy night: De la Rionda: -- Argued that Zimmerman, who had taken criminal justice classes, fed police a story of escalating violence and exaggerated fear to meet the standards of Florida's "Stand Your Ground" self-defense law. In his final words Thursday, de la Rionda reminded them that, while Zimmerman still has hope, there's no more special moments for, there can be no more photos of Martin. De la Rionda characterized Zimmerman as a wannabe police officer who wrongly took the law into his own hands and pressed the fatal encounter with Martin. -- Said the lack of Martin's DNA on Zimmerman's pistol refutes defense arguments that Martin had grabbed the gun during the struggle. That's important, because to find Zimmerman guilty of second-degree murder, jurors will have to find that he acted with "ill will, hatred, spite, or an evil intent" in shooting Martin, according to Florida law.
