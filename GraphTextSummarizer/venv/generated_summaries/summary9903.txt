Minjun admits that those events and the subsequent changes in Chinese society have had a major effect on his life and work. " Art critics have often labeled his early work "critical realism," a term that encompassed a number of Chinese artists in the early 1990s that used satire to juxtapose capitalism and consumerism with Chinese communism. While that famous smile may remain in some of his work in the future, Minjun believes that China could do with slowing the pace of social change. Born in 1962, Minjun graduated from the Hebei Normal University in 1989, the year that authorities cracked down on student protests in China, most notably in Tiananmen Square. Part self portrait, part parody, part social commentary, his paintings have made him one the most instantly recognized contemporary artists in China.
