The first trouble with Triumph was in diesel generator No. 6 -- the one that wound up catching fire. There had been nine incidents resulting in fuel leaks associated with flexible fuel lines in just two years. In fact, Carnival's Costa Allegra caught fire in the Indian Ocean in February 2012 because fuel leaked onto a hot spot and ignited. But, during that same time period, Carnival learned about another, even more alarming safety problem in the engine room: fuel lines. Carnival says it proactively began investigating after the Costa Allegra fire and found a big problem in a different type of fuel line.
