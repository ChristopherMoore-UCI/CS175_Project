" Hear from another student who lives on the other side of the river For over a month, CNN Radio contacted several East St. Louis schools for comment, including East St. Louis High School, but those calls were not returned. But in an interview with CNN, school board member and former East St. Louis Mayor Carl Officer says it is the state that's corrupt. Although Jones didn't attend public school, he says his friends that did often complained about poor teachers, a lack of school support, and shoddy classroom conditions. According to the most recent U.S. Census statistics, more than 25% of youth in East St. Louis did not graduate high school. In those cities, only 53% of high school students graduate within four years.
