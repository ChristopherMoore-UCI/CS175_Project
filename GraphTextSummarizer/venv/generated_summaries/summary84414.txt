Rich people are getting rich and poor people are getting poor in most of these places. Sustainable development is simply an expression of the desire to increase human development where we live within the environmental limits of the planet. CNN: How do you go about making cities like London, or Paris or Frankfurt or New York more sustainable? They'll produce their own energy from wind, solar, biofuel and recycled city waste.
