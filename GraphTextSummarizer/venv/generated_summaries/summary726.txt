The key point is that we are collectively responsible for such deaths at some level or another, especially if our leaders and state officials carry them out. We may not like Indonesia's laws, but they are being applied even-handedly within national borders where state officials have authority. Consequently, Indonesia's actions raise more general questions about the powers we give to states -- or, more accurately, to those who control the coercive apparatus of the state at any particular moment. However, dozens of entirely innocent women and children from other countries are routinely killed in such strikes with little comment. Significantly, it is those same national borders that demarcate the extent of Indonesia's leaders ability -- or even desire, perhaps -- to use their capacity for state-sanctioned violence.
