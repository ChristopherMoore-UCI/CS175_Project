Police: Robert Wagner not a suspect in new probe of Natalie Wood's death The story surrounding Wood's death has long been one of Hollywood's great mysteries. Wagner mourned Wood's death for years before marrying Jill St. John, one of Wood's closest friends, in 1990. "Splendor in the Grass" was no slouch, either; for her performance opposite Warren Beatty, Wood picked up an Oscar nomination for best actress. However, except for a handful of roles, "Bob & Carol" also marked the end of a chapter in Wood's film career. Filming continued in Hollywood, and during the Thanksgiving holiday, Wagner and Wood invited Walken to relax on their boat, Splendour, named for "Splendor in the Grass."
