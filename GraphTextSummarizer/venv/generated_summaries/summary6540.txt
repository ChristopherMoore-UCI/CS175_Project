It's a parochial place whose mayor thinks that replacing a crumbling public library or building light rail -- years after other cities in Canada have done both -- is a bold idea. But it was naïve to think that a country of 35 million people, on the way to war in Iraq, would not face this kind of violence one day. Unlike the United States, Canada has little violent crime. When a gunman killed that lone soldier in front of the memorial today, when he -- and possibly his accomplices (at this moment we do not know whether, who or how many) -- then swept through the front doors of the Parliament of Canada and began firing, something changed here. It is too much a cliché to say -- as many surely will -- that Canada has lost its innocence today.
