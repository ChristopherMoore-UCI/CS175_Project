But the United States says the radar and interceptor missiles it plans to place in eastern Europe won't have the ability to shoot down Russian missiles. Late last year, then-Russian President Dmitry Medvedev threatened to withdraw from the START treaty on nuclear weapons reductions and deploy ballistic missiles in its exclave of Kaliningrad on its border with Europe if NATO moved ahead with the plans for missile defense. "We discussed how the European missile defense system is designed and configured to counter ballistic missile threats from the Middle East, and we have made clear we have no intent or desire to undermine Russia's strategic deterrent," said Ellen Tauscher, the special envoy. During Thursday's conference, the U.S. special envoy for strategic stability and missile defense said there were discussions aimed at easing Russia's concern. NATO Deputy Secretary-General Alexander Vershbow, who listened to Makarov's comments, told reporters he does not believe a missile defense system in Europe would not affect Russia.
