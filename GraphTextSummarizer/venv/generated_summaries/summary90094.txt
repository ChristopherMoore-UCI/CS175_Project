" U.S. diplomats say there has been excessive drinking surrounding traditional late-night meetings, especially during Christmas-time budget negotiations held by the fifth committee, which handles administration and budgetary matters. The United States ambassador for management and reform, Joseph Torsella, issued a rare public scolding, by U.N. standards, on personal behavior Monday. Torsella, who issued the drinking warning, has also been on the warpath against excessive business-class travel by U.N. staff who travel overseas. A deputy spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, Eduardo Del Buey, said: "I don't think it's up to the secretary-general to tell the member states how to behave. We all have our private lives, don't we?"
