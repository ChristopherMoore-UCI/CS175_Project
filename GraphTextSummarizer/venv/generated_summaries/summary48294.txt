Cody Ray Smith, described by the court as over 14 years old, pleaded not guilty to charges of rape with a foreign object and rape by force. Two other juveniles, Ari Abdallah Morales and Marcelles James Peter, appeared with Smith at the Contra Costa County Superior Court, but did not enter a plea. The four are accused of taking part in what police said was a 2Â½-hour assault on the Richmond High School campus, in the Richmond community north of Oakland on San Francisco Bay. The court described Morales as under 16, and did not give an age for Peter. All of those arraigned are due back in court on November 5.
