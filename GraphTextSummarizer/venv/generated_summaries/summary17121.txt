"I've got prostate cancer, and I'm treating it with hemp oil, with cannabis," he told CNN's Don Lemon. -- Tommy Chong, one-half of the marijuana-loving "Cheech and Chong" comedy duo, is battling prostate cancer, he announced Saturday on CNN. Chong, 74, explained to CNN that he doesn't smoke marijuana, which he said he'd quit about a year ago "for health reasons," to treat his prostate cancer. He's authored several books including "The I Chong: Meditations from the Joint" about his "family business" specializing in handmade bongs, arrest and nine months in federal prison, according to his and Marin's website. Besides the "Cheech and Chong" films, Chong has appeared in several TV series, such as "That 70's Show."
