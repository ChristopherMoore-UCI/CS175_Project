The Democratic-led Senate ignored that bill for months, but during the lame-duck session -- with Senate Energy Chairwoman Mary Landrieu, D-Louisiana, days away from a runoff election and looking for a way to show her clout -- came up one vote shy of advancing it. Soon-to-be Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, said a measure authorizing construction of the 1,179-mile Canada-to-Texas pipeline will be the first bill he'll schedule for a vote. The Republican-led Senate plans to force a showdown with President Barack Obama over the Keystone XL pipeline as soon as new members take office in January. The President has said he wants the decision left in the hands of the State Department, which is six years into a review of the project and currently holds final authority because the pipeline would cross international borders McConnell said he will allow amendments to the bill, which is sponsored by Sen. John Hoeven, R-North Dakota. Afterward, McConnell shrugged off that vote, pledging that the measure would return -- and fare better -- once new lawmakers took office and Republicans gained control of the Senate.
