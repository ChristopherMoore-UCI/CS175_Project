The speech comes a day after Cameron made headlines by promising the British people a vote on European Union membership if he wins the next general election in 2015. -- Free trade, transparency and a crackdown on tax cheats will be at the heart of Britain's G8 presidency, Prime Minister David Cameron told the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday as he set out his vision for a more competitive Europe. " Cameron said the biggest thing that Britain and America could do together is to work on an EU-U.S. trade deal. He wants Britain to be outward-looking, Cameron said, as he insisted that his referendum promise was "not about turning our backs on Europe" but about making the 27-member bloc work for everyone. Britain's desire to renegotiate the terms of its EU membership is based on the need to gain the consent of the people as they follow a path within Europe, he said.
