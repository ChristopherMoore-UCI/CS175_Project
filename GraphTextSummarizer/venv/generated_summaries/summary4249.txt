The Taliban is claiming responsibility for an attack Friday on a convoy of U.S. Consulate vehicles in northwest Pakistan, saying it was in retaliation for the killing of Osama bin Laden. The car bomb, packed with 50 kilograms (110 pounds) of explosives, detonated as the consulate cars passed by in Peshawar, said Liaqat Ali Khan, the police chief. A car bomb targeted the vehicles in Peshawar, killing one person and wounding 11 others, police said. The blast killed a motorcycle rider passing by, said Ibrar Khan, a Peshawar police official. The blast injured two U.S. government employees, said spokesman Alberto Rodriguez.
