Berry or her employees called police each time, but no one has been arrested, according to LAPD Officer Sarah Faden. It's not unusual for photographers to stake out positions around Berry's Los Angeles home to get shots of the Oscar-winning actress, but investigators don't know what this intruder was trying to do, Faden said. -- An unidentified man twice jumped over a fence and into actress Halle Berry's yard this past weekend, a Los Angeles police spokeswoman said Monday. Police are looking at security camera video for clues to identify the intruder, she said. The same man jumped the same fence at the same time Sunday morning, Faden said.
