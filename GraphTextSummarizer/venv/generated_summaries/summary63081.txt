The al Qaeda statement, translated by the SITE Intelligence Group, follows more than a month of intense factional fighting between the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant with other Islamist groups in northern and eastern Syria.

Alkhouri sees the next stage of this conflict as bringing al-Nusra and groups within the Islamic Front closer, an "emerging sign of powerhouse jihad.
