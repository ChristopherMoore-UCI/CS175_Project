A jury convicted Godinez, 26, on all 17 counts including murder, felony murder, attempted murder and robbery after just four hours of deliberations, according to Sukhdeo. The city's reaction to the murders helped Newark's police department implement policing tactics and technologies, including wireless camera surveillance and audio gunshot detection systems. The lone-survivor of the attack, Natasha Aeriel, spoke last, according to Romesh Sukhdeo, assistant county prosecutor. "Community organizations got together and through local foundations were able to raise money ... and that has enhanced our ability to create public safety in this city in a big way," said Garry McCarthy, Newark police director. Godinez was charged along with five other defendants currently awaiting trial in the August 4, 2007, murders of Terrance Aeriel, Dashon Harvey, and Iofemi Hightower behind the Mt. Vernon Elementary School.
