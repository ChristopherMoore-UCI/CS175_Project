-- A contentious political battle that brought thousands to the state Capitol drew to a close Friday as Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker signed into law a bill that curbs the bargaining rights of most state workers. GOP lawmakers say the bill's passage will help Wisconsin close a $137 million budget shortfall with a plan that requires public workers, with the exception of police and firefighters, to cover more of their retirement plan contributions and health care premiums. Senate Democrats called the bill an attack on worker rights, filing a complaint with the Dane County District Attorney's Office, claiming the Senate's vote violated Wisconsin's Open Meetings Law. The weeks-long standoff reached a fever pitch Thursday after a spokesman for Republican Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald said the leader received two death threats that detailed the ways in which the writer claimed Fitzgerald would be killed. "We were elected to make tough decisions," Walker told reporters, lauding his administration's efforts to prevent employee layoffs and tax increases.
