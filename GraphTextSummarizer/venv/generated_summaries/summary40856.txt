In the case of the California man and nine other plaintiffs, their lawsuit accuses three websites of trying to extort $500 in exchange for removing their names and photographs from sites purporting to list sex offenders, though two of the plaintiffs are no longer listed on a state sex offender registry and another two plaintiffs, both women, have never been arrested or convicted of a sex offense or any crime, their attorney says. " The federal lawsuit represents a legal initiative on behalf of the California Reform Sex Offender Laws organization, a nonprofit that says public sex offender registries and residency restriction laws don't protect children and instead dehumanize individuals and their families. The plaintiffs also cite California's "right of publicity" law, which "says you can't use anybody's name or photograph to help them sell something or solicit something without prior consent," said plaintiff attorney Janice Bellucci of Santa Maria, California. But just as he was removed from the state government registry in January, a website claiming to list sex offenders posted his name and conviction online -- along with a link to photos of the couple, the couple said. They have a one-size-fits-all and ... extreme view that sex offenders are damaged humans who will always re-offend.
