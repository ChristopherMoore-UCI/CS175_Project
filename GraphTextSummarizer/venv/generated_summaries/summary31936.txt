Now when I hear, "You never know who's watching," I realize it means I need to live life by example. When I couldn't pick up a prescription, pay a bill or go to the store for them because it was gym time, I was being self-centered. Trust me when I say weight loss is more mental than it is physical. I ran that fifth mile thinking about mind over matter. Getting fit for the family I love I spent all of 2012 working to become healthy in mind and body.
