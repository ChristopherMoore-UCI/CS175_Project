Opinion: Let's not forget Superstorm Sandy's victims But LIPA customers such as Jonathan Saporta complained about receiving typical bills for electricity use during a month that was anything but typical. The utility had said Monday that it was sending out bills based on customers' estimated usage of the same month last year, because it had reassigned its meter readers to help with power restoration efforts after Sandy. Flagler said the estimated billing this month was a direct response to Sandy, and not the way LIPA typical bills. The announcement came after outraged customers questioned why they were receiving electricity bills post-Sandy that reflected a full month's use of electricity, even though many were without power for days or weeks. LIPA has been widely criticized for its communication with customers in weeks after Sandy.
