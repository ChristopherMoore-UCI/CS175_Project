-- Hundreds of activists at a meeting in Turkey titled "Conference for Change in Syria" issued a declaration Thursday calling on President Bashar al-Assad to step down and hand power to his vice president, with the goal of then organizing democratic elections. " Conference organizers say their main goals are to organize committees aimed at supporting protesters inside Syria, communicating with the media, and lobbying foreign governments. "This conference is a hard message to the Syrian regime," said Omar al Muqdad, a human rights activist from the Syrian town of Dara'a, which has become the symbol of defiance against the al-Assad family, which has ruled Syria for four decades. Tareq Salhab, a dentist who traveled from the coastal Syrian city of Latikiya to Antalya on Thursday, accused anti-regime demonstrators in Syria and the activists in the opposition conference in Turkey of being "terrorists" and "traitors. " "You have to go to Damascus and Homs and Latakiya to see the democracy in Syria," Salhab said, listing Syrian cities.
