A spokesman for the Department of Housing and Urban Development in Washington told CNN that unsalable homes are still a relatively small part of the national inventory of foreclosed properties. " Popik says responses from thousands of real estate agents nationwide to the questionnaires he sends out quarterly indicate that badly damaged foreclosed homes -- so-called "distressed" properties in real estate jargon -- are a much bigger element of the national housing picture than officials in Washington have acknowledged. "About a third of all of the foreclosed properties nationwide have been so damaged, either by the previous owners or by criminal gangs coming in after the foreclosure, that they no longer qualify for standard mortgage financing," Thomas Popik told CNN. In some cities hit harder by the national economic downturn, a quick glance at foreclosed homes paints an even harsher picture. "In many cases, it costs so much to rehabilitate these houses, it's just not cost-effective," he told CNN.
