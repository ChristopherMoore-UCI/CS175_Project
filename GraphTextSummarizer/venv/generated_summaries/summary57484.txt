Terry said he didn't currently see the need for U.S. ground troops in the form of ground controllers for airstrikes or forward deployed operations, but like Joint Chiefs Chairman, Gen. Martin Dempsey, Terry said should the need arise, he would "certainly ask for it." "(ISIS) operationally is probably on the defense to hold what they have gained," Gen. James Terry, commander of Operation Inherent Resolve, told reporters in Kuwait. Combat strikes against ISIS have put the terror group on the defensive, the commander of U.S. military operations against ISIS said Monday. The additional forces will be there to "build partner capacity," meaning training Iraqi security forces and advising and assisting operations. Countries in the region and NATO members will send an additional 1,500 troops to combat ISIS, which Terry called a "threat to region."
