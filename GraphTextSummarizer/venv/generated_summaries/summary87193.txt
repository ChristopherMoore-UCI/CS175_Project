" Jones headed for Hoylake having secured the first leg of his historic quadruple at the home of golf -- St. Andrew's in Scotland -- the week before. The champion golfer of the age -- American Bobby Jones -- won that year's British Open at Hoylake, near the city of Liverpool, as the second leg of an unprecedented grand slam of championships. "Jones was at the height of his fame when he came to Hoylake," explains Pinnington, a former club captain. "The story goes that Jones was sitting next to a chap called Kenneth Stoker, who was captain of the club the year before," Hoylake club historian Joe Pinnington told CNN. It gave Hoylake a unique hat-trick -- the only other amateur golfers to have won prestigious tournament (John Ball in 1890 and Harold Hilton in 1892 and 1897) were also Royal Liverpool members.
