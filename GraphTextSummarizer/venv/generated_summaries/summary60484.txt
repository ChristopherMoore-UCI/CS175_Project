When Kuol fled, many others were also leaving their homes around southern Sudan. Mark Bixler told the story of Kuol Dut and other young men from southern Sudan as the author of "The Lost Boys of Sudan: An American Story of the Refugee Experience." Even a boy of Kuol's age knew that militias and soldiers slaughtered men, women and children in the vast, flat expanse of southern Sudan. He became a U.S. citizen in 2007 and spent three months the next year back in southern Sudan, in that same village of thatch huts that a militia torched so many years earlier. After talking with his mother, Kuol changed his name from Daniel Khoch to Kuol Dut to honor his father and drop the "Daniel" he had adopted in a refugee camp.
