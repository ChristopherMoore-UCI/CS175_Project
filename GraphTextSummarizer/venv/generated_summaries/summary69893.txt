Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years, was found guilty in June of ordering the killing of protesters and was immediately transferred to Tora prison in southern Cairo to serve his life sentence. Essam El-Erian, a senior adviser to Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy, said in January that the government looked forward to a second trial. The 84-year-old has suffered a range of physical problems since he was driven from office in February 2011, following weeks of protests by Egyptians demanding more freedom and reforms. -- Former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, his two sons and his former interior minister will be retried April 13, Egypt's state-run news agency Mena said Sunday. "God willed the retrial would take place under Morsy's rule, with new evidence and new defendants," El-Erian said.
