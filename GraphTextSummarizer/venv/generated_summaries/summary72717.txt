Although my friends on the East Coast like to think they have it easier with more options for public transportation, it's a mistake for people to assume that higher gas prices don't affect them. Look at the polls, and you'll see that one of the major reasons everyday Americans think we need to become more energy self-sufficient and develop a better strategy for importing oil is that they're leery of becoming too dependent on countries in the Middle East that are often unwelcoming, undemocratic and unstable. It also wouldn't hurt to pay more attention to oil reserves in this hemisphere. But if you have a mouth, and occasionally like to fill it with food, high gas prices should be hard to swallow. President Obama was right to say recently that there is little a chief executive can do about gas prices.
