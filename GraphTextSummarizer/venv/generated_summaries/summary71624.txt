Atari was being hit from all sides by a saturated market for arcade games, competition from other companies making games for its famous 2600 console and by a large volume of returns from retailers -- a problem it had never before faced and wasn't prepared to handle. Not so fast, Atari historian Curt Vendel said Monday. " Today's Atari, which still sells games but no longer makes its own platforms, did not respond to a request for comment Sunday. So Atari literally buried the project, dumping truckloads of unsold games in a desert landfill in New Mexico. The original company folded in 1984, and several successive companies have bought the name, Vendel said.
