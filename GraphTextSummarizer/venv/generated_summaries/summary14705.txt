For years, New York drivers have had three minutes to turn off idling engines, and in 2009 the city passed more stringent laws: Drivers now have one minute to turn off their engines if they're adjacent to a school. A 2008 New York City Council oversight committee report said as much, too, stating: "Although idling restrictions have been in place in New York City since 1971, many drivers persist in idling their engines, leading to questions about the effectiveness of our idling law. After passing tougher idling rules, the city initiated a public awareness campaign through GreeNYC to inform drivers and parents of the health dangers, and economic waste, of engine idling.
