In January, Harvey removed Honors as commanding officer of the Enterprise, claiming that the captain demonstrated poor judgement with videos he created on the carrier between 2005 and 2007. -- The Secretary of the Navy issued censure letters Friday to four naval officers for the roles they played in a series of raunchy videos shown aboard the USS Enterprise between 2005 and 2007, a spokesman said. John Dixon, former executive officer of the Enterprise who took over as second-in-command after Honors, also was censured. The letters, which cannot be appealed, effectively end the officers' careers as they will prevent promotion, said Navy spokesman Capt. Letters were also issued to Rear Adms.
