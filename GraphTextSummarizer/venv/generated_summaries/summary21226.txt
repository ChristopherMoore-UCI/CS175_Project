He says he's "never really dealt with bullying issues" in middle school or high school. Carlson emphasized students need to report bullying, and he acknowledged "gay students in our district struggle with bullying and harassment on a daily basis." Damon Fietek, 16, knows that all too well. The Minneapolis School District has taken many steps to address the issue of bullying LGBT students, including training its staff on tracking bullying of these students, injecting LGBT topics into the curriculum, hosting an "Out4Good" LGBT support program, and implementing a bullying prevention curriculum called Second Step. In his adviser role, Fietek says he receives phone calls, texts and Facebook messages several times a week from students who feel like they are at a dead end because of bullying or uncertainty regarding their sexuality. Burroughs says his past is why he believes so passionately in putting an end to bullying, particularly of students who are perceived to be gay.
