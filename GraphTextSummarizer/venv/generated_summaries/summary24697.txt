Starting the day on 456-3, in reply to India's score of 224, England continued to plunder runs at will. Their score of 710 was was England's best for 73 years and their third highest of all-time behind the 903-7 declared against Australia at The Oval in 1938 and 849 against the West Indies at Kingston, Jamaica, in 1930. -- England opener Alastair Cook just missed out on reaching a remarkable triple- hundred as the hosts continued to turn the screw in the third cricket Test against India at Edgbaston on Friday. And England's position became even stronger when Indian opener Virender Sehwag was caught at slip for his second succesive opening ball duck, as the visitors began their second innings in disastrous fashion. And, after passing his second-ever Test double century, Cook looked on course to become only the sixth England batsman in history to reach 300, and first since Graham Gooch -- also against India -- in 1990.
