It prohibits discrimination against disabled people, guaranteeing them equal opportunity in employment, transportation, government services and other areas. -- President Barack Obama commemorated Monday's 20th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act by signing an executive order to increase government employment of disabled people. The executive order signed by Obama calls for strategic planning, mandatory training and other steps to increase federal hiring of people with disabilities. The outdoor commemoration featured a presentation in sign language by actress Marlee Matlin, who starred in the film "Children of a Lesser God," and musical performances by Nathaniel Anthony Ayers, the subject of the film "The Soloist," and Patti LaBelle. The law, which President George H.W. Bush signed July 26, 1990, is credited with smashing barriers and creating opportunities for the disabled in a nation where more than 3 million people 15 and older use wheelchairs.
