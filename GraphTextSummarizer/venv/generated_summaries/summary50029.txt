A feisty Republican who rose up through local politics to the state's highest office, Brewer generated national headlines in recent years for her public opposition to President Barack Obama on border security and immigration reform. -- It's not clear who might try to succeed Jan Brewer as governor of Arizona next year, but chances are good that whoever it is won't be quite as flamboyant. Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer won't seek reelection Just over a year into her tenure, she rose to national prominence by signing SB1070 into law. Arizona law dictates that a governor can't run for more than two consecutive terms, and her time in office before she was elected in 2010 would count as a full four-year term. "First entering public service as a mother concerned about the workings of her local school board, Governor Brewer has served with distinction at every level of state and local government over the last three decades," veteran Republican Sen. John McCain said Wednesday, calling her "a great champion for our state."
