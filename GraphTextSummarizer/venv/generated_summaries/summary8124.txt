Ahmad Wais Afzali, a Muslim cleric and funeral director from the New York borough of Queens, was one of the first people charged in what authorities have described as a plot to detonate bombs on New York subways. Prosecutors say the two 25-year-old U.S. citizens and residents of Queens conspired with Zazi "to attack the New York subway system in mid-September 2009. He said he called Zazi on September 11, 2009, a day after he was contacted by authorities. On Thursday, Afzali told the court that police had asked him to help provide information about Zazi and two other suspects, Adis Medujanian, and Zarein Ahmedzay. Afzali is a native of Afghanistan, but has no idea where he will go upon leaving the United States "I hardly speak my own language," he said.
