In the movie, Cusack played mediocre student Lloyd Dobler, who was smitten with the high school valedictorian, Diane Court (Ione Skye). -- NBC is reportedly considering a TV series follow-up to Cameron Crowe's 1989 classic "Say Anything," but both Crowe and star John Cusack are vocally against the idea. Cusack was just as disturbed by the news of a TV series, tweeting that he knew Crowe would be "repulsed at this horror." On Monday, Deadline reported that NBC had a script commitment in place for a single-camera comedy based on Crowe's landmark coming-of-age story. The movie was both written and directed by Crowe.
