Conduct by people associated with MLB that shows insensitivity to others simply cannot and will not be tolerated," he said. "Children should not be told that they do not belong at a ballpark." McDowell, who has apologized for his behavior, will also be required to undergo sensitivity training, according to the MLB. Roger McDowell is accused of making vulgar, homophobic and threatening comments at a Giants and Braves baseball game on April 23 at the AT&T Park in San Francisco. The commissioner also commended Justin Quinn, a fan who attended the game with his wife and 9-year-old twin daughters and who brought McDowell's behavior to the attention of the public. Major League Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig said in a statement that he hoped the incident would raise awareness of the importance of sensitivity to others.
