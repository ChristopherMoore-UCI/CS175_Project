Editor's note: Robert Menendez is the junior senator from New Jersey and the author of a new book, "Growing American Roots: Why Our Nation Will Thrive As Our Largest Minority Flourishes." Sen. Robert Menendez, D-New Jersey, says that in the U.S., Latinos are no longer on the outside looking in. It means comprehensive health care, elder care and economic opportunity -- the same rights that all Americans want and deserve. Contrary to what may be a popular belief, most Latinos in America today are U.S. citizens. And too many Latinos suffer from a lack of adequate health care.
