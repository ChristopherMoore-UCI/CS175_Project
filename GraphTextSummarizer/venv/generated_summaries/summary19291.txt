A letter from the ADL to Urban Outfitters President and CEO Richard A. Hayne objected to the "insensitive design and the company's periodic use of products within the realm of Holocaust imagery. "Whether intentional or not, this gray and white stripped pattern and pink triangle combination is deeply offensive and should not be mainstreamed into popular culture," said ADL National Director Abraham H. Foxman in the letter. During the Holocaust, gay people were made to wear a pink triangle for identification purposes. The Anti-Defamation League has condemned a product sold in Urban Outfitters stores that it says resembles uniforms prisoners were forced to wear during the Holocaust. The ADL took the retailer to task in 2012 for selling a T-shirt with a star on its pocket, claiming the design looked like the Star of David symbol that Jewish people were made to wear during the Holocaust.
