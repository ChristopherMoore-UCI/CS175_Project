The Obama Environmental Protection Agency, to name just one agency, has proposed regulations that would drive Americans' energy prices through the roof and result in the loss of tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands,of American jobs. This provision has forced countless businesses to cut back on hiring or reduce workers' hours and wages, which has meant fewer jobs and opportunities for American workers. Creating jobs and encouraging economic growth should be bipartisan priorities, and we look forward to working with Democrats on everything from repealing the job-killing medical device tax to approving the job-creating Keystone XL pipeline. This tax has already eliminated thousands of jobs in the medical device industry, and it's on track to eliminate thousands more if it isn't repealed. Given the economic stagnation of the past six years, the last thing our economy needs is a tax that is eliminating thousands of jobs.
