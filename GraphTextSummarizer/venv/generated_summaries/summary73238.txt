I wonder what the picture's going to look like?" recalls famed astronaut Buzz Aldrin. Aldrin had just snapped what he claims is the "first selfie in space. Taken while on the 10th and final Gemini mission -- Gemini 12 -- Aldrin revealed the story behind the selfie to CNN. Meanwhile, almost 50 years on, Aldrin reflects on his other "first" and concedes he took the pioneering pic out of boredom. He's perhaps best known for becoming the second person to walk on the moon, as part of the 1969 Apollo moon landing, but Aldrin unknowingly made history when in 1966, he snapped the "first space selfie."
