Newspapers followed the story, soon identifying Chuang as the woman in the account, which included salacious claims that the pair had liaisons on council time and council premises, including once being caught in flagrante by a security guard in the town hall. The scandal, broken by a blogger and virtually unprecedented in New Zealand politics in its sleaziness, has raised fears it could herald a grubby new era in which the sex lives of politicians, traditionally seen as beyond the purview of the media, become fair game. The council then announced that it was opening an inquiry into the matter to determine whether Brown used council funds in the relationship and whether any aspect of his behavior contravened the council's code of ethics. Brown had stated in his Campbell Live interview that no inappropriate spending of council funds took place. While the Facebook post has been taken down, Chuang expressed similar sentiments in an interview she gave to the New Zealand Herald newspaper.
