The case was one of a large number of lawsuits filed in state and federal courts against the automaker over claims of unintended acceleration in its vehicles. Uno's 2006 Camry was not subject to these recalls, though her family's suit claimed her model was also defective, and that Toyota failed to include a brake override system to guard against sudden and unexpected acceleration. "We are gratified that the jury concluded the design of the 2006 Camry did not contribute to this unfortunate accident, affirming the same conclusion we reached after more than three years of careful investigation -- that there was nothing wrong with the vehicle at issue in this case," Toyota said in a statement posted on its website. -- A California jury on Thursday rejected claims that Toyota was responsible for the death of a woman in a 2009 crash that resulted from a sudden and uncontrollable acceleration of one of its cars. Calling the case a "bellwether," Toyota said it believes the verdict also set a "significant benchmark" that its vehicles are safe with or without a brake override system.
