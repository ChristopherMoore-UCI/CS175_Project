Sealey said that though the family hoped to keep Jahi on life support, hospital representatives had told them Monday that would not be an option. But, he added, "If the patient is brain dead, they are legally dead and, legally, the doctors and the hospital have the right to stop life support -- without the consent of the family." Still, giving them a little time to come to grips with the reality can be helpful, said Curtis, who published a study in 2008 that found that when the withdrawal of life support was delayed, a family's satisfaction with care tended to be higher. Doctors had recommended the tonsillectomy to treat Jahi's sleep apnea, weight gain, inability to concentrate, short attention span and uncontrolled urination, her uncle Omari Sealey told CNN on Monday in a telephone interview. "I don't want her off life support because I really feel like she can wake up," Nailah Winkfield told CNN's Piers Morgan. "Once a death is reported to us, we have a duty and responsibility to immediately proceed to where the body lies, examine the body, make identification, make inquiry into the circumstances, manner, and means of death, and, as circumstances warrant, either order its removal for further investigation or disposition, or release the body to the next of kin," the official said, quoting California law.
