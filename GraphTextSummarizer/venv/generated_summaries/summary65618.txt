It does not want to see Iraq return to a level of death similar to that wrought during active combat. The U.N. on Thursday called out once more to Iraq's political leaders to stop the mayhem. Across Iraq in those months, violence killed 1,818 people, the U.N. said. Sectarian factions bomb and shoot one another on a nearly daily basis, and reports on the violence often fade into the back rows of news coverage, as one month of deadly statistics follows another. "We haven't seen such numbers in more than five years," said Gyorgy Busztin, a spokesman for the U.N. mission in Iraq.
