The gunmen are believe to be Boko Haram fighters who were pushed out of Gamboru-Ngala, Nigeria, in a ground offensive by Chadian and Cameroonian troops, along with fighters from other Boko Haram camps in northeast Nigeria. Boko Haram insurgents killed scores of people Wednesday on the Nigerian-Cameroonian border, slitting throats and shooting victims, residents said. The attackers moved door-to-door slaughtering people in the predawn raid on the town of Fotokol, according to witnesses, and opened fire on at least three mosques, including the central mosque, as worshipers said their morning prayers. Chad's parliament had voted, only two days before the kidnappings, to send troops to Cameroon and Nigeria to join in the fight against Boko Haram. The gunmen also moved along the streets shooting people heading to the mosque, residents said.
