Southern Bali: Bukit Peninsula Good for: surf, seafood and spirituality Bali may be known for beaches and cornrows now, but it was the surfers who first discovered this beautiful Indonesian island. Central Bali Good for: food, unique coffee and natural wonders Bali's famous for the delicacy of babi guling -- suckling pig -- and no place does it quite like Ibu Oka in the centre of Ubud. Lonely Planet: Bali's best spas and chill-out spots From Ubud, hire a driver and head north to Kintamani to see the awe inspiring sight of Gunung Batur, Bali's second highest volcano. In reality, Bali is a lush Indonesian island teeming with cultural experiences, delicious food and exhilarating adventures. Bali may have its fair share of tourists seeking nothing more than seven days of sun, sand and sex in the southern party triad of Kuta, Legian and Seminyak, but this only forms a small part of what's on offer.
