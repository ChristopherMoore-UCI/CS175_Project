Increasing the number and size of these areas will ensure that essential food, water, energy, genetic diversity and climate securities continue to provide for us and future generations. Those decisions can result in trade-offs between the provision of energy, food and water security, and creating and sustaining jobs and livelihoods, promoting economic development and conserving biodiversity and our natural areas all under a stabilized global climate. The outcomes from the Congress can serve as a roadmap towards a more sustainable future; one that has embedded protected areas in the decision-making process for development and has prioritized their role to define and deliver on the world's Sustainable Development Goals. It is our hope that this collective expertise and shared recommendation will provide key insight to the G20 leaders and influence their outcomes to ensure global economic development through a green and sustainable pathway. We believe the answer to these challenges is the inclusion of protected areas and other nature-based solutions as an integral part of our economic and development pathways.
