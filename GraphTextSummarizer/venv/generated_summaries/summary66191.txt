"We plan to employ experts familiar with the '96 Camry and the components that make up car to show that rapid acceleration is to blame for the accident, not Mr. Lee accidentally stepping on the accelerator," he said. "I feel that the boy [Koua Fong Lee] is innocent." Lee's accident is among the first of a growing number of cases getting a second look since Toyota announced a recall, acknowledging that problems with sudden acceleration were more extensive than originally thought. Then, the recalls started, and the complaints sounded just like what happened to Mr. Lee," lawyer Brent Schaefer said. "With Toyota in the news, found reports of other 1996 Camry's [sic] with sudden acceleration so filed this complaint," the incident summary states. -- A man serving eight years for vehicular homicide because of a fatal crash involving his Toyota Camry is hoping for exoneration amid concerns over unintended acceleration in some of Toyota's vehicles.
