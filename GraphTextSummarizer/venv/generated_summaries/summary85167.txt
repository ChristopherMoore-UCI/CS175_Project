Batista sacked as Argentina coach The 56-year-old Sabella was Daniel Passarella's assistant coach with both the Argentina and Uruguay national teams. Sabella, who won four caps for his country as a player that took in spells in England with both Leeds and Sheffield United, takes over the Argentina reins despite a previous agreement to coach UAE club side Al Jazira. Batista, who had replaced Diego Maradona, was sacked after just eight months in charge following Argentina's Copa America quarterfinal exit to Uruguay earlier this month. Argentina have confirmed the appointment of Alejandro Sabella as their new national coach in succession to Sergio Batista. In March 2009, Sabella took his first senior coaching job with Argentine side Estudiantes and just four months later he led them to their first Copa Libertadores title in 39 years.
