Silverman will participate in the 36th annual American Atheists National Convention at the Newark Liberty Renaissance Hotel. What Silverman is doing instead is talking up the "resurgence" among atheists. "Closet atheists are coming out all over the country," Silverman said, estimating that his group has 4,000 members.
