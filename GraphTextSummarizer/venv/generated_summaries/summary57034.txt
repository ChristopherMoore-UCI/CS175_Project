New electronic nose could work just as well as the snouts on man's best friend, say researchers. The electronic nose will be able to identify tiny amounts of explosives in high-traffic, high-risk areas, like airports or shipping terminals, according to researchers. Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology are currently creating a tiny electronic nose made out of a ceramic material that could also detect a range of gases, including hazardous ones like carbon monoxide. The technology behind reproducing human sense will grow even further in coming years. While scientists at Tufts University in Massachusetts are working on a smelling machine that uses strands of dried DNA to identity different scents.
