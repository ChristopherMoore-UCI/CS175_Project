Around 70%-80% of fish sold at Aberdeen fish market already comes from fish farms and aquaculture facilities, mostly around mainland China. Although being close to fished out for years, it was only in January of this year that a five-year ban on trawling in Hong Kong waters came into effect. Making aquaculture environmentally sound is another issue; much of the feed for fish farms comes from live caught "trash fish" -- the price of which has increased in Hong Kong since the trawling ban. Using vast tanks to grow out valuable fish for the restaurant trade, the company has developed a method where the water is recycled and fish feed comes from sustainable sources, not trash fish. Fishing boats unload their catch: still thrashing live fish caught in the South China Sea and more tropical waters further afield.
