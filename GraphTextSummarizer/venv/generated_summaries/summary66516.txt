-- Greenpeace protesters briefly shut down BP stations across London on Tuesday, after the oil company announced its second-quarter results, BP and Greenpeace said. Greenpeace said it simply targeted stations that sell BP gas. Asked about targeting stations that may be owned by individuals or businesses other than BP, Greenpeace spokeswoman Beth Herzfeld said they "don't want to make anybody suffer. They also covered BP signs with posters reading, "Closed: Moving beyond petroleum," a take on BP's slogan. The protests came after BP unveiled a massive $17.15 billion loss in the second quarter due to costs stemming from the Gulf of Mexico oil disaster.
