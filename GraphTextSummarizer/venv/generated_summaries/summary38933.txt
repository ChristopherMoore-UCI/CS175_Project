The pair also took home rap album ("The Heist"), rap performance and rap song (both for "Thrift Shop"). A highlight was a performance of "Get Lucky" featuring Pharrell Williams, Stevie Wonder, Nile Rodgers and song originators Daft Punk, who lurked in a "control room" in their robot helmets. The robot-headed duo won record of the year for the hit "Get Lucky" and album of the year for "Random Access Memories" at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards Sunday night. Williams, who's written such songs as "We've Only Just Begun" and "Evergreen," had struggled to overcome substance abuse problems over the years. Lorde earned the third of the big three awards, song of the year, for "Royals."
