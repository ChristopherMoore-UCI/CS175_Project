The retirement of the world's top-rated racehorse led news bulletins in Australia, with former Australian p Prime Minister Gillard tweeting: "We've never seen anything like Black Caviar before and may never again. A crowd bedecked in Black Caviar's signature salmon pink and black polka dot silks turned out to catch a glimpse of the life-size tribute, which is the work of sculptor Mitch Mitchell. "We are all proud Australians we are all proud Victorian this is a great day for Australia," breeder Rick Jamieson told The Telegraph. " The six-year-old sprinter, worth almost $8 million in prize money, bowed out after claiming her quarter century victory at Sydney's TJ Smith Stakes in April. The statue of Black Caviar, which retired with a perfect 25-0 career record, was unveiled in the animal's birthplace of Nagambie in the state of Victoria as it emerged the horse is set to deliver a living legacy of its own -- the super mare is in foal.
