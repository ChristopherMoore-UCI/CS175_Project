Skin color doesn't define personhood, but since race is a marker of identity in our society, the experience of personhood includes having to deal with the meanings others attribute to racial identity. When white people want to "help" people of color, it always reeks of privilege and entitlement as in, "let me help you with your problems." When white people deny their own embarrassing identity markers, we perpetuate the hypocrisy that only people of color have these problems. Since whiteness has become synonymous with a better life, it is easy for any lighter-skinned person to use skin color as a shield against hurtful stereotypes about social class, gender, sexuality, family history or even mental illness. Many white kids take diversity for granted.
