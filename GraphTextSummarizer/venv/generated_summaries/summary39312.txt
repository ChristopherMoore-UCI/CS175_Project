Under Mujica's leadership, the Broad Front has pushed through reforms legalizing abortion, same-sex marriage and marijuana -- major policy shifts in a region once defined by conservative policies influenced by the Roman Catholic Church. Uruguay's politicians who led the charge to legalize marijuana and same-sex marriage appeared to win another ringing endorsement from voters in the South American country Sunday. Candidate Luis Lacalle Pou of the conservative National Party told supporters Sunday evening that he had conceded to Vazquez and wished him well, as exit polls predicted defeat. "Uruguayans again have said 'yes,' yes to more freedoms and more rights, better democracy and better citizenship," he said in a televised speech Sunday. This year the South American nation became the first in the world to have a system regulating the legal production, sale and consumption of marijuana.
