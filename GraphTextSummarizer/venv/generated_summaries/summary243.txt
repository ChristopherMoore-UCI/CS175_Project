The 47-year-old carded 19-over-par 90 in Friday's second round of the PGA Tour's Valspar Championship, including an octuple-bogey 12 at the 16th hole of the Copperhead course at Innisbrook resort in Florida. Daly won the 1991 PGA Championship in his debut season on the main U.S. circuit, and followed that up with his second major success at the 1995 British Open. However, his off-course problems were reflected in his declining playing fortunes and these days he has to rely on sponsor exemptions to enter PGA Tour events. Daly is still a draw at overseas tournaments, but had trouble at the 2011 Australian Open when he walked off the course after hitting seven balls into water hazards. -- It's not the first time John Daly has had to ask for help -- but it must be one of the most embarrassing.
