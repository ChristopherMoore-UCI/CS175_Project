Leading nations have often used friendly games to blood new talent, work on new tactics and give an opportunity to players to stake their claim for a regular starting place at major tournaments, with multiple substitutions taking place throughout contests. The game's European governing body has stepped up its attempt to bring more prestige to friendly games, creating more opportunities for countries to qualify for the 2020 European Championship finals and the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. While fans across the world wrestled with a potentially exciting concept bereft of any definite detail, UEFA recognized the new venture as a "big step for national teams in Europe. " "We accept and respect that all UEFA member associations have agreed to create a new competition," Wolfgang Niersbach, chairman of UEFA's national teams competition committee, said in a statement. It is also thought that two of Europe's 13 qualifying places for the 2022 World Cup may also be decided via the top two divisions of the Nations League.
