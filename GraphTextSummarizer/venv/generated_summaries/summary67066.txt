"Children have made long journeys in terrifying conditions, often losing their families along the way and arriving at the camps in desperate need of security, health care and a normal life," said Catherine Fitzgibbon, program director of Save the Children in Kenya. Nearly 1,300 people, including children, are arriving daily at the Dadaab refugee camps in northeastern Kenya, according to Save the Children. -- More than 800 Somali children are arriving at crowded refugee camps in Kenya daily after walking for days to escape a prolonged drought, an aid group said this week. Aid groups said the combined problems of drought and conflict have sent food prices skyrocketing. "In Somalia, if we are not able to respond rapidly and effectively to it, there will be many more lives lost," said Mark Bowden, a U.N. humanitarian coordinator in the nation. The drought has left thousands of children in Somalia, Kenya, Ethiopia and Uganda malnourished, and millions others in danger, Save the Children said.
