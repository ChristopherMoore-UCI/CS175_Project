U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Frank Santoro urged Vick, 28, to offer the Eastern District of Virginia Bankruptcy Court another plan for emerging from bankruptcy. The judge's ruling comes a day after Vick's lawyer said the suspended quarterback will go to work for a construction company in Newport News, Virginia, after he leaves federal prison for bankrolling a dogfighting operation. The details emerged in a Chapter 11 confirmation hearing in Virginia Eastern Bankruptcy Court to determine how Vick, 28, will work his way out of bankruptcy. -- A federal bankruptcy judge has denied the Chapter 11 bankruptcy plan presented by suspended NFL quarterback Michael Vick. The decision to reinstate Vick rests with NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, with whom Segal said he had consulted.
