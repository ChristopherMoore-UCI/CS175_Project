"Officer Budimlic clearly and reasonably believed that the use of deadly physical force was necessary to defend himself and Andrea Rebello and, on this basis, made the decision to discharge his weapon." Smith, wearing a hoodie and a black ski mask, invaded the home Rebello shared with her twin sister and two others during the pre-dawn hours of May 17, the report said. The 28-page investigative report, which includes interviews with police officers and civilian witnesses, as well as forensic evidence, was ordered by District Attorney Kathleen M. Rice after Budimlic opened fire and killed both the armed home intruder and the student in May. The intruder, Delton Smith, 30, was fatally shot seven times by Budimlic, according to the report. The police officer who fatally shot a Hofstra University student as she was being held at gunpoint by an intruder has been cleared of any wrongdoing, according to a report released Wednesday by the Nassau County District Attorney's office in New York. The student, Andrea Rebello, 21, whom Smith had in a headlock at the time, was shot once in the head by Budimlic. "Smith ignored numerous commands to drop his weapon and repeated his threats to shoot both Andrea Rebello and Officer Budimlic," the report said.
