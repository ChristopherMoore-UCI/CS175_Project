Before they set hoof onto the snow they have to undergo a change of shoes, a feat made possible by farrier Christian Lampert, who replaces regular shoes with a set containing winter grips and a unique layer of silicone to prevent snow sticking to hooves. On the valley floor stands the frozen lake of St Moritz -- home to an unlikely event of similar vintage -- "White Turf" -- horse racing on snow and ice. Horses for White Turf are brought to St Moritz from all over the world, including Hungary, Italy, France, Germany and the UK. The race card at each meeting features flat racing, winter-style trotting and the local speciality, skijoring -- an awkward combination of horse, human and skis which is a clear crowd favorite. As leader of the St Moritz ski school he can often be found handing out prizes to young skiers.
