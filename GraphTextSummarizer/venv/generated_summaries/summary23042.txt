In a nationally televised address Monday, Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner expressed her sorrow for the loss of her husband, former President Nestor Kirchner, and gave thanks for the outpouring of support that followed. Among youths who sang and marched in memory of Nestor Kirchner, Fernandez said she saw the her husband's face reflected in theirs. Nestor Kirchner, who was president from 2003 to 2007, died last week from an apparent heart attack. She described Nestor Kirchner as her companion for 35 years in life as well as in the ideals they shared. In addition to the great responsibility she feels for governing Argentina, Fernandez said that she now feels compelled "to honor his memory and honor his government, which transformed and changed this country."
