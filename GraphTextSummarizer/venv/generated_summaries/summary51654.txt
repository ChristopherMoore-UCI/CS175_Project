There are lots of studies about the different ways men and women bond, so I find it interesting how the bonding intersects around Super Bowl time. " On the line of scrimmage: Football and politics For advertisers and businesses, Super Bowl Sunday should be a prime time to focus on women. Now, we know that women attended the gladiator fights and chariot races in ancient Rome. Many women are into sports for the same reasons men are: They enjoy the competition. According to Nielsen demographic data, 46% of the Super Bowl viewing audience is female, and more women watch the game than the Oscars, Grammys and Emmys combined.
