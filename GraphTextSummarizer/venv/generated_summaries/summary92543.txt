-- More than six years have passed since Steven Hayes broke into the Cheshire, Connecticut, home of the Petit family, setting off a deadly chain of events that ended in the death of a woman and her two daughters. The two men entered the Petit home, beat and tied up William Petit and forced Jennifer Hawke-Petit to go to a bank and withdraw $15,000. " William Petit, who remarried last year, did not respond to Hayes' comments. I'd never done anything like that," Hayes told the Register during an hour-long interview from prison. And I just snapped." Hayes and Joshua Komisarjevsky have been tried in the case, convicted and sentenced to death.
