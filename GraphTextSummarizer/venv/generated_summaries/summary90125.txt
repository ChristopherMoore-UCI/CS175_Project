Haitian Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive said in an exclusive interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour on Wednesday that after the quake, because of the growing number of orphans, illegal child trafficking is "one of the biggest problems that we have." "There is organ trafficking for children and other persons also, because they need all types of organs," Bellerive said. Steps being taken by the State Department and other organizations, he said, include registration of unaccompanied children, helping "remobilize the Haitian Police's Child Protection Brigades," and "rebuilding the capacity of Haitian [non-governmental organizations] already working to protect child domestic servants, known in Haiti as restaveks." " While UNICEF -- the United Nations' children's fund -- "has taken the lead role in overall child protection and safety in Haiti since the earthquake, we are working to supplement their efforts in combating child trafficking," he said. This poses great risk, and particularly for children, [of] a higher vulnerability to human trafficking," Crowley said. He did not give specifics but when asked whether there is trafficking of children, Bellerive said, "The reports I received say yes."
