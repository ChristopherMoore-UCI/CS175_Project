The report focused on youth ages 15-24 from Brazil, Russia, India, China, Vietnam, Germany, Spain, Italy, the UK and the U.S. Some highlights: In all countries studied, the majority of young mobile users own feature phones (basic phones that don't run apps) -- which isn't surprising, since they indicated that price is the main driver in their purchase decision (except for Russia, where design was ranked as slightly more important). But in terms of mobile Web usage, Chinese youth are leading the way: 73% of young Chinese mobile users access the Web from their phone. In Russia, a whopping 98% of young mobile users have prepaid phone plans; in the U.S., only 19% do. Across all types of phones, China and the U.S. have the most young users who use advanced mobile data services. For U.S. mobile users aged 20-24, 45% are paying their own mobile phone bills.
