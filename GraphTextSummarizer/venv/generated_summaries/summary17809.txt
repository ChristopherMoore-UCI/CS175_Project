Yeah, about five years ago I was auditioning with this body and the attitude of a Latin woman, and it didn't match the stereotype of the Latin women in Hollywood. Not only was she working on a shoot for CoverGirl (she is their new spokesperson), but she also just launched her Sofia Vergara for Kmart fashion line for women of all sizes. I am a Latin woman: I'm voluptuous, I'm loud, I'm exactly what a Latin woman is [laughs]. I don't think there's anything bad in being a Latin woman. And now that I'm almost 40 -- we always have our insecurities as women.
