Fritz Gelowicz appears in court on April 22 in Dusseldorf, northern Germany. It said the intention was to target both U.S. and Uzbek targets, said German Interior Ministry spokesman Christian Sachs. Gelowicz was a leading member of a radical Islamist center in Ulm in southern Germany and was well known to German authorities, officials said. The group said it wanted to target the United States' Ramstein Air Base and other U.S. and Uzbek military and diplomatic installations in Germany, Sachs said. U.S. interests in Germany were among the targets of the plot, Michael Chertoff, who was the U.S. homeland security secretary, said at the time.
