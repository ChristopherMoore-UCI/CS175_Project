The alleged gangster also apparently penned a separate autobiography that was found by authorities at Bulger's Santa Monica, California, apartment after his arrest there, courts documents say. The manuscript was seized at a South Boston home on January 5, 1995, the same day a warrant was issued for Bulger's arrest on racketeering charges. Once one of the FBI's 10 most wanted fugitives, he is currently being held without bail and faces an impending racketeering indictment after authorities tracked him down in June 2011 at his California home. When Bulger went down to check, FBI agents arrested him. It is not clear whether the notorious fugitive, who evaded authorities for 16 years, actually wrote the memoir, but prosecutors say it is part of their investigation.
