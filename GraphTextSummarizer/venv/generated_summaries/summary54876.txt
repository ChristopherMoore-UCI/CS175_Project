Contrary to "war on drugs" critics, drug use and addiction dropped across the country. During my tenure as drug czar, I traveled to more than 120 communities to see firsthand the impact of illegal drugs. As the late, great political scientist James Q. Wilson remarked, "The central problem with legalizing drugs is that it will increase drug consumption" -- and all its inherent harm. People have been deeply hurt by drug related accidents or spent thousands of dollars on drug rehabilitation. It's hardly an exercise in intellectual rigor for those in the middle- and upper-class who live in areas with little crime and violence to be willing to experiment with drug legalization.
