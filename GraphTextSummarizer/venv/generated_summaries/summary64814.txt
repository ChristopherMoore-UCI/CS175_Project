Manufactured sapphire is made by melting down aluminum oxide, the compound that crystallizes into sapphire in nature, allowing it to cool and then cutting it with a diamond-coated wire saw. " Collins noted that Gorilla Glass can be molded into curved designs and multiple shapes without losing its strength, and he questioned whether the same could be said for manufactured sapphire. The MIT report estimates that sapphire would be about three times stronger than Gorilla Glass. "But they'll have to continue to contend with the incumbent technologies -- Gorilla Glass and similar materials offered by other manufacturers." Another alternative would be ultrathin (and less costly) sapphire covers that would fit over glass screens for added durability.
