Galileo Mondol, 17, is one of three high school junior varsity soccer players who authorities allege entered a cabin occupied by freshman students and assaulted three victims at a camp in western Massachusetts. Mondol is being tried as an adult and faces charges that include aggravated rape of a child under 16, indecent assault and battery on a person who has turned 14, assault and battery and intimidation of a witness. The assaults occurred last month at Camp Lenox near Otis, a town in western Massachusetts, according to the Berkshire District Attorney's Office. "I imagine he planned on getting dressed for his first day of school, and instead he had to get arraigned on felony charges," Korman said. At Tuesday's hearing, prosecutors said the three went into the freshman cabin searching for victims, using a broomstick to assault them.
