"It's phenomenal the change we've seen in the past week," said Andy Copeland, whose 24-year-old daughter Aimee was on a ventilator in intensive care at Doctors Hospital in Augusta, Georgia. -- The University of West Georgia graduate student infected with rare "flesh-eating" bacteria has proven to be "amazingly resilient," her father said Wednesday, and a second apparent case has been reported. The bacteria are "remarkably common in the water and in the environment," according to Dr. Buddy Creech, an assistant professor of pediatric infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University. Other than a minor tear that was sewn up and the loss of "a lot of blood" that required a transfusion, Lana Kuykendall's vaginal deliveries of twins Abigail and Ian were uneventful, said her husband, Darren Kuykendall, a 42-year-old firefighter. On Friday morning, "she woke up and she had a big bruise on the back of her leg and it looked like a blood clot," Darren Kuykendall said.
