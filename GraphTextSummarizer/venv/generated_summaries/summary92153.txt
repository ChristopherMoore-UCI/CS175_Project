The nature of the wounds and the bullets in their bodies indicated that the killings were a homicide-suicide, but it is not known whether they were accidental or intentional, said Dr. Gregory Hawker, the Jackson County coroner. "That's crazy to think two young boys are dead, and no one knows anything about it," neighbor Michael Hatley told CNN affiliate WSAZ. The two boys, who were half-brothers, were found Wednesday in Jackson, Ohio, about 75 miles south of Columbus. "Authorities have taken the older boy's computer to make sure there's no indication of ill intent," Hawker said. The gunshot wounds to two Ohio boys found dead in their grandparents' home are consistent with a homicide-suicide, a coroner said Friday.
