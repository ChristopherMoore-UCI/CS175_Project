For all the talk recently about Web security, government snooping and the like, only 3% of respondents said they don't go online because of worries about things like privacy, viruses, spam and hackers. As in earlier Pew studies, it appears that older Americans and those with less education are the least likely to be online. Web usage was also slightly lower among rural Americans and Hispanics. " Less popular, but interesting, reasons included not having a computer (13%), saying Web access is too expensive (6%) and being limited by poor eyesight or another physical disability (4%). Fifteen percent of adults in the United States are not online, for reasons that range from lack of interest to fear of the unknown to not being able to afford a computer, says a new survey.
