Kimberley Prosser of the Brevard County Fire Department said the agency sent two emergency strike teams as a precaution to two communities near the fire, Lake Harney Woods in Volusia County and Blountes Ridge in Brevard County. Winds of 15 mph were forecast Wednesday morning, increasing to 25 mph by evening, Annaleasa Winter, a Division of Forestry spokeswoman, told CNN affiliate WPBF. The fire, which began Monday in northern Brevard and southern Volusia counties, has destroyed a mobile home, several outbuildings and several camp structures, the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services said. The period between October 2010 and February 2011 was the driest period in southern Florida in 80 years, the district said. As of Wednesday, however, "no residences seem to be in immediate danger," said Sterling Ivey, department spokesman.
