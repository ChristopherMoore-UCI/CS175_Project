Still, Dr. Stephen Cina maintained his determination from January: that blood samples taken after Khan's death in July show the 46-year-old died of cyanide poisoning and that the manner of death was homicide. Cina also said Friday that coronary artery disease was a contributing cause to Khan's death, because the autopsy showed one of his major coronary arteries was 75% blocked. No cyanide remained in the exhumed body of Illinois lottery winner Urooj Khan, preventing investigators from determining how the toxin entered his body, the Cook County medical examiner said Friday. But after being prompted by a relative, technicians retested Khan's blood, leading to Cina's cause of death determination in January, more than a week before the body was exhumed. "Since cyanide affects oxygen utilization in the tissues, it follows logically that a natural disease process that already limits blood flow to the heart could render an individual particularly susceptible to death due to this toxin," he said.
