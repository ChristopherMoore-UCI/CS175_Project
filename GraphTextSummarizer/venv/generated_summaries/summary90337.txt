I have seen destroyed buildings and war zones on TV and in the news, but returning here was the first time I had seen such destruction in real life. But actually, everyone was just relieved that there were people outside Syria who still cared. At first you can't believe your eyes, and you have to remind yourself that you are not watching an apocalyptic movie, but real life. Since when was conflict ever associated with fashion? That this is "conflict fashion."
