"Northwestern considers its students who participate in NCAA Division I sports, including those who receive athletic scholarships, to be students, first and foremost," Alan Cubbage, vice president for university relations, said in the statement. Northwestern University will ask the National Labor Relations Board to review its decision allowing football players to unionize, arguing that student-athletes are not university employees but "students, first and foremost." They continue periodically to have ranked basketball teams, but they've given up a certain kind of model of sports," he said, adding that "under certain conditions" the same could happen at other private elite universities that "continue to play big-time sports. He further said that if the players won their fight, private institutions with high academic standards -- he specifically cited Duke and Stanford universities -- could abandon the current mode to preserve academic integrity. " On Wednesday, the board ruled that football players at Northwestern University are employees and can unionize.
