-- China plans to put laboratories in space, collect samples from the moon and prepare to build space stations over the next five years, according to an ambitious plan released this week aimed at putting the country on the global map for space exploration. The spaceship blasted off from a launch facility in the Gobi Desert in northwest China, one month after the first space laboratory module Tiangong-1 was launched into space. Since 2003, China has made major breakthroughs in its space program, including becoming the third country after Russia and the United States to put a human in space. Some experts say a critical gap in Chinese-U.S. space relations is the absence of regularized talks on space security, which took place between Washington and Moscow during the Cold War. "By investing in space exploration, China wants to contribute and be a major player in the world on more than one level."
