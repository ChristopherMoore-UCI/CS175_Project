Ryan O'Neal, Redmond O'Neal and half-sister Tatum O'Neal sat together for an interview on June 25, 2010, the first anniversary of Fawcett's death. -- The son of Farrah Fawcett and Ryan O'Neal was arrested on a drug charge during a traffic stop in Santa Monica, California, on Tuesday morning, police said. On Tuesday, Santa Monica police searched O'Neal's car with his consent and found illegal narcotics, a department spokesman said. Redmond O'Neal, 26, was convicted on two drug offenses two years ago but was released a year ago from a Pasadena, California, sober living facility where he was undergoing court-ordered drug rehab. Redmond O'Neal was on a day pass from the rehab center so he could visit his mother's grave for the first time.
