-- The Fair Labor Association released a report Wednesday that Chinese plants of Foxconn, a major supplier of Apple products, have improved worker conditions. The technology supplier has moved to bring working hours -- including overtime -- down to below 60 hours per week "with the goal of reaching full compliance with the Chinese legal limit of 40 hours per week, plus an average of 9 hours of overtime per week while protecting worker compensation," the FLA said in a news release. "Our hope is that our efforts will not only benefit Foxconn, but that they will also serve as a model for other companies and help improve working conditions for the manufacturing industry throughout China," said Louis Woo, Special Assistant to the CEO, Foxconn Technology Group. Apple became the first electronics company to join the FLA in January, and required independent audits of working conditions at Foxconn and other suppliers. In the past two years, the company has been at the center of a storm of complaints about working conditions for its more than 1.2 million employees in China, especially after a spate of worker suicides.
