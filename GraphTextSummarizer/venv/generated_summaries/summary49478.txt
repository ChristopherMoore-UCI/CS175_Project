Thick smoke rose from the fast-moving fire, which was being fueled by high winds and low humidity, Dunn said, adding he expects the same conditions Sunday. By Saturday evening, the fire had destroyed two structures -- a barn and a chicken coop, Dunn said. -- A fast-moving brush fire near Daytona Beach at one point forced the evacuation of 300 homes and spread to 1,000 acres Saturday, Greg Dunn of the Florida Forest Service said. Firefighters from Volusia and Flagler counties, the state forest service and all city fire departments were working to fight the fire, the Volusia County government website said. Volusia County Animal Control was helping to evacuate horses and other large animals from the area, the county government said.
