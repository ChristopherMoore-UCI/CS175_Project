Fashion designer Jeff Banks will receive a CBE; Frances Marie Corner, the head of the London College of Fashion, will receive an OBE; and MBEs will go to Christopher Bailey, the creative director at Burberry, and Natalie Massenet, the founder of online designer shopping site Net-a-Porter. A large number of artists and others in creative fields are featured on this year's list. Christopher Lee is famous for playing Count Dracula and his roles in "Lord of the Rings" and "Star Wars" films. Honors lists are published twice a year -- once on New Year's Day and once in June, to mark the queen's "official" birthday. Lee, 87, is famous for his portrayal of dark villains, starting with Count Dracula in a series of movies from the late 1950s until the 1970s.
