At the time, she was visiting Ochoa in his family's home, according to CNN affiliate KGO and authorities. " "There are too many instances where terrible crimes can be perpetrated within families over long periods of time and victims, particularly more vulnerable individuals (such a developmentally disabled folks, young people, etc.) are unaware of how to get help or unable to do so," the chief wrote. Ochoa's wife and children, who resided in the house, also lived in fear of Ochoa, authorities told KGO. "In that home, she was basically, through the use of emotional and psychological pressure as well as sexual abuse, forced to participate in horrific acts for an extended period of time," Wagner said in a separate interview with KGO. Ochoa built a shed in his backyard where most of the sexual abuse occurred, but it has since been torn down, authorities told the news outlet.
