Since the election, opposition and church groups have reported kidnappings, torture and other violence, including the deaths of opposition party members. Two U.S. Embassy cars and a British Embassy vehicle were going to check on reports of recent violence when they were stopped, McGee said. -- U.S. and British diplomats are safe after Zimbabwe police, soldiers and "war veterans" stopped their convoy Thursday and threatened to burn them alive, U.S. officials said. U.S. Ambassador James McGee visits a reported victim of political violence at a Harare clinic this month. "I feel compelled, as a supporter of human rights, to speak out about the atrocities being committed across Zimbabwe," McGee wrote, saying the U.S. had received more than 700 reports of violence.
