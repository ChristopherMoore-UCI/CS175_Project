"I think he was just thinking that a lot of them just might work in the context of a new Cars album." Ocasek stayed busy in the interim years, recording six solo projects and producing albums by a variety of artists, including Weezer, Guided by Voices and Bad Religion. In addition to Hawkes and Ocasek, the other original members are Elliot Easton on guitar and drummer David Robinson. "The Internet has made it so that a lot of bands are kind of making it on their own through their use of the Internet, without a traditional record company," Hawkes said. The Cars enlisted producer Garret "Jacknife" Lee for the project, who like Ocasek had worked with Weezer, to get the band motoring again. The result is 10 new Cars songs, half produced by Lee and the rest by the band.
