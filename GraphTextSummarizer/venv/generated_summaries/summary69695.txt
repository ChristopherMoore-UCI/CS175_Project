" Driving wheelchairs A new kind of wheelchair allows people who cannot use their hands and feet to steer using simple tongue movements. A 43-year-old man who lost his jaws and tongue after a cancer battle 11 years ago received a transplant for the bottom third of his face, according to the Hospital La Fe in Valencia, Spain. "The tongue is always moving, but the technology is smart enough to tell the difference between natural movements and the tongue movements [meant to steer the wheelchair]," Ghovanloo said. E-tongue senses sweet Scientists at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign developed a handheld device the size of a business card, which can taste the sweetness in food and drinks. Aside from everyday functions of chewing, swallowing, talking and tasting, the tongue has new uses such as steering wheelchairs and helping blind people see.
