The suit was originally brought by the Natural Resources Defense Council, which argued that the FDA has allowed livestock producers to use popular antibiotics penicillin and tetracycline in feed for more than 30 years for purposes other than treatment of illnesses. In subsequent years, new medical evidence suggested that treating livestock with antibiotics increased risks to human health. At the time, the FDA found the practice of using antibiotics for non-medical reasons unsafe. If drug manufacturers fail to show that using the antibiotics in livestock is safe, the FDA commissioner must issue a withdrawal order. In 1977, the FDA announced plans to withdraw approval of some antibiotics used in livestock feed.
