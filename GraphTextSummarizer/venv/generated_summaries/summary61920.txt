Certainly, black conservatives are right to differ with black liberals about how racism impacts black advancement today. Unfortunately, such trash talk -- popular among many black conservatives -- continues to alienate black Republicans from the African-American community. If black conservatives really want to make black conservatism a serious force in the black community, they have to drop their "just get over it" philosophy about racism and its lingering effects, stand up to the GOP when it does something wrong, and come up with a real urban agenda. Rooted in black nationalism and the self-help belief system of Malcolm X, it insisted that the black community be at the forefront of solving black problems. It was policy- and solutions-oriented, focusing on things like rebuilding the black family, black entrepreneurship, starting and supporting black businesses in poor neighborhoods, enterprise zones, housing vouchers, micro-lending, repealing Davis Bacon (a prevailing wage law that unfairly prevented unskilled, often black, workers from gaining apprenticeships on federally funded construction jobs), and starting Christian schools.
