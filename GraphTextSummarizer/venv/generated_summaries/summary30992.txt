Supong said the government did not have enough resources to deal with floodwaters, noting that officials had recently asked the private sector for water pumps to help drain water out of Bangkok. Water quality in some areas is also being affected, according to Bangkok resident Anisha Prachaseri, while other newer dangers are presenting themselves. Indeed, Bangkok residents have plenty to be anxious about. In a nation that, according to the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration, produces 8,000 tons of garbage a day during normal times, Bangkok residents are dealing with massive piles of trash stacking up around the flood-stricken city. "People have been buying many more bottles of water than normal as there's a problem with tap water, which has been contaminated with floodwaters after it leaked into the pipes," she said.
