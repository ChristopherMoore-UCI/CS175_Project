-- An early morning fire at a poultry processing plant in northeast China killed at least 119 people Monday, state-run Xinhua news agency said. "The complicated interior structure of the prefabricated house in which the fire broke out and the narrow exits have added difficulties to the rescue work, sources with rescue forces said," the Xinhua report said. More than 300 workers were inside the plant in Jilin province when the fire broke out about 6 a.m., Xinhua said. About 100 of them were able to escape -- and told Xinhua that the gates to the plant were locked. CNN's Dayu Zhang reported from Beijing and Zarifmo Aslamshoyeva from Atlanta
