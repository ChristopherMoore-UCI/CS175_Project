One MWC exhibitor GENBAND, a U.S.-based company that provides technology which can be used to create remote working environments, said Yahoo's move was understandable, but the problems it faces could be overcome with better technology. "When people come into the office you don't want people just sitting there heads down knocking out their emails, because they can do that from a caf√© or a home office or remote office. At the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, one of the planet's biggest showcases of new digital technology, numerous manufacturers are touting gadgets and software specifically aimed at keeping workers out of the office and either on the road or at home. Cisco, another MWC exhibitor whose products are directly aimed at creating remote working environments, insisted its technology was capable of recreating every aspect of real-life interaction short of physical contact. Yahoo has declined to comment but the memo, obtained by tech blog All Things D, said the move was necessary as "to become the absolute best place to work, communication and collaboration will be important, so we need to be working side-by-side."
