I've heard of it on the outside, people walking outside, but I've never heard of anyone being struck by lightning while grocery shopping," he told CNN affiliate WWL. About three weeks earlier, some two miles from the store where Brooks was hurt, another lightning strike hit Mona Billiot while she was cooking dinner in her kitchen. But that advice didn't work for two women in the same Louisiana city who were hurt in lightning incidents about three weeks apart -- one in a grocery store and another in her home. Doctors ran tests on both Brooks and Billiot and say they will be OK. In 2012, lightning strikes caused 28 deaths and 139 injuries in the United States, according to the National Weather Service.
