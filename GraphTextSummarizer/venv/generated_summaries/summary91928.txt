Six ocean kayakers will switch off paddling kayaks mere inches from Nyad's side throughout the journey, towing underneath them electronic Shark Shields that emit a harmless but annoying electrical impulse that repels most species of sharks. "There's no getting around the fact that we're in an ocean here where some dangerous species of shark swim," she said at the news conference. Nyad is determined to swim from Cuba to Florida. Nyad in good spirits in 18th hour Nyad announced Sunday morning at a Havana news conference that she planned to enter the water at Havana's Marina Hemingway to begin her attempt. At 7:45 p.m. ET Sunday she jumped into the water and began her 103-mile swim between Cuba and Florida.
