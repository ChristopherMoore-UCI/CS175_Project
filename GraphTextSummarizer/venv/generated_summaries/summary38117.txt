" Sharaf's new cabinet also includes Mohamed Kamel Omar in place of Mohamed Orabi as foreign minister; Amre Helmi as health minister; and Abdelfattah al-Banna, as minister of antiquities. The names of the new appointees were leaked to the state-owned al-Ahram newspapaer Monday hours before they are expected to take the oath of office in front of Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, head of the military council that took control of the country after President Hosni Mubarak was ousted on February 11. Mubarak is due to appear in court on August 3 to face charges of abuse of power and killing protesters. The 83-year-old ex-ruler fell into a coma around noon Sunday, Mubarak lawyer Farid El Deeb told CNN. By Sunday evening, he had regained consciousness, said Mohamed Fathalla, the head of the Sharm el-Sheikh facility where Mubarak is recuperating.
