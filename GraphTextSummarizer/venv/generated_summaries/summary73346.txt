" And while the Best Film Editing award may mean more to a handful of old Hollywood hands sitting in darkened editing booths than it does to those watching on E! news, the occasion is undiminished for Cassidy. While the major categories generally hog the limelight -- and his "American Hustle" colleagues are up for the big ones including all four major acting categories, Best Director and Best Picture -- he says that the technical categories are far from unsung these days. Cassidy is in the running for the Best Film Editing Oscar, alongside his colleagues Crispin Struthers and Alan Baumgarten, for their work on David O. Russell's "American Hustle." " He says that the peer recognition is important, and while it "remains to be seen" what a win would do for his career options, the recognition from the Academy means that he is afforded more choice in what he makes. "You're nominated by the members of your branch (of the Academy), so there's maybe 300 other editors in Hollywood and around the world who ... nominate the five nominees each year so it's a huge honor -- it's your direct peer group.
