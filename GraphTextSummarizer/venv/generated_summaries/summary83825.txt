He joined the mission to protest the rig owned by Russian company Gazprom because he firmly believed oil companies had to be stopped from drilling for fossil fuels in the Arctic. The exit visa will put an end to Hewetson's chilling saga that began in September in the icy waters surrounding an Arctic oil rig. Russian paratroopers stormed the Greenpeace ship. At 10 Friday morning, the Russians will give Frank Hewetson the best holiday gift of all: a stamp in his British passport that will allow the Greenpeace activist to leave the country and return home to his family.
