On Sunday, undercover police detectives in the Bronx, New York, responded to the Craigslist post, which referred to the heroin as "stamps, diesel, H train, dope, bundles, tickets, dog food." Kathryn Kalikow, 27, and Brian Whelan, 28, were charged Monday with possession of drugs with intent to sell after allegedly advertising the drugs on Craigslist as "high quality diesel pain relief." On Monday evening, just after the arraignment, Whelan's family admitted him voluntarily to a drug rehabilitation facility, Whelan's attorney, Marvin Ray Raskin, said Tuesday. -- The daughter of Peter Kalikow, the former owner of the New York Post, has been arrested after allegedly trying to sell 30 bags of heroin, court documents show. Her father purchased the New York Post in 1988 and sold it in 1993, and was the chairman of New York's Metropolitan Transportation Authority from 2001 to 2007.
