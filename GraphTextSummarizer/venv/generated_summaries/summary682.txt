Two of the four suspects -- Tabari Young, 22, and Bryon Champ, 21 -- fired shots in the incident, Chicago police said. Chicago officials have said homicides this year are below the 2012 pace. The FBI's annual crime report last week showed Chicago had 500 homicides in 2012, up from 431 in 2011 and more than any other American city. In all, 13 people were shot Thursday at the Back of the Yards neighborhood on Chicago's South Side. "Our officers and our detectives have worked tirelessly in partnership with the community, to solve this case and hold the criminals who committed this senseless act of violence responsible for their actions," Chicago Police Superintendent Garry F. McCarthy said in a statement.
