The "Rock of Ages" movie soundtrack, which debuted at No. 15 on the Billboard 200, and No. 1 on the Soundtrack chart, will likely have a better week after the film opens, said Phil Gallo, a senior correspondent at Billboard. It's scenes like this one, which opens Adam Shankman's new film "Rock of Ages," based on the rock opera of the same name, that have audiences split on movie musicals. Boasting names like Tom Cruise and Catherine Zeta-Jones, nostalgic rock anthems and '80s flair, "Rock of Ages" will prevail if audiences are in on the joke, said Robert Viagas, the founding editor of Playbill.com. " In other words, the fact that the actors in "Rock of Ages" are constantly reacting to musical numbers could work in the film's favor. Most of the musicals that have done well at the box office of late have used a mix of dialogue and music to move a story along, much like "Rock of Ages."
