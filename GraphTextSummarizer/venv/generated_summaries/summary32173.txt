It sounds crazy, but the way late folk artist Howard Finster told the story, the mysterious face said, "Paint sacred art; paint sacred art. "When most people are winding down, he was winding up," said Jordan Poole, executive director of Paradise Garden, a 4-acre property teeming with Finster's creations, about 90 miles northwest of Atlanta. Paradise Garden is located about 90 miles northwest of Atlanta in unincorporated Pennville, Georgia. Although Finster still spent a lot of time at the garden, it didn't get as much attention after the couple moved, Poole said, and deteriorated after Finster's death in 2001. He's also the star of the documentary "Paradise Garden: Howard Finster's Legacy," released this year by Art West Film.
