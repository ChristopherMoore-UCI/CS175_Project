New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said last week that Aron told authorities he was sorry for the trouble he has caused. According to Kelly, police showed up at Aron's third-floor attic apartment at 2:40 a.m. July 13 and asked him about Kletzky's whereabouts. -- A grand jury indicted Levi Aron on Wednesday as authorities revealed new details about the death of the 8-year-old Brooklyn boy he is accused of kidnapping and killing last week. Surveillance video showed Aron entering a dentist's office while Kletzky waited for him across the street for seven minutes, Kelly said. Aron claims he took Kletzky to a wedding July 11 in Monsey, New York, and then brought him back, Kelly said.
