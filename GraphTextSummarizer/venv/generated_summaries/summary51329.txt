In a country renowned for its fondness for romance, smoking has never quite shaken off its romantic associations with smoky Left Bank cafes and waifish Parisienne beauties clutching on a Gauloises. France is extending its ban on smoking to include bars, discotheques, restaurants, hotels, casinos, as well as its fabled cafes. From January 1 it will be illegal in France to smoke in cafes as well as clubs, casinos and hotels. France has lagged behind many of its European neighbors in bringing in legislation to curb smoking in public places. The new restrictions will only apply to the inside of premises, meaning smokers are still free to light up on the terraces.
