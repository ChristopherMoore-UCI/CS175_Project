Members of parliament will now decide on the criteria and conditions of the new members that they will elect accordingly," said Ashour. "Parliament will discuss tomorrow the new process of choosing the 100-Egyptians who will write the country's most important guide to governance so they must be careful in their choices and it must include constitutional lawyers and experts this time around," Ashour told CNN. Egyptians took to the streets for weeks protesting last month's choice of the former panel fearing that Islamists would draft a constitution that follows strict Islamic rules. The move stalls Egypt's attempt to rebuild after the revolt that toppled longtime strongman Hosni Mubarak last year. The court order stated that parliament must elect 100 "qualified" people from outside the parliament to write the constitution.
