Perhaps the answer lies not in trying to make more Americans serve but in enabling more veterans to serve in new ways when they come home. The question for civilians is how to create more channels for people like Garcia to continue being contributors and leaders in public service -- not as pilots or infantry commanders but as candidates for office or school principals or heads of nonprofits. We support organizations like The Mission Continues and Team Rubicon that plug veterans into community service. We foster relationships between veterans and civilians. If we truly want to thank veterans for their service, let's make sure each one who returns from war is empowered to be an integrated, vital part of their community's social fabric and civic life.
