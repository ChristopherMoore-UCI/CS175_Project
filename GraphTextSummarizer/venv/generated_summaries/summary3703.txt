The National Health and Family Planning Commission announced two more fatalities Tuesday afternoon -- one in Anhui province and the other in Jiangsu province. The virus had been found in pigeons but had not previously been discovered in humans until a series of cases were reported in China last week. The Chinese health agency also said Tuesday that there are no reported cases of human-to-human transmission. "Although we do not know the source of the infection, at this time there is no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission," said the WHO's Michael O'Leary. Meanwhile, Chinese Vice Premier Liu Yandong called for further efforts to prevent the spread of H7N9 infections and the treatment of patients after visiting the country's disease control center on Monday, Xinhua reported.
