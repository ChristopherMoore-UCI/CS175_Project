The cuddlier side of business: More MBAs are taking in environmental factors. Stanford, which offers MBA students more than 30 elective courses on subjects such as ethics, social responsibility and the environment, says it views the leadership of an organization as "a noble and critical pursuit". Perhaps unexpectedly, the research shows that such courses are not inevitably housed within a dedicated department of ethics or corporate social responsibility. "What we're seeing at Duke, and we're seeing this probably everywhere, is the business community now has reached a point where they recognize that to be globally competitive, you have to have an understanding of the risks and the opportunities that natural environments pose for firms," says Michael Lenox, associate professor of business. The many league tables which rank MBA programs vary in their methodology, but mainly share a few assumptions, including that a prime mark of quality is a stream of graduates entering highly-paid jobs in financial services and consulting.
