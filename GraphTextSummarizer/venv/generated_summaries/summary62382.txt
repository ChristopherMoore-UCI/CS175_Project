Like police, members of Anonymous are also reluctant to speak publicly, both for their own security and because it runs counter to their deeply held belief that the positions held by the collective, expressed through the rolling democracy of the Internet, are far more important than the opinions of any individual anon, or person who participates in Anonymous activities. From New York to Oakland, California, cops had their Web sites hacked; personal information, including the home addresses of specific police officers, was posted online; and officers who used pepper spray on Occupy protesters, including NYPD Deputy Inspector Anthony Bologna and Lt. John Pike at the University of California-Davis, saw their entire life histories blasted out in Web videos and document dumps. The list of police officers and agencies targeted by Anonymous is long. " Anonymous is also the subject of several federal and state investigations, including one by the commonwealth of Massachusetts, which issued subpoenas to Twitter in an investigation of threats directed against Boston police after the department's website was hacked. "I think [police] see it as a form of vigilantism," said professor Gabriella Coleman, an anthropologist who studies Anonymous at McGill University in Montreal, Quebec.
