"" Li Na: China's tennis rebel is people's idol Li had lost in her only other grand slam final appearance, when she also made history by reaching the title match at January's Australian Open, but this time she showed none of the nerves on display in that defeat by Kim Clijsters. -- China's Li Na became the first Asian tennis player to win a grand slam singles title as she defeated defending champion Francesca Schiavone in the final of the French Open on Saturday. The second seeds, who have won 10 grand slam crowns between them with other doubles partners, triumphed 7-6 (7-3) 3-6 6-4 win over Colombia's Juan Sebastian Cabal and Eduardo Schwank of Argentina. I think it's also important for them to know clay courts over there -- I think they just have hard courts. Schiavone had big support in the crowd at Roland Garros after beating home hope Marion Bartoli in the semifinals, but Li -- who earlier eliminated favorites Maria Sharapova and Victoria Azarenka -- powered through the tie-break without conceding a point.
