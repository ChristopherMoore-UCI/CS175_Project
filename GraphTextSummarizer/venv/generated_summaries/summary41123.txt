A Web site developed this year that allows students to share old exams online is causing debate among professors about its ethical implications. "Most teachers give out practice exams and old exams anyway," she said. PostYourTest.com is an educational tool that lets students anonymously upload materials and tests from their previous and current classes, said Demir Oral, creator of the site. She said the site might be OK only if students get permission from their teachers to post exams online. "I know that some teachers reuse past exams and it would be hard to have to write a new test for every class." However, Mary Bojan, professor of chemistry at PSU, said she wouldn't mind if students posted her tests online.
