Now we're going way back: Blockbuster was normally pretty decent about staying on top of this, but we can't do a post on video store gripes without mentioning those VCR tapes that were not rewound. These first few entries listed could be said about video stores in general. It's called Blockbuster Video for a reason, film geek. But once Blockbuster Video conquered the known video rental world, Blockbuster Video was "the video store." During its heyday, Blockbuster had Disney-style clean-cut rules for its employees, who also had to wear pretty dorky uniforms (rather than dress like, you know, normal people, like at indie video and record stores).
