Meanwhile, the White House has invited families of sailors who died in the Cole bombing to meet with Obama on Friday. According to the White House schedule for Friday, Obama will meet privately with families of the Cole attack and also with families of victims of the 9/11 attacks. On his first day in office, Obama ordered the halt, requiring prosecutors to seek delays in the 14 active cases before military commissions there. A number of the families were called Thursday afternoon, according to Andrew Hall, the lawyer who represented families.
