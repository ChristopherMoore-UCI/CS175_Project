In the aggregate, however, because opium cultivation far exceeds cannabis cultivation, in 2009 the value of cannabis resin production in Afghanistan was estimated at between US $39-94 million, about 10-20 percent of the farmgate value of opium production. "The gross income per hectare of cannabis (US $3,900) is higher than from opium (US$ 3,600). "As a result, the net income of a hectare of cannabis is US $3,341 compared to US $2,005 per hectare of opium. "While other countries have even larger cannabis cultivation, the astonishing yield of the Afghan cannabis crop -- 145 kilograms per hectare of hashish, the resin produced from cannabis, as compared to around 40 kilograms per hectare in Morocco -- makes Afghanistan the world's biggest producer of hashish, estimated at between 1,500 and 3,500 tons a year," said Antonio Maria Costa, UNODC's executive director, in a report issued at the agency's headquarters in Vienna, Austria. As with opium, the bottom line is to improve security and development in drug-producing regions in order to wean farmers off of illicit crops and into sustainable, licit livelihoods, and to deny insurgents another source of illicit income."
