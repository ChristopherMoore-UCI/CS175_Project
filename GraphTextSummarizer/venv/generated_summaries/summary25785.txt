The 1943 Stearman, a popular training aircraft during the war, was one of nine flying to Reagan National from Virginia's Manassas Regional Airport to help promote the movie "Legends of Flight," a film meant to provide a window into "a century of aviation trial and error," according to its Web site. "It looked like (Michael) was up on the main gear, and then the nose went down and the tail went up," said pilot Dave Brown, who was directly behind Truschel's aircraft. "I sidestepped (Truschel) and landed right behind him," Brown told CNN. Brown told CNN that "by the time it happened, (Truschel) was going really slowly, so when it flipped over on its nose it just went on over on its top wing." Brown said there was damage to the tail, a wing and the prop of Truschel's plane.
