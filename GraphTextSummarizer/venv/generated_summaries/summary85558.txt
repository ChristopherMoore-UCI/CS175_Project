Typhoon Nanmadol pounded Taiwan with heavy rains Monday before it was downgraded to a tropical storm and headed toward China. The storm made landfall in the southern portion of Taiwan about 3 a.m. Monday, dousing some areas with up to 300 mm (11 inches) of rain, officials said. By Monday, the death toll in the Philippines had climbed to 12. Among them were two children who died when Nanmadol, known locally as Mina, triggered a landslide in northern Philippines on Saturday, authorities said. Ten others were killed in different incidents, 21 people were injured, and nine remain missing, the council said in a statement Monday.
