Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid made a procedural move Friday that would set up a vote on final passage in the Senate no later than Monday. Senate lawmakers wanted votes on amendments that would address those issues. The Senate is expected to vote Monday on the $1.1 trillion package, which has already passed the House, Sens. Mitch McConnell and Barbara Mikulski said late Friday. Amendment votes could have been risky because if either measure passed, the spending bill would have to go back to the House to be voted on again. Reid tried to get unanimous consent for an adjournment until Monday when there would be enough votes to end the filibuster, but Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, objected because Reid would not guarantee a vote on an amendment dealing with immigration funding.
