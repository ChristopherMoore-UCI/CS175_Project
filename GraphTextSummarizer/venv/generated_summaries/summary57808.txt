Afghan officials have insisted the raids be conducted in compliance with Afghan law. And special operations forces will operate under Afghan law, said a statement from the presidential palace. U.S. special forces will be on the ground in all special operations, but they will not enter the home of an Afghan unless specifically asked to do so by the Afghan commandos leading the operation, or by other Afghan officials, the senior NATO official added. -- The United States and Afghanistan signed a landmark deal Sunday that affords Afghan authorities an effective veto over controversial special operations raids. A senior Afghan official with sight of the agreement said the search of "residential houses or private compounds" can now only be conducted by Afghan special forces.
