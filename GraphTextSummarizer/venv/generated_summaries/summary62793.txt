It might have something to do with the call I made this week to an ICE representative to ask about the case or the story that the Spanish-language television network NBC-Telemundo did on Barrientos or the fact that New Jersey Sen. Robert Menendez took an interest in the fate of a woman who has resided in Newark for nearly 20 years or the fact that, according to Johnson, there may even be a congressional inquiry into whether Barrientos should have been taken into custody in the first place. The "Morton memo" is a June 17 in-house memorandum (PDF) from ICE Director John Morton to all field office directors, field agents and chief counsel. I have three theories as to what's going on here: The memorandum was written by Morton, or people above him, in a deliberately vague manner to allow local agents to skirt it and continue to rack up deportations; there is massive insubordination within ICE at the local level; or this was a political stunt intended to con Latinos into thinking the Obama administration is being more compassionate and lenient in deportations when really nothing has changed. They include the length of time the person has lived in the United States, whether the person was brought as a child, whether the person is pursuing an education, whether the person has a criminal record, whether the person or immediate relative served in the U.S. military, whether the person has a spouse, child or parent who is a U.S. citizen or permanent resident, and other circumstances. But that doesn't explain why an agency that, for weeks, didn't return the calls of Barrientos' lawyer, Bryan Johnson, suddenly became much more accommodating.
