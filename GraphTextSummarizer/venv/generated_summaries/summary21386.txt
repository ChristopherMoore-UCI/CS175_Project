The latest threat to close the Strait, according to experts and U.S. administration officials, appears to be an attempt by Iran to intimidate the U.S., and specifically President Barack Obama, not to proceed with tough new sanctions that could target Iran's oil industry and its oil exports as well as companies that do business with Iran's Central Bank. Many experts say Iran would only have limited success in blocking the Strait for an extended period of time as many governments maintain a naval presence in the region, notably the United States. I think any U.S. president would be forced to respond to that and to open the Strait; that would also mean military action against Iran so an Iranian attempt to close the straits could mean war." Shutting off the Strait would be disastrous for the world economy, causing oil prices to skyrocket. Why Strait of Hormuz matters Iran attacked ships in the Gulf during the 1980s in an attempt to cut off Iraq's oil exports when those two countries were at war.
