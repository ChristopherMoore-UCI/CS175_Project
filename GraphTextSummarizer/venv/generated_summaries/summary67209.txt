-- British officials Saturday warned of terror threats in Kenya as the east African nation battles Islamist militants in neighboring Somalia. The terror group has threatened Kenya with retaliatory attacks, saying it considers the forces' incursion an affront to Somalia's sovereignty. The U.S. warning came after Kenya sent troops across the border into Somalia to pursue Islamist Al-Shabaab militants. A spokeswoman for the U.S. embassy in Nairobi said Saturday that it had not changed its travel advice, which urges U.S. citizens already in Kenya and those thinking of traveling there to "evaluate their personal security situation in light of continuing and recently heightened threats from terrorism and the high rate of violent crime in some areas. "Kenyan authorities have alerted the public to a heightened threat from terrorist attacks in Nairobi.
