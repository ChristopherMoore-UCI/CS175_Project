In the U.S. an increase in credit card debt again pushed up outstanding U.S. consumer debt in July by $7.5 billion, the Federal Reserve reported last Monday. U.S. consumers are defaulting on credit card payments at a significantly higher rate than last year, "raising the prospect of problems in the stricken U.S. subprime mortgage market spreading to other types of consumer debt," according to the Financial Times this week. Simply put, we have developed a habit for credit cards that we can't afford, with people becoming adrift from old notions of delayed gratification: You save first before you purchase. We use credit cards for computers, the latest gadgets such as iPods, holidays and fashion, all the things many of us now deem as essential. Consumer credit outstanding rose to $2.46 trillion in July, up from a revised $2.45 trillion in June, the Federal Reserve said.
