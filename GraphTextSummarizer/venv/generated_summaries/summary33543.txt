You can fly to New Zealand, where the Hobbit premieres on Wednesday, on a Hobbit-branded plane -- complete with a Hobbit-inspired safety video with Peter Jackson, telling you how to keep safe, if the flight approaches its own Mount Doom. Will the movie receive critical acclaim -- or Jar Jar Binks reception? New Zealand's taxpayers have been helping subsidize 14%, or US$82M, of the films (which cost close to NZ$700M, or US$575M). On the short ride into the city you'll see the Hobbit-themed flags fluttering in Wellington's persistent wind before a giant Gandalf hovers into view. Many more Kiwis will be waiting by the red carpet, hoping for their own little bit of movie tinsel.
