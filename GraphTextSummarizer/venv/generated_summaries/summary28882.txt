"The male that turned himself in ... has been deemed the shooter based on the investigation thus far," said Philadelphia police Lt. John Stanford. On Saturday, police said school security officials provided inaccurate information about the teen who was cleared and released. He faces aggravated assault, violation of Pennsylvania's Uniform Firearms Act, recklessly endangering another person, having a weapon on school property "and other related charges," according to the police spokesman. A 17-year-old male was charged Saturday as an adult with aggravated assault and other charges over a shooting the previous day at a Philadelphia high school, police said. Police searched for the weapon late Friday in trash cans, along railroad tracks and other spots around a nearby major urban transit station, transit spokesman Andrew Busch said.
