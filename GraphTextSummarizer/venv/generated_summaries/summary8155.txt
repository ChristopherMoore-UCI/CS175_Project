In February major Hollywood studios stopped distributing films to Indonesia, after the government said it would impose a new royalty tax on imported movies. Syamsul Lusa, director of film at the Ministry of Tourism and Culture, says the absence of marquee films in Indonesia has taken its toll on local cinemas, citing a decrease in business of roughly 30% to 40% over the last four months. Pesik says "the real problem is fair business practice in movie distribution". But cinema owners say the long wait is now over, with monster hit "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2" releasing on Friday. Movie fans are sure to pack theaters when the final Harry Potter installment releases on Friday.
