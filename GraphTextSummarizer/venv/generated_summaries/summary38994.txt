A day after seeing Santa Claus at a mall, young Christopher Milke asked his mother if he could go again. "Ms. Milke was found to have arranged the killing of her own son, a four-year-old toddler, because he was too much of a burden and interfering with her life," Horne said in a written statement. A jury convicted Milke of murder, conspiracy to commit murder, child abuse and kidnapping on October 12, 1990, less than a year after her 4-year-old son was found dead. -- Arizona will appeal a judge's decision to overturn the murder conviction and death sentence of Debra Milke, the state's attorney general announced Friday. That was the plan, she said, when the boy got into the car with Milke's roommate, James Styers.
