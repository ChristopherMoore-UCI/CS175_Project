Then, just weeks before Corby's trial ended, Australian Federal Police and Qantas, the airline Corby used to fly to Bali, announced they had been investigating the role of some baggage handlers in a long running cocaine smuggling operation through Sydney airport. Her lawyers claimed that the drugs were planted in Brisbane, by airline baggage handlers involved in interstate drug trafficking, who planned to remove the package in Sydney, but mistakenly sent it to Bali instead. On 8 October 2004, Corby took a flight with her brother and two friends from Brisbane airport via Sydney to Bali to celebrate Mercedes' 30th birthday. Her story resonated with many Australians -- those who had been to Bali, a popular tourist destination; those who imagined how easily an unlocked bag could allow drug traffickers to turn a dream holiday into a nightmare; those who held prejudices about customs officials in developing countries; and others who thought, regardless of whether Corby was guilty or not, the penalty she faced was unreasonably harsh. When they landed in Indonesia, customs officials checked their luggage and discovered a plastic bag containing 4.1 kilograms of marijuana -- the largest seizure ever made at Bali's Denpasar airport -- in Corby's boogie board bag.
