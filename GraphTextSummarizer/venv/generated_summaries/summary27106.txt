But a lot has changed over the past two decades, and people who wouldn't pass a background check have found other ways to procure guns easily through unlicensed sales at gun shows or on the Internet, where background checks are not required. Since February 28, 1994, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, background checks have stopped more than 2 million gun purchases by "prohibited purchasers"  like convicted felons, domestic abusers, the dangerously mentally ill and fugitivesâ€”people who we all agree should not have guns. Let's finish the job, expand Brady background checks and help keep guns out of the hands of the wrong people. Three out of four NRA members and 80% of gun owners agree that the scope of background checks needs to be expanded. In fact, 90% of Americans support universal background checks covering all online sales and gun shows.
