-- Greek lawmakers Wednesday approved a package of austerity measures demanded by international lenders, despite protests outside Parliament as they were voting, in a move that should clear the way for an emergency loan to Athens. Greek riot police fired round after round of tear gas to keep small crowds of protesters away from Parliament in the run-up to the vote and as lawmakers one by one said "Yes" or "No." Euro group chairman Jean-Claude Juncker also welcomed the news, saying the "way is now clear" for Athens to receive the fifth instalment of a huge bailout loan from European Union countries and the International Monetary Fund. Crowds outside Parliament swelled as the vote took place, but both sides showed some restraint, with police and demonstrators eyeing each other warily rather than wading into the melee. The two-day general strike is continuing on Wednesday, with members of three major unions planning to march on Parliament after the vote.
