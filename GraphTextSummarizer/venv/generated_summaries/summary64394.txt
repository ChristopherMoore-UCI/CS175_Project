The rebels have said the peacekeepers entered the village near the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, an area where peacekeepers should not be and where intense fighting has been raging for days between rebels and government forces. This story was reported by CNN's Richard Roth from the U.N. and Hamdi Alkhshali from Atlanta, and written by Jason Hanna in Atlanta. -- Twenty-one U.N. peacekeepers detained by Syrian rebels this week could soon be released, representatives for the United Nations and a Syrian opposition group said Friday. The other video shows rebels walking near several U.N. trucks. "All the parties" have agreed to a release of the 21 held since Wednesday, and the U.N. peacekeeping agency has dispatched a team to help collect them, U.N. spokeswoman Josephine Guerrero said.
