In May 2008, Jean and Yéle Haiti partnered with the United Nations World Food Program and the Pan American Development Foundation to create "Together for Haiti," a program that specifically provides resources for targeted food distribution, employment creation, micro-enterprise grants and farm training. -- In 2005, Haitian-born and Brooklyn-raised musician Wyclef Jean created the grassroots charity organization Yéle Haiti. Jean is encouraging people to text "Yéle" to 501501, which will automatically donate $5 to the Yéle Haiti Earthquake Fund, or to visit http://www.yele.org/. Within two hours of Tuesday's 7.0 magnitude  earthquake, Jean and Yéle mobilized on social networking sites to raise funds for disaster relief. In 2007 Jean testified before the House of Representatives urging the U.S. government to earmark more funds for education in Haiti and to encourage the U.S. private sector to enter the Haitian market in order to create jobs for the Haitian people.
