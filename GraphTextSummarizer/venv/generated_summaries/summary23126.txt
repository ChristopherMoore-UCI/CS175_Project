Mother's instinct saves lives of 3 sons Parents must assure children that they are safe and help them cope with distress associated with reminders of the tornado -- like sirens or the destruction they see. Parents can reminisce about that person with their kids and conduct a memorial activity that children can join in. That, and open communication will go a long way toward supporting children with their responses to this devastating tornado.
