Breivik claims the shooting rampage was a matter of self-defense, meant to save Norway from being taken over by multicultural forces and to prevent ethnic cleansing of Norwegians, Lippestad said. Breivik showed some of his extremist views during a February hearing, which began with him entering court with a smile and offering up a raised, clenched-fist salute. The two psychiatric experts recommended he spend four weeks under 24-hour psychiatric monitoring, according to court documents released in February. The Tuesday report said Breivik was not psychotic at the time of the crimes, does not suffer from a psychiatric condition and is not mentally challenged. Anders Behring Breivik was charged last month with committing acts of terror and voluntary homicide.
