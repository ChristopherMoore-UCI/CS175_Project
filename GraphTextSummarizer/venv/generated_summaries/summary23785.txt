-- FIFA president Sepp Blatter has apologized for his remarks about gay fans attending the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. The move, to avoid the blistering 50 degrees centigrade heat in Qatar in June and July, was first suggested by Germany's FIFA executive committee member Franz Beckenbauer and is gathering momentum. Blatter, in Abu Dhabi for FIFA's Club World Cup, also gave his support to the notion of the 2022 World Cup being played in January rather than the traditional mid-summer slot. They have not made an official request to switch dates which would bring clashes with major club leagues in Europe such as the English Premier League, Spain's La Liga and Serie A in Italy. Blatter was heavily criticized for saying they should "refrain from sexual activity" if they go to Qatar because homosexuality is illegal in the emirate.
