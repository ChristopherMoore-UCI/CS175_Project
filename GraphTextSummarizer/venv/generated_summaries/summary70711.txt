"While Ms. Dorrell had a legitimate right to apply for and accept a position within the football program, the circumstances surrounding the former coach's decision to hire her compromised her ability to be effective in such a position," athletics director Jeff Long said on Tuesday. Jessica Dorrell, the football program's student athlete development coordinator, had been placed on paid administrative leave after it was discovered that she had a consensual relationship with Petrino. -- The woman at the center of a scandal that led to the firing of University of Arkansas football coach Bobby Petrino resigned from her job at the school on Tuesday. Dorrell, a former Arkansas volleyball player, was a passenger on Petrino's motorcycle, but he did not initially disclose that information. That relationship came to light after Petrino was involved in a motorcycle crash on April 1.
