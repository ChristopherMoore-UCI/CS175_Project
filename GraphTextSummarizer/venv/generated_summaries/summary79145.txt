Clinton's annual earnings from speeches have varied from year to year depending on his schedule and availability. While it is not unusual for former presidents to command millions of dollars in speaking fees after leaving office, Clinton is the only one subjected to strict disclosure requirements as a result of his wife's position as a high-ranking federal official, first as a U.S. senator and now as secretary of state. Clinton's fees were detailed in Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's annual financial disclosure report, released Monday. The Center for Public Integrity, a public interest watchdog group, estimated in a report last year that former President George W. Bush had delivered almost 140 paid speeches for at least $15 million in his first two-and-a-half years since leaving the White House. Former President Bill Clinton commanded the largest speaking fees of his career in 2011, earning $13.4 million and exceeding his previous record by 25%.
