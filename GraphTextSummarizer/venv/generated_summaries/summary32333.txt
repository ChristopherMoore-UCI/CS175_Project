RIP Yams," said a post Sunday on the group's official Facebook page with a black-and-white photo of Yams, whose real name is Steven Rodriguez. Rather than being famous for rapping or mixing, Yams is credited with masterminding the rise of A$AP Mob and launching the careers of A$AP Ferg and the chart-topping A$AP Rocky. You changed my life, you changed the world," Ferg wrote on Instagram next to a photo of him and Yams kneeling on stage. "R.I.P Yams, I love you brother," Rocky posted on Facebook. The group's record company, RCA Records, said it was "shocked and saddened to hear of the death of A$AP Yams," according to a statement reported by Rolling Stone.
