They both entered "not guilty" pleas in August to the original 39 counts, including conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud, bank fraud, making false statements on loan applications, and bankruptcy fraud. -- "Real Housewives of New Jersey" stars Teresa and Joe Giudice face new bank fraud charges. "In the course of obtaining the loan, she and Giuseppe Giudice prepared a loan application which falsely stated that Teresa Giudice was employed as a realtor and that she had a monthly salary of $15,000," Fishman said. The husband and wife are due in court in Newark for the added charges on Wednesday, according to U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman. The new counts stem from a $361,250 mortgage loan that Teresa Giudice, 41, got in 2005, Fishman said.
