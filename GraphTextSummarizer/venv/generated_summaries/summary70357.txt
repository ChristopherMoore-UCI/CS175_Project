However, the head of SACMS, Zhao Tiechui, said Tuesday that the number of miners dead or missing from accidents had decreased by 35% from last year, with just 807 dead so far in 2011. Days of heavy rain caused a mine at Niupeng in Guizhou province to flood on Saturday morning; while "rain-saturated earth on the surface collapsed into a shaft" at another pit in Guangxi around noon the same day, killing three miners, Xinhua said. -- Two separate incidents at coal mines in Southwest China over the weekend left at least three miners dead and 42 trapped, state media reported. By Monday the water level at the mine had dropped but was still 40 meters (131ft) higher than where 23 of the miners are believed trapped, according to reports from China National Radio. At Guangxi, high concentrations of gas prevented workers from using machines to dig out another 19 trapped miners trapped at a depth of 390 meters (1,200ft), China Daily said.
