-- After a second day of jury selection in the Casey Anthony murder trial, more prospective jurors facing weeks and possibly months away from home, family, work and school have been excused. Other major cases that have been sequestered in recent years include the O.J. Simpson double murder trial in Los Angeles and the trial of Mary Winkler, found guilty of voluntary manslaughter in the death of her husband, a minister in Selmer, Tennessee. Lawyers have also dismissed several potential jurors who expressed opinions about the case during voir dire, questioning to ensure jurors are not biased. After screening for hardship, the court will ask remaining prospective jurors about their knowledge of the case, whether they could set that aside and if they were to find her guilty could they impose the death penalty. Anthony was transported to Clearwater, Florida, and booked into the Pinellas County Jail for jury selection.
