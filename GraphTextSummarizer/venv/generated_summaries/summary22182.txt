According to the Bronx Zoo's website, the exhibit called Tiger Mountain houses Amur tigers, also known as Siberian tigers, as well as Malayan tigers. The man -- believed to be about 25 -- was riding on the zoo's Wild Asia monorail around 3 p.m. Friday when he jumped out of his car, "clearing the exhibit's perimeter fence," according to statement from Bronx Zoo Director Jim Breheny. Because the man followed instructions to roll under the wire, "that probably saved his life," Breheny told reporters. "I think it's safe to say that if the tiger really wanted to do harm to this individual he certainly had the time to do it," Breheny said. The facility emergency response staff arrived and used a carbon dioxide fire extinguisher to move a tiger away from the man, Breheny said.
