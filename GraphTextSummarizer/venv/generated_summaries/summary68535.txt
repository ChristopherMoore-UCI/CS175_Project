She wrote that profiles on the site, which received almost 100,000 visitors a day, are created by users and that profiles generally display "information that is publicly available in a Google Internet search as well as newly created user generated content." The commission is seeking a court order barring the "deceptive practices," prohibiting Jerk.com from using information they obtained improperly and requiring them to delete profiles created from scraped Facebook information. From 2009 to 2013, the operators of Jerk.com created profiles for millions of people, including children, using information that was scraped off Facebook, according to charges filed Monday by the Federal Trade Commission. Jerk.com profiles included buttons that allowed users to vote on whether someone was a "jerk" or not, as well as add personal information and comments about that person. The FTC says that the site created phony Facebook apps that operators then used to download the names and photos of millions of users.
