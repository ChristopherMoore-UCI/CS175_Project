Meanwhile, other stars such as Seth Rogen and Jason Biggs had decidedly less kind reactions to the news that Bieber had been pulled over while drag racing in Miami Beach, Florida, and then arrested on charges of drunken driving, resisting arrest and driving without a valid license. Nickelodeon star Grande, who spent some time on tour with Bieber and shares a manager with the pop star, Scooter Braun, didn't directly address Bieber by name, but the timing of her reaction on Twitter spoke volumes. Ellen DeGeneres, who once had Bieber on her show to surprise him with a car as a birthday gift, sounded genuine when she tweeted she hopes the star will be able to mature without injury. " Over on late night, Bieber was the top joke on both "Jimmy Kimmel Live" and "Late Night With Jimmy Fallon. "All jokes aside, Justin Bieber is a piece of s***," Rogen tweeted.
