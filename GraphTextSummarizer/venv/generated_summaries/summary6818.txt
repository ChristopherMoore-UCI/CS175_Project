On the other side of the Capitol, House Democratic Whip Jim Clyburn, D-South Carolina, said Democrats were discussing including the alternative minimum tax as part of the package, in addition to the payroll tax cut and business tax credits the Obama team has proposed. " Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Thursday that House committees will begin action on Obama's proposed economic recovery package in the next couple of weeks, with a vote in the full House slated for the week after Obama's inauguration. Several Democrats also said they were down on a tax proposal for payroll tax credits -- amounting to about $20 per paycheck and totaling $500 per person and $1,000 for couples earning less that $200,000 a year. During a lengthy closed-door meeting Thursday evening with Democratic senators on Capitol Hill, Larry Summers, chosen to head the National Economic Council, and senior Obama adviser David Axelrod heard complaints about the stimulus plan, according to two senior Democratic aides who attended the meeting. None of the senators CNN spoke with after the Finance Committee meeting said they thought the opposition to these provisions would derail the bill but suggested that many meetings would be needed with the Obama team to hammer out an agreement.
