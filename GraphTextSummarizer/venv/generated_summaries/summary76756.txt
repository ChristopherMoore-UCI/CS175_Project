-- A plot to assassinate Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has been foiled, Russia's state-run Channel One TV reported Monday, less than a week before presidential elections that Putin is expected to win. But opponents took to the streets by the thousands after his United Russia party won a narrow majority in December parliamentary elections, which monitors from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe said were "slanted in favor of the ruling party." " Putin has dominated Russian politics for more than a decade, and his opponents accuse him of rigging parliamentary elections late last year. The plotter who was killed was allegedly willing to be a suicide bomber, and the mission was organized by Chechen militant leader Doku Umarov, Channel One reported. Ukraine's domestic security agency, the SBU, uncovered the plot after an explosion at an apartment building in Odessa killed one of the plotters and injured another, Channel One said.
