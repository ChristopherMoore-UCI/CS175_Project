Because of her history, NBC decided to tape Carey singing her holiday classic before a live audience Tuesday night, then air it Wednesday for the network's coverage of the 82nd annual Rockefeller Center tree lighting. Her no-show forced NBC to air Carey singing "All I Want for Christmas is You" live during its broadcast of the tree-lighting Wednesday night. According to TMZ, Carey was delayed because she was meeting with her lawyer about her divorce settlement with husband Nick Cannon. -- Mariah Carey is known for her five-octave voice, her slinky dresses and her many hits, including "All I Want for Christmas is You." And her behavior this week at the Rockefeller Christmas Tree Lighting Ceremony in New York won't do anything to help that reputation.
