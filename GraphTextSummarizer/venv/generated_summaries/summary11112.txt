-- Flamboyant carnival musician Michel Martelly edged out former Haitian first lady Mirlande Manigat in a pivotal presidential runoff vote held last month, according to preliminary results released Monday. The third-place candidate, Martelly, claimed he had won more votes than Celestin and a review of results by an Organization of American States team supported that contention. "My life on stage was very different than it was at home," Martelly said last year in the midst of violence after the November election. Martelly, 50, took 67.6% of the vote, while Manigat, 70, received 31.5%, according to Pierre Thibault, spokesman for Haiti's Provisional Electoral Council. Haitians responded by charging fraud and burning cars, tires and Celestin's campaign headquarters in Port-au-Prince.
