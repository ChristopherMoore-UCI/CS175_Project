If there is something subversive about Alan's man-love for Phil -- and Galifianakis' presexual overgrown adolescent remains the movie's closeted comedic focal point -- it's all bound up in an ugly tangle of homophobic taunts, male bonding cliches, and the virtual exclusion of the opposite sex (Heather Graham's solitary scene very much included). Phil, Stu and Doug (Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms and Justin Bartha) are escorting their emotionally volatile buddy Alan (Zack Galifianakis) to a rehab clinic when they're forced off the road. Everything that made "The Hangover" such an unexpected hit -- its bold, brilliant pick-up-the-pieces story structure; the way it reveled in exposing the wild side of its outwardly conventional (if mismatched) buddies; and the big dose of strange that was Zack Galifianakis in his breakthrough movie role -- has been squandered and cheapened in two uninspired, largely mirthless and meretricious sequels. Crime boss Marshall (John Goodman) explains -- at length -- how their old sparring partner Chow (Ken Jeong) has escaped from a Bangkok prison. If Goodman seems subdued after his big, boisterous turns in "Argo" and "Flight," it could be because the writing is so hack -- or maybe he figured there was just no way anyone was going further over the top than Ken Jeong, whose angry cokehead /rabid degenerate shtick is way beyond funny.
