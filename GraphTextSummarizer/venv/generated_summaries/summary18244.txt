In press conferences and TV appearances, Cruz and House tea party members said time and time again that they were doing what the "American people" asked them to do. The resolution of the shutdown always hinged on whether House Speaker John Boehner, a Republican, would defy the tea party hard-liners in his party and allow a vote on a bill that a majority of Republicans did not support. Those same numbers give Obama and the Democrats confidence in saying they are the ones who are actually listening to the American people. While many strategists believe the House is still safe for Republicans, a recent Public Policy Polling survey, conducted by the Democratic pollster for MoveOn.org, a liberal activist group, suggests that the Democrats in competitive Republican districts are ahead. Rep. Raul Labrador and other staunch conservatives and tea party members gave him kudos.
