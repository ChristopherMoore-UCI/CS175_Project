An activist based outside Syria with a network in Latakia said security forces in al-Ramel and other areas targeted in the crackdown used loudspeakers to warn people under the age of 55 not to go to mosques. "We are urging that these are unarmed protesters, and there's been excessive force used against them, and this force must stop," she said Friday. The Local Coordination Committees said 29 people were killed Friday when security forces fired on protesters in several locations. Unrest has engulfed Syria since mid-March as security forces wage a crackdown on peaceful protesters demanding political change. Two children were among five people killed in the town of Ghabagheb by security forces, the observatory said.
