Clinton and former President George W. Bush visited Haiti on behalf of the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund, which was established to raise money for long-term recovery in the impoverished nation. Port-au-Prince, Haiti -- Extending U.S. trade preferences for Haiti could create as many as 100,000 jobs that would boost the earthquake-ravaged country's recovery, former President Bill Clinton said during a visit to the Haitian capital Monday. On Monday, Clinton and Bush met with Haitian leaders, visited a camp for displaced Haitians and toured two small businesses in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. During the periods of the Clinton and Bush presidencies, the conventional wisdom was that by opening up countries like Haiti to subsidized agricultural imports from the United States and other developed nations, Haiti could industrialize faster. Clinton also said he supported the development of Haiti's domestic agriculture industry as a key to development and recovery.
