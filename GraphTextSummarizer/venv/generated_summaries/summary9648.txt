It's too early to tell whether Monday's incident is connected to other minor explosions in New York City in recent years, including ones at the British and Mexican consulates and another in Times Square, Kelly said. The explosion blew out the windows of a Starbucks coffeehouse at East 92nd Street and Third Avenue at 3:25 a.m., according to New York City Police Commissioner Ray Kelly. However, Kelly also noted that Starbucks has been the target of low-grade explosions in other cities. Seven people were briefly evacuated from the building above the Starbucks, Kelly said, but no one was injured. A "low-order improvised explosive device" exploded after being left on a wooden bench in front of the coffeehouse, Kelly said.
