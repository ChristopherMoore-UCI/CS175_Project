However, cell phones are still far from a popular contribution method: even though the Federal Elections Commission cleared the path to cell phone donations for political candidates back in June, only 1% of American adults have used their cell phone to donate to a presidential candidate. Conversely, 87% of Republican donors have given money in person, over the phone or through snail-mail, while 57% of Democratic donors have contributed offline (The numbers don't total 100% because people can make multiple donations in various ways). Democratic donors are more likely to send a donation via text message or app â€” 15% of them have done so compared to 6% of Republican donors. While offline donations are still the most popular form of contributions, the Internet's a close second: of the 13% of adults who contributed to a campaign, 67% did so in-person, on the phone or through traditional mail, while 50% donated online or via email.
