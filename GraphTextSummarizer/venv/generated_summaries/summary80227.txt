Japan has slipped to the world's third largest economy, falling behind the blistering speed of China's manufacturing growth, according to Japanese figures released Monday. China has expanded domestic industries and infrastructure, driven by a surge in exports. Japan's economy was valued at US $5.4742 trillion dollars while China was at US $5.8786 trillion. At the speed China is growing, Japan's government predicts China will overtake the United States as the world's largest economy in less than 20 years. Multinational corporations have expanded in China, taking advantage of low labor costs.
