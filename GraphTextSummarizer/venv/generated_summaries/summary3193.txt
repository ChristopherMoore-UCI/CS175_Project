Knox said she gave conflicting answers at the interrogation on November 6 because of police pressure and her confused state. Knox and Sollecito were both present at Monday's court session, Kercher's attorney Francesco Maresca said. They are accused of killing British student Meredith Kercher, Knox's housemate in Perugia, a scenic university town north of Rome. The murder trial of American student Amanda Knox in the death of her housemate two years ago resumed Monday in Italy after a summer break. Knox, 22, and her Italian ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito also face charges of sexual assault.
