Still, ElBaradei was considered an above-it-all technocrat who was viewed as an unlikely presidential candidate, though he did join anti-Mubarak protests in Egypt despite receiving death threats.

The next month, he returned to his first love -- diplomacy and atomic weapons -- and published a book, "The Age of Deception: Nuclear Diplomacy in Treacherous Times."
