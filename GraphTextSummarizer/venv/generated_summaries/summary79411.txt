-- Sanctions against Iran are illegal and are undermining international law, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said in an exclusive, wide-ranging interview with CNN's Fareed Zakaria. Minister: U.S. mischaracterized deal Rouhani's comments on the country's centrifuges came the same day as remarks by Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif suggesting that the Obama administration had mischaracterized Iranian concessions. However, Rouhani insisted that Iran still had a right to peaceful nuclear technology, including enrichment, which he described as "part and parcel of the inalienable rights of states. "In the context of R&D and peaceful nuclear technology, we will not accept any limitations," Rouhani told Zakaria, arguing that Iran's need for medical isotopes necessitated a heavy water reactor. Speaking to CNN chief national security correspondent Jim Sciutto, Zarif said: "The White House version both underplays the concessions and overplays Iranian commitments."
