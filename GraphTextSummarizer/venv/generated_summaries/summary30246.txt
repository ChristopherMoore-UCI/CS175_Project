Nowadays, the fact that Brooke was elected as a Republican back then likely raises more eyebrows among those who can't remember that back in the early-to-middle 20th century, the GOP remained for many African Americans the "Party of Lincoln" and was considered more trustworthy than a Democratic Party still beholden to a Southern segregationist bloc of elected officials. The last two African American senators, Blanche K. Bruce and Hiram R. Revels from Mississippi, achieved their seats a century before the way other senators did, through a majority vote of their state legislature, whose rare indulgence of black plurality came about through post-Civil War Reconstruction. Edward W. Brooke III, the first black man popularly elected to the U.S. Senate, who died Saturday at 95, and Stuart Scott, the groundbreaking ESPN sports anchor who died Sunday at 49, transformed their country's perceptions of racial identity in distinct ways. Stuart Scott's breakthroughs were quite different from Brooke's. He helped bring a new archetype to intelligent black style, making doubters and haters alike re-evaluate their misgivings about turn-of-the-century "Afro Pop" while inspiring younger minorities to reimagine possibilities in journalism, on- and off-screen.
