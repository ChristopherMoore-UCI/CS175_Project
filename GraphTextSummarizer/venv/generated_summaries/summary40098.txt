-- Werewolves are usually the stuff of B-movies and bad novels, but last year British author Glen Duncan did the unthinkable in literary circles, crafting a howling good tale out of the weary werewolf myth. Watch Glen Duncan read an excerpt from "Talulla Rising" CNN: Do you have a favorite werewolf story and why do you think they have appealed to readers for so long? Duncan: I've never read a werewolf story in my life, but my favorite werewolf movie is, of course, "An American Werewolf in London." In the book, Jake Marlowe, a 200-year-old lonely lycanthrope, believes himself to be the last of his kind until he meets Talulla Demetriou. It's your classic tale of boy meets girl, except this pair turn into werewolves, battle vampires and fall in love. In the case of werewolves, the fear of the beast within, and the desire to be liberated into it.
