-- South Korea demanded Tokyo withdraw a ban that asks Japanese diplomats to refrain from flying with Korean Air to protest a test flight above islets in the sea east of Korea that Japan claims is its territory. Japan has long claimed the islets as its territory, but Seoul leaves no room for debate and says all Korean territory was returned after the country won independence from colonial rule by Japan in 1945. "The government is taking this seriously, as the Japanese government in effect is placing sanctions on one of our private companies," the South Korean foreign ministry spokesman said in a briefing Thursday. The islets in the sea east of Korea, known as Dokdo in Korea and Takeshima in Japan, have been a prickly issue for the countries. South Korea said it will consider various measures if Tokyo does not withdraw the measure that goes into effect Thursday.
