-- The Obama administration could be in violation of the War Powers Resolution if it fails to get congressional authorization by Sunday for U.S. participation in the Libya military mission, House Speaker John Boehner said Tuesday. "We are in the final stages of preparing extensive information for the House and Senate that will address a whole host of issues about our ongoing efforts in Libya, including those raised in the House resolution as well as our legal analysis with regard to the War Powers Resolution," he said. The White House has previously said it was complying with the War Powers Resolution through frequent briefings on the Libya mission. According to Boehner, a 90-day deadline for congressional authorization of the Libya mission expires Sunday. Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who supports the Libya mission, said Tuesday that he expected the White House to provide Congress with details on the Libya mission this week.
