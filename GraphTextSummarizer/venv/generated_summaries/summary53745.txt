The students were taken away after flashing the salute -- popularized by the film's central figure, Katniss Everdeen (played by Jennifer Lawrence) -- at a speech in northeastern Thailand by Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha to civil servants, according to Phavinee Chumsri, from the group Thai Lawyers for Human Rights. Five university students who used the signature three-fingered salute from "The Hunger Games" in front of Thailand's Prime Minister were detained Wednesday and told they'll face a charge of breaking martial law, a lawyer said. They were released after about eight hours, the lawyer said, but have been asked to come back on the charge that they broke the martial law that's been in effect in Thailand since Prayuth -- then the army's chief -- announced in May the the country had been placed under military control. But, according to Phavinee, the Khon Kaen University students were taken to a Thai army facility, Camp Sri Patcharin, where they refused to sign an agreement not to participate in political activities. At the time, the quintet in Khon Kaen province -- about 450 kilometers (280 miles) northeast of Bangkok -- was in a line wearing shirts bearing the words "Don't want a military coup," Phavinee said.
