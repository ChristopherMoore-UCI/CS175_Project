"Kiefer worked with Freddie Prinze, Jr. more than 5 years ago, and this is the first he has heard of Freddie's grievances," Sutherland's rep said. " Prinze didn't leave acting -- he was at San Diego Comic-Con over the weekend promoting his Disney XD series "Star Wars Rebels," and has worked on TV series "Bones" and "Witches of East End" within the past year. In a statement to ABC News, Sutherland's rep said that Sutherland didn't know Prinze wasn't his biggest fan. -- Freddie Prinze Jr. and Kiefer Sutherland have very different memories of working together on "24." But according to Prinze, it was Sutherland in particular who made him want to throw in the towel.
