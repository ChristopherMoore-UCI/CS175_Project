The woman and children held captive in a cellar for years by their incestuous father will take years to recover from their disturbing ordeal, doctors warned Wednesday as the family at the center of the case remained in psychiatric care. Members of the Fritzl family will also be offered the chance to adopt new identities in an effort to help them lead normal lives, officials said. "The two boys appeared overawed by the daylight they had never experienced before," said Chief Inspector Leopold Etz. Elizabeth Fritzl -- now 42 -- spent more than two decades in the windowless basement after being drugged, handcuffed and locked up by her father, Josef Fritzl, as an 18-year-old. "I am afraid it is too late for that." Kampusch, the Austrian girl abducted as a 10-year-old and held captive in a basement for more than eight years until she escaped in 2007, also offered her help to the family on Tuesday, but questioned the decision to move them from the cellar into psychiatric care.
