Fortunately, the battles have been strictly rhetorical, although both nations' military vessels and aircraft have navigated and scrambled ominously in the vicinity of the disputed islets in the East China Sea known as the Diaoyu islands in China and the Senkakus in Japan. Dialogue continues behind the scenes but this is against the backdrop of frosty admonitions and dangerous posturing. While diplomacy has not been effective yet in reviving that spirit of amity, damping down tensions, or in securing a meeting between President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, finding a formula to execute a mutually acceptable climb down is essential to jump-start dialogue. For example, in February Japan claimed that a Chinese vessel locked its firing radar onto a Japanese ship. Surprise, surprise, Japan and China are still not getting along.
