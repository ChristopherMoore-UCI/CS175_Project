There is a distinct fruity aroma that welcomes visitors when they pass the giant wall of gum housing millions of chewed pieces in Seattle. But health experts warn that birds are notorious for carrying dangerous germs and viruses. The Gum Wall, also dubbed the Wall of Gum, is one of the strangest attractions in Pike Place Market, where visitors can go to watch fish throwers and see the original Starbucks. Visitors from all over the world snap photos next to it and leave as many pieces of their own gum as they want. Thousands of the dirty birds crowd the square sometimes leaving their droppings or attacking visitors.
