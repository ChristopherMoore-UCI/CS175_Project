"We had set ourselves the objective of defending Mr. Kerviel against an injustice that is absolutely lamentable," Koubbi said outside the courthouse, according to CNN affiliate BFM-TV. Jean Veil, a lawyer for Societe Generale, told BFM-TV that he had "great satisfaction regarding the court's decision to name Jerome Kerviel as solely responsible for the fraud." Societe Generale, which said it discovered the losses in January 2008, said that at no time were supervisors aware of Kerviel's alleged unlawful activities. The ruling that Kerviel must pay â‚¬4.9 billion (about $6.3 billion) in damages to the bank, Societe Generale, was also upheld. Metzner previously told CNN that Kerviel's behavior was strongly influenced by the environment at Societe Generale.
