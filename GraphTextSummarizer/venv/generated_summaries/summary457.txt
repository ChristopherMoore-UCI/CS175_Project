This will require hard choices to bring government spending and revenues into balance while still investing in the long-term drivers of U.S. economic competitiveness. It also means increasing investment in capabilities that can ensure U.S. power projection in contested environments and protecting low-cost, high-impact programs that build the capacity of critical partners in other regions to address shared challenges.

The super committee's failure to reach agreement on deficit reduction highlighted another more worrisome deficit -- one of political courage, vision and classic American pragmatism. This standard has long been a pillar of American strategy and is essential for a global power with global interests, let alone the world's indisputable leader and ally of choice.
