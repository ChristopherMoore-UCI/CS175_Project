Williams rode Dunaden to victory at the Geelong Cup warm-up as trainer Mikel Delzangles followed the example set by last year's winner Americain, who could only manage fourth on Tuesday behind German-bred Lucas Cranach. -- Top French jockey Christophe Lemaire could not believe his luck after winning one of horse-racing's biggest prizes in dramatic fashion in Australia on Tuesday. Craig must be devastated and I hope he recovers quickly and that he will win many more big races. The 32-year-old was able to ride at the Melbourne Cup only because Dunaden's usual mount Craig Williams was serving a ban for careless riding, and he had never seen the famed Flemington raceway before Monday. " Lemaire rated the victory as the second finest of his distinguished career, after the winning on Divine Proportions at the 2005 Prix de Diane in Chantilly in front of his family.
