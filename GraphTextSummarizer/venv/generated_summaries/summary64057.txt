One talking point frequently used by Republicans to justify shutting down the government while trying to overturn the Affordable Care Act is that the House and its Republican majority are more representative of Americans' views than President Barack Obama and the Democratic Senate. House Republicans lost ground in the 2012 elections, lost the national vote for the House by over a million votes and retained a majority only because of favorable districting. Senate Democrats retained their majority despite having to defend more than twice as many seats as the Republicans. The Constitution provides for an orderly process of making laws and building agreement between chambers of Congress and branches of government. The House Republicans' attempt to nullify a duly-enacted law violates the norms of our constitutional system.
