My charity in Palm Beach County, Florida, assists veterans, soldiers, and  their families by providing supportive services, financial assistance, housing, mental health service referrals and more. About a quarter of homeless adults in this country are veterans, according to the National Coalition for Homeless Veterans, yet the Census shows veterans represent only 10 percent of the civilian population. According to the Department of Veterans Affairs,  between 6,500 and 7,000 female vets in the United States are homeless, with almost nowhere for them to get help --  especially when compared with the number of facilities for homeless male veterans. That's when the commitment in my heart to help homeless veterans was born. I not only wanted to help homeless veterans, I wanted to help them before they became homeless, before they have to live through what I did.
