-- A Taliban-affiliated website published on Sunday what it claimed was a leaked document containing confidential government security plans for a vital meeting of tribal elders in Kabul next week, one that is set to discuss Afghanistan's long-term relationship with the United States and possible peace talks with the insurgency. The document said the following could be "probable threats" posed by the Taliban: -- "Suicide attacks with new and dangerous tactics in one or several places continuing for several hours"; -- "Rocket attacks from Kabul city sub-districts or districts outside"; -- "Infiltration of enemy into the lines of security forces." Sunday's alleged leak was interpreted in Kabul as anything from a desperate insurgency resorting to fraudulent propaganda to a new sign of the Taliban's enhanced ability to elicit confidential information from government ministries. "This is yet another huge lie by the Taliban," said Interior Ministry spokesman Sediq Seddiqi. Regardless, they are a sign of the information war between coalition forces and the insurgency, both of which regularly trade blows and accusations on social media.
