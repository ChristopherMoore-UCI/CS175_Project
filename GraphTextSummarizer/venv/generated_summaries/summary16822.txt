'We have always believed that Qatar's hosting of the World Cup would be a catalyst to accelerate positive initiatives, already being undertaken by Qatar, which will leave a legacy of enhanced, sustainable and meaningful progress in regards to worker welfare across the country," said Hassan Al Thawadi, the secretary general of Qatar's Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy. -- Organizers of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar have responded to criticism over the plight of migrant workers on stadia and infrastructure projects by saying Tuesday that "tangible progress" had been made in addressing widespread concerns over their welfare. They said that they would be meeting representatives from other building projects in the "coming months" to achieve a "unified standard" across the whole of Qatar for migrant workers. They detailed systematic abuse and the ITUC claimed that fatal construction injuries were eight times higher in Qatar than other developed nations, with migrant workers from India and Nepal the worst affected. FIFA has also still to decide the actual dates for the 2022 World Cup after fears that the searing heat in Qatar in the summer will be dangerous for players and spectators.
