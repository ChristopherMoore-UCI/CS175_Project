Chiao, who set up the group after experiencing sexual harassment herself in Egypt, says that HarassMap is also using mobile technology to provide victims with details of how to access free support services. "They ask them to watch out for sexual harassment and not ignore it and to speak against the harassers when they see it happen." Chiao says the community outreach program has already had a big impact. "A lot of the women's NGOs in Egypt offer services like free legal help, how to make a police report, psychological counseling, self-defense classes," explains Chiao. On the HarrassMap website, victims' reports give a disturbing insight into sexual harassment on the streets of Egypt. The issue of sexual harassment in Egypt grabbed international headlines in 2011 when CBS reporter Lara Logan was attacked in Cairo's Tahrir Square after former president Hosni Mubarak stepped down.
