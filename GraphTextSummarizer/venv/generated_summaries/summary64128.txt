With Qatar already having made large investments in French utility companies such as Veolia and Suez environment, as well as media group Lagardere, and more recently the purchase of French football club Paris Saint-Germain, this latest announcement of French-Qatari cooperation was met with heavy criticism by both the French left and right. "To see Qatar land in the French suburbs as a stand-in for a cash-strapped French Republic deserves to be looked at twice," Demorand mused. Marine Le Pen, head of France's far right National Front party, whose presidential campaign played heavily on the fear of immigrants -- particularly those of Muslim origins, also weighed in with a communique titled "French Islamic Trojan Horse," in which she accused Qatar of investing in the "banlieues" because of the high number of Muslims present there. CNN has sought comment from the Qatari government and from French government officials on the plan, but has not yet received a response. Aneld, a group representing local elected officials who advocate for diversity in deprived areas met with Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, the Emir of Qatar last November, to secure an investment of 50 million euros.
