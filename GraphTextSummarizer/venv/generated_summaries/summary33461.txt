-- Britain's involvement in the invasion of Iraq "was the right decision and it was for the right reasons," Prime Minister Gordon Brown said Friday in his first response at an inquiry into country's role in the March 2003 conflict. Brown was answering a question from the chairman of the inquiry, John Chilcot, about whether he thought taking military action in March 2003 was the right decision, especially given that it led to such a great loss of life among military personnel and civilians. Phillip Hewett, died in Iraq in 2005, said she doesn't believe Brown did everything possible to equip British troops. "I said that every single request that was made for [military] equipment had to be met, and every request was met, and at any point military commanders were able to ask for equipment that they needed, and I know of no occasion when they were turned down for it," Brown testified. "It meant that we had to go in for a very major savings exercise in order to cope with what was effectively a billion pounds reduction in our finances." Brown testified that military options took precedence over financial concerns.
