"The solicitor said, 'It's automatic jail time,'" McGill told CNN affiliate WSB. Kevin McGill, a garbage collector in Sandy Springs, Georgia, had been sentenced to a total of 30 days in jail for violating the city's noise ordinance that states that "trash collection must be conducted between the hours of 7 a.m. and 7 p.m." McGill said that when he appeared in court, he was "stunned" when he learned he'd have to serve time for collecting garbage too early. " "The only thing that seems to stop the activity is actually going to jail," McGill said. A sanitation worker in an Atlanta suburb already served two weekends in jail -- and faced several more until officials relented Monday-- after authorities charged him for doing his job too early in the morning.
