The International Crisis Group said in a report last week that Turkey's long-simmering war with the Kurdish insurgency had escalated, raising casualties to a level not seen in more than a decade. More than 700 people have been killed in the past 14 months, according to the conflict resolution organization that has extensively researched Turkey's war with the PKK. Turkey, the United States, and the European Union have formally labeled the PKK a terrorist organization. However, suspicion within Turkey is likely to fall on Kurdish militants. Tunceli province is a predominantly Kurdish region where frequent clashes have occurred between the Turkish military and fighters from the militant Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK.
