Polanski was accused of plying a 13-year-old girl with champagne and a sliver of a quaalude tablet and performing various sex acts, including intercourse, with her during a photo shoot at actor Jack Nicholson's house. Polanski pleaded guilty to a single count of having unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor.
