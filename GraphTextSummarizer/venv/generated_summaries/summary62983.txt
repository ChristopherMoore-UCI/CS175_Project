The plane landed at New York's John F. Kennedy International airport "without incident" at 10:17 p.m. ET on Friday, November 27, Air France said. The pilots made the decision to turn back "in strict accordance with procedures and as a precautionary measure... following a minor technical problem in order to carry out ground checks," Air France said. Air France became the fourth airline to operate the superjumbo when it received its first A380 at the end of last month. -- An Airbus airplane was forced to turn back to New York 90 minutes into a flight to Paris, Air France said Monday. Airbus also declined to specify what caused the plane to turn back, saying the incident was an issue for the Air France maintenance team not the aircraft's manufacturer.
