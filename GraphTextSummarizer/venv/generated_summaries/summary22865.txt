Delton Fire Department officials said the cause of the leak was the rink's resurfacing machine, CNN affiliate WISC reported. Dozens of people were treated at local hospitals for dizziness, nausea, headaches, vomiting and fainting, authorities said. It said it recorded high readings of  the gas from inside the Poppy Waterman Ice Rink, but at the time of the leak, many hockey players, staff and spectators had left. "The good thing about this is a lot of people got sick all at once, so it was recognized quickly and the exposure was pretty limited," Matt Lazio, director of St. Clare's emergency department, told WISC. The incident started  when several players complained of headaches and dizziness.
