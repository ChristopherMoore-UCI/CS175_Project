France's Muslims warn of a growing anti-Islam backlash as the country slowly comes to terms with last week's deadly attacks on Charlie Hebdo magazine and a Jewish supermarket. " Many French Muslims turned out in Paris and elsewhere for huge national unity marches Sunday, keen to show they shared in the nation's horror and grief at the events of last week. Groups representing French Muslims have urged authorities to step in to protect them in the same way as they have boosted security around Jewish sites. Valls said the thousands of extra police and soldiers deployed to ensure national security since Wednesday's attack on Charlie Hebdo would watch over mosques as well as Jewish schools and synagogues. One of the 12 victims in the Charlie Hebdo attack was police officer Ahmed Merabet, a French Muslim of Algerian descent.
