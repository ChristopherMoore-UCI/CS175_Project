The Namibian government sold almost eight tons of ivory for $1.2 million, said Willem Wijnstekers, the secretary-general of CITES, the international agreement covering the trade of endangered species. More than 108 tons of ivory remain to be auctioned in the next three sales, CITES said. The International Fund for Animal Welfare said a legal ivory trade allows poachers to launder their stocks of illegal ivory. The four auctions taking place over the next two weeks may also encourage other countries with elephant populations to hold their own ivory sales, especially now that they have seen the proceeds Tuesday's sale generated for the Namibian government, Travers said. That means the ivory comes not from poaching or confiscation, but from animals that died naturally or -- in the case of South Africa -- from the period before 1994 when elephant culling was allowed, Vasquez said.
