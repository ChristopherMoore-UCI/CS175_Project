Meyler continues to focus on girls and education in Liberia, meeting with tech giants and innovative education labs to come up with ways to better serve her students at More Than Me. The hardest part for Meyler, who often describes herself as a "big kid," was seeing children abandoned and orphaned by Ebola.
