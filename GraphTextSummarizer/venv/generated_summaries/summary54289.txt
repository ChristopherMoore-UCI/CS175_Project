Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill, in whose home state the disturbances occurred, led a congressional hearing this month that scrutinized programs run by the Pentagon and the Homeland Security and Justice departments to help local police departments obtain surplus military equipment and buy new armor. He also proposes to require local police that have received such equipment in recent years to return it to the Defense Department. The proposed bill would also restrict the Homeland Security and Justice departments' grant programs from giving money to cities to buy drones, surveillance equipment, ballistic helmets and lethal weapons. Coburn wants the Defense Department to seek congressional approval before transferring any new types of equipment under the surplus program and to maintain a public website that reports all transfers. Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Oklahoma, is sponsoring the legislation, which would block state and local police from receiving broad categories of military-grade equipment, including M-16 rifles, MRAP vehicles and camouflage equipment.
