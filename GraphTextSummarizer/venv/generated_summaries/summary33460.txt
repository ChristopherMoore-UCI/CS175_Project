" A spokesman for BA said: "We are very pleased the threat of industrial action has been lifted and that we have reached a point where we can put this dispute behind us." BA's cabin crew employees have been embroiled in an ongoing wage dispute over the past two years and some 6,700 crew participated in 22-days of strikes last year. Unite said a two-year pay rise had also been agreed, giving rises of 4% this year and 3.5% next year, subject to productivity agreements. Unite says it will not be calling for any industrial action following the talks as BA agreed to restore travel concessions to staff who went on strike. Of the 10,000 crew polled, 83% of the 6,981 who returned valid ballot papers voted yes to strike action. Industrial action would have been called within days if the deal had not been negotiated, the Press Association reported.
