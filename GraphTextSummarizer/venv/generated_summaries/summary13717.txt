Cable companies have been slow to update their set-top boxes, and smart TVs haven't caught on in the same way that easy-to-use Apple TV, Chromecast and Roku have. To watch Internet content on the Chromecast, you hit a button on compatible apps from an Android or iOS smartphone or tablet. The Roku Streaming Stick will cost a few bucks more than the Chromecast but includes a dedicated remote control, like other Roku products. It has more content options than a Chromecast but still lags behind the Roku. A third major competitor in the streaming-to-TV space is Apple TV.
