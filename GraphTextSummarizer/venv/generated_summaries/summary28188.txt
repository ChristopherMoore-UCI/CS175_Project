-- The cast of the upcoming film "X-Men: Days of Future Past" made a surprise appearance at Comic-Con this afternoon along with director Bryan Singer. Another can of "Kick-Ass" "The goal was to try and make a film that would bring this cast together by time travel or time displacement of some kind," Singer said. There is a moment, which you'll see in this reel, where these characters come face to face, older self with younger self. "Whenever you're going back in time -- and this is every bit as much a time travel movie as it is an X-Men movie -- there is those risks," Singer said. The cast members who appeared include those from the original "X-Men" movie franchise and those from 2011's X-Men reboot "X:Men: First Class."
