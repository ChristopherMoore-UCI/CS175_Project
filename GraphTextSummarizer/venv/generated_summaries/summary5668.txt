Pakistan's nerves showed as Azhar Ali was run out for five, then James Anderson claimed his second wicket as he bowled Yousuf for a patient 33 and Swann trapped Kamran Akmal leg before wicket for a duck without offering a shot. Pakistan bounced back to win the third Test against England by four wickets at the Oval in London as veteran batsman Mohammed Yousuf completed a successful return to international cricket on Saturday. Pakistan lost an early wicket and then Yousuf came to the crease at 57-2 after Imran Farhat fell to Graeme Swann for a quickfire 39. The tourists, whose country has been devastated by floods, reduced England's series lead to 2-1 ahead of the final match at Lord's starting next Thursday as Yousuf's experience proved vital. England added just one run to their overnight total before Amir dismissed last man Stuart Broad for six.
