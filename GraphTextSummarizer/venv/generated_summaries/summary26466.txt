Two of the 26 people being treated at Bridgeport Hospital are in critical condition, said spokesman John Cappiello. A train heading from New Haven to New York City derailed around 6:10 p.m., hitting the other train in Bridgeport, Connecticut, Metro-North spokeswoman Marjorie Anders said. Because of a bridge replacement project, those two tracks are the only way in and out of New York City by train from that part of Connecticut. A passenger in a middle car of the New York-bound train, Chris Martin, recalled to CNN how his car went dark after the crash, then someone over the intercom "called all the doctors up front. Bridgeport Mayor Bill Finch said such travel headaches could persist for weeks, because the two tracks affected by the derailment -- which are both "shot right now" -- may take weeks to repair.
