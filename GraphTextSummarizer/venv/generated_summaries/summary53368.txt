-- English club Arsenal will be without Robin van Persie and Theo Walcott for their Champions League last-16 second leg with Spanish champions Barcelona, but it is "possible" captain Cesc Fabregas could play. The clash with Barcelona has taken on added significance after Arsenal failed to end their six-year trophy drought thanks to a last-minute Carling Cup defeat against Birmingham at Wembley on Sunday. Van Persie injured his knee scoring in Sunday's League Cup final defeat against Birmingham while Walcott sprained his ankle during the Premier League victory over Stoke City. But Fabregas, who played a key part in Arsenal's thrilling 2-1 victory over Barcelona during the first leg in London, has an outside chance to make the second leg on March 8. Arsenal are looking to avenge last year's 6-3 aggregate defeat by Barcelona at the quarterfinal stage of Europe's premier club competition.
