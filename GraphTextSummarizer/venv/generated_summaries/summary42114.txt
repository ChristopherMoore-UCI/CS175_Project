The last war between North and South lasted for decades and claimed millions of lives. There is little suspense as to the outcome: Every reliable source indicates that South Sudan will vote for separation, dividing Africa's largest country and taking with it some 80 percent of known Sudanese oil reserves. In about 100 days, the people of South Sudan are to vote on whether to declare independence from the government in Khartoum. President Obama joined U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and Vice President Ali Osman Taha of the North and Salva Kiir, leader of the South, in New York last week to highlight the imperatives of peace, while he has also reinforced the American diplomatic presence in the region. Southern Sudan may possess most of the known petroleum reserves, but the pipelines to market for that oil run through the North.
