Visiting Unite For Sight volunteers and local Ghanaian translators work to register patients, identify their eye care needs and provide visual acuity screenings. Through September 2007, Unite For Sight has coordinated and funded more than 1,200 sight-restoring cataract surgeries in the Accra, Ghana region. Having heard stories about them from our partner ophthalmologists and visiting volunteers, I knew that I would see their greatness in action while in Accra, but personally seeing their selfless dedication and commitment to Unite For Sight was even more extraordinary than I had anticipated. Jennifer will be traveling to Ghana and then India, taking volunteers to continue the work of Unite For Sight. Unite For Sight vision screenings are held in very remote locations, where patients have no access to eye care.
