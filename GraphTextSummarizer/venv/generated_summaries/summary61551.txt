The Jacksons also point to a television interview soon after Jackson died in which AEG Live CEO Randy Phillips said AEG Live "hired" Murray. The company's lawyers contend Jackson chose Murray, who had treated him for three years as a family physician, but Jackson lawyers argue the promoters chose to negotiate their own contract with the doctor so they could control him. A so-called "smoking gun" e-mail sent by AEG Live Co-CEO Paul Gongaware 11 days before Jackson died said, "We want to remind (Murray) that it is AEG, not MJ, who is paying his salary. AEG Live lawyers argue they had no way of knowing that Murray -- licensed to practice in four states and never sued for malpractice -- was a risk to Jackson. Were AEG Live executives negligent in dealing with Murray and did their negligence contribute significantly to Jackson's death?
