U.S. Geological Survey scientist David Hill even published a paper in 2011 called, "What is That Mysterious Booming Sound?" In it, he said such sounds are so commonplace in upstate New York, they earned the nickname "Seneca guns." Accompanying the sounds are vibrations that have shaken homes and household objects in the northeast corner of town, city manager Lisa Kuss said. Others include meteorites, a phenomenon known as "booming sands" or even distant thunder, sounds that Hill wrote can be carried for significant distances under proper atmospheric conditions. While the specific source of such sounds is rarely found, natural explanations abound, Hill said. "My bet is on gremlins," one Facebook user jokingly posted to WLUK's Facebook page.
