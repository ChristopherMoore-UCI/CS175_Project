The crest on the River Danube, which has also brought flooding to southern Germany, Austria and Slovakia, is expected to reach southern Hungary on Wednesday and the country's southwest a day later. Floods continued to devastate communities alongside the surging River Elbe in Germany's northeastern Saxony-Anhalt state Wednesday. Record water levels along the Elbe as it makes its way to the North Sea have caused flooding in the Czech Republic, as well as eastern and northern Germany. "One-hundred-and-fifty people refused to be evacuated, but were forced to leave their homes by authorities," a spokesman for Saxony-Anhalt's Interior Ministry in Magdeburg said. Annette Friedebold, the owner of an animal park in Weissewarte, told CNN how she'd been forced to evacuate most of the 400 animals housed there, starting last Tuesday.
