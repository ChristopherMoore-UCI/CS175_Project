In the real world of policing, it's impossible for law enforcement officers -- particularly those who lack the specialized training given to Border Patrol agents -- to make assumptions about one's legal status without taking race and ethnicity into account. I liked the independence and courage he showed in going against the Republican Party establishment by challenging Gov. Charlie Crist in the U.S. Senate race in Florida. The governor is now running for the Senate as an independent, against both Rubio and presumptive Democratic nominee Kendrick Meek. In fact, things were going smoothly for Rubio until Arizonans passed a law intended to deputize state and local police officers to act as surrogate immigration agents. Apparently, his concerns about racial profiling have been assuaged.
