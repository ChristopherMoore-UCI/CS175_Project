-- Former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has said millions of dollars from the "extreme right wing" in the United States helped oust him from government and derailed a peace plan with the Palestinians. Olmert suggested the current Israeli government was content to blame the Palestinians for a reluctance to negotiate, rather than striving for a peace deal which is of great importance to Israel. In an exclusive interview aired Friday with CNN's Christiane Amanpour, Olmert said his attempts to make peace had been "a killer" for him as prime minister. I think that, by the way, in Israel, the majority of the Israelis would have supported my plan, had it come for elections," Olmert said. Olmert was indicted on a variety of corruption charges in 2008 in a probe that dogged his last months in office.
