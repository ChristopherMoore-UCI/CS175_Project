Bethsaida Sandoval, 38, a Royal Caribbean vacation planner, has been charged with 24 counts of burglary across Palm Beach County, including Boca Raton, Jupiter and Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. "This is not normal business practice and Bethsaida Sandoval should not be in the building, or accessing Royal Caribbean computer systems at that time of night," reads the affidavit. Police in Palm Beach County say the employee accessed personal information about reservations to find out when the vacationers would be away. "One common factor was that they were all on vacation with Royal Caribbean." Sandoval allegedly told police that she printed or wrote down personal information on customers and gave the information to Lopez. According to the affidavit, Sandoval was seen entering the Royal Caribbean building after hours, about 1 a.m.
