A small group of GOP candidates who were elected last Tuesday night campaigned on the pledge they would oppose Boehner remaining Speaker. Boehner stripped him of his seat on the Budget committee after a series of splits with GOP leaders in 2012. Social conservatives Huelskamp said he agrees with Boehner's pledge to again pass a series of GOP economic measures next year that the Democratic-led Senate ignored. But several House Republicans and leadership aides all say that numerically "it's a wash" in terms of how big of a group of rabble rousers Boehner can expect to deal with in the next Congress. 'Strong position to persuade' Boehner is "in a strong position to persuade," Oklahoma GOP Rep. Tom Cole told CNN.
