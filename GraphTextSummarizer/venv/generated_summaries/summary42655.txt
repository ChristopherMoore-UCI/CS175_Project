"Because of their extreme environments, they tend to be highly sensitive to temperature changes," said marine biologist James McClintock of the University of Alabama at Birmingham. From krill to king crabs, the collapse of a 160-square-mile portion of the Wilkins Ice Shelf in Antarctica could mean many changes for wildlife at the bottom of the world. Scientists already are observing declines in polar krill populations that could be tied to a decrease in annual winter sea ice. And they might be among the first in the animal kingdom to have to adapt to warming temperatures. With a decline in sea ice, there is less habitat for young krill," McClintock said.
