In 2009, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America allowed member churches to recognize same-sex relationships, but stopped short of creating a churchwide policy or crafting a specific blessing service. Just this summer, the Presbyterian and Methodist churches rejected measures that would have granted formal church recognition to gay relationships. As with civil politics, issues involving homosexuality have roiled American churches for years. -- Episcopal priests will be allowed to conduct services blessing same-sex relationships under a policy approved Tuesday at the church's national convention in Indianapolis. But the Rev. David Thurlow of South Carolina said the policy advocates a "new theology" of human sexuality that is inconsistent with church canons and doctrine.
