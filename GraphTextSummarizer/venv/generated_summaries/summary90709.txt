While Pussy Riot tweeted Sunday that two members fled the country "because of the danger," Pyotr Verzilov, husband of jailed band member Nadezdha Tolokonnikova, would not say Monday whether the two who have fled took part in the February performance in Moscow's Christ the Savior Cathedral. A Russian court this month sentenced three members of the band to two years in prison after they were found guilty of hooliganism for performing a song critical of President Vladimir Putin in a church. The sentencing and conviction of Tolokonnikova, Maria Alyokhina and Yekaterina Samutsevich triggered international condemnation. Verzilov would not say whether the two have formally applied for asylum in another country. -- Two members of the female punk rock band Pussy Riot have fled Russia, the group said.
