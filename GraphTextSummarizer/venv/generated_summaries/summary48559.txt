The Oscar-winning actress further cemented her superstar status Tuesday with an appearance on "Sesame Street" to talk about skin with Elmo -- who, it turns out, has red skin under his iconic red fur. When Elmo notices that Nyong'o's skin is "a beautiful brown color," Nyong'o replies, "That's the thing I love most about skin ... skin comes in lots of beautiful shades and colors. The "love the skin you're in" line comes at the very end of the clip, after a conversation about how skin protects us and allows us to feel things. Lupita Nyong'o named People's most beautiful person of 2014 Accepting an award in February at the seventh annual Black Women in Hollywood Luncheon, Nyong'o told the crowd of her childhood struggle with self-hate and her prayers for lighter skin. And now she can say, as she told her young viewers on "Sesame Street," "I love my skin."
