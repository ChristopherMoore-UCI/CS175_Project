The German was outshone by McLaren's Lewis Hamilton in Q1 and Q2, but had set the fastest time of one minute and 13.556 seconds when Q3 was halted for more than half an hour after Mexican rookie Sergio Perez slid into the barriers of the street circuit. The Englishman clocked a best lap of 1:13.997 to head off 2010 Monaco winner Mark Webber in the second Red Bull (1:14.019) while final practice pacesetter Fernando Alonso of Ferrari was fourth in 1:14.483. Williams' veteran Brazilian driver Rubens Barrichello, four times a runner-up in Monaco, will start 11th behind Russia's Petrov if Perez cannot take to the wheel. Perez, who was taken to hospital, is unlikely to race on Sunday after suffering concussion and a leg injury, but his Sauber team said he had escaped serious harm. The British driver went above Mercedes' Nico Rosberg -- who crashed at the same place as Perez in Saturday's final practice session -- but could lose that spot after running across a chicane in his desperate attempt to move up the grid and attracting the interest of the race stewards.
