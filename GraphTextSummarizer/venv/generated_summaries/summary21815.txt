At that rate, Brown could complete the labor in mid-October and possibly be free from probation requirements by the end of the year. Singer Chris Brown has been booted from court-ordered drug rehab and taken into custody by Los Angeles County Sheriff's deputies, a sheriff's spokesman confirmed Friday. He pleaded guilty to felony assault in June 2009, which resulted in a sentence of five years of probation and 1,400 hours of community labor. Although he completed that program last month, the judge ordered him to remain a resident at the Malibu treatment facility until another hearing on April 23. Brown's probation officer reported at a hearing last month that the singer "continues to make great improvement" in dealing with anger, stress and drugs, but the judge decided he could not go free until after his trial for an assault charge in Washington on April 17.
