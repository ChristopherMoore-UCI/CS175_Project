An anonymous Bay Area buyer snatched up the "Butte nugget" -- named for the Northern California county in which it was discovered this summer -- at the San Francisco Fall Antiques Show. " McCarthy told the Chronicle that the buyer is "a prominent Bay Area collector" who specializes in historical items. The huge hunk of bullion went on public display Thursday, piquing the interest of hundreds who flocked to the show to get a peek. A more than 6-pound chunk of gold sold over the weekend for $400,000, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. "Nuggets like this don't come along every day," said David McCarthy, the nugget's appraiser.
