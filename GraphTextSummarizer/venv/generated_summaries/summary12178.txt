"All allegations of harassment against Mr. Cain are completely false," said a statement from Cain's campaign after Bialek's accusation. A Chicago woman said Monday that Herman Cain sexually groped her in 1997 when Cain was head of the National Restaurant Association. "Mr. Cain has never harassed anyone." Bialek is the fourth accuser to come forward with allegations of inappropriate behavior by Cain. Politico first published a report last week claiming that two female employees at the restaurant association accused Cain of inappropriate behavior during his tenure there.
