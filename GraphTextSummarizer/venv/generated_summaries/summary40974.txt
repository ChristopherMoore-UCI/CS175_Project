It has had to fight off the challenge of BT Sport, a subsidiary operation of BT Group plc, the British multinational telecommunications services company, to win the biggest rights packages on the last two auctions of EPL rights. "With increases already achieved from domestic live and highlights rights deals and anticipated strong growth in overseas deals, the benefits of the new deals for Premier League clubs will be substantial," he told CNN. The new round of deals from 2016/17, will deliver record amounts to clubs. It represents a massive increase on the $4.59B paid by the same broadcasters to acquire the equivalent set of rights from 2013-16 and will make the EPL the second richest league in the world behind the National Football League (NFL) in the United States. Announcing the deal Tuesday, EPL chief executive Richard Scudamore said the clubs had delivered "competitive and compelling football" which had helped to increase viewing figures as well as live attendances.
