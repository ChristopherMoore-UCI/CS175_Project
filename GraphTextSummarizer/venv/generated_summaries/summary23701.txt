A squad car's headlights shine on Morrison as he walks away from a dark driveway in the background, where he had pulled over a car carrying Ramirez, who Morrison thought was a suspect in an armed robbery and shooting. Despite the emotional breakdown -- and despite the inquest clearing Morrison of wrongdoing -- responses to a message posted by the Billings police chief on Facebook indicate there are plenty who feel Morrison used excessive force. Both times Morrison faced an inquiry and the shootings were ruled justifiable, partly based on testimony analyzing the video, according to local media reports. It's ugly, as a dash cam from Morrison's patrol car reminds us. Morrison had just learned Ramirez, whom he shot three times, was unarmed.
