Dead.'" CNN iReport: Parents of teens share driving tips The trouble, said company President and CEO Paul Zimmerman, is that a lot of parents don't know it exists. People are doing dangerous things out there Another big challenge is convincing teens -- and adults for that matter -- that talking on a phone is just as dangerous as driving under the influence. Iowa is making the software available free of charge (it typically costs about $4 per month) to teens up to 17 as they apply to get their licenses at the Department of Motor Vehicles, said Zimmerman. Getting to teens as they get their license or as they are insured under their parents' plan is key, says Zimmerman, who is a father of two teens.
