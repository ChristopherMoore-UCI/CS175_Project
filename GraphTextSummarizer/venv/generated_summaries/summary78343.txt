-- Robin Thicke's summertime hit "Blurred Lines" is an illegal rip-off of Marvin Gaye's "Got to Give It Up," Gaye's children claim in court documents filed Wednesday. Gaye's heirs not only accuse Thicke and "Blurred Lines" co-writers Pharrell Williams and "T.I." Clifford Harris Jr. of copying Gaye's song, but they also contend Sony-ATV failed to meet its responsibility to protect the copyright. The Gaye family counterclaim includes Thicke quotes from an interview with Billboard Magazine published in July. Maybe that's because it was originally a Marvin Gaye song ("Got To Give It Up") and Marvin Gaye is ... awesome. Thicke's inital lawsuit contends there are "no similarities" between his song and Gaye's "other than commonplace musical elements" "Being reminiscent of a 'sound' is not copyright infringement," his complaint argues.
