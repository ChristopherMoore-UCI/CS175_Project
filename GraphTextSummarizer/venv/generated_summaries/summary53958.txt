Russia and China have blocked U.N. Security Council attempts to take action to end the conflict and force al-Assad to step down, stressing that outside powers shouldn't be picking Syria's leaders. Ahmed Moaz al-Khatib, head of the Syrian National Coalition, met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on the sidelines of an international security conference in Munich, Germany, Russia's state-run news agency RIA Novosti reported. He said then that Russia had overlooked atrocities in Syria, and must condemn the crimes before his group can engage in talks. The opposition chief also met in Munich with U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, who had harsh words for the Syrian leadership. Russia has criticized Western powers, including the United States, that have recognized the opposition as Syria's rightful leadership.
