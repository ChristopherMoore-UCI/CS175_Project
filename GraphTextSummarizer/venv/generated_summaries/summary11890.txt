Irma Navarro, 37, was arrested last week on suspicion of willful child cruelty, according to a statement from the Santa Ana Police Department. Another one of her children was being watched by a baby sitter, while the third was at school at the time of the incident, police said. Navarro allegedly shackled her son because she did not want him "running the streets and getting into trouble or mixed up with the wrong group of kids while she was at work," the statement said. All three have been placed in protective custody by social services. A witness told police she and a friend had noticed the boy leaning against a tree and crying.
