There is a slim chance of snow on Thursday, followed by days of sunshine and temperatures near 40 by Monday. The National Weather Service warned that flooding could be an issue, especially across the lower Ohio Valley and western Mid-Atlantic regions. Cities in southeast Missouri, western Kentucky, northern Tennessee and western Pennsylvania might get 2 to 4 inches. More snow is expected from this system, but it's only likely to be 1 inch Wednesday as the forecast models indicate the majority of snow will stay south of the city. Arkansas, northern Mississippi and western Tennessee will get the brunt of the icy weather.
