"Not only are the Indian airlines pirating staff from each other, but India is very close to the Gulf where airlines have no problem with money and no problem with pirating staff from just about everywhere. "The carrier has been one of the main culprits in terms of discounting." M Shivkumar, the head of finance at Jet Airways, India's biggest carrier, recently identified Air India's price war as a key factor for the problems in Indian aviation. "The growth has been so rapid in the Indian aviation space, that airlines have had difficulties keeping up with the staffing needed in terms of pilots, maintenance workers and engineers," Ballantyne said. According to Tom Ballantyne, the chief correspondent with Oriental Aviation, where once Indian aviation suffered from too little competition, now it suffers from too much. With an Indian rupee last week dropping to its lowest level in history, recently hitting 52.50 against the U.S. dollar, the pain is set to increase of Indian airlines.
