"He made the IMF not only effective, but credible." Strauss-Kahn has been a force in French politics for a quarter century, first winning election to that country's National Assembly -- the lower house of parliament -- in 1986. The "worst-case scenario" is that Strauss-Kahn's removal as IMF head would lead to a "shock that sets the global economy back," she said. One year later, he was named managing director of the IMF. As head of the IMF, Strauss-Kahn pulled in an annual tax-free salary of more than $420,000, according to a 2007 statement from the organization. Strauss-Kahn issued a statement after the investigation, noting that he had "apologized for it to the (board of directors), to the staff of the IMF and to my family," as well as to the employee.
