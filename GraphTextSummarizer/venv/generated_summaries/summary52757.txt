Many techies took Gore's side, saying that while neither he nor any other single person created the Internet, he was, in fact instrumental in helping build out Internet infrastructure. " Obama's no 'strategy yet' comment sparks a political uproar Here are a few times when other U.S. politicians found themselves in similar territory: President George H.W. Bush and the 'amazing' supermarket scanner Born into a wealthy family, schooled at an elite Massachusetts boarding school and then Yale, the nation's 41st President had more than a couple of strikes against him when it came to an elitist, out-of-touch public image. "What he was amazed about was the ability of the scanner to take that torn label and reassemble it." President Jimmy Carter and the 'malaise' speech Carter never uttered the word "malaise" in his July 15, 1979, televised address on what he saw as a growing "crisis of confidence" in the country. Historian Sean Wilentz wrote in his 2008 book, "The Age of Reagan" that Carter "appeared to be abdicating his role as leader and blaming the people themselves for their own afflictions." While it was just a joke made by a man well-known for his love of quips and never meant for public consumption, the comment embodied beliefs among critics of Reagan as a dangerous hawk obsessed with doing battle against an "Evil Empire," his finger eagerly hovering over the trigger of America's nuclear arsenal.
