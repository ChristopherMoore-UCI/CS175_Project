FDA: Problems found at another facility of sister company of pharmacy tied to meningitis Federal authorities have launched a criminal investigation into the practices at the Framingham-based company, and the state pharmacy board has voted to permanently revoke the company's license to operate as well as the licenses of the company's three principal pharmacists. According to health agencies, the compounding center did not follow proper sterilization procedures and distributed its products without knowing whether they had passed sterility tests. In October, the pharmacy board, which is part of the state's Department of Public Health, said it had "identified serious deficiencies and significant violations of pharmacy law and regulations that clearly placed the public's health at risk." Patients contracted fungal meningitis -- which results in inflammation of the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord -- after their spines were injected with a contaminated, preservative-free steroid called methylprednisolone acetate, health officials have said. Treatment, which can have toxic side effects, is expected to continue for infected patients for "many months," Dr. John Jernigan told reporters last month.
