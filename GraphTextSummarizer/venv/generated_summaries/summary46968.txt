-- Celebrity chef Paula Deen drew a standing ovation from a crowd of several hundred people Sunday in Miami Beach as she made her fourth public appearance since a controversy over her admitted use of a racial epithet in the past. While Deen was preparing one of her famous dumpling dishes, she invited celebrity chef Robert Irvine to the stage, and Irvine then jokingly said to her "you apologized. Through her representative, Deen said that attending the South Beach event this year, as she has for almost a decade, was like a homecoming for her. Deen also said she was grateful for having the opportunity of helping the festival raise millions of dollars for Florida International University's Chaplin School of Hospitality and Tourism Management. Looking thinner than she has in the past and appearing overjoyed by the exuberant reception, Deen said she used her months out of the spotlight to spend a lot of quality time with her grandchildren.
