An Australian coroner ruled Friday that there was enough evidence to put Gabe Watson on trial for the death of Tina Watson, who was 26 when she drowned in October 2003 while diving around a historic shipwreck in Australia's Great Barrier Reef. Watson, 31, told police that his new bride appeared to panic 45 feet underwater and that he "looked into her eyes and saw her eyes were wide open, but there was no response," Townsville Coroner David Glascow said in his inquest findings. Tina Watson, background right, lies motionless after she drowned in 2003 while diving in the Great Barrier Reef. Glascow, however, cited what he said were inconsistencies in Watson's statements to investigators. The insurance company confirmed that Gabe Watson inquired about her life insurance policy after her death, the coroner said.
