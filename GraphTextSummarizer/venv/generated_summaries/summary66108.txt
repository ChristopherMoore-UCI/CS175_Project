-- Amanda Bynes is "making great strides towards recovery" from mental illness, her parents said Monday. The actress has been moved from UCLA Medical Center, where she had been treated since late July, to a private treatment facility outside Los Angeles for "specialized treatment," the statement from Rick and Lynn Bynes said. Bynes, 27, was placed under an involuntary psychiatric hold two months ago after she was involved in a disturbance in a residential neighborhood in Thousand Oaks, California. In addition, she also has a DUI case pending in Southern California, while a pair of separate hit-and-run charges against her were dismissed last year. Her mother was granted conservatorship over her daughter under a California mental health law.
