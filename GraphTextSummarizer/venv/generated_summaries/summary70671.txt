Many men still prefer shaving with straight razors, although safety razors date back to at least 1762. The real winners in this transition from wet shaving with soap and a brush to electric razors were badgers. Shaving goes electric People have been patenting and trying to market electric razors since 1900, but at first they met with little success. The real arms race started in the 1960s After years of losing market share to their electric competition, Gillette finally hit upon a winning innovation in 1960 when it introduced stainless steel blades. MIT professor William Nickerson joined up with Gillette to figure out a way to stamp the blades out of sheets of high-carbon steel, and by 1903 they had their first batch of razors ready to take on America's beards.
