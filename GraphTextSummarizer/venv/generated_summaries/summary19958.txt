Fox announced Tuesday that "The X-Files," the series about the paranormal that ran for nine seasons in the '90s and early '00s, is returning for a special six-episode "event. " 'The X-Files' was not only a seminal show for both the studio and the network, it was a worldwide phenomenon that shaped pop culture -- yet remained a true gem for the legions of fans who embraced it from the beginning. Vince Gilligan, who later created "Breaking Bad," got his start on "The X-Files" and occasionally paid tribute to the show on his later series. We're ecstatic to give them the next thrilling chapter of Mulder and Scully they've been waiting for," Fox executives Dana Walden and Gary Newman said in a statement. "The X-Files" concerned Mulder, an FBI agent who believes in paranormal phenomena, and Scully, who served as a check on his impulses.
