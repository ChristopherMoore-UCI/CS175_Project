-- Every third Monday in January we gather as Americans to commemorate the values and beliefs -- as well as the ultimate sacrifice -- of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. His tireless advocacy for civil rights, equal protection under the law, labor rights, and for the ultimate realization of our essential creed that we are "one nation, endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness" is taught in every school in America, and is now enshrined in a memorial on the National Mall. Southern governors and those in Washington comfortable with the status quo hid behind arguments about "states rights." In a 1957 speech titled "Give Us The Ballot," Dr. King spoke plainly about the imperative of equal voting rights. Literacy tests, poll taxes, and grandfather clauses: many insidious techniques were used by certain states to restrict, confuse, and write off, marginalize and disenfranchise so many eligible citizens from voting simply because of the color of their skin. The latest vogue in anti-suffrage legislation is mandatory photo ID laws.
