The department says it is taking comprehensive steps to improve, including programs for primary care and mental health care for female veterans, along with having a female veterans' program manager in each of its medical facilities. The median age of female veterans is much lower than their male counterparts: 47, compared with 61, according to Veterans Affairs data. The number of female veterans enrolled for medical care with the department is expected to increase by 30 percent in the next five years, it predicts. While noting that the department has taken steps to upgrade its services and facilities to meet the needs of female veterans, investigators found that it stumbled on some more basic elements. -- Department of Veterans Affairs medical facilities do not consistently offer the level of services and infrastructure necessary to properly treat the growing number of female veterans, a government investigation concludes.
