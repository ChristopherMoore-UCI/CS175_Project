The charge centers around a one-way ticket that authorities allege Abdel Hameed Shehadeh purchased from New York City to Islamabad, Pakistan. Shehadeh -- who was born and raised in New York -- told authorities that he wanted to enlist for career opportunities and benefits, the Justice Department said in a news release. Shehadeh will be prosecuted in the Eastern District of New York, the Justice Department said. The complaint also says Shehadeh purchased an airline ticket to travel to Amman, Jordan, in October 2008, but was not allowed to enter the country by Jordanian authorities. But he later admitted to FBI agents in Hawaii that he bought the ticket in order to join a fighting group such as the Taliban, according to a criminal complaint unsealed Monday in New York.
