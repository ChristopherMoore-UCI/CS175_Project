They were seized from the Bell City Motel by the county's Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, according to executive director Robin Kuchma. An exasperated employee who answered the phone at the Bell City Motel pleaded to be left alone before hanging up when reached by CNN Friday night. The incident comes just weeks after two young brothers were strangled to death by a large, exotic python as they slept at a friend's house in Campbellton, New Brunswick. The Children's Aid Society of Brant is investigating the welfare of those children, Brantford Police Sgt. Though it's against the law to own a python in Brantford, no arrests have been made and no charges have been filed; nor have any names have been released by authorities.
