Samuel Eto'o scored twice, with the returning Wesley Sneijder, Thiago Motta and Esteban Cambiasso also on target as Leonardo's side moved up to third place in the table, five points behind leaders Milan but with a game in hand. Serie A top scorer Edinson Cavani opened the scoring with his 18th league goal of the season and Jose Sosa added a second in injury time for the home side. However, Antonio Floro Flores levelled on the stroke of half time when he was on hand to fire home after Mathieu Flamini deflected the ball into his path. And Inter Milan increased their lead even further when Motta headed home from close range. However, the home side went into the break 2-1 ahead when Eto'o fired a shot that slipped through the hands of goalkeeper Sergio.
