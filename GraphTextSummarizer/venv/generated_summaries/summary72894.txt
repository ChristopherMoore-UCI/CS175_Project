The region's health department said economic reasons were the predominant reason that woman have abortions. A northern Italian region has approved a measure to pay women from low-income families not to have abortions. That compares to 195,743 in England and Wales last year, according to the British Department of Health, and 846,181 in the United States in 2006, according to the most recent figures reported by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The option of accepting the check will be presented to women in abortion clinics during the consultations they have prior to having an abortion, the site said. "We want to help the family, maternity, and birth rate, removing the obstacles as much as possible, beginning with those of an economic nature that make it more difficult to choose in favor of life," said the region's president, Roberto Formigone.
