-- Even as anti-American violence eased Saturday around the Muslim world, tensions remained high -- stoked, in some nations, by the prospect of U.S. troops arriving to protect U.S. diplomatic missions. To that end, U.S. officials said earlier this week that Marine teams would be dispatched to protect U.S. diplomatic missions in Libya, Yemen and Sudan in the wake of anti-Western unrest in those countries. Clinton demands Arab Spring nations protect embassies Yemen's parliament issued a statement early Sunday demanding U.S. Marines leave the Arab country immediately, calling the presence of any foreign forces -- and U.S. troops in particular -- "unacceptable." -- All nonemergency personnel and relatives of State Department personnel at U.S. missions in Khartoum, Sudan, and Tunis, Tunisia, have been ordered to leave and travel warnings have been issued for American citizens for both those nations, Nuland from the U.S. State Department said Saturday. Yet even with this relative break, the furor has not gone away completely, nor has concern over safety and security at U.S. embassies.
