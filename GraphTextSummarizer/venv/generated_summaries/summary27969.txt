Investigators in the case have uncovered a series of text messages between Obermiller and her boyfriend, identified by police and by Obermiller's parents as 20-year-old Robert Young of Norwalk, that appear to be coordinating when she would be picked up from her grandparents' home in the early morning hours of June 7, Fulton said. Fulton said police believe Abbi Obermiller left her grandparents' home on her own accord late on the night of June 6, but said detectives are "concerned" that the situation may have changed and that there is a "possibility she is in danger. According to Fulton, Obermiller repeatedly sent messages to Young asking, "How much longer?" "We do believe that Bobby does know where she's at, he just doesn't want to tell us," Obermiller's mother, Rose Obermiller, told HLN's "Prime News" on Monday night. Fulton also said one of Obermiller's friends told police she saw Abbi wearing a wedding ring.
