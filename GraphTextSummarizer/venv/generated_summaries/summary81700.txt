" Black boxes don't provide the whole picture for aviation accident investigators, though. Peter Goelz, a former managing director of the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), said flight recorders can be difficult to pinpoint, even if they have locator beacons. What do black boxes contain? The NTSC's final report into Adam Air Flight 574 -- which crashed in Indonesian waters on New Year's Day, 2007, killing all 102 people on board -- came out more than a year after the disaster. The report on Flight QZ8501 is likely to take at least year to cover all the different angles, according to Ross.
