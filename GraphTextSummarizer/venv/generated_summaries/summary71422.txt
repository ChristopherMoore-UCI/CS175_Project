Bernadine Nelson, left, and Gretchen Wilson want to raise awareness about the importance of adult education. Since Wilson received her GED in May 2008, Nelson said, several people have already called her, citing the singer's achievement as inspiration for obtaining theirs. For Wilson, Nelson's dedication to bringing the importance of education to the forefront of people's lives is making a difference. Wilson reached out to the local adult education center in Lebanon, Tennessee, where she met Nelson, the center's director. A year later, Wilson received her GED, crediting the achievement to Nelson's support and encouragement.
