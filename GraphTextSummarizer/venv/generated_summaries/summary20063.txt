Among respondents who did favor physical punishment, men outnumbered women in every country except Canada, France, and India. Respondents in all 16 countries in this month's global survey picked a good talking to as the best tactic for teaching a lesson, by a wide margin. Two other traditional forms of discipline - sending kids to their rooms and spanking - were the least favored choices in all but two countries. Not a single woman in the United States expressed a preference for spanking. See the full set of results here.
