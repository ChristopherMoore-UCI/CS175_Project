British newspaper reports Friday highlighted concerns over the training given to G4S recruits and the use of thousands of young people in security roles. She said it became clear Wednesday that G4S was not able to provide all the security staff it had promised to the organizers of the London Olympic Games. -- The chairman of the London 2012 organizing group Friday rejected concerns over security staffing ahead of the Olympic Games, which start in two weeks. Young people do a "fantastic job" in a similar role at the annual Wimbledon tennis championships, and there's no reason to think they won't perform well at London 2012, the spokesman said. "There is no question of Olympic security being compromised," May said.
