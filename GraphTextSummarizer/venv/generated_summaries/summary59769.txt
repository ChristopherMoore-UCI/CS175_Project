Officer Steve Arkell was fatally shot by Michael Nolan, 47, according to New Hampshire Attorney General Joseph Foster. "I join all Granite Staters in mourning the loss of Brentwood police officer Steve Arkell, who died tonight doing his job, protecting his community," she said. -- A powerful explosion tore through a duplex in Brentwood, New Hampshire, Monday afternoon, after a man shot and killed a police officer who responded to a domestic dispute there, authorities said. A second officer responded to the scene but was driven away by gunfire, Foster said. The incident is being investigated by the state and federal authorities, according to Foster.
