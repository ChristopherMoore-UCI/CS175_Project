A decade later, the mysterious "Snake Man" -- better known as 30-year-old contortionist Lazarus Gitu -- is now set to perform on New York's Broadway, one of the star acts in Ruddle's spectacular circus show, "Mother Africa. An orphan whose mother had died from Aids and father from old age, Gitu learned to bend his body into incredible positions from watching other performers busking. Or at least, that's how it seemed to circus manager Winston Ruddle when he first saw the homeless boy dressed head-to-toe in a snake skin suit, performing on the streets of Mombasa, Kenya. " The freakishly flexible teen became something of a legend on the streets of Mombasa, and when Ruddle came to the city looking for performers for his new circus troupe, he was quickly pointed in the direction of the "Snake Man. "The circus has changed the lives of many street boys," said Gitu.
