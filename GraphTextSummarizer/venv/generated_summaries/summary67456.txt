-- A beer-tasting cruise around New York's Lower Manhattan fizzled Saturday when the tour company's sailboat ran aground near the Statue of Liberty. The "Craft Beer Tasting Sail" takes place aboard the Clipper City, a replica of a 19th-century schooner operated by Manhattan By Sail. None of the 121 passengers and nine crew members suffered injuries, CNN affiliate WABC reported, but it took about an hour and a half for the Coast Guard, fire department, police and the National Park Service to get the passengers back to land. "He got stuck on the reef, and then all of a sudden the boat stopped and nothing was happening," passenger Brandy Hamm told WABC. Passengers are promised magnificent views of the New York skyline while sampling locally brewed beers.
