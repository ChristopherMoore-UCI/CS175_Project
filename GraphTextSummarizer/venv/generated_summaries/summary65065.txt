-- "Unguarded" with Rachel Nichols premieres tonight at 10:30 p.m. ET and CNN's newest host sat down with CNN Digital to talk about hot-button issues surrounding athletes, her experiences as a woman in sports broadcasting and why "Unguarded" is far from your typical sports show. Rachel Nichols: There's all kinds of sports shows and most of them are on sports networks. Do you feel certain camaraderie with other women in sports broadcasting? I think that as we see more people talk about it in society and talk openly in society, we'll see the same thing reflected in sports and I think that it's fantastic that people are comfortable talking about who they are as people and the fact that sports is becoming more accepting of that is a terrific thing and something we should celebrate. I like the fact that CNN is saying, "Hey, the broader audience is interested in sports, along with their finance and everything else, and we're going to be that component." CNN: You were in China interviewing LeBron James.
