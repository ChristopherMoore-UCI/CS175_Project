Together Blas and Garcia make up the odd couple of popular science -- "I make the money, she spends it," quips the laconic Blas -- and while Garcia has devoted her life to science, Blas is as well-versed in the gospels as he is corporate life. Divided into five interlinked galleries, from "The Atom" all the way to "The Universe" and everything in between (described by Garcia as "nature in scale"), the aim is to make science more accessible and inspiring to a new generation. "It's not secret, the Filipino public largely perceive science as very cold and should be left in labs, but science is too important to leave to scientists alone," said Garcia. Compared to Garcia, he takes a more charitable view of the teaching of science in the Philippines but realizes more needs to be done to inspire the next Philippine Faraday. He holds a masters degree in theology and was the Southeast Asia president of U.S. food corporation Sara Lee for Southeast Asia until 2000.
