A small team of investigators from the Halo Corp. is due to arrive in Madrid on Tuesday to search for the San Diego State University student, Austin Taylor Bice, who went missing after a night out with friends, said his father, Larry Bice. Bice was studying in Madrid at the University of Carlos III, which has 18,000 students, including about 220 Americans, the school's director of international relations, Carlos Lopez Terradas, told CNN. And I think the problem was he got a little bit overconfident and decided that he wanted to go it alone, go back to the house by himself and that was the problem," said Juan Gabriel Paredes, a family member who came to Madrid from Wichita, Kansas, to help Bice's father in the search. A family member last Saturday told CNN that contrary to earlier reports, Bice was not refused entry to the discotheque by doormen and was not drunk, although "he had a few beers." "People we've talked to say if it were bad, it would have shown up right away," Bice's father told CNN on Thursday in an off-camera interview.
