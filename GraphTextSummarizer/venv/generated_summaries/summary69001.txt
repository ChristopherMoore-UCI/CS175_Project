But with the rise of the ultra-violent Islamist group ISIS in Syria, the Turkish government increasingly came under criticism at home and abroad for not doing enough to stop jihadists from going through Turkey to get into Syria. At the same time, Turkish border guards looked the other way, taking few steps to stop activists, volunteers and journalists from crossing into Syria. Police didn't elaborate, other than to say in a statement that they "now have reason to believe that (the girls) are no longer in Turkey" and have crossed into neighboring Syria, parts of which have been taken over by the Islamist terror group. In a report on border security released last year, the Turkish Prime Minister's office said, "It is easier to prevent people suspected of being members of radical groups from entering into Turkey than it is to prevent them from exiting from the Syrian border of Turkey." Three teenage British girls suspected of traveling from London to Turkey with the goal of joining ISIS are now believed to have made it to their target country -- war-torn Syria -- London's Metropolitan Police said Tuesday.
