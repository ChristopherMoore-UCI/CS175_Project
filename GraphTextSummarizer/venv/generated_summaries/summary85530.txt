The 366 cartograms (statistical maps) which make up the book twist, shrink and distend countries and continents into all sorts of shapes and sizes. For ease of visual comparison, territories are split into 12 geographical regions -- e.g. blue for North America, brown for Northern Africa -- and shading marks out specific countries. John Pritchard, research assistant at University of Sheffield and part of the team working on the project, told CNN: "I think the maps of disease are particularly shocking and bring home the scale of the problem in Africa better than a table of statistics does." Indeed, the map of malaria deaths is striking: 94 percent of deaths from malaria occur in Africa, making the continent appear like a vast bloated blob. Team members are currently working on a map of languages and soon hope to be producing animated maps. "We have a series of maps that show deaths at various stages, which would be particularly suited to an animation, and we now have a PhD student looking at extending the Web site, including ways of mapping flow."
