Paul Fronstin, a senior research associate with the Employee Benefit Research Institute, said cost sites such as New Choice Health are crude tools because they don't tell people with traditional plans what they'll pay out of pocket. Sixteen state hospital associations operate Web sites that allow comparison shopping for such inpatient procedures as appendectomies, maternity stays and knee or hip replacements: Georgia, Iowa, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin. But Brad Myers, co-founder of New Choice Health, said health care and car buying are a lot more similar than many people think. New Choice Health gives you more than 50 facilities, with prices ranging from $550 to $1,200. Pennsylvania has detailed price information on cardiac and joint replacement surgeries on its Health Care Cost Containment Council Web site, but the data are several years old.
