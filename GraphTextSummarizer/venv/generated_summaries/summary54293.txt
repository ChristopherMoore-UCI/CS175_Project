Unions call the move unfair, though France's government say it is critical to keep public finances in order. The pension plan is the latest in a continuing round of moves by President Nicolas Sarkozy's administration to pare down France's deficit and curtail government spending. While many nations in Europe and elsewhere have undertaken or proposed major cuts, such moves are especially significant in France, where historically one in four jobs has been tied to the public sector. France's Interior Ministry estimated that 560,000 people demonstrated, while unions -- six of which called for the protest, along with another one planned for November 6 -- put the number at a much higher 2 million. Yves le Goff, a spokesman for the French Union of Petroleum Industries, said industry leaders planned to meet Friday afternoon to discuss the situation.
