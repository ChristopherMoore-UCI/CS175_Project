"Alternatively, A&E's conduct constitutes reverse palming off, in that consumers believe that Hajn is selling Duck Dynasty related apparel." Hajn lawyers sent a cease-and-desist letter to A&E in early June, but the network is still marketing the men's, women's and children's clothing with the trademarked slogan, the lawsuit said. "A&E generated $400 million in revenues from sales of Duck Dynasty branded merchandise at Wal-Mart in 2013 alone," the suit said. "A&E's conduct constitutes clear acts of unfair competition that risks considerable consumer confusion in that customers purchasing apparel from A&E believe that these goods are affiliated, sponsored, endorsed or related to Hajn," the suit said. -- When Uncle Si Robertson declared on "Duck Dynasty" that "My favorite color is camo" it spurred a line of clothing sold to the A&E show's fans, according to a federal lawsuit filed Tuesday. A&E sells the apparel through merchandising deals with retail outlets such as Sears, Wal-Mart, Kohl's, Sports Authority and Target, as well as online, the complaint said.
