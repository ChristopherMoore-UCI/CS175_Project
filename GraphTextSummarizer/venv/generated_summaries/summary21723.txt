But the first Indian-American winner of Miss America and Chen's candid admission reflect the evolution of American beauty, which is now less about assimilation than it is about the freedom of choice. At the same time, she spun the traditional notion of American beauty on its head. Critics seemed to emphasize that her Indian heritage -- she was born in New York to parents from the southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh -- and American patriotism could not occupy the same space, no matter how genuine her display. And both women reveal that each of their definitions of beauty, to varying degrees, is rooted in the idea of individual choice -- a concept that, for better or worse, is as American as it gets. Ultimately, whether it is Julie Chen or Nina Davuluri, Miss Kansas or Miss New York, I'm grateful that they all set the stage for my own story: the daughter of Indian immigrants, born and raised in Japan and educated in the United States.
