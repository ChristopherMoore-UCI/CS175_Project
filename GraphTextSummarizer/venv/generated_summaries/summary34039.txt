-- A North Korean rocket slated for launch sometime early next month can be clearly seen in a satellite photograph taken Sunday. The satellite imagery, obtained by the Institute for Science and International Security from DigitalGlobe, shows the rocket at the Musudan-ri launch site in northeastern North Korea, casting a shadow on the ground below. Both countries are believed by the United States and other Western nations to be trying to acquire nuclear capability. The North Korean government says it will launch a commercial satellite atop a rocket sometime between April 4 and April 8. Watch how the U.S. is responding to a planned launch Â» Japan recently mobilized its missile defense system -- an unprecedented step -- in response to the planned North Korean launch, Japanese officials said.
