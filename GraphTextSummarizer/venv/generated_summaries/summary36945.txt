Reddit got a traffic spike of about 30% in traffic in August/September, due to an influx of Digg users responding to the the spectacular failure of Digg's redesign, according to Reddit engineer Jeremy Edberg. (WIRED)  -- Reddit, the community news sharing site, has now joined the billion-page-per-month club, having served up some 1,000,404,480 pages to almost 14 million unique visitors in January, as measured by Google Analytics. Reddit, with a staff of about 10 now, has seen an extraordinary rise in traffic -- quadrupling page views since January 2010. Reddit vs. Digg rivalry by the numbers While the front page is still the most popular part of the site, Reddit also has a wide collection of "sub-reddits" dedicated to particular topics and communities, including the not-to-be missed IAMA. That means Reddit, once largely seen as a geekier also-ran to Digg, has now handily surpassed its better-funded rival in traffic.
