Critics say the number of uninsured Americans cited in the Families USA report is misleading. But Holtz-Eakin thinks Families USA is exaggerating the numbers to make a political point the day before the White House summit. The number of Americans without health insurance reported by Families USA is much higher than those reported by the U.S. Census Bureau. "The huge number of people without health coverage is worse than an epidemic," Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA, said in a press release. With respect to health care reform, "the cost of doing nothing is too high," says Families USA.
