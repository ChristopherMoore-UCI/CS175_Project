Scott also asked all university presidents to remind their students, faculty and staff "how detrimental hazing can be." Kratzer said University of Florida authorities have worked for some time to eliminate hazing, and there has been a "heightened concern" since the death at FAMU. "Alpha Phi Alpha does not condone hazing! -- The University of Florida has temporarily suspended its chapter of the Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity after learning about a hazing incident involving fraternity members, a university spokeswoman said. However, students at the university said hazing still occurs at fraternities and sororities. " Dave Kratzer, Florida's vice president for student affairs, said, "This was not a case that we know of that anyone went to the hospital -- thank goodness." "It's not in the realm of seriousness on the far end of things, when you think about what could have occurred with hazing, and we want to stop it now," Kratzer told CNN.
