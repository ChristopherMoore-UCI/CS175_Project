-- It turns out that the military regime in Myanmar is soccer-crazy and even pondered buying world-famous club Manchester United, according to a U.S. diplomatic cable obtained by WikiLeaks and published by the Guardian newspaper in Britain. Turns out Than Shwe is a United fan. The embassy's contacts said the creation of the football league "may be a way for the regime to distract the people from ongoing political and economic problems." As for Than Shwe's grandson, his dream of sitting in the directors' box at Old Trafford, the stadium where Manchester United plays, may have been dashed. "One well-connected source reports that the grandson wanted Than Shwe to offer $1 billion for Manchester United" says the cable, which was written in June 2009. The suggestion to buy United apparently came from the grandson of Than Shwe -- the highest-ranking figure in Myanmar's junta.
