At conventions, Morgan said she constantly encounters fans who got into computer programming because of "Tron." Fellow iReporter Joe Machos, a data processor at an insurance company at the time (not unlike one of the computer programs in the movie), saw the movie on opening day, July 9, 1982. Even so, the original movie's suits are a favorite among fans, no more so than iReporter Jay Maynard, who -- wearing the iconic suit -- gained fame online and on shows like "Jimmy Kimmel Live" and "Tosh.0" as "Tron Guy." Machos then pointed to an image from "Fantasia" -- which didn't make a profit until more than 25 years after its release -- saying, "That was, too." iReport: A chat with the cast of "Tron: Legacy" With the imminent release of the sequel, fans have been clamoring for a Blu-ray version of the original, which is quite difficult to find on DVD (Netflix's spokesperson said that the 2002 anniversary release is on "moratorium"). iReport: Jeff Bridges' "zen thing" in "Tron: Legacy" Aside from the technological, early cyberpunk aspects of "Tron" and other themes (Morgan sees a spiritual component to it; both films have something of a religious subtext), another explanation for its long-standing appeal is that the production design was unlike anything seen before. Fike hopes that "Tron: Legacy" will continue that tradition.
