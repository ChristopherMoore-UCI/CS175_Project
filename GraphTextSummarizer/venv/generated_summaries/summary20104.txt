When that failed, cartel members attacked federal police installations in at least a half-dozen Michoacan cities. The infusion, which more than tripled the number of federal police officers patrolling Michoacan, angered Michoacan Gov. Leonel Godoy Rangel. La Familia members attacked the federal police station in Morelia to try to gain freedom for Rueda shortly after his arrest, authorities said. The recent spate of violence was sparked by the arrest of high-ranking drug cartel member Arnoldo Rueda Medina.
