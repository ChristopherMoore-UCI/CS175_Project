Polls in Iraq to elect a 325-member parliament closed Sunday evening, capping an electoral process in which militants intent on disrupting the vote carried out dozens of attacks that killed 38 people. Some violence was expected, Obama said, but "overall, the level of security, and the prevention of destabilizing attacks, speaks to the growing capability and professionalism of Iraqi security forces, which took the lead in providing protection at the polls. -- Violent attacks on election day didn't stop large numbers of Iraqis from successfully casting their votes in key parliamentary elections Sunday. " Secretary of State Hillary Clinton praised Iraq's High Electoral Commission and security forces for running and securing the vote. "I congratulate all the people of Iraq who participated in national elections today and over the past three days," she said in a statement.
