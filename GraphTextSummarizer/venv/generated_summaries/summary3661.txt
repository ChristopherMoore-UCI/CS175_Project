Casa de la Musica is what one Lonely Planet author describes as 'hot hot hot salsa with young hot hot hot Cubans'. It has many Victorian-era buildings from the city's coffee days, superb handicrafts including hand-painted boxes and animal toys, good beaches and a fun day trip to a grotto of cascades and cobalt-blue pools you can reach by horse for $20 or $25. In town, you'll find colorful colonial buildings on narrow streets that still see donkey carts and historic sites, including the spot -- locals claim -- where Christopher Columbus made his first foot-fall of the New World in 1492. San Juan also has excellent art, free salsa lessons in clubs, fine dining in the ever-emerging SoFo district on Fortaleza St, and excellent beaches below the city walls. Grab a rental car and find hidden beach coves -- practically isolated -- to the north, along with a peek at Christoffel National Park's plantations.
