-- Greece state broadcaster ERT is back on the air after being shut down by the government in June. They were holding a sit-in at ERT headquarters, lambasting what they called "a fake imitation ERT." The new signal is airing only old movies and documentaries, not live programs, according to government spokesman Simos Kedikoglou. In June, the country's top court ordered the government to restart ERT. ERT had earlier said the decision to shut down the broadcaster meant 2,656 employees would lose their jobs.
