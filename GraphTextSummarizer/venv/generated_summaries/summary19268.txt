Recently, however, a couple didn't leave their kid at home, and that's exactly what caused a heated online debate about the social acceptability of bringing your children to restaurants that don't have crayons or dancing, human-sized mice that may or may not have done time in Leavenworth. @AlineaBaby describes itself as ... a baby who likes fine food, fine drinks, and crying. The kids and restaurant debate later took a bizarre and wonderful twist when somebody created a fake Twitter handle for the 8-month-old child. Regardless, we have to ask: Should adults bring their small children to fine dining restaurants? I genuinely enjoy the odd experience of being served really small portions of elaborate food on really large elaborate plates, where 75 percent of the actual surface area is covered by tiny, elaborate flakes of garnish that, combined with the elaborate entrÃ©e, ultimately won't prevent me from just ordering pizza a few hours later when I get home
