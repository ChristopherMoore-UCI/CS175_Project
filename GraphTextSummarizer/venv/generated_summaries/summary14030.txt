From Chicago, to Georgia, to Southern California, a new social media application is causing problems on middle school and high school campuses across the United States. Less than 4 months old, Yik Yak has "a couple hundred thousand users, mainly in Southeast/East coast campuses," its co-founder Brooks Buffington said. Buffington told CNN he doesn't want high school students using the app. "If used inappropriately, Yik Yak posts can be especially vicious and hurtful, since there is no way to trace their source, and can be disseminated widely," Opferman said in the letter. "One of my favorite use case stories is a freshman missed his flight for Christmas break, and he came back to campus and he posted on Yik Yak that the freshman dorms were closed, and so an upperclassman let him crash on his couch," Buffington said.
