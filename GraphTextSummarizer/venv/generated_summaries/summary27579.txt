Cantlie, a photojournalist who also wrote several articles for major British newspapers, was kidnapped in November 2012 along with American journalist James Foley. This month the group released videos showing the executions of two other Western hostages, American journalist Steven Sotloff and British aid worker David Haines. The British citizens there were seemingly of mixed ethnicities and spoke of a wider war after Syria "because when they learn that Sharia (law) is spreading into Syria, then we will be at war with America," Cantlie told the Times. British journalist John Cantlie hadn't been seen in nearly two years. Just a few months later, Cantlie returned to Syria, only to be kidnapped again.
