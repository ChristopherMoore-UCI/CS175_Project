The second round of talks between North Korea and the U.S.-led U.N. Command on the peninsula ended Friday. Officers from both sides met in Panmunjom in the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea. The talks were designed to set the stage for higher-level discussions on the sinking of a South Korean warship, for which North Korea has been blamed. An international investigation blamed North Korea for the sinking, an assertion the North has denied. The United Nations and North Korea began occasional meetings between generals -- "general officer talks" -- at Panmunjom in 1998 in an effort to lessen tensions.
