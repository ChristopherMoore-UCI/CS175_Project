A man known as "Carlos the Jackal" stood trial in Paris on Monday, accused of fatal bombings in France during the 1980s. The Venezuelan-born revolutionary has been serving a life sentence in France since 1997, when he was convicted for the shooting deaths of two French secret agents and an informant in 1975. He is on trial for his alleged role in the attacks on two trains, a train station and a newspaper office in France in 1982 and 1983. Ramirez, who was a member of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, first made headlines in 1975 when he led an attack on an OPEC meeting in Vienna that took at least 60 hostage, including 11 oil ministers. After two decades on the run, Ramirez was captured in 1994 in Sudan and taken to Paris in a sack.
