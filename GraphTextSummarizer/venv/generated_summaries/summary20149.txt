"Rather than sending out trained 'cell leaders' to conduct preparation for sophisticated operations, AQAP (al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula) and other related organizations have recently been content to send out a higher number of lone individuals (or at least lightly supported ones) whose chances of success are considerably lower, but whose number and presence raise similar public anxieties," the report said. "It remains to be seen how much of this 'new radicalism' may find actual expression in violent acts or attempts at recruitment." The use of more lone individuals in carrying out attacks can be seen in the case of Yemeni-American cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, suspected in the failed bombing of a Detroit-bound passenger plane on Christmas Day last year, the report said. The U.S. Treasury Department last month designated al-Awlaki a key leader for al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, and he is believed to be hiding in Yemen. "The prison chaplaincy, including its Muslim adviser, told a parliamentary committee last year that the situation was becoming progressively worse," the report said.
