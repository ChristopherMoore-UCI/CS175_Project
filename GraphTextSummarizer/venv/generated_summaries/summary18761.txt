Don't allow them to hypocritically introduce their own recruited terrorists as representatives of Islam." Khamenei also riffs on Western history, explaining that the United States and Europe have a long tradition of oppressing people of "color and non-Christians." Iran's Supreme Leader has written a letter in English asking Western youths not to judge Islam based on the Charlie Hebdo terror attacks, in a message published on the cleric's website and Twitter account. In the post, titled "To the Youth in Europe and North America," Ayatollah Ali Khamenei calls on young people to seek out their own understanding of Islam, and he criticizes the media's portrayal of Muslims following the massacre of 16 people at the French satirical magazine and at a kosher supermarket in Paris this month. The Supreme Leader finishes with a hopeful message that "future generations would write the history of this current interaction between Islam and the West with a clearer conscience and lesser resentment. But the leader of Iran, where chants of "Death to America" have been a familiar refrain at Friday prayers and parliamentary sessions since the Islamic republic's founding in 1979, strikes a more conciliatory tone in his message to young people in the West.
