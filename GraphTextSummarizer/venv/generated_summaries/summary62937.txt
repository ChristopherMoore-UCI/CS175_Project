We are bombarded with television analysis, newspaper opinions, blogs, tweets, Facebook posts, radio commentators and street corner preachers that all offer some perspective about who will decide the election between President Barack Obama and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney. We didn't understand red states or blue states. Not in red states or blue states, but in the United States of America. Early votes. The undecided millennial Our dreams from last night become our marching orders as we awake to the understanding that this election will be decided by millions of young people, our people, in states across this country.
