Warnings went out via campus e-mail within seconds of the eyewitness report: "AU Alert: man with gun seen on campus. " The university also sent out the warning via Twitter, and shortly thereafter, photos appeared online on the social networking service showing hundreds of students herded into safe rooms. After an eyewitness reported a man with a gun on campus at American University, authorities put the Washington college on lockdown as officers swarmed out to look for him. "Someone saw a holster, what they believe was a holster, somebody had on them," Lt. Jesse Porter said. "We were really stressed out because we weren't getting the alerts at the same time as other students," Bera said.
