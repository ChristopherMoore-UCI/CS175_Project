-- Airplane manufacturer Boeing builds some of the most complicated machines on Earth, but in its efforts to make wireless signals on airplanes better it turned to the produce aisle for help. Some countries do allow cell phone use on board planes with specially designed cell phone receivers, devices which Boeing sells and installs. Wednesday the company announced a "breakthrough" in the procedures it uses to evaluate wireless signals in cabins, saying in a news release the tests make "it possible for passengers to enjoy more reliable connectivity when using networked personal electronic devices in the air." Boeing says the procedures it developed can reduce the time it takes to test wireless signals from two weeks to just 10 hours. "One of the wonderful aspects of our improved testing is that we can describe both strong and weak signals with incredible accuracy," Boeing spokesman Adam Tischler said in a statement to CNN.
