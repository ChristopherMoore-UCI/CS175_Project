"Michael Jackson has an unbelievable fan base," Darren Julien, the auction house's president, told CNN earlier this month. Its sale came exactly two years after the then 50-year-old Jackson was killed by a surgical anesthetic called Propofol, which a Los Angeles coroner ruled killed the singer in combination with several sedatives found in his blood. And a bidder paid out $330,000 -- more than 10 times what Julien's had expected to get -- for one of the famous, shiny, crystal-covered gloves that Jackson wore during the 1980s. In an auction featuring memorabilia from the Beatles, Madonna and Elvis Presley, it was Michael Jackson who proved to be king. It includes an inscription to them on the jacket's lining, and the sleeve is signed, "Love Michael Jackson."
