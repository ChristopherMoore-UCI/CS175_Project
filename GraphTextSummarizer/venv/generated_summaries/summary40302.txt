Waters gave credence to that theory, saying that winds were clocked at 15 to 20 mph, not as strong as in typical dust storms, in which winds reach 30 to 40 mph. I-10 from Phoenix to Tucson gets hit by 10 to 20 dust storms per year, mostly during the summer monsoon season, said Ken Waters, warning coordination meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Phoenix. Between 30 and 40 vehicles were involved in the Interstate 10 accidents, which also seriously injured five people, Officer Robert Bailey told CNN's sister network HLN. -- Three people died Tuesday when a sweeping dust storm impaired visibility on a major interstate in Arizona and caused a chain-reaction of car accidents, according to the state's Department of Public Safety. Officials were asking motorists to avoid the affected stretch of I-10, near Casa Grande, Arizona, and south of Phoenix.
