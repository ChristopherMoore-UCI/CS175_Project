In addition to the hospital, East Bakersfield High School and the county coroner's office are within two blocks of the intersection where David Sal Silva died. The woman flatly tells the dispatcher she just witnessed several police officers in East Bakersfield, California, beat a man to death. Several witnesses have painted a more brutal picture, saying that Silva was crying for help and officers continued to beat him until he fell silent. It was not immediately clear which phones these are or what "forensic analysis" is being done, though the office did say that Bakersfield police saw one of the phones on video from the incident, but not the other one. After Silva was restrained, police requested medical assistance for his injuries, the release said.
