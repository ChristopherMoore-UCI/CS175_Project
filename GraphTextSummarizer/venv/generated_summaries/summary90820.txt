The group alleges the admitting privilege requirement is unconstitutional and treats doctors who perform abortions differently from doctors who perform other types of medical procedures. After divisive debate, Texas Senate approves restrictive abortion measure Conley issued the order after Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin filed suit. Thompson's order comes just days after federal judges in Wisconsin and North Dakota blocked those states from enforcing new abortion laws. In Wisconsin, U.S. District Judge William Conley issued a temporary restraining order against the enforcement of the law that bans doctors from performing abortions if they don't have admitting privileges to hospitals within 30 minutes of their practice. The plaintiffs call it medically unnecessary due to the safety of abortion procedures and said enforcement of the section will force them to shut down.
