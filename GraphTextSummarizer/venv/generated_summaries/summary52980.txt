In fact, recent polling has revealed that more than 70% of gun owners support background checks. Current federal law only requires background checks when guns are purchased from federally licensed dealers. This gap in the law allows millions of guns to exchange hands each year without background checks. The problem is that the same individuals who are blocked from sales at a dealer can simply purchase guns through unlicensed, private sellers at gun shows or from strangers they meet online with no background check at all. In fact, since its inception 16 years ago, the gun background check system has blocked more than 2 million felons and other dangerous people from buying guns.
