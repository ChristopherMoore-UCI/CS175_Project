Given Outside Lands' affiliation with Bonnaroo, a certain eclecticism in the lineup is to be expected; other acts slated for the fest this year range from post-rock (Explosions in the Sky) and hip-hop (Big Boi) to jazz (Dirty Dozen Brass Band) and folk (Father John Misty). Other acts tapped for the festival include Skrillex, Jack White, Foo Fighters, Beck, Sigur RÃ³s, fun., Justice, Norah Jones, the Kills, Of Monsters and Men, Alabama Shakes and Grandaddy. Metallica, Stevie Wonder and Neil Young and Crazy Horse will anchor the 2012 edition of Outside Lands, to be held in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park on August 10-12. Now in its fifth year, Outside Lands pairs music with wine and food, billing itself as "the world's only gourmet music festival." Tickets for Outside Lands go on sale on April 19.
