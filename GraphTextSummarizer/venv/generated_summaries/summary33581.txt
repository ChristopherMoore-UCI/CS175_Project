We think it's most probable, but I don't have proof." Asked whether Syria uses Hezbollah "for that kind of attack," Juppe responded, "Absolutely." Hezbollah, the Shiite militant group in Lebanon, receives financial and political assistance from Syria. After the 2006 war between Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah militia, the peacekeepers' mandate was expanded to include helping Lebanon keep the country's south "free of any armed personnel, assets and weapons" other than government troops. -- Syria on Monday denied involvement in last week's bombing that wounded French U.N. troops in Lebanon. Hezbollah said last week's attack was "aimed against Lebanon's security and stability" and called on "the security apparatuses to exert all efforts to put an end to such attacks." The bomb went off near a U.N. patrol vehicle in southern Lebanon, wounding five French U.N. troops.
