In the days following a grand jury decision not to indict New York police Officer Daniel Pantaleo in Garner's chokehold death, demonstrators in New York City and beyond took to the streets demanding justice, chanting "I can't breathe" -- a reference to Garner's last utterance. Barthel said the shirt is meant to bring people together and remind communities that police officers are there to serve and protect -- not to harm. "This shirt shows great disrespect to the family of Eric (Garner), and all victims of police misconduct. Garner's death was later ruled a homicide by the New York City medical examiner. How does this help in any way relations between police and community?" wrote another.
