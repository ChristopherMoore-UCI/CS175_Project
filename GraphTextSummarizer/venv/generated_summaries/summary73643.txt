The injured player was transported to a hospital in Murray, Utah, said Salt Lake Police detective Greg Wilking. Alex Guerrero, second-baseman for the Albuquerque Isotopes, could be seen quarreling on the field with his teammate, catcher Miguel Olivo, during a game against the Salt Lake Bees on Tuesday. The Isotopes, who lost to the Bees 7-4, got behind early in the game, allowing Salt Lake 4 runs in the first inning. Both men also play in games for the Dodgers in the majors. Olivo became angry and confronted Guerrero on the field in the seventh inning, after the second-basemen did not tag a player out when Olivo threw the ball to him, MiLB.com reported.
