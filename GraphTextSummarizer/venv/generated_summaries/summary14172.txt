"At no point until July of this year, a good 8 months after we parted ways, did they ask for the twitter account or claim in was their property." PhoneDog alleges Kravitz "is attempting to discredit PhoneDog and destroy the confidence that PhoneDog's users have in PhoneDog" through continued use of the Twitter account. CNN's Richard Quest weighs in As social media accounts become increasingly relevant for employers, the line between personal and professional Twitter accounts begins to blur, and a pair of intellectual property lawyers see new precedents on the horizon. The lawsuit, which was filed in July, alleges that Kravitz' continued use of a Twitter account he was "given use of" while employed with PhoneDog was a misappropriation of trade secrets and damaged the company's business, goodwill, and reputation. Kravitz was a product reviewer and video blogger for PhoneDog for about four years, during which time he used the Twitter account @PhoneDog_Noah. According to the complaint, PhoneDog asked Kravitz to let go of the Twitter account when he resigned in October 2010, but instead of getting rid of it, he changed the handle to @noahkravitz and continued to use and tweet under the account.
