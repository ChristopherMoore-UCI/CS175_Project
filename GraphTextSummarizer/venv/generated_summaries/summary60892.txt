Chase Downham, the Koch-backed Americans for Prosperity's Indiana director and typically among Pence's biggest allies, said that "the price of reforming traditional Medicaid should not come at the cost of expanding an already troubled entitlement program. The short-term embarrassment hurt Pence, but the longer-term cost could be greater: He lost his chance to explain his Medicaid moves to conservatives who hate everything about Obamacare. The notion of a state government-run news agency was harmful enough, earning Pence headlines like "Pravda on the Plains" and comparisons to Chinese and North Korean state media. The leaked details of a bizarre proposal to create what sounded like a state government-run news agency sucked all the oxygen out of Indiana's political media, right when Pence was supposed to explain a complicated conservative approach he's taking to expanding Medicaid. But there was another big problem: Pence really needed the oxygen those stories sucked up to explain his Medicaid expansion.
