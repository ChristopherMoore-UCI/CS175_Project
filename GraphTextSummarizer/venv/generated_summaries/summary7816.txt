According to the telecommunications administration, 36% of Americans "have access to wireless internet service at maximum advertised download speeds of 6 Mbps or greater, which some consider the minimum speed associated with '4G' wireless broadband service." Mobile broadband is a huge part of the future of internet access, which is why the Obama administration is pushing for its National Wireless Initiative, which would expand wireless broadband networks to cover where 98% of Americans live. The National Broadband Map is based on data "collected from broadband providers or other data sources," so it may be interesting to compare this map with the crowdsourced cell coverage maps I wrote about earlier this week. " The National Broadband Map, says the telecommunications administration, "includes more than 25 million searchable records showing where broadband internet service is available, the technology used to provide the service, the maximum advertised speeds of the service and the names of the service providers. Furthermore, 5% to 10% of Americans only have access to internet services that are too slow to even support a basic set of online functions, such as downloading Web pages, photos or video.
