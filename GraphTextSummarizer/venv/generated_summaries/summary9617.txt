Other family members were detained last week as they gathered outside the prison where Ali Saremi was hanged. Saremi was arrested for his alleged presence at anti-revolutionary gatherings organized by the People's Mujahedeen and for sending information for the group, according to Iranian state media reports. " The group also demanded that Iranian leaders "be tried in the International Court of Justice for crimes against humanity." Ali Saremi had been arrested five times since 1982. " "This is a very difficult time for my family," Akbar Saremi said, adding that other family members are being targeted now. -- Iranian authorities have buried the body of a political prisoner, who was executed last week, without the presence of his family or friends, his son told CNN.
