In recent years, U.S. officials had considered Al-Shabaab to be diminished in strength, but after the attack at the Westgate shopping mall in Kenya last year, officials have worried that the group has demonstrated a renewed capability. Somali national army and African Union peacekeepers are in final preparations for major offensive against Al-Shabaab, according to President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud. Mohamud Shiekh, a witness near the national theater, said that at least one mortar landed near presidential palace. A barrage of mortar fire from Islamic extremists pummeled parts of the Somali capital for two nights last week, near the presidential palace and other government buildings. At least eight mortar rounds rained down on the Somali capital of Mogadishu late Wednesday, security officials and witnesses said.
