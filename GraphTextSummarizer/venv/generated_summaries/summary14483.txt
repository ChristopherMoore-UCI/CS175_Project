"Price tag" attack is a term frequently used by radical Israeli settlers to denote reprisal attacks against Palestinians in response to moves by the Israeli government to evacuate illegal West Bank outposts. Israeli police have set up an investigation team and collected evidence in the area, police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said. Lately "price tag" attacks have also targeted Israeli military forces and police stationed in the West Bank. It is rare for them to carry out attacks inside Israel. Police stepped up security in northern Israel Monday after a fire at a mosque overnight in an apparent revenge attack.
