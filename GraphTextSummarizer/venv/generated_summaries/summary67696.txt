Smith said that since the war in Afghanistan began, troop salaries and benefits have jumped significantly. "From 2002-2010, military pay rose 42%, housing allowances have risen 83%," she said. "The average junior enlisted member, typically with just a high school degree, earns approximately $43,000 per year," Smith said. He said that in 2008, the average bonus for Army enlistees was more than $18,000. For example, the Army reports that "the average amount of bonus has gone down substantially over the past few years," said Doug Smith, a spokesman for the Army's recruiting office. "Some may take a year or slightly longer, the typical new enlistee would probably be somewhere between 9 and 11 months," Pentagon spokeswoman Cynthia Smith wrote in an e-mail.
