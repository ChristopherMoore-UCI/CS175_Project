What India can learn from China Not so fast, says China watcher and India Today correspondent Ananth Krishnan. " China's economy may be slowing down but India faces a longer list of economic challenges including higher unemployment, chronic inflation and an overwhelming lack of basic infrastructure. It has progressed far better compared to India," said Infosys China CEO Rangarajan R. Vellamore. " With the 1962 border dispute still vividly remembered by many in India, the impression of China as a threat stands in the way of further economic integration between the two countries. "After 30 years of dedicated efforts in building China into a manufacturing powerhouse, it would take a long time for India to build that kind of manufacturing capability," said Haiyan Wang, Managing Partner of the China India Institute.
