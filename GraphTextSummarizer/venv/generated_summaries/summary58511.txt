The cardinals may cast ballots as many as four times on the second and third days, according to voting rules laid down by John Paul II. There were traditionally three methods of choosing a new pope, but the church abolished two, leaving cardinals to pick a peer via paper ballot only. Ballots are passed out, and cardinals write in a candidate's name and fold it up, then one by one, in order of seniority, they approach an altar and ceremoniously place their ballots into a chalice. Voting is secret, but ballots are counted in the open. He has slightly amended the 500-year-old policy on pope selection to get a successor into place more rapidly.
