Combat is broken down into three sections for each chapter: flight battle, ground battle and boss battle. If you want more, you bet hearts that you can complete the chapter, winning you more hearts. Hearts are the currency by which players can obtain new weapons and skills. On the ground (because apparently this angel has a limit on how much he can fly), Pit navigates through a series of rooms and pathways, defeating enemies and collecting hearts. The boss battles close each chapter, involving classic characters and a combination of nimble dodging and intense firepower.
