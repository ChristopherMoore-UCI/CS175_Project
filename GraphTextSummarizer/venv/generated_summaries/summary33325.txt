" More recently in a late December interview, Christie was grilled by New Jersey reporter Steve Adubato about appearances with Jones in the Dallas Cowboys owners' box. " While Christie acknowledges it's politically incorrect to be a Cowboys fan in New Jersey, it could be a smart move in the Garden State, which technically doesn't have an NFL team. While the New Jersey governor's unusual adoration of the Dallas Cowboys has been well documented, Chris Christie's loyalty for America's team was on full display Sunday night when he was seen giving Cowboys owner Jerry Jones a bear hug after the team made a huge comeback to defeat the Detroit Lions. "I would take all the abuse that I'm taking from some of these folks in return for Cowboys playoff wins," Christie said on WFAN's "Boomer & Carton" radio show, where he does regular call-in interviews. Christie said in 2013 that his father was a Giants fan -- "Every Sunday, he'd watch the Giants and yell at the TV set" -- and part of his own motivation for favoring the Cowboys stemmed from watching his dad get so upset on game days.
