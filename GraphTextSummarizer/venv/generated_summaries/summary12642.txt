Brian Kimberling: Some friends and I used to build fires on Indiana train tracks at night and sit around with a bottle of something purloined from someone's parents. I think a lot, in a possibly European-inflected way, about the cultural heritage of southern Indiana (five words that do not often appear in that sequence). Kimberling: I am working on another novel also set in southern Indiana. Nate spends a good part of the book in the wilds of Indiana, where he beautifully describes tracking and observing birds like the Summer tanager and wood thrushes, as well as warblers, chickadees and Acadian flycatchers. The problem was that other titles (such as "Audubon, Indiana") seemed to restrict the book's scope somehow and that the snapping turtle in the book has symbolic value.
