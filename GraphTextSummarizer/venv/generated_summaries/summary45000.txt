Researchers basically stumbled across the new frog, Rissler said, adding the discovery is "extremely rare." "We were doing a study on a related organism, the southern leopard frog, in my lab at the University of Alabama and another colleague contacted us to say we have these frogs that look like southern leopard frogs, but they don't quite sound like southern leopard frogs, can you add some of these to your genetic analyses? Amid the skyscrapers, sidewalks and subways of New York City, scientists have discovered a new species of frog within view of the Statue of Liberty. And, while it's fairly common to find new species of animals in the remote wildness or in rain forests, to discover one in marshes and ponds within an urban area such as New York is nothing short of amazing, according to Leslie Rissler, program director with the National Science Foundation. "I think some people would like to name it, who knows, Staten I, a lot of things to do with New York City," Rissler told CNN. "However, we have to go back to these different museums, find the exact voucher specimen that was used for these other species and, if there is an old name that's available then we will use that name because that's the proper way to do it, rather than taking bids on who wants to name the new frog in New York."
