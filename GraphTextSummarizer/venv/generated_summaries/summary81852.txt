As recently as two weeks ago, scientists documented a dead dolphin with oil on its remains, Mase said. "The Gulf of Mexico is no stranger to unusual mortality events," Mase said. Of those nine, six were confirmed to contain oil from the incident; one was found with oil that did not match the Deepwater Horizon samples, and two have not yet been tested. "Even though they have oil on them, it may not be the cause of death," she said. "We did not say that the dolphins have died because of the oil, just that they have come back with oil on them."
