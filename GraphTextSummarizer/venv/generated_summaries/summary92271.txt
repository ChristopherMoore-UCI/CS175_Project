Iran's leaders have seen other authoritarian rulers swept from power in Egypt, Tunisia and Libya - and pushed to the very brink in Syria. The hope that some magic incantation might change Iran springs eternal, but states are more thick-skinned than that. As Iran's chief nuclear negotiator in the 2000s, Rouhani nimbly evaded international efforts to achieve a peaceful end to the country's drive for weapons of mass death. Iran continues to make mischief through the region, most horrifically by supporting the brutal actions of the Bashar al-Assad regime in Syria. Iran's long record of evasion and deceit requires more than mere promises - we must see decisive and irrevocable proof.
