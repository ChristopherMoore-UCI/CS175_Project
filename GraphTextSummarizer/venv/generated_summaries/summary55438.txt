I had graduated from high school before I learned some of the greatest voices during the Harlem Renaissance and civil rights movement -- Lorraine Hansberry, James Baldwin, Bayard Rustin -- were members of the LGBT community. And yet, it was only this week -- thanks to longtime civil rights activist David Mixner -- that I learned Congress once debated passing a law forcing gay men to wear tattoos and corralling those who were HIV positive into internment camps. Most of the books are about history: presidential biographies, wars, social justice movements. For far too long, the story of the LGBT community has been scrubbed from our education, contributions erased and existence relegated to the poorly lit corner of bookstores under the banner "Alternative Lifestyle." Just as Hansberry and Rustin and Milk were there -- working for the greater good, changing the course of global history, woven into the fabric of humanity.
