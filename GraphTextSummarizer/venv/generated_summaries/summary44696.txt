Thanks to the Cuban Adjustment Act, which was enacted in 1966 -- or four years after Rubio's grandfather came to the United States -- Cuban refugees who flee the Island and reach the U.S. shoreline have a clear path to legal residency and eventual citizenship. The Florida senator -- a Republican Party rock star who has been entrusted with the Herculean task of pulling the GOP out of the hole that it has dug with Latino voters because of harsh rhetoric on immigration -- delivered a substantive speech on U.S. foreign policy Wednesday at the Brookings Institution. Last year, Rubio came under criticism from fellow Latinos for getting wrong the year that his parents came to United States. So when Cuban-Americans do what Rubio has done since arriving in the Senate 16 months ago and take a hardline against illegal immigration, Mexicans and Mexican-Americans have been known to cringe. The story appears in a forthcoming and unauthorized biography of the senator by Manuel Roig-Franzia of the Washington Post. Rubio was born to Cuban exiles in Miami in 1971, and so he's automatically a U.S. citizen.
