Weeks of clashes between opposition protesters and government forces have left at least 36 people dead, authorities say. Last week, opposition leader Henrique Capriles Radonski blamed Maduro for fueling tensions. Think about what the U.S. government would do if a political group laid out a road map for overthrowing President Barack Obama, Maduro said. Maduro revealed the arrests as he spoke to a commission of South American foreign ministers who are visiting his country as part of efforts to facilitate dialogue as political tensions mount. "Last night we captured three generals, who we had been investigating...three generals who were trying to turn the air force against the legitimately constituted government," President Nicolas Maduro said in remarks broadcast Tuesday on state-run VTV.
