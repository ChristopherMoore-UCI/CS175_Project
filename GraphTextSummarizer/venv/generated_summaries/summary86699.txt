"And it's time we encourage law-abiding Americans to do just that." Congress is preparing to consider such measures as a ban on the manufacture of new high-powered assault weapons, cracking down on straw purchases of guns for those who can't pass background checks, curbing gun trafficking and expanding background checks. "I have some confidence that there will be support in the Senate, including from several Democrats in states with large populations who are gun owners, for passing universal background checks, funding to encourage better reporting to the NICS (National Instant Criminal Background Check System) mental health disqualifications, and measures to strengthen laws that can be used to prosecute and deter illegal gun trafficking," Webster said. There is some bipartisan support for expanded background checks, especially to keep guns out of the hands of people with mental illness. In perhaps the most passionate part of his speech, Obama was also sending a message to voters, who polls have shown are divided over changes in gun law. Graham to Obama: Stop 'cheerleading' for gun laws Gun control advocates are hoping to capitalize on that emotion.
