Another discovery of recent years is the remains of a squalid slave cemetery in the courtyard of a home in central Rio de Janeiro. A new Historical Circuit of African Heritage opened in Rio de Janeiro in 2010 to help tourists and descendants of slaves reconnect with the past slavery. Brazil's patron saint, Our Lady of Aparecida, a black clay statue of the Virgin Mary, was -- according to some -- found by runaway slaves on their way to Quilombo, a community of runaway slaves. "The black people that were part of this congregation, most of them came from Congo," said Joao Carlos Desales, a tour guide who took CNN around Rio de Janeiro. The project began after workers installing a new drainage system in the central districts of Saude and Gamboa discovered hundreds of personal objects belonging to African slaves, according to the Rio Times.
