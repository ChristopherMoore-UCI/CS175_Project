She said committee staff "did not hack into CIA computers to obtain these documents, as has been suggested in the press." "As far as the allegations of CIA hacking into Senate computers -- nothing could be further from the truth. Sen. Dianne Feinstein said CIA Director John Brennan told her in January that agency personnel searched the computers last year because they believed the panel's investigators might have gained access to materials on an internal review they were not authorized to see. Brennan said in a statement last week that he was "deeply dismayed" that some members of the Senate have made "spurious allegations about CIA actions that are wholly unsupported by the facts." He also said that the CIA believes in congressional oversight and often has "spirited" conversations about agency techniques.
