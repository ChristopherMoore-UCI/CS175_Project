When she drowned in a hotel bathtub almost three years before Bobbi Kristina Brown was found in a similar state (cocaine and heart disease were cited as factors in her death), Houston, 48, had an estate worth an estimated $12 million to $20 million. As Bobbi Kristina Brown remains in a medically induced coma fighting for her life, little information about the incident at her Atlanta-area home or her condition has slipped from police or family. On January 26 at 4:14 a.m., about two weeks before the anniversary of her mother's death, Bobbi Kristina Brown tweeted, "Littlelady&yourgrowing young man @nickdgordon miss you mommy ..:') Nick Gordon Bobbi Kristina Brown called him her husband, but her father's attorney released a statement saying the two were never married. Bobbi Kristina Brown reportedly got engaged to Gordon, and in January 2014, she tweeted out a picture of wedding rings, along with the words, "#HappilyMarriedâ€¢ SO#Inlove." Gordon, 25, faced criticism following the tweet from those who questioned how he could marry a woman he considered his sister.
