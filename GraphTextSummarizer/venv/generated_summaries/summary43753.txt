Premier League leaders Manchester United needed a last-gasp Ashley Young goal to rescue a 3-3 Group C draw at home to Swiss side Basel, in a thrilling match that saw United squander a comfortable two-goal lead. Brazilian defender Lucio fired Inter ahead from the edge of the box after just six minutes and the Italian side doubled their lead midway through the half, when Giampaolo Pazzini netted from close range after fine work from Yuto Nagatomo. And the same player added a second goal on the stroke of half-time when Daniel Van Buyten's header was wonderfully saved by Hart, only for Gomez to be on hand again from close range. And, just two minutes later, Basel drew level when Frei's right-wing cross was superbly headed home by his namesake Alex Frei. United took a 16th minute lead when Danny Welbeck, in for the injured Wayne Rooney, was left unmarked in the area to score off the post, and the young England international added his second just a minute later when side-footing home a Ryan Giggs pass.
