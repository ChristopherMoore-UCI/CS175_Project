Kalaouz says he's now preparing for Snoop's Middle East tour beginning in December, with a focus on cities in the oil-rich Arabian Gulf states, such as the UAE, Kuwait, Qatar and maybe even Saudi Arabia. The Beirut show producer, Roger Kalaouz later explained that Snoop was actually filming part of the music video for the new track that night. When I heard Snoop Dogg was coming to Beirut, I jumped at the opportunity to show the world a different side of the country I had grown up in. And when Snoop left the club at 3 a.m., the party continued till seven in the morning, according to Kalaouz, in true Snoop fashion, back at the hotel. Outfitted in a hooded sweater, despite the sweltering heat of the Beirut summer, Snoop leaned forward and told me in his low voice: "There are a lot of places I could have started but I chose to start here because I felt they've been supporting me you know -- they've been down with me for long time.
