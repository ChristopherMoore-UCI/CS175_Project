It's a trick to get there, and the restaurant is one of the few bright spots in a still run-down area of downtown Miami, so go with good directions. North of Lincoln Road, on the Biscayne Bay side of Miami Beach is Joe Allen restaurant (1787 Purdy Ave.), a bastion of good food and service that a crowd of mostly local clientele has kept going for nearly a decade. Many Miami restaurants boast they serve the freshest fish in town, but few have their own fishing fleet to back up the claim. A good first stop is Lincoln Road, the pedestrian boulevard that runs almost the width of Miami Beach. Garcia's Seafood Grille and Fish Market (398 N.W. N. River Drive, Miami) offers its own freshly caught fish and a great view from a deck overlooking the Miami River.
