Now, the U.S. team will have to find steelier resolve for its next contest, against soccer powerhouse Germany on Thursday. Portugal would need a big victory or an especially heavy U.S. defeat to tip the goal difference to their advantage. At that point, it would all depend on goal difference. If Portugal and Ghana tie, the United States would stay in second place on four points. The U.S. team took to the field for its clash against Portugal with these words inscribed on its jersey patches: "The American will to win is stronger than any opponent in your way."
