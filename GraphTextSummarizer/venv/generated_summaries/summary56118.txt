"The fear of markets in Asia is that the strengthening of the U.S. dollar could pose risks across the entire region," says Frederic Neumann, HSBC's Co-Head of Asian Economic Research and Managing Director. The index has also lost a full 20% of its value since this year's high -- only set on May 22 -- meaning the bourse is now in bear market territory. Overall growth in emerging markets is expected to accelerate to 5.1% this year, and to 5.6% in 2014. Japan's Tokyo Nikkei led Thursday's rout across Asian stock markets, closing down 6.4% to a two-month low. The world's biggest economy, the United States, is also on "more solid ground" despite the World Bank's prediction of slower global growth.
