Claire Danes, who plays intelligence expert Carrie Mathison, put it this way: "The CIA is in a very precarious position, is being held on trial and may not survive. Both Saul and Carrie are asked to testify at heated hearings, where questions about Brody and his alliances with the CIA take center stage. In the two episodes provided to critics, former military hero Nicholas Brody (Damian Lewis) is nowhere to be found. After missing all the signs of Brody's continued ties to terrorism and the plot to bomb the memorial service of the vice president, the CIA faces the consequences of another massive intelligence failure. Carrie and Mrs. Brody will interact more.
