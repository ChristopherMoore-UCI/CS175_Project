Under Michigan law, retailers have to return $25 worth of deposits per person per day. In honor of Kramer and Newman's ill-fated trip to Michigan in a mail truck full of bottles and cans they hoped to redeem for dimes, let's take a look at why Michigan's bottle deposit is so high. According to stats published by the Container Recycling Institute, these rates dramatically outpace those in states with nickel deposits, where redemption rates largely remain in the 60-to-80-percent range. In 2008, Michigan returned over $407 million in deposits. Although it's tough to track fraudulent cans and bottles that come in from outside the state, the Michigan program has returned over 95 percent of the deposits it has taken in since the year 2000.
