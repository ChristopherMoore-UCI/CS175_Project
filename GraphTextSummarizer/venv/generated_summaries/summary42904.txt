-- It has only ever happened between two sets of sisters in the history of tennis, but Agnieszka and Urszula Radwanska could yet become the next female siblings to meet in a major final. They have met in a grand slam before, with Urszula -- the younger at 22 -- briefly losing her usual cool en route to defeat in the first round of the 2011 U.S. Open. His profession meant the girls were surrounded by tennis from birth, with early images showing the sisters in the midst of bats and balls -- and one memorable picture showing them tottering around like ballerinas, albeit with their feet squeezed into tennis ball canisters. Their father coached Aga and Urszula from the ages of five and four respectively but he stopped traveling last year, and both are now working with Borna Bikic (Jelena Dokic's former coach) as well as Polish Fed Cup coach Tomasz Wiktorowski. A lot of kids are trying to play right now and trying to be professionals -- so it's nice to see that -- and people are talking more about tennis so it's becoming more popular," says Urszula.
