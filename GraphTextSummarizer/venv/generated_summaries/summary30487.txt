Homer's mother, Connie Homer, told CNN affiliate WXIA that he was a big Braves fan who was attending the game with a friend. The Braves said they planned to observe a moment of silence for Homer before Tuesday's game. "All the witnesses stated that there was (sic) no other people around Mr. Homer when he fell," police said, adding there were no surveillance cameras at the scene. Ronald L. Homer, 30, was attending Monday night's Braves game against the Phillies. His family said Homer went to the platform to smoke and may have lost his footing on the wet pavement, according to WXIA.
