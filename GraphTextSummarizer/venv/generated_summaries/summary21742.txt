It took just 17 minutes for South Korea to find the net as Koo Ja-cheol latched onto Lee Yong-rae's pass to finish emphatically past Uzbek goalkeeper Ignatiy Nesterov. Having been beaten by Japan on penalties in the semifinal, South Korea flew out of the traps and looked to put pressure on their opponents, who were thrashed 6-0 by Australia in the other final four clash. -- Two goals from Ji Dong-won ensured South Korea ended the Asian Cup in third place after they beat Uzbekistan 3-2 in Qatar. It had looked like the result would not be in any doubt as South Korea raced into a three-goal lead inside 39 minutes but Uzbekistan hit back to ensure a nervy last half an hour. And when Ji's downward header crept past Nesterov after 39 minutes it looked like Uzbekistan were on course for another painful defeat.
