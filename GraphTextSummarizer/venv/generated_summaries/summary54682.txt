"It's like someone in the U.S. making a parody video of a Brooklyn hipster and getting thrown in jail for it and being held in jail for months without bail," Cassim's brother, Shervon Cassim, told CNN affiliate KARE. " Cassim's family says Shez, 29, has been charged with endangering national security, but they've not been told what about the video endangered security. And he's being treated like some sort of dangerous criminal, high security criminal that they need to keep under maximum security conditions," Shervon Cassim told KARE about his brother. "I just want my son home for Christmas," said Cassim's mother, Jean Cassim, in a statement. UAE authorities did not respond to CNN requests for details about what charges Cassim may be facing and why.
