" The new deployment will include communications and intelligence specialists who will assist the Jordanians and "be ready for military action" if President Barack Obama were to order it, the official said. In a critical indication of growing U.S. military involvement in the civil war in Syria, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel has ordered the deployment of more American troops to Jordan. This comes as the Pentagon has recently reviewed military options for Syria although Obama has not ordered any to be put into action. Hagel cautioned lawmakers about the difficulties surrounding any direct U.S. military action in Syria. There have been several dozen American troops, mainly special forces, in Jordan for the past year assisting the Jordanians.
