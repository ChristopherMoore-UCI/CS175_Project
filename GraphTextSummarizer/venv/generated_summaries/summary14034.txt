To put it very simply: America makes Chinese Americans, but China does not -- and does not particularly want to -- make American Chinese. It's not so much in China's operating system to welcome an immigrant -- whether ethnic Chinese or not, however steeped in Chinese civilization -- and make it possible for her family to be seen as truly Chinese. I'm proud to be Chinese American: proficient in Chinese culture, fluent in American life. Whether Locke is "Chinese enough" is for him and his family to judge, not for any other Chinese American, much less an apparatchik in China. The Han Chinese are the overwhelmingly dominant ethnic group of China, and their ethnocentrism frames Chinese political culture.
