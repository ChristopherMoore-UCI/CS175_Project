-- A Virginia mental health facility has dropped out of a plan to allow presidential assailant John Hinckley Jr. to participate in social group sessions, according to a government court motion issued Friday. "Not once during any one of these releases has Mr. Hinckley done anything dangerous or violent. Government prosecutors are calling on the federal judge overseeing Hinckley's case to reject a proposal by St. Elizabeths Hospital in Washington to allow the man who shot President Ronald Reagan to have longer visits away from the government mental hospital. According to the court filing, St. Elizabeths sent an August 8 letter stating that Colonial Behavioral Health, People's Place facility in Williamsburg, Virginia, had withdrawn from the plan to participate in Hinckley's treatment. Government experts testified that Hinckley has failed to make friends in Williamsburg and could become socially isolated.
