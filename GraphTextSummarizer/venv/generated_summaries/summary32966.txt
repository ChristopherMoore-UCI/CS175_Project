-- Justin Rose couldn't miss when he was part of Europe's triumphant Ryder Cup team last year but his putter let him down when his time came to force a playoff at the Abu Dhabi Golf Championship. It took the 37-year-old Welshman 255 appearances to claim his maiden victory on the Tour -- at the Irish Open last year -- but only another 14 to land one of the most prestigious trophies on the circuit. Rose, instrumental in Europe's Ryder Cup comeback at Medinah last October, struggled on the greens to relinquish his grip on the tournament. He carded five birdies in the opening 17 holes to overtake a stuttering Rose, who bogeyed three of his first 16. The lead was briefly held by England's David Howell, a member of Europe's winning Ryder Cup teams of 2004 and 2006, as he continued his resurgence having been 569th in the world rankings three years ago.
