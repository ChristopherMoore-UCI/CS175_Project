Felicia could reach Hawaii by Monday, but by that time it may have weakened to a tropical depression or tropical storm, said meteorologist Derek Wroe at the Central Pacific Hurricane Center in Honolulu, Hawaii. See hurricane ratings, what they mean, and how to keep safe Â» Even if the storm does not hit Hawaii as a hurricane, it can still cause flooding damage, Wroe said. Hurricane Felicia weakened Friday as it headed toward Hawaii and may continue to wane, but forecasters have not discounted the threat of flooding on the island chain. "[Storms and depressions] bring a lot of moisture with them and the wind may not be as strong when it comes in with a depression, but a depression is sometimes just as capable as bringing in flooding as a tropical storm," Wroe said. Wroe expects the hurricane to continue westward after it strikes Hawaii, bringing rain to one or more of the islands for a day or part of a day as it moves along, he said.
