"After further investigation, detectives have determined the person believed to be a female suspect in fact is a male," DeKalb County police spokeswoman Mekka Parish said Friday evening. On Friday morning, Taylor was spotted at a Wendy's fast-food restaurant. It was not immediately known whether Taylor's fatal gunshot wounds were self-inflicted or caused by police, Parish said. Witnesses identified him as the "Grandma Bandit" because he was profiled on a Crime Stoppers piece earlier in the week, Parish said. -- A robbery suspect nicknamed the "Grandma Bandit" died in a shootout Friday in Atlanta, Georgia, authorities said.
