Among the vehicles is the absolute must-see of the Mulhouse collection: Bugatti founder Ettore Bugatti's personal car, the fabulous 1929 Type 41 Royale Coupe Napoleon. A section of the Mulhouse collection is devoted to a full grid of F1 racing cars, including the rear-engine Bugatti 251 racer that made its debut at the 1956 French Grand Prix. Using money from their textile business, former Bugatti racer Fritz snapped up every model of the car that came on the market, including in 1963 a 30-car collection from the U.S. auto enthusiast John Shakespeare that included a second Royale. It has an equally imposing value -- somewhere north of $15 million, based on past sales of other Bugatti Royales. When it came to spending it, Fritz's thoughts naturally turned to the sumptuous style and classic panache of the Bugatti sports car.
