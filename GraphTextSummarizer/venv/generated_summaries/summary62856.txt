The other slain officer was Placer County Deputy Michael David Davis Jr., 42, an 18-year veteran with a wife and four children. Authorities say Marcelo Marquez, 34, of Salt Lake City, Utah, was arrested Friday after police found him in a home in Auburn, about 30 miles from the initial shooting. Also arrested was Jannelle Monroy, 38, of Sacramento County, who was allegedly with Marquez during the rampage, authorities said. Davis died exactly 26 years after his father, a Riverside County sheriff's deputy, was killed in the line of duty, authorities said. He is in serious condition in a hospital, according to authorities and CNN affiliates.
