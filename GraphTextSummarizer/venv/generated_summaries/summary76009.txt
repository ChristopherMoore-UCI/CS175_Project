But when some 40 Western cyclists from seven countries crossed the Tumen River between China and North Korea early Monday morning, it was the first time that a bicycle race -- or any sports event -- had started in China and finished in North Korea, according to event organizers and local officials. North Korea is famous for many things -- allegations of human rights violations and nuclear missile threats for a start -- but not for co-hosting international sporting events. This gives North Korea a window to the West." After leaving Chinese territory on Monday, the cyclists were bussed to the North Korean side of the river and then instructed to lead the bikes back to the middle of the bridge to re-start. -- When Bernt Johansson crossed the mountainous countryside of North Korea into the city of Rason, the crowds there reminded the Swedish biker of the adulation that greeted his 1976 Olympic gold finish in Montreal. You who have participated in this international cycling tourism festival held in Rason city for friendship and development of relationship of economy and cooperation, (and you) will be able to see the beautiful view of Rason City which is developing to a world-class economic and trade city," Chon Dong Chol, head of the Rason tourism bureau, told the racers after the finish.
