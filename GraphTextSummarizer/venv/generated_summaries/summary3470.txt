African CEOs look to bright future Months later, he sent me a link to a call for African fellowships for a TEDGlobal conference in Arusha Tanzania in 2007. Our 4 days in Arusha were simply life changing -- we laughed and we cried and we were moved and inspired as we listened to African speakers like Ory Okolloh, the Kenyan blogger who had set up Mzalendo to bring the proceedings of the Kenyan Parliament to the people of Kenya for the first time, Ngozi Okonjo Iweala, then Nigeria's first female minister of Finance, who had just started publishing government financial allocations for the first time in Nigerian newspapers and Eleni Gabre Madhin just on the verge of leaving her job with the World Bank in Washington to set up Ethiopia's first commodity exchange. That first event with 100 people in a small hall at University College, largely organized on the back of our credit cards, has today grown into a greatly prized event, the only TEDx event outside Africa focusing completely on the African continent. Today, it is organized by a team of 16 dedicated African professionals from medicine, IT, literature, law and NGO backgrounds, all volunteering their time to help create an amazing event aimed at inspiring new ideas about Africa. It is against this backdrop that 500 people interested in ideas from Africa will gather on December 1 in Blackfriars, London, for the fourth TEDxEuston event to listen to 13 distinguished speakers, including Albie Sachs, "patient capital" investor Jacqueline Novogratz and writer Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie -- all of whom, in different ways are challenging conventional wisdom, through their work on the African continent.
