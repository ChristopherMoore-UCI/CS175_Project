The planned reshuffle represents an attempt to win support for additional austerity measures intended to help the economy weather the current crisis, measures that sparked debate Wednesday in parliament as demonstrators protested outside. Protesters have been gathering outside Parliament for more than three weeks as part of an ongoing peaceful demonstration against austerity measures, with some camping in the square facing Parliament. The finance minister has defended the five-year austerity plan, saying it is needed to keep Greece solvent. Tens of thousands of protesters had vowed to form a human shield around the parliament to prevent lawmakers from debating new austerity measures Wednesday afternoon. The agency has said a default on some debt appears "increasingly likely." Unemployment in Greece skyrocketed to more than 16% in May, a 40% rise since last year.
