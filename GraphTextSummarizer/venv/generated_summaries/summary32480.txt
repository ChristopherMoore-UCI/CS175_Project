Armstrong team removes special jerseys for cancer survivors Russia's Denis Menchov was third overall ahead of Contador's fellow Spaniard Samuel Sanchez. " British rider Cavendish triumphed in the closing leg of the three-week event for the second year in a row, his fifth stage win of 2010, but his late burst was not enough to deny Alessandro Petacchi the sprinters' title. They were made to take off special black jerseys worn to promote Armstrong's cancer charity during the neutral zone run ahead of the official start of the 102-kilometer stage from Longjumeau. The 38-year-old finished more than 39 minutes behind Contador, his teammate at Astana last year, after suffering from crashes early on in the grueling 21-stage race. He was 81st in a 161-strong peloton behind Cavendish -- all credited with the same time of two hours, 42 minutes and 21 seconds -- with Armstrong 106th as he completed his final Tour in 23rd overall.
