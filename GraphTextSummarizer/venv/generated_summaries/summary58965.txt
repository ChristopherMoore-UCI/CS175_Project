On Twitter, advertisers can pay to promote their own hashtags alongside Twitter's list of most common hashtags. Facebook is testing the idea of supporting the use of hashtags in posts to the social network, according to reports in The Wall Street Journal and other publications. On Facebook, advertisers could hypothetically "promote" user posts that contain particular hashtags just as they now promote "likes" of their business pages. Hashtags, unique and often cryptic terms preceded by a hash mark ("#"), are specially tracked and aggregated on Twitter as they would presumably be on Facebook. Twitter shows which tags are trending, and clicking on a hashtag brings up other posts with the same tag.
