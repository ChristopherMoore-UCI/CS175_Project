" The Voyager team believes this region is where lines of magnetic particles from the solar system are meeting particles from interstellar space. "If we would have only looked at particle data alone, we would have said we're out of the solar system," said Tom Krimigis, a scientist from Johns Hopkins University who examines data on low-energy charged particles. "We believe this is the last leg of our journey to interstellar space," said project member Edward Stone of the California Institute of Technology. NASA officials have been saying for months that Voyager 1 is almost there when it comes to interstellar space as it continues the longest road trip in the history of mankind. When the direction changes, Voyager 1 will finally be in interstellar space.
