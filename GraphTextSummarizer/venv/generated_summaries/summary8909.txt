-- Forces loyal to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi went on the attack Tuesday, pushing opposition fighters back to the outskirts of a key oil town, rebels said. Off the coast of Misrata, U.S. military planes fired at three Libyan boats, destroying one and damaging the other two, military officials said in a statement Tuesday. Opposition fighters in Bin Jawad battled Gadhafi forces and came under a hail of artillery and rocket attacks, a rebel source said. " The central group representing the opposition in Libya and working to plan a new government if Gadhafi were to fall issued a statement Tuesday describing its "vision of a democratic Libya. The witness in Misrata on Tuesday pleaded for coalition forces to strike Gadhafi's forces in that city to "save Misrata from a massacre."
