Firefighters responding to 9/11 at increased cancer risk The advisory committee review called for expanded "coverage for certain types of cancer resulting from exposure to toxins released at Ground Zero. 9/11 responders wait for compensation for their illnesses New York Reps. Carolyn B. Maloney, Jerrold Nadler and Peter T. King, said in a joint statement in June the proposal "helps pave the way for expanding the scope of available medical care and compensation for those sickened by the toxins at Ground Zero." 9/11 detective dies after battle with lung cancer First responders, volunteers, survivors of the attacks and residents near the site who meet specific qualifications will be eligible for coverage, according to the World Trade Center Health Program. The Zadroga Act, passed by Congress in December 2010, is designed to provide medical services and compensation for responders who were exposed to toxins while working at ground zero. The move is an about-face from Howard's announcement in July 2011, when he stated that cancer treatments would not be covered by the compensation fund.
