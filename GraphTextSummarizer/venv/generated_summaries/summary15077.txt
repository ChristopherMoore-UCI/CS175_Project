Providing free music to more than 750 million people (assuming Facebook Music launches globally) seems like a no-brainer: Why wouldn't everyone in the world want to listen to and share free music with friends? I find it hard to imagine a situation in which Facebook users decide that free music isn't for them. Details on the new platform are scarce, but Ben Parr at Mashable reports that Facebook is partnering with top music services Spotify, MOG and Rdio to let users stream music on Facebook.com. Music is enjoyed almost universally, and free music services have been among the fastest-growing on the web -- Napster, to name but one. Facebook may be about to unleash unlimited free music to all its users.
