But one man is using the game to bring young Catholic and Protestant men together on the same team in Belfast, Northern Ireland. After graduating college, Michael Evans coached basketball at two high schools in Belfast, Northern Ireland. Former college basketball player, Michael Evans, 26, in partnership with another basketball player, Dave Cullen, created the organization Full Court Peace to help forge friendships between between schools in the divided communities. And then the coaches role is very unique in that the kids all bond over having one voice and one person telling them what to do and guiding them along and helping them with success. They're not bashful about having pictures of each other, arm-in-arm on their social networking sites, and they communicate through me about each other because I'm in touch with all of them.
