But Ol Pejeta conservationists say they will persevere "in the hope that our efforts will one day result in the successful birth of a northern white rhino calf." If not, the end is nigh for the northern white rhino, which is a subspecies. So, on Friday, after rangers found the northern white rhino lifeless in his hut on a Kenyan wildlife conservancy, a short countdown to extinction began. Ol Pejeta called that "a sorry testament to the greed of the human race." That's what got most of the thousands of his ancestors, which once roamed northern African savannahs, the WWF said. Suni was 34 years old when he died, and Ol Pejeta felt obliged to say that he wasn't poached for his horns.
