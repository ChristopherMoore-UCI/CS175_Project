Panama stopped the ship in July, and authorities said they found undeclared weaponry from Cuba -- including MiG fighter jets, anti-aircraft systems and explosives -- buried under thousands of bags of sugar. But Panama said it violated United Nations arms sanctions on North Korea. Because it is pursuing nuclear weapons, North Korea is banned by the United Nations from importing and exporting most weapons. The Cuban government said the shipment consisted of "obsolete" weapons being sent to North Korea for repairs before they were to be returned to Cuba. North Korea paid a fine of nearly $700,000 for violating regulations for navigation in canal waters, according to the Panama Canal Authority.
