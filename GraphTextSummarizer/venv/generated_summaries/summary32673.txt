If only the films in fifth and sixth place were so lucky... "Straw Dogs" debuted in fifth place with a very weak $5 million. Other notable box-office happenings this weekend: "Rise of the Planet of the Apes" crossed the $170 million plateau, "Crazy Stupid Love" surpassed $80 million total, and "Kevin Hart: The well-reviewed illness thriller remained a top choice for adult audiences on a weekend when "Straw Dogs," "Drive," and "I Don't Know How She Does It" were all targeting them as well. The Sony remake (of Sam Peckinpah's 1971 film with Dustin Hoffman), which played mostly to males (60 percent) and older audiences (61 percent at least 25 years-old) has already exhibited major frontloadedness, earning $2 million on Friday but only 2.5 times that over the full frame. In fourth place was Disney's stalwart August release "The Help," which continued to work up solid numbers in its sixth weekend.
