KGW reported that sources believe the woman, Terri Horman, approached the landscaper, who had been working on the family's property in northwest Portland, Oregon, and offered the man "a large sum of money" to kill her husband, Kaine Horman. -- The stepmother of missing Oregon boy Kyron Horman attempted to hire a landscaper to kill her husband several months ago, CNN affiliates KGW and KATU reported Monday, citing sources with knowledge of the investigation. Investigators informed Kaine Horman of the murder-for-hire plot and said his wife may have tried to hire others as well, KGW reported, citing sources familiar with the conversation. Terri Horman has been the subject of intense scrutiny during the investigation into Kyron's disappearance because she was the last person with him before he vanished on June 4. News about the plot could explain why Kaine Horman abruptly moved out of the family home in late June, taking the couple's toddler daughter with him.
