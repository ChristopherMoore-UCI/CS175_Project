The president said Thursday that he was tempted to call off the rescue mission after learning that two workers from the Carton de Colombia company had been kidnapped in southwestern Colombia Wednesday night. "A very productive night, everything is ready for the liberations tomorrow, nobody said that it would be easy, we are not losing hope that together we can weave peace," former Sen. Piedad Cordoba said on her Twitter account late Thursday night. In its December statement, the FARC criticized Colombia's attorney general for removing and disqualifying Cordoba from serving in the legislature. Helicopters bearing the organization's symbol flew into the jungle Wednesday to free the first of the group: a councilman from the town of San Jose de Guaviare. But news of two more kidnappings by the FARC drew the ire of Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos.
