The Weather Service issued a winter storm watch for northern Georgia, warning of potential snow and ice accumulation on the roads. Sometimes, it doesn't even have to snow -- just the possibility of wintry weather is enough for a partial shutdown. We ask motorists to please limit travel during this period," said Heather Jensen, a spokeswoman with the Tennessee Department of Transportation. Also out of an abundance of caution, Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal declared a state of emergency for 15 northern Georgia counties and asked state workers in those areas not involved in emergency response to work from home. CNN meteorologist Michael Guy explained the weather: "An area of low pressure will pick up Gulf moisture and collide with the cold air for a major winter event over the next couple of days for areas from Arkansas through Kentucky and Tennessee," he said.
