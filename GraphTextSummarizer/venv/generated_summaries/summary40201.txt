Officials say it is not clear whether these cases are linked to a previously confirmed case in suburban Cook County or to the outbreak associated with Disneyland in California. Officials are advising anyone who experiences a high fever and  rash to call their local health department and their doctor, even though the cases appear to be concentrated in the northwest suburban Cook County region. They learned  Wednesday that two infants who attend a KinderCare Learning Center in Palatine, Illinois, have tested positive for measles. Anyone who has not had the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine was told to stay at home and away from others who have not  been vaccinated for the next 21 days. The two infants confirmed to have measles have not been vaccinated.
