-- The bodies of 11 more people have been recovered after the weekend collapse of a Russian oil rig in freezing north Pacific waters, a Russian news agency reported Monday. The rig was carrying out work under a contract with Russian energy giant Gazprom, the news agency said. That brings the total number of dead from the Sunday disaster to 16, according to the state news agency RIA-Novosti. The television channel Russia Today reported that the rig was being towed into position when pumps failed, causing it to take on water and sink. There were 67 people aboard the offshore drilling rig when it capsized during a storm in the Sea of Okhotsk, which lies between the Kamchatka peninsula and the Russian mainland, north of Japan.
