The "Anger Management" actor called off his engagement to Rossi, a former adult film star, weeks before their November wedding, Sheen's publicist Jeffrey Ballard said. The couple began publicly dating in November, and the thrice-married Sheen popped the question during a Valentine's Day getaway to Hawaii. It's over for Charlie Sheen and fiancÃ©e Brett Rossi. "I've decided that my children deserve my focus more than a relationship does right now," Sheen said. "Scotty and I had a great year together as we traveled the world and crossed a lot of things off our bucket list," the 49-year-old actor said in a statement.
