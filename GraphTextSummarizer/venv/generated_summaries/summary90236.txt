The 350-passenger Spirit of Adventure was traveling some 100 miles off the coast of the east African country of Tanzania -- embarking on a two-week trip from Mauritius to Mombasa, Kenya -- when the boat sped toward the ship, said cruise liner spokesman Paul Green. "As a precautionary measure (the captain) asked the passengers to go to the main lounge," Green said. No shots were fired and no attempt to board was made, Green added. -- A British cruise ship avoided a possible pirate attack in the Indian Ocean on Wednesday when the captain to took evasive maneuvers and alerted naval authorities after the ship's radar detected an approaching small boat. Sll cruises traveling in the Indian Ocean provide security briefings for passengers as a matter of policy, he said.
