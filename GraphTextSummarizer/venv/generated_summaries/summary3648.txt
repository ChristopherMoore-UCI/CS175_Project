On the other side are people like Sheryl Resnick of Tucson, Arizona, who believes the appropriateness of suing parents really depends on the individual child's circumstances "I know of a situation where a 12-year-old was taken out of private school and had to go to public school in a different city," said Resnick, also on Facebook. " Dorothy Liu, an entrepreneur and mom in Bellevue, Washington, said if the parents' side of the story is true, it sounds as though they were "at the end of their rope." "As parents, most of us try to do the best we can and hope we can instill enough good common sense and humility in our kids so they may make good decisions," said Liu, who has a 10-year-old daughter. At a hearing Tuesday in New Jersey State Superior Court, a judge denied the request for high school tuition and current living expenses. Mixed into this seemingly dysfunctional family brew are a number of other allegations against each side: that the Cannings didn't like Rachel's boyfriend and that they were abusive to her, and that Rachel missed curfews and was suspended from school. Another hearing will be held in April to deal with the other issues in the suit, including college costs.
