The Adams, along with fellow sailors Phyllis Macay and Bob Riggle, were found shot to death after U.S. forces boarded their hijacked vessel around 1 a.m. Tuesday, U.S. officials said.

The 15 detained pirates were being held together on a U.S. warship, Fox said, and "we will go through the appropriate process to bring them to a judicial process and hold them accountable for their activities.
