-- Irish low-cost airline Ryanair posted a €169 million ($240 million) loss in the last year after being hit with higher fuel costs and a writedown in its investment in rival carrier Aer Lingus. "Growth in passenger numbers and a focus on costs were proof that the company has a close eye on strategic wins, while further reductions in fares could well tempt travellers who are currently deserting other legacy carriers." The company said that with the writedown on the Aer Lingus stake stripped out, its figures showed a more "robust" net profit of €105 million. Richard Hunter, head of UK equities at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers, said the Aer Lingus stake was "an albatross around the company's neck." Ryanair's boss Michael O'Leary said though that he hoped to see a recovery this year, forecasting profits to "at least double" thanks to anticipated lower fuel costs.
