-- A Danish entrepreneur is trying to end poverty in Africa through microcredit -- funding African businesses by connecting them with investors from around the world. MYC4 says the model gives African entrepreneurs access to credit at low interest rates, while allowing lenders to make a profit from the interest. Tim Vang is the co-founder of MYC4, a web-based marketplace that lets investors bid to provide loans to small and medium-sized African businesses. We actually got inspired by how we can help Africa -- we read everywhere that Africa is growing, the GDP growing 5% a year, but actually the access directly to these small and medium-sized enterprises is hard, so we said "could we create an infrastructure that was investing directly in African entrepreneurs?" We will have a completely different story -- it's not about waiting for the U.N. and others to save the world, it is about you and I having a tool at our fingertips to be able to help and save the world, make it a better world. TV: I think it is a combination; these two things go hand in hand.
