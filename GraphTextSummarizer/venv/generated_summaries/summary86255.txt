Seminole County Circuit Judge Kenneth Lester Jr. will start by presiding over a bond hearing for George Zimmerman on Friday. He had the second-highest overall score among Seminole County circuit judges in that survey, which also ranked the jurists for impartiality, freedom from bias and demeanor. " Lester has been a judge since 1996 and has previously handled juvenile, probate and mental health cases. The 17-year-old was shot to death February 26 while walking through the Sanford, Florida, community where Zimmerman, 28, served as a neighborhood watch volunteer. Sanford police decided not to immediately bring charges against Zimmerman, sparking protests and a furious debate about race, guns and a Florida law that allows residents to use deadly force in public without first retreating from a confrontation.
