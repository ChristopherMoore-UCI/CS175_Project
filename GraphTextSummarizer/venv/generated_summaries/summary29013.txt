The International Atomic Energy Agency, which monitors nuclear activities on behalf of the United Nations, has inspected Iran's declared enrichment facilities, but Iran does not provide details or access to sites where nuclear components are made. According to Alireza Jafarzadeh, an Iranian-American with ties to the People's Mujahedeen of Iran, the facility is at a site referred to as TABA, just west of Tehran, and is designed to manufacture parts for centrifuges used to enrich uranium, a key component for civilian nuclear power as well as for nuclear weapons. Iran claims its nuclear program is for civilian energy needs, but the United States and other nations maintain Iran is working to develop fissile material for nuclear weapons. Former nuclear inspector David Albright, who has closely followed developments concerning Iran's nuclear exploits, said he had no information about whether TABA is in fact a secret nuclear site. The same group was the first to provide the details that publicly exposed the existence of Iran's clandestine nuclear program in 2002.
