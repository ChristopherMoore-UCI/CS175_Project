"Based on this new evidence, I am broadening the scope of my Audit Committee hearing to investigate how Mayor Filner was able to circumvent credit card rules and how to prevent negative effects on the City's credit rating as a result of one person's misuse of taxpayer dollars." As the list grows, city officials said Thursday that Filner might be booted from office later this month over a different, but related issue: money. The latest person to accuse San Diego Mayor Bob Filner of sexual harassment is a great-grandmother. The city attorney's office said a rarely used section of the city charter, Section 108, dating back to 1931, would allow for Filner to be removed from office -- without a recall -- over unauthorized payments from the city treasury. If it does, it would then ask a court to boot Filner from office.
