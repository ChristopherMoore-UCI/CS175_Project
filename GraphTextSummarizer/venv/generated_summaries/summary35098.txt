Republicans speculate that they will take back the House -- and possibly the Senate -- as voters express their frustration at where Democrats and President Obama are taking the country. "Democrats are going to lose the House and suffer the loss of a lot of Senate seats because of their policies," Kristol said. White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs had some fellow Democrats fuming last month over his take on the midterms. " Democrats hold a 256-179 advantage in the House and a 59-41 advantage in the Senate, including the two independents who caucus with Democrats. After facing backlash from Democrats, Gibbs revised his prediction and said the party will hold on to the House and Senate.
