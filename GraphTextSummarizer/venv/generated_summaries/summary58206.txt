The world's top-ranked players will go head-to-head in a special match for charity at Real Madrid's Bernabeu Stadium on July 14. Now they hope to shatter the record for the largest turnout at an exhibition match -- set in July 2010 when 35,681 people watched Kim Clijsters beat fellow former world No. 1 Serena Williams in Brussels. -- They already have the record for the longest final in grand slam history, and now tennis rivals Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic are preparing to make history again in an ambitious bid to attract the biggest crowd. Nadal, a Real Madrid supporter who tries to attend as many matches as possible, said he was thrilled to be taking part in the historic event. "Back to practicing, very happy because the Rafa Nadal Foundation's event has been confirmed at Bernabeu!"
