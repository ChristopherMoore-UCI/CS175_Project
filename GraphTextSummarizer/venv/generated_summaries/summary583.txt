-- Actor Robert Blake accused CNN's Piers Morgan of calling him a liar in a combative, profanity-laced interview that was more remarkable for its tone than revelations surrounding his acquittal in the 2001 murder of his wife. At one point during one of Blake's tirades, Morgan asked: "Are you sane?" Later Blake said: "My skin is a little bit thin. At times, Blake appeared to be drawing on his acting experience, quoting lines from movies or interviews he gave years earlier. "I made a deal to come here and talk about anybody from the book," Blake said after Morgan asked about his feelings about the case. When Morgan asked about the case, including the civil suit, Blake demanded: "Do you know why I was arrested?" "Tell me," Morgan said.
