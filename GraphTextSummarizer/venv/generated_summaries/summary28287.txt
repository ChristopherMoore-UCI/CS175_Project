With the muscular form of Michelangelo's David setting hearts a-flutter outside the Galleria dell'Accademia, and comely Renaissance maidens in every gallery, it's the artistic heart of Florence that plucks at the heart strings. Visiting romantics scrawl heart-rending graffiti in the charming courtyard and smooch on the balcony with their own Romeos. Romance runs rich through Italy's veins, with icons of amore to melt the hardest heart.
