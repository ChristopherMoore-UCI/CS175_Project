Also on Inside Africa: Film shines light on Obama's Kenyan sister "Adelaide was quite a monoculture and then suddenly there was a rush of Sudanese refugees," said Sieh Mchawala, who directed the film about Kuol. Many of the new arrivals were young single men who had lost their parents in Sudan's civil war and had grown up in refugee camps, such as Kakuma Camp in northern Kenya. "They were lost boys in refugee camps, but they could be lost men here in terms of not knowing what to eat or how to cook or anything." Kuol, a Sudanese woman, was working as a health worker in Australia, visiting newly-arrived refugees, when she came across single men going hungry because they had no idea how to prepare simple meals. In response, she set up a cookery school for young Sudanese refugee men in Adelaide, Australia.
