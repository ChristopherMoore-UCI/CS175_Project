Wilkerson was being held on three counts of aggravated child abuse in addition to the first-degree murder charge, Johnson said Friday. At first, the plea appeared to pay off: Police caught up to the woman -- later identified as Ebony Wilkerson -- after she sped away from her sister's Daytona Beach apartment. Investigators have claimed in the charging affidavit: "Ebony Wilkerson acted with premeditated design to kill her three children. Despite these concerns, the officer talked to a detective also at the scene and let her go on her way, concluding she couldn't be held under a Florida law that allows for detention of people believed to be impaired by mental illness and who possibly pose a risk of harm. Still, as more details come out -- like the sister's 911 call and the charging affidavit -- they paint an ever more disturbing picture, especially for Wilkerson's children.
