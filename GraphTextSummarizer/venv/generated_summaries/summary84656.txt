-- Dutchman Edgar Davids has lifted the European Champions League trophy, won league titles in Italy and the Netherlands and played in a World Cup semifinal against Brazil in 1998. So why has a soccer star like Davids, who won 74 international caps for the Netherlands between 1994 and 2005, decided to become joint head coach of Barnet, who are currently rock bottom of the lowest tier of professional in England. After a playing career which spanned two decades and saw Davids strut his stuff at the San Siro and the Nou Camp, the one-time midfield dynamo will now be pacing the touchline of Barnet's 6,000-capacity Underhill Stadium in north London. Barnet would be the third English team Davids -- who was nicknamed "The Pitbull" in recognition of his fiesty playing style -- has turned out for following two years with Tottenham Hotspur between 2005 and 2007 and a brief spell with second-tier Crystal Palace in 2010. "I am delighted to welcome Edgar to our club," said Mark Robson, the current Barnet head coach who will now job share with Davids.
