This case was never "open and shut" as Martin family attorney Benjamin Crump insisted in a news conference at the start of the trial. Normally, in murder cases that doesn't happen. We have all been duped in the Trayvon Martin case. And that the damning stereotypes associated with race and class would have no room in a Florida courtroom where George Zimmerman is being charged with second-degree murder in the death of Martin? He even has police officers testifying in his favor that Trayvon's father, Tracy Martin, told them that the voice screaming for help on the 911 call was "not his son" when he heard the tape for the first time.
