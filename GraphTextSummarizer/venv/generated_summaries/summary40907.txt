Griego told investigators he hoped to end his spree "at a Walmart, with mass destruction," Bernalillo County Sheriff Dan Houston said. A Bernalillo County grand jury also indicted Griego on Monday on three counts of intentionally caused child abuse and three counts of death of a child under 12, charges that relate to the killing of his two sisters and brother. Investigators said Nehemiah Griego, 15, had hoped to go on a killing spree and die in a shootout with police. He was arrested the night of January 19 after deputies found the bodies of his mother, father, brother and two sisters in their home on the outskirts of Albuquerque. -- The teenager accused of gunning down his parents and three siblings in their New Mexico home last month has been indicted on five counts of murder.
