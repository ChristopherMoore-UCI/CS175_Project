-- Waterlogged Vermont and northern New York braced for more rain a week after Tropical Storm Irene destroyed roads and sent floodwaters cascading into homes and businesses. Some of the worst flooding struck Vermont, New Jersey and upstate New York. Abundant moisture from Tropical Storm Lee, moving up from the Gulf of Mexico, will interact with an approaching cold front to produce widespread rainfall amounts of 1 to 3 inches with localized amounts of 4 inches possible, Morris said. Although the forecast was too far out to show precisely where the heaviest rain might fall, "it could be trouble," especially for the southern part of the state, said Mark Bosma, spokesman for Vermont Emergency Management. " Irene killed 43 people from Florida to New England as it marched up the Eastern Seaboard over the weekend, dumping torrential rain.
