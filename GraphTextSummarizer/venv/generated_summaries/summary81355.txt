Africa was shot and killed by Los Angeles police Sunday after he scuffled with officers. Africa came to the United States from the continent about a decade ago, said a friend who would only be identified as Nick G. Like Africa, Nick had also been homeless on the streets of Skid Row -- a decrepit area wrought with poverty and despair. The Los Angeles County coroner's office has identified Africa, but is not releasing his real name pending notification of relatives. But on the harsh streets of Skid Row that became his home, he was known as Africa. Africa then jumps out, swinging his arms at police.
