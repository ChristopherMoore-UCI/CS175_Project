The last inquest was in 1995 and since then there have been a number of significant dingo attacks," said Stuart Tipple, the lawyer representing Chamberlain-Creighton and her former husband Michael. "It gives me hope that Australia will finally realize dingoes are dangerous and hope that justice will finally be done for my daughter as well," she said. The Chamberlain's lawyer Stuart Tipple says that, if nothing else, the couple hopes a change in the official cause of Azaria's death makes "public authorities more aware of their responsibilties. Where once many people -- including the jury that convicted Lindy and Michael Chamberlain -- believed that it was unlikely that a dingo would kill a baby, evidence in recent years shows that is indeed possible. -- A coroner has adjourned the fourth inquest into the death of a baby believed to have been killed by a dingo in central Australia more than 30 years ago.
