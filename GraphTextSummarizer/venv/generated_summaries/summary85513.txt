The drama pits incumbent President John Dramani Mahama of the NDC against his main challenger, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo of the NPP. Nine Supreme Court justices spent 48 days hearing the case, which has riveted the nation. But Mills died in office last year, elevating his vice president, Mahama to the presidency. Experts credit Ghana's system of sending high school students to boarding schools in other parts of the country for their education, which exposes Ghanaians to other communities and cultures, for creating tolerance and cooperation. The incumbent won a second term in 2004, but term limits prohibited him from seeking a third term in 2008.
