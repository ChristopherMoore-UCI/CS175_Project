But immigrants have always been part of Shanghai's PISA tests and most East Asian school systems excel precisely because they are capable to leverage the academic potential of disadvantaged students much better than many Western nations do, and because they are able to break the downward spiral between disadvantage, lower performance and lower levels of student engagement. Not least, just 77% of students in Shanghai say that other students like them, compared with an average of 90%. Other East Asian systems, including Chinese Taipei and Japan, also saw improved student learning outcomes. In the past, the policy focus was on the provision of education, in top school systems it's on outcomes, shifting from looking upwards in the bureaucracy towards looking outwards to the next teacher, the next school, about creating networks of innovation. Obviously, one can't copy and paste school systems wholesale.
