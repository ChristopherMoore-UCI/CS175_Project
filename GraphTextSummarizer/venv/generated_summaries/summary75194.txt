But early Sunday, protesters threw rocks at police and tried to storm a QuikTrip store, according to tweets from St. Louis Metropolitan Police Chief Sam Dotson. Two groups of protesters gathered in Shaw before splitting and reconvening at St. Louis University, according to CNN affiliate KTVI-TV in St. Louis. The latest protests, dubbed a "Ferguson October" and "Weekend of Resistance," are taking place in Ferguson, St. Louis and the surrounding area. " After clerks locked the QuikTrip door, fearing the store could be looted and burned like the one in Ferguson, police in riot gear used pepper spray on sitting protesters surrounding the QuikTrip, CNN affiliate KPLR-TV reported. A photo from CNN affiliate KMOV-TV in St. Louis showed police in rain gear arresting West, in a black suit, tie and scarf, and others in what appeared to be a parking lot.
