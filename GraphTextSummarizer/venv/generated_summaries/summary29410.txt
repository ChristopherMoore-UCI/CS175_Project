-- The stepmother of 10-year-old Zahra Baker told police the girl was killed two weeks before she was reported missing, according to search warrants released Tuesday. According to the warrants, Elisa Baker told Adam Baker that a man she said was her brother actually was her husband. According to those records, Adam Baker's phone was not in the areas where Zahra's remains were found on the day that Elisa Baker said he disposed of them, the warrants say. One of the search warrants details an online conversation a web user said she had with Adam and/or Elisa Baker "regarding their involvement with chainsaw massacre role-playing." In October, Adam Baker, who denied he was involved in Zahra's disappearance, tearfully called for the return of his daughter.
