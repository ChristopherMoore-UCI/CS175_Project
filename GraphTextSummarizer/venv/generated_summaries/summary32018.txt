Despite dominating the first half, Wolves couldn't double their lead and were made to pay eight minutes into the second half when defender Kevin Foley brought down West Ham striker Victor Obinna. Two goals in as many minutes by Ex-Newcastle striker Charles N'Zogbia midway through the first half gave Wigan a surprise lead. Newcastle's efforts to get back into the game were thwarted until the 72nd minute when substitute Shola Ameobi gave the Magpies hope of a point when he scored from close range before Coloccini's late show. The Gunners had to come from behind after Birmingham striker Nikola Zigic headed home from a Keith Fahey cross in the 33rd minute. Despite the loss Birmingham remain 16th place in the table as strugglers Wolves and West Ham -- the Premier League's bottom two sides -- drew 1-1 at Molineux.
