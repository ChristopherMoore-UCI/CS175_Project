This is why it's nearly impossible for us to get Teddy food at a restaurant. Teddy has food allergies that can cause anaphylaxis, a deadly condition that can cut off his breathing. Teddy's pre-K teachers are great -- they contact us for alternative suggestions when their lesson plans include food products. Every time other parents send food in, we have to worry about whether Teddy will be safe. Teddy took his first sip of milk in 2005, triggering a strong allergic reaction as seen in this family photo.
