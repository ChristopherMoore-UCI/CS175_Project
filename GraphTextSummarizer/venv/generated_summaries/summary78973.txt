Residents are proud to have Super Mario represented in the neighborhood, he said, and grateful that their street signs will not feature names of war heroes or violent characters. The future residents of a new Spanish neighborhood say they are the first in the world to name their street after the Super Mario video game character. " Video games won out over more traditional options in an online poll that residents used to pick their street names, said Antonio Almudi Miranda, president of the Arcosur neighborhood association. A dozen of the development's streets will be named for video games, Almudi said. Super Mario's street is nearly a kilometer long and will have hundreds of homes on it, Almudi said -- and his will be one of them.
