World champion Jorge Lorenzo trimmed the lead of this season's MotoGP pacesetter Dani Pedrosa with his second successive race victory on Sunday, overcoming scorching hot conditions in Spain. Pedrosa had set a lap record in Saturday's qualifying for the Catalunya Grand Prix, but was upstaged from the start by his fellow Spaniard and had to settle for second place as he spent most of the race holding off his rookie Honda teammate Marc Marquez. Spain's Aleix Espargaro was eighth for Aprilla while U.S. veteran Colin Edwards was ninth on a Kawasaki ahead of Italian Michele Pirro on another Ducati. " Germany's Stefan Bradl was fifth on a Honda ahead of Britain's Bradley Smith -- who achieved a career-best finish for Monster Yamaha Tech 3 -- and Ducati's Andrea Dovizioso. Monster Yamaha Tech 3's Cal Crutchlow had started from second on the grid, but the British rider crashed out on the 10th lap along with Ducati's former world champion Nicky Hayden to be among eight retirements.
