Witnesses later told police they saw the victim sitting on the pier railing, then falling into the water, according to NYPD's Detective Michael DeBonis. Fishermen hooked a senior citizen who was drowning near a New York pier Saturday, keeping the man above water and close to the pier long enough for rescuers to reach him, according to a fire department spokesperson. When officials reached the man in the water, he was unresponsive, not breathing and "turning blue," said DeBonis. Prior to being transported from the boat to land, the man began to breathe on his own, DeBonis said. "They played a major role in helping with this person's survival," FDNY spokesman Khalid Baylor told CNN.
