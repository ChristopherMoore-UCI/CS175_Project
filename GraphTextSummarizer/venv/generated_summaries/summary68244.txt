We must seize the opportunity to bring domestic violence and financial abuse out of the shadows and help women trapped in abusive relationships find the path to safety. The National Network to End Domestic Violence reports that financial abuse almost always accompanies physical abuse and can be the primary obstacle to women breaking free from bondage. Wherever possible, businesses should take into account extenuating circumstances such as domestic violence when considering credit histories and ratings. Oftentimes women simply don't have the money because money is a weapon of choice for many domestic violence perpetrators. The sheer scope of domestic violence overall in this country almost defies belief.
