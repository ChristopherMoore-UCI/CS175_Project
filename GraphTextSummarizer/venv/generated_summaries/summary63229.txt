That act 150 years ago was the first instance of the U.S. government setting aside scenic wilderness for public use and preservation. Calling it a "remarkable message of hope for a nation embroiled in a bloody civil war," National Park Service director Joseph Jarvis suggested Lincoln's actions may have been "assuring the nation of better times ahead, as if he knew that Americans would need places where they could go and find peace in the perfection of the natural world." It was during the throes of the Civil War, with lots of bloody and brutal fighting still ahead, when President Abraham Lincoln turned his attention to the Mariposa Grove and the Yosemite Valley areas of California. The land around the grove and the valley became Yosemite National Park in 1890. Do you have fond memories of Yosemite National Park?
