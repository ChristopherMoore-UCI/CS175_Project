There are a slew of high-profile candidates for Clinton's Senate seat, including New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo, whose last name carries some star power of its own in New York, where his father, Mario Cuomo, was once governor. -- Caroline Kennedy, who was widely considered the front-runner for an appointment to replace Hillary Clinton as U.S. senator from New York, will remove herself from consideration for that post, according to three Democratic sources. Kennedy's decision to bow out comes a day after her uncle, Sen. Edward Kennedy, suffered a seizure at a luncheon after Obama's inauguration. Sen. Kennedy, 76, was diagnosed with brain cancer last May. Paterson has the power to appoint the replacement for the vacated seat, who then faces a special election in 2010 to fill out Clinton's term. The 51-year-old daughter of President John F. Kennedy indicated her interest in filling the seat after Clinton was nominated to be U.S. secretary of state.
