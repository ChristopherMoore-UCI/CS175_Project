These are the first charges against Chinese state officials for what the U.S. says is a widespread problem, U.S. officials told CNN before Holder's remarks. China is a "victim of U.S. cyber surveillance and theft," the spokesman asserted, saying that "certain U.S. agencies have been consistently tapping into China's government agencies, corporates, universities, and private networks for surveillance purposes." He was adamant that the U.S. "intelligence programs serve a specific national security mission, and that does not include providing a competitive advantage to U.S. companies or U.S. economic interests," Carney said. "We're ready to work with China to prevent these types of activities from continuing." Joining Holder, David Hickton, U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania, said the alleged hacking has caused the victimized U.S. companies to lose capital investments in research and technology. In some instances, the hackers stole trade secrets that would have been "particularly beneficial to Chinese companies at the time that they were stolen," Holder said.
