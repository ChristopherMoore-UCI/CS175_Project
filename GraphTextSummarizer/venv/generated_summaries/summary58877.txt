Rare photo of teenage Diana sold for $18, 369 Michael Pearson reported and wrote from Atlanta, and Eric McLaughlin reported from London. They want more." Katie Nicholl, royal editor for the Mail on Sunday newspaper, told CNN's Kate Bolduan on Monday that it's worth taking a look at the timing of the allegations -- just weeks before the anniversary of Diana's death. By the British military? Pshaw, say royal analysts in reaction to news over the weekend of a newly revealed allegation that elite British soldiers were in on Diana's 1997 death in a Paris car crash. "People don't want to believe that someone as loved as Princess Diana can just die in a road accident," he said. The latest claim, published by Press Association, the Sunday People newspaper and other British media outlets, alleges that members of Britain's elite Special Air Service commando unit were involved in assassinating Diana.
