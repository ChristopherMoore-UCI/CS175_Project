Shot-by-shot testimony in Bulger trial makes jurors squirm Prosecutors brought up the horrific murder of Davis in 1981 just 10 minutes before court ended Friday. Flemmi said he "inadvertently blurted out" to Davis that he and Bulger were FBI informants. Bulger trial opens window on mob world of cold violence, fierce loyalty Davis' brother, Steve Davis, has been a regular at trial since it began in June. "He strangled her all the way down to the basement...when he got to the basement she was dead," Flemmi told the jury, referring to Bulger and Flemmi's girlfriend, Debra Davis. Bulger then said several times that "he wanted to kill her" because of what Davis then knew about the duo's relationship with Connolly, Flemmi testified.
