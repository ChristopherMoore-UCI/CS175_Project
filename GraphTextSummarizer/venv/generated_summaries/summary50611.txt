"I think people don't realize that baseball players get hurt as much as they do," said Freel's mother, Norma Vargas. "When it comes to the development of CTE, our current sense is that it requires repetitive brain trauma and not just a couple of big concussions." Former NFL players Dave Duerson, Shane Dronett and Ray Easterling also committed suicide and were later diagnosed with CTE. Suspicions that he could have CTE began percolating among family and friends after Freel killed himself a year ago. These types of problems -- which are echoed in other CTE cases -- raise questions about how big a role the disease plays in suicides among players, and how things like pre-existing mental health problems, or post-career adjustment issues, influence the cause of death.
