A police statement said the incident began when Rihanna, whose full name is Robyn Rihanna Fenty, found a text message on Brown's cell phone from "a woman who Brown had a previous sexual relationship with," according to court documents released last week. -- Singer Chris Brown has recorded a song with his girlfriend, Rihanna, after charges were filed against him for allegedly assaulting her, a source close to the record's producer, Polow Da Don, said Thursday. The Los Angeles, California, district attorney filed two felony counts against Brown, 19, last week relating to a February 8 incident in which police said he assaulted Rihanna, 21. When Brown made his first appearance in court last Thursday, Rihanna's lawyer asked the judge not to prohibit him from having contact with her while he faces the charges. The case has been moved to L.A. County Superior Court Judge Patricia Schnegg who signed the search warrant in the case.
