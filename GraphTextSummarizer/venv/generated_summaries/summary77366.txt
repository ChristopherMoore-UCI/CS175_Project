" Co-creator Chuck Lorre told EW that Raj and Lucy's recent texting date won't be the last time we see them come up with a creative way to communicate, but Raj will also "continue to rely on demon rum to help him overcome his shyness." When the writers created the scene in which Howard has a dream about "Battlestar Galactica" hottie Katee Sackhoff that is soon interrupted by George Takei, the task of calling up the celebrated "Star Trek" actor about the guest spot fell to co-creator Bill Prady. "We wrote a line of Howard saying, 'I'm so confused' and thought it'd be really funny if George Takei said, 'Confused? But everybody is coming from a sweet, good place," Simon Helberg (Howard) told EW. The audience raved when she impersonated Howard's mother's voice, and when she told a story about getting her makeup removed following the day of shooting this season's Halloween episode.
