Boko Haram attackers swooped in on motorcycles Monday and killed 10 people in one village, residents said. "Today, the Security Council took an important step in support of the government of Nigeria's efforts to defeat Boko Haram and hold its murderous leadership accountable for atrocities," said Samantha Power, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. During the attacks, Boko Haram set fire to homes and food stores, residents said, and fired machine guns. The U.N. Security Council approved sanctions Thursday against Nigeria's Boko Haram. A Boko Haram leader claimed responsibility in a chilling video and said he was willing to free the girls in exchange for imprisoned militants.
