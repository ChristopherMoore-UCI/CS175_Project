Special agent Calder Robertson of the Army Criminal Investigation Command (CID), testifying by phone from Germany, was asked by one of Manning's attorneys if he knew that the Army private had an alter ego with the name, Breanna Manning. A third agent, Mark Mander, who was part of the search of Manning's aunt's house in Potomac, Maryland, which was listed in Army records as his home address, testified that a memory card containing classified information was found among Manning's belongings. Madrid was Manning's platoon sergeant at Fort Huachuca, in Arizona, where Manning received his first intelligence training after basic training. Lim, who was an officer in Manning's chain of command at FOB Hammer when Manning served there, spoke about the Army private's strengths at using some computer programs, and his weakness at public speaking. -- Defense lawyers for an Army private accused in the biggest intelligence leak in U.S. history brought up Saturday a purported female alter ego of Bradley Manning's as they seek to establish his state of mind at the time of the alleged crimes.
