The parents of two former schoolmates of Kendrick Johnson's have filed a $5 million slander and libel lawsuit in federal court against the publisher of Ebony magazine and writer Frederic Rosen. Rosen's reporting on Johnson's death has been removed from Ebony.com Johnson Publishing Inc. and Rosen declined to comment on the lawsuit. The lawsuit, dated Wednesday, claims that stories written by Rosen and published in Ebony magazine and on Ebony.com imply that the brothers played a part in Johnson's death and their father was involved in a conspiracy to cover it up. School officials sued over Kendrick Johnson death Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson believe that their son was beaten to death and that investigators have covered up his murder.
