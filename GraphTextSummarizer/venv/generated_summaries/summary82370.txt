But the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a privacy rights group that obtained the Marshals Service photos, said the disclosure shows that body imaging machines can store intrusive images of people's bodies and that the federal government will store images in the absence of strong judicial or legislative restraints. In written comments this year to CNN, the TSA said images at airports "cannot be stored, transmitted or printed" when in normal operations. It called the 100 images a "representative sample" of stored images. The disclosure about the U.S. Marshals Service storing images came this week in response to a Freedom of Information Act request from the Electronic Privacy Information Center. Marc Rotenberg of the Electronic Privacy Information Center conceded that the Marshals Service's images are "not particularly revealing" but said this experience highlights the necessity for prohibitions on government's use of backscatter technology, which can capture far more revealing images by using X-rays to provide detailed images in or under a person's clothing.
