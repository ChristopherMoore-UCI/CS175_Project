Western intelligence agencies believe al Qaeda groups such as AQAP and Khorasan are continuously trying to develop new ways to beat airport security. Although Jabhat al Nusra is an al Qaeda affiliate and has ties to -- and some overlap of personnel with -- the Khorasan Group, its top leadership has not to date made attacking the United States and the West priority. U.S. officials said the strikes overnight Wednesday in Idlib province to the west of Aleppo targeted Khorasan, a group of veteran al Qaeda operatives previously based in Afghanistan and Pakistan. " Islamist rivals in Syria find a common enemy Ahrar al Sham, a powerful and well-funded Salafi-jihadist rebel group with widespread popularity among Syrian Sunnis, has to date kept its distance from al Qaeda and shown virtually no interest in its ambitions of global jihad. But reports from the ground suggest that facilities and vehicles belonging to Jabhat al Nusra and Ahrar al Sham were the ones hit overnight and that there were civilian casualties.
