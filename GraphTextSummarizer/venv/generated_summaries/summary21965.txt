British fans will be disappointed that Andy Murray misses as he continues his recovery from a back injury, but 2009 U.S. Open champion Juan Martin del Potro will be in attendance. Mouratoglou is confident Federer, currently down in seventh in the world rankings, still has what it takes to challenge the top players in the men's game. "He's fighting against his back which is hurting him very often during the year," Patrick Mouratoglou, coach of women's tennis powerhouse Serena Williams, told CNN. The Swiss has also won the tournament more times than any other player in history, with Federer heading to London's O2 Arena in search of a record-extending seventh title. "He's been out of shape too many times in the year and at that level you cannot perform when you are out of shape." Federer, who recently split from coach Paul Annacone, is appearing in the season-ending showpiece for a record-equaling 12th year in a row.
