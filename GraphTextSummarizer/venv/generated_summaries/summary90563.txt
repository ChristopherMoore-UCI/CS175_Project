The work of making sure that women and girls everywhere can seize their potential is about making specific changes that will set into motion these longer term outcomes. Some of the bravest, most revolutionary voices about empowerment are coming from women and girls like Malala who are calling the world's attention to social norms that prevent women from realizing their full potential. Yet in many places, women, especially young women, have very little decision-making authority to be able to effect this kind of change. The evidence shows that in the developing world, women play a different role than men and are more likely to take care of their family's health care and nutrition, things that children need to become productive adults and contribute to the economic and social development of societies. That's why I'm proud to announce the launch of my team page on Catapult.org, a crowd-funding platform dedicated to supporting women and girls.
