" Another indicator of the growing insecurity in Saltillo and the rest of Coahuila is the increase in the number of disappearances in the past two years, the majority believed to be linked to organized crime. Other nearby cities, like Monterrey, the capital of Nuevo Leon, also started like this and now are cities where they live a climate of strong violence. It had been a difficult day in Saltillo, the capital of Coahuila state: Seven people had been killed and four police officers were injured in a series of firefights that caused alarm throughout the city, the state attorney general's office said. Like neighboring states Nuevo Leon and Tamaulipas, all on the U.S. border, Coahuila has seen peaks in violence associated with the capture or killing of important trafficking leaders who had influence in the region. From 2007 to January 2011, the Fray Juan de Larios Human Rights Center, in coordination with United for Our Disappeared of Coahuila, documented 118 disappearances, of which 91 presumably were related to organized crime, according to a report by the organization.
