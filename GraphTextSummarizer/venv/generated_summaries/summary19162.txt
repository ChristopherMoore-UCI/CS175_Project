-- A man climbed to the top of a nearly 60-story skyscraper in downtown San Francisco, California, on Monday, where he unfurled a U.S. flag and was promptly detained by police. On his website, Goodwin said he planned to climb the Millennium Tower, a nearly 60-story building in San Francisco, to help raise awareness of cancer and the county's vulnerability to terrorist attacks on its skyscrapers. Video from CNN affiliate KGO showed a man, dressed in red, scaling the side of a giant tower with what appeared to be suction cups. "He made it to the top of the building and my understanding is that there were some officers waiting for him," said Albie Esparza, a spokesman for the San Francisco Police Department. After unfurling an American flag at the top of the building, the climber turned himself over to police.
