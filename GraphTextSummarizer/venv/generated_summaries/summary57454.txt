In his first visit to sub-Saharan Africa since taking office earlier this year, Kerry singled out Nigeria's Boko Haram as "a terrorist organization," though the United States doesn't formally list the Islamist militant group as such. -- U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry took exception with Nigeria's human rights record Saturday, but at the same time he defended that government's right to defend itself against terror groups disrupting Africa's most populous nation. But Kerry said he has raised "the issue of human rights" with Nigeria's foreign minister. Kerry noted that Boko Haram has "wantonly upset the normal governance of Nigeria in fundamental ways that are unacceptable." Last week, a spokesman for the United Nations human rights commissioner told reporters that Boko Haram could face war crimes charges for alleged ethnic and religious cleansing in Nigeria.
