With Thursday's news that Pujols has agreed to a 10-year, $254 million contract with the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, Cardinals officials, players and fans are finally permitted say what has gone unsaid far too long -- that Albert Pujols is a pain in the rear. And yet ... for the hundreds of people who work for the Cardinals, and for the majority of the thousands upon thousands of fans who have asked Pujols for an autograph or a handshake or the smallest of words, the three-time National League MVP is, well, terrible. Albert Pujols is leaving the city and you are free, dear people, to speak the truth. Fan 2: "Albert, do you sign jerseys?" Pujols: (not looking up): "No." It's not a problem that Pujols doesn't say much -- neither does Derek Jeter.
