But in interviews, Armenian President Serge Sarkisian has said he wants Turkey to make progress towards re-opening the border, before agreeing to attend a follow-up round of football diplomacy, at a soccer match scheduled to take place in the Turkish city of Bursa on October 14. The border between Turkey and Armenia has been shut since 1993, after Turkey objected to Armenia's war with Turkish-ally Azerbaijan over the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabagh. In September 2008, Turkish president Abdullah Gul accepted an invitation to attend a soccer match with Armenia's newly-elected president in the Armenian capital.

Many observers say the current diplomatic rapprochement between Turkey and Armenia was made possible by a dramatic round of "football diplomacy."
