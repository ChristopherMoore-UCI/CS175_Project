He has a collection of recycled bikes, an electric cycle and one bike fashioned from spare parts that he calls "Frankenbike." Vanderwyden carefully drives the strange-looking contraption, powered by a treadmill motor, since it can easily exceed the top legal speed of 18 mph allowed for electric bikes, he said. Critics of electric vehicles point out that electricity is mainly produced by coal-powered plants which, in turn, create large amounts of greenhouse gases. "What was started in the '70s was turned off in the '80s as far as the conservation and the use of renewable energy," said Vanderwyden. Fuel-efficient hybrid cars only account for a small percentage of cars sold today, although the Alternative Fuel Vehicle Institute predicted that by 2035, alternative fuel cars will account for more than half of the cars bought. Oil accounts for more than one-third of U.S. energy use.
