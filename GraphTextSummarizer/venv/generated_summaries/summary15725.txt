Opinion: Why Iraq elections can't fix chaos left behind by U.S. CNN's Matthew Hoye and Mohammed Tawfeeq contributed to this report. "As the people of Iraq have now spoken, I call upon all elected representatives to work together for the future of Iraq," said Nickolay Mladenov, the top United Nations official in Iraq. "Given the challenges confronting Iraq, it is essential that a new government and its leaders seek to unite the country through the formation of a new government that is supported by all Iraqi communities and that is prepared to advance tangible and implementable programs," said Bernadette Meehan, spokeswoman for the National Security Council. Last year was the deadliest in Iraq since 2008, with more than 8,800 people killed, most of them civilians, according to the United Nations. Some 277 political entities across Iraq contested for 328 seats of the Iraqi Council of Representatives, the country's parliament.
