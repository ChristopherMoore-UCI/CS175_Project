NFL's past penalties for domestic violence 'a different story' The former Baltimore Ravens star had his contract terminated by the team earlier this month in the wake of the disturbing video that shows him knocking out his Janay Rice on an elevator in a casino in Atlantic City on February 15. Ray Rice took the first step toward a possible return to the football field Tuesday evening when the NFL players' union announced it had filed an appeal of his indefinite suspension by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell. Goodell explained in a memo to NFL team owners that the league believed it would have been illegal to obtain the video because it was part of a criminal investigation in New Jersey. It posted the first one, which showed Rice dragging Janay Rice -- limp and face down -- out of the elevator, shortly after the incident. It is unclear how long the appeal process will take, but under the terms of an agreement between NFL owners and players a date for a hearing must be scheduled with 10 days of the appeal.
