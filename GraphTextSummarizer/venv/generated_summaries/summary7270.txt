Over a mournful, slowly rising instrumental track provided by organist Spooner Oldham, drummer Roger Hawkins and guitarist Marlin Greene -- key musicians of what became the Muscle Shoals sound, heard on countless soul records -- Sledge crooned, pleaded and roared his way through the tune. Sledge died of natural causes, said East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner Dr. William Clark. Percy Sledge, the R&B belter whose biggest hit, "When a Man Loves a Woman," became a cornerstone of soul music, died Tuesday. Atlantic Records picked it up and wanted to redo the slightly out-of-tune horns, but the original version ended up being released. "Southern soul had at last entered the mainstream of pop in the unlikely guise of the ultimate make-out song," music historian Peter Guralnick wrote.
