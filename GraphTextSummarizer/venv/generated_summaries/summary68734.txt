"The American-made Falcon 9 launch vehicle and Dragon Spacecraft were designed from the start to be the safest, most reliable and economical vehicle to carry crews into space," said Ken Bowersox, a former astronaut and now vice president of Space X.  "We will meet NASA'S certification requirements. Elon Musk, the multimillionaire head of Space X, has already been awarded a NASA contract to begin flying cargo to the station within a year using his Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon capsule. The entrance of ATK into the commercial crew arena clearly signals an intense fight for NASA dollars and contracts to fly crews to the space station. ATK says it will offer NASA launch services to the station using a new rocket called Liberty. Kent Rominger, former space shuttle astronaut and now ATK's program manager for Liberty, said, "We will be the safest vehicle on the street to carry a crew."
