Consultants from the company meet with cancer survivors to talk about combating dryness with lubricants and using other toys to enhance sexual pleasure. Bober was inspired to start the program when she realized many of her patients -- adult survivors of pediatric cancers -- were struggling with sexual issues and had no idea where to go for help. These symptoms are common for cancer patients, Bober said. It's not uncommon for cancer patients to become depressed and question their life path, he said, which a partner can find hard to relate to. Several years ago, a group of young cancer survivors held her captive with questions for more than two hours.
