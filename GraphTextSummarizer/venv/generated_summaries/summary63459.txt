The world places its hopes in America as a country that stands for the rule of law against the rule of tyrants and for the elevation of right over might. In Syria we long failed to act to defend people who are actual victims of weapons of mass destruction. How many people are losing faith in America as a morally-based power that will use its might to stop mass murder by a tyrant? In Iraq we spent trillions of dollars to fight in an oil rich country that never attacked us, on the pretense that Saddam Hussein's regime possessed weapons of mass destruction. I understand that people are sick of wars and face many stresses in their own lives.
