Arredondo is seen on video, wearing a cowboy hat, helping National Guard troops, police and firefighters wrestle a fence open to allow emergency responders to reach the dozens of wounded people bleeding on the Boston sidewalk.

Deval Patrick is helping the woman, whom he met at Tufts Medical Center, to find Tyler. An ambulance took Victoria to Tufts Medical Center, but her memory of Tyler followed.
