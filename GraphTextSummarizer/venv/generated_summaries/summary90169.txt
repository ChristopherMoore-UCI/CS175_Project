Here's a cheat sheet on the latest developments, based on CNN's reporting: After classified briefing, lawmakers have 'more concerns' Monday it was the House of Representatives' turn to hear the Obama administration's explanation of how it handled Bergdahl's case, as top White House deputies tried to convince lawmakers they made the right call when they didn't notify Congress in advance about the controversial exchange of Bergdahl for five Taliban figures. But the Army has no definitive finding that Bergdahl deserted because that would require knowing his intent -- something Army officials can't learn without talking to the soldier, a U.S. military official told CNN. A Taliban source with knowledge of Bergdahl's captivity told CNN's Nic Robertson on Sunday that Bergdahl escaped at one point and was on the run for three days. He was kept in a cage As Bergdahl recovers, details are slowly emerging about the conditions he endured during five years of captivity. A U.S. official told CNN last week that Bergdahl may have tried to escape his Taliban captors on at least two occasions.
