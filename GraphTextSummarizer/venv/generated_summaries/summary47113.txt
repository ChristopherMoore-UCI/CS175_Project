Gadhafi had agreed in principle to stop all hostilities in his North African nation and allow outside forces to help keep the peace, his government and African Union mediators said Monday in a joint statement. After a series of setbacks driven by the advances of pro-government forces, Libyan rebel fighters recaptured the besieged city of Ajdabiya over the weekend after apparently holding off Gadhafi's better-equipped forces. Ramtane Lamara, the African Union's commissioner for peace and security, read the agreement with Gadhafi early Monday, flanked by Libyan government spokesman Musa Ibrahim. But she said there also must be, among other things, a resumption of water, electricity and other services to Libyan cities that have been "brutalized by Gadhafi's forces. The African Union plan, which Gadhafi agreed to in principle, does not provide any solution to the violence against the Libyan people, Ghoga said.
