Former President Ali Abdullah Saleh said the condition was agreed to in a secret deal struck last May at the residence of Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi, who was recently elected as the new president of Yemen, said the aide, who asked not to be named. Asked about the report of a secret deal, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said on Thursday she "can't speak to" Saleh's "political future in Yemen." Before he left office, Saleh faced a separatist movement in the south, sectarian tensions in its north and the growing presence of what Western officials describe as al Qaeda's most dangerous affiliate, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. Abdu Ganadi, the spokesman for Saleh's ruling General People Congress party (GPC), said that Saleh's stance does not represent the official position of the party, but is a condition that Saleh has put on the table in exchange for him leaving the country. Others include four brothers from the prominent Ahmar family who were involved in a fierce war against Saleh's forces last May before the president was seriously wounded and burned in an assassination attempt at the presidential palace amid battles between government forces and tribal fighters.
