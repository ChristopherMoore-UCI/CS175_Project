NATO commander Gen. John Allen pledged to hold "the perpetrators accountable for their actions." Meanwhile, an embassy spokesman said British government personnel are coordinating with Afghan authorities to secure the area. In the first attack, a militant drove a vehicle packed with explosives toward the Council's main security gate before detonating the device, according to Afghan police spokesman Hashamap Stanikzai. " The strike, which the Taliban have claimed responsibility for, coincides with the 92nd anniversary of Afghan independence from Great Britain. White smoke billowed from a building in the compound while heavily armed British and Afghan forces cordoned off the area in the center of the capital, establishing a security perimeter around the buildings. Afghan President Hamid Karzai condemned the attack, as did the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan.
