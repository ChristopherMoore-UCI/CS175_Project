While no shots were fired and no one was injured, the pilot, co-pilot and a transport security guard were all threatened at gunpoint, said Ine Van Wymersch, of the Public Prosecutor's Office in Brussels. But this was not a chance holdup, said Van Wymersch, describing the men involved as "professionals." Antwerp, the city known as the world's diamond-cutting capital, lies only about 25 miles away from Brussels. Within three minutes, the thieves had snatched the diamonds from the hold, said airport spokesman Jan Van der Cruysse. Some 20 airplane passengers had taken their seats for the short hop from Brussels, Belgium, to Zurich, Switzerland. The aircraft targeted was a regular passenger flight operated by Helvetic Airways on behalf of Swiss, Switzerland's national airline.
