News last week that initial enrollment figures were inflated by hundreds of thousands of dental plans brought new scrutiny to the law, prompting Burwell to apologize and pledge that "this kind of mistake" wouldn't happen again. Nearly half a million Americans chose plans on HealthCare.gov during the first week of open enrollment for 2015, a sign the federal health care site has improved since its rocky rollout last year.

The Department of Health and Human Services said Wednesday that more than a million Americans submitted applications for coverage in the first week of open enrollment for 2015. The administration has previously predicted that between 9 and 9.9 million to enroll in health coverage under Obamacare by the time the 2015 open enrollment period ends, at the end of February.
