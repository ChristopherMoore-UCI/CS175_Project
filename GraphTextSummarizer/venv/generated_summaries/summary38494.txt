I turned around and saw that the other members of our CNN crew on the plane with me-- correspondent Philippe Cousteau, tech expert John Sanders and Hong Kong based cameraman Scott Clotworthy-- were all looking out the windows, too. Their goal is to take captive Sumatran orangutans that were pets and teach them how to live in the wild so they can be released into the rainforest. I knew how remote it was going to be, so it wasn't a surprise when we traded our caravan of pickup trucks for three giant off-road vehicles. Flying over the island of Sumatra in Indonesia, I looked out the window and got my first exciting glimpse of the Sumatran rainforest. I will never forget the sound of the Sumatran rainforest surrounding me, and the feeling of knowing the next day I would see a captive orangutan released back into the wild.
