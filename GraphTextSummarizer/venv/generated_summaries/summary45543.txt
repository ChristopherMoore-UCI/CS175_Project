Australian journalist Nat Wallace traveled from Newcastle, New South Wales, to watch Black Caviar sprint to racing royalty. Royal regulations for Ascot's fashionistas Black Caviar's colors of black and salmon pink were worn with pride in frocks, fascinators and ties. For the bookmakers, it was not a question of if Black Caviar could win Saturday's Diamond Jubilee stakes at Royal Ascot, it was by how much. It has been revealed a back injury could have slowed the champion mare, but as debate rages over how Black Caviar won, the fact that she did was reward enough for the thousands of ex-pats who had been hearing nothing but great things. "It was a disappointing finish for Black Caviar," Wallace said after the result was decided by a photo.
