-- Udinese have gone top of the Italian Serie A table on goal difference from Lazio after captain Antonio Di Natale was again on target in a 2-1 victory over Siena on Sunday. The same two players combined again for a 69th minute third goal, with Robinho's strike being bundled over the line by back-tracking defender Francesco Lodi. Udinese took the lead after just 54 seconds against Siena, when Dusan Basta prodded the ball home from close range. Brazilian striker Robinho then helped himself to the second goal in the 24th minute, curling the bal home after Ibrahimovic had sent him clear on the left wing. However, the performance of the day came from Milan, who are ominously just a point behind in third position after thrashing Catania 4-0.
