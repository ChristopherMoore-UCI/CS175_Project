NASA released 30 seconds of video from one of the twin probes that arrived in lunar orbit on December 31 and January 1. As for the "far side of the moon," as NASA says on its website, the time it takes the moon to make one rotation on its axis is the same amount of time it takes the moon to orbit around the Earth. -- A NASA orbiter has beamed back its first images of the far side of the moon, including scenes of a massive crater caused by an ancient cosmic impact, the space agency announced Wednesday. "So," NASA explains, "one 'side' of the moon is always facing the Earth, and the other 'side' is always facing away from the Earth." For 82 days, their instruments will chart the lunar gravitational field, giving scientists a peek into what goes on beneath the surface -- and possibly an insight into how the Earth and its neighbors formed.
