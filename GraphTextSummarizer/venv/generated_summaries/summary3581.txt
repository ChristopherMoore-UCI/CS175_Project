Hundreds of city buses and ambulances remained stuck, prompting officials to ask the states of New York and New Jersey for ambulance loans to help reduce the backlog of emergency services requests. In the week that left many New Yorkers stranded, Mayor Bloomberg called snow removal a top priority while also reminding residents of a state deficit "that's going to filter down to us." He said New York had insufficient accountability tools, which led to a lack of information on street conditions, and delayed using city snow removal equipment. She said the holiday blizzard "brought New York to its knees in a way we have never seen before," asking administrators why a state of emergency was never called. In one instance, a newborn died in Brooklyn after the mother waited nine hours for emergency responders, according to New York Fire Department spokesman Steve Rittea.
