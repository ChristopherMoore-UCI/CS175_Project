" While any decision by Pyongyang to proceed with a launch would take into account domestic and international factors, he said, "In my view, the DPRK government is fully committed to conducting additional satellite launches, and cannot be dissuaded by the international community." The Unha-3 did not have military applications, but North Korean scientists and engineers were able to "apply the know-how they've acquired from the Unha-3 to other missiles," he said. 'Long-term commitment' Daniel A. Pinkston, North East Asia deputy project director at the International Crisis Group, said the reported activity at Sohae was consistent with Pyongyang's statements regarding space launches. " The satellite pictures appeared to show that a yearlong construction project at the Sohae facility had been completed, including the upgrade of the launch pad and gantry tower to enable the launch of rockets larger than the existing Unha-3 space launch vehicle, said the report. -- New images of North Korea's main satellite launch site show that an upgrade allowing for larger rockets has been completed, raising the possibility of a fresh launch within the year, a new report says. The U.S.-Korea Institute said the development would allow the Sohae facility to launch rockets up to 50 meters in length -- considerably larger than the Unha-3, which is about 30 meters long.
