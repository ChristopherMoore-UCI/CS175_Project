" From prodigy to producer A violin prodigy, Ramone began studying music at 3. ," said Stevie Wonder, calling Ramone "the star of stars behind the stars." Ramone's collaboration with Ray Charles, Billy Joel and Paul Simon won a total of three album of the year awards, and Ramone won producer of the year (non-classical) in 1980, The Recording Academy said. There's no question that Ramone made his own mark -- across most all types of music, embracing the old and the new.
