Thirteen foreign nationals were among the dead, said Hashmat Stanikzai, Kabul police chief spokesman. Paul Ross, the IMF's mission chief for Afghanistan, remembered Abdallah as a "wonderful, kind man" who was always there for his family, his colleagues and the people of whatever nation he was trying to serve. "He was modest, he was funny, he was warm," Ross said of Abdallah, who is survived by a wife and daughter. Christine Lagarde, the IMF's managing director, posted a statement online saying her agency's representative in Afghanistan, Wabel Abdallah, is among the dead. Two armed men then entered the restaurant and started shooting, Afghan Deputy Interior Minister Mohammed Ayoub Salangi said.
