"More training for staff in Haiti, more doctors, more nurses, more treatment centers, more medications, more toilets, more clean water. "We need to plan for up to half of those cases occurring in the next three months because of the explosive nature of this epidemic," the organization's deputy director, Dr. Jon Kim Andrus, told reporters in Washington on Tuesday. Meanwhile, the Pan American Health Organization said it was planning to treat 400,000 cholera cases within the next year, up from a previous estimate of 270,000 over several years, as a result of the outbreak in Haiti. -- Pivotal elections will proceed as planned in Haiti despite the cholera outbreak that has now sickened more than 60,000 people and threatens to keep spreading. "We have a cholera problem here, which is something that the Haitians and we are all grappling with, which is a major public health challenge here," Merten said at a news conference Tuesday.
