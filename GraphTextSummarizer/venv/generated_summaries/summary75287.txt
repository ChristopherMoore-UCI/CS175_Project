-- "The Simpsons" co-creator Sam Simon is facing terminal illness the best way he knows how: with a sense of humor and a generous heart. "They showed me my scans and said, these are the scans of a dead man," Simon recalled in an interview with NBC's Maria Shriver. " Simon was honest about how difficult his diagnosis has been -- "cancer is a horrible disease, (and) I am struggling with it," he told Shriver -- but he added that it's also been a lesson. she came up with an almost therapy for me, where we planned and are still planning a series of animal liberations and actions that I get to participate in and enjoy and have something to look forward to at the same time," Simon said. It was two years ago that Simon, 59, was told that he had colon cancer and had just three to six months to live.
