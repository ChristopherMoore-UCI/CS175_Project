Boeing spokeswoman Lori Gunter said the company is "aware of the event and working with the customer." Dreamliner woes explained Dreamliner troubles dating back four months include reports of an oil leak, a fuel leak, engine cracks and a damaged cockpit window. Last week, Boeing chief engineer Mike Sinnett expressed confidence in the battery system. NTSB investigators are disassembling the burned battery involved in the January 7 fire aboard a Japan Airlines Boeing 787 at Logan International Airport in Boston. "I am wary of a plane model that has fire problems and leaks fuel," said Atlanta-based businessman Bobby Burns, a project manager who takes more than 50 trips a year. "The incident will be included in the comprehensive review the FAA began last week of the 787 critical systems, including design, manufacture and assembly," it said in a statement late Tuesday.
