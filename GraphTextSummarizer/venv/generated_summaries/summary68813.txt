It remains unclear why Peters targeted an 18-year-old girl and it would be "unproductive to speculate," said Judge Zahra. According to court documents, "he said the suburb of Mosman was like the Hong Kong peak and he wanted to create in his own mind what the nemesis in his book could have been doing." During sentencing, the judge debunked suggestions that Peters was motivated by a confused reality and said the motive, beyond reasonable doubt, was extortion. " "The terror instilled can only be described as unimaginable," Judge Peter Zahra told the District Court in Sydney during sentencing Tuesday. Peters was only in the house for a matter of minutes, but it would take police nine hours to determine that the box contained no explosives, and 10 hours to remove it. The plan ultimately failed, the judge said, because police were called, the media was alerted, and Peters decided to abandon his efforts to extort money.
