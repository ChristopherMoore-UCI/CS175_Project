In an effort to combat fetal alcohol syndrome, researchers are planning to install free pregnancy test dispensers in the bathrooms of some bars. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the U.S. Surgeon General all agree that women should avoid alcohol during pregnancy, since no amount has been determined to be safe. Pregnancy test dispensers will be placed in bars that are frequented by women 21 to 44 in six regions of the state. The researchers believe offering free pregnancy tests in bar restrooms will encourage women to use them and, if they are pregnant, stop drinking that night. Alaska falls slightly below the national average for alcohol consumption in women ages 18 to 44, according the the CDC.
