Nani, who plays for English premier League side Manchester United, suffered the injury in a training session with his national side in Portugal, before leaving for the tournament which begins on June 11. Nani is the latest Premier League player to succumb to injury in the build-up to the finals. Winger David Silva and striker David Villa made it 2-0 at half-time before Xabi Alonso added a third early in the second period. Ivory Coast striker Didier Drogba, who also plays for Premier League champions Chelsea, is a doubt for the tournament after breaking his arm in his team's friendly against Japan on Friday. Cesc Fabregas and Fernando Torres both marked their returns from injury by coming off the bench to score and Pedro added a sixth ten minutes before full-time.
