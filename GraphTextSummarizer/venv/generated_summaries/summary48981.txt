Toilet paper took its next leap forward in 1890, when two brothers named Clarence and E. Irvin Scott popularized the concept of toilet paper on a roll. Even as the markets boom in developing nations, toilet paper manufacturers find themselves needing to charge more per roll to make a profit. The average American uses 57 squares a day and 50 pounds of toilet paper per year. The Scotts' brand became more successful than Gayetty's medicated wipes, in part because they built a steady trade selling toilet paper to hotels and drugstores. By 1930, the German paper company Hakle began using the tag line, "Ask for a roll of Hakle and you won't have to say toilet paper!"
