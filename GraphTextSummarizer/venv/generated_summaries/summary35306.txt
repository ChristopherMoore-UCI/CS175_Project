This has not kept Okinawa from feeling the might of Jelawat's gusts, although there have been no reports of major damage. -- At least 50 people were injured and 271,400 households rendered without power after Typhoon Jelawat struck Okinawa island of Japan, disaster officials there said Saturday. The cyclone has lost some of its might and should continue weakening while moving into colder waters, said CNN meteorologist Karen Maginnis. Wind troughs out of China could divert Jelawat away from land and into the open Pacific Ocean. "The winds are screaming through the streets," storm chaser James Reynolds said from Okinawa before the typhoon strike.
