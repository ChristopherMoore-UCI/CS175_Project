El-Bashir's government has been blamed by the United Nations of supporting militias that conduct "indiscriminate attacks" on civilians in the Darfur region, including torture, rape, and killings. The Sudanese president has been outspoken in his opposition to allowing non-African forces in Darfur. He said the crisis in Sudan's western Darfur region is a "media fabrication." Sudan's Arab-dominated government is accused of responding by unleashing the tribal militias known as janjaweed, which have committed the worst atrocities against Darfur's local communities. In the majority of Darfur, there is little to no conflict and people are living normal lives, he said.
