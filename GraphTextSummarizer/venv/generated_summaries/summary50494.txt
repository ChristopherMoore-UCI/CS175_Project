The first time he arrived with a dusty Valentine's Day present to give to her, and was only allowed to visit when cagey hospital staff acquiesced at Badenhorst's insistence. Badenhorst has not been back home to visit the rest of her family in the intervening five years, and she misses many aspects of life in South Africa. Jan Kemp did not know Badenhorst nor her wider family, but was so touched by her plight that he came to visit her every day in hospital. "It turns out he had a daughter who died in a cycling accident a couple of days before Valentine's Day," she explains. The family moved to Australia four years after the accident, partly because of a good job offer for her dad, partly to ensure a safer life for the four children, and partly to ensure better medical care and a prosthetic limb for Joany.
