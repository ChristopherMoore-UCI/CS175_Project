Rate of infection Ebola fears hit close to home The rate of infection has slowed in Guinea, but it has increased in neighboring Sierra Leone and Liberia. There is no known cure or vaccine for Ebola, which the World Health Organization says is believed to have infected 1,323 people in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria between March and July 27. " Another physician in West Africa was not so fortunate; Dr. Sheik Humarr Khan fell ill early last week while overseeing Ebola treatment at a Sierra Leone hospital and died days later. Both Brantly, a 33-year-old who last lived in Texas, and Writebol were caring for Ebola patients in Liberia. The fear began just after news broke Thursday that a long-range business jet with an isolation pod left the United States for Liberia, where it will evacuate two Americans infected with Ebola.
