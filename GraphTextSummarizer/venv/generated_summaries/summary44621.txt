The Pakistan Taliban claimed responsibility for a Friday attack on a Shiite Muslim mosque in Peshawar in northwestern Pakistan -- a suicide bombing and gunfire assault that a hospital representative said killed 19 people. The militant group and the Pakistani army said previously that Mansoor commanded the December 16 massacre at the Army Public School and Degree College, which largely teaches sons and daughters of army personnel from around Peshawar. One would-be suicide bomber was stopped by people in the mosque who held him by the throat, Durrani said. Khurasan, the TTP spokesman, said the attack was orchestrated by TTP commander Kalifa Omar Mansoor. Pakistan has seen plenty of violence, much of it involving militants targeting restive regions in northwest Pakistan along the border with Afghanistan.
