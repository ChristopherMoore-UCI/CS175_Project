Lastly, the trials of Nazi war criminals and collaborators are a very powerful tool in the ongoing fight against Holocaust denial and distortion. For thirty-two years I have been actively involved in the ongoing efforts to help bring Nazi war criminals to justice -- and the most common question I am asked concerns the age of the perpetrators. While there may have been a few such cases of this, I have never encountered a single regretful or remorseful one in decades of dealing with dozens of Nazi murderers of many different nationalities, religions, occupations and walks of life. Is it still worthwhile to prosecute elderly Holocaust perpetrators? The continuing pursuit of Nazi war criminals sends a powerful message about the importance of holding genocidists accountable.
