Once just a site for sharing photos and updates with friends, Facebook has woven itself into the fabric of the net with its Open Graph platform, that lets other websites embed Facebook widgets, install "Like" buttons, plug-in a commenting system, and let users log in with their Facebook credentials. Unfortunately, LinkedIn's platform faces the tough challenge of coming almost a year after Facebook debuted its Like button and its Open Graph API. LinkedIn's Share button joins a growing number of plugins that try to get users to spread the news about a site or news story, a pantheon that includes Facebook's Like, Twitter's Tweet button, and social voting and submission widgets from Digg and Reddit. Calling it "a new platform for building the professional web," LinkedIn is seeking to challenge Facebook's growing control over online identity. -- LinkedIn announced a new platform Wednesday for its business-focused social networking site -- offering websites and developers easy tools to embed "recommend" buttons, company-profile boxes and contact widgets on third-party websites -- as well as a way to log in to other sites using LinkedIn.
