Knox, 24, was convicted and sentenced to 26 years in prison for the murder of British student Meredith Kercher, 21, who was found partially naked with her throat cut in her bedroom of the house the two shared. Knox and her former boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, 26, were convicted on two key pieces of evidence: a 30-centimeter (12-inch) kitchen knife and a clasp from Kercher's bloodied bra. Authorities testified in the original trial that Kercher's DNA was found on the blade of the knife, Knox's DNA was on its handle, and DNA from Sollecito was on the bra clasp. They both stressed that they had worn masks, gloves, paper suits and used sterile knives and scissors during their retesting at Rome's La Sapinenza University. Kercher, a University of Leeds student from Coulsdon, Surrey, was discovered with her throat slit in November 2007, in the hilltop town of Perugia, just two months after she arrived in Italy during her year abroad.
