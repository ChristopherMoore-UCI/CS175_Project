Terror threats One reason Yemen and the United States partnered in the offensive: Threats from al Qaeda operatives in Yemen increased in recent weeks. The crackdown began over a week ago, resulting in the deaths of more than 60 suspected al Qaeda militants in Yemen from April 19 t0 21, Yemeni officials have said. The remains of a Saudi national killed in airstrikes in Yemen earlier this month are not those of a wanted al Qaeda bomb-maker, according to multiple sources in Saudi Arabia who were briefed on the matter. U.S. authorities blame the Yemen-based branch of al Qaeda for a string of plots against Americans, including the failed attempt to blow up a U.S.-bound jetliner with a bomb concealed in an operative's underwear in 2009. Al-Wuhayshi has been referred to as the "crown prince" of the global terror organization al Qaeda.
