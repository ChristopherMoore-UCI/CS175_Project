Johnson drove Gabriel to San Antonio from Tempe, Arizona, and she went to Florida a week later, according to investigators. San Antonio police have been working with the FBI and Tempe police. "Let me say this, that we do remain hopeful that baby Gabriel is alive," William McManus, chief of the San Antonio Police Department, said at a news conference at the landfill. She told Gabriel's father she killed the boy and has also said she gave him away to a couple in San Antonio, police say. A lead prompted investigators to focus on the landfill, which is owned by Republic Services, a waste and environmental services company based in Phoenix, Arizona.
