The DEKA bionic arm can be configured for people with limb loss at the shoulder joint, mid upper arm or mid lower arm, the FDA said. "This innovative prosthesis provides a new option for people with certain kinds of arm amputations," said Christy Foreman, director of the FDA's Office of Device Evaluation. In considering whether to approve the device, the FDA reviewed a Department of Veterans Affairs study involving 36 participants fitted with DEKA arms. Kamen nicknamed the DEKA arm "Luke" after Luke Skywalker, the "Star Wars" hero who was fitted for a prosthetic after losing his right hand in a light-saber duel with Darth Vader. Unlike most current prostheses, the DEKA can perform such delicate tasks as zipping up a coat, unlocking a door with a key or handling an egg without breaking it.
