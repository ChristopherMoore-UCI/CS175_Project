In her work as a doctor, and as an advocate for children without families, she has witnessed brutal treatment of orphans in many parts of the world. The horror of it means that these are children at risk: for early marriage, living in the streets, prostitution, child labor, and finally -- the worst ever -- children who end up exploited by adults, and traded and trafficked. Orphans, whether they be true orphans, double or single, or children living without parental care because they're children whose parents are unable to parent them -- children are at risk.
