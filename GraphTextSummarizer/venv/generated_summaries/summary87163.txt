The Southeast Asian nation's top court issued an order on Tuesday delaying the implementation of the law for 120 days while it waits to hear arguments from several petitions against the new measures, the official Philippines News Agency (PNA) reported. One of the petitions submitted to the court against the law argues that "the State cannot, as a general principle, routinely invade the privacy of married couples in the exercise of their most intimate rights and duties to their respective spouses," according to PNA. "For me it's a good sign, a victory" for those who are against the law, said Bishop Arturo Bastes of Sorsogon, according to PNA. But supporters of the legislation, like Sen. Miriam Defensor Santiago, say it is necessary to help people in the Philippines "escape the vicious cycle of poverty by giving them options on how to manage their sexual lives, plan their families and control their procreative activities." More than 80% of the Philippines' 96 million citizens are Catholic.
