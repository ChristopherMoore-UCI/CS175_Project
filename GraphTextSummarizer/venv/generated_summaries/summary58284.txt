In that mountain cave, defendant Sulaiman Abu Ghaith testified, sat the man who had summoned him, his future father-in law: Osama bin Laden. Abu Ghaith was captured last year after years of being among a group of alleged al Qaeda operatives sheltered in Iran. "We are the ones who did it," Abu Ghaith, speaking through an Arabic interpreter, quoted bin Laden as saying. "America will not rest until it accomplishes two things," Abu Ghaith testified he told bin Laden. Shortly after his arrival in the country, Abu Ghaith said, bin Laden summoned him for the first of several meetings.
