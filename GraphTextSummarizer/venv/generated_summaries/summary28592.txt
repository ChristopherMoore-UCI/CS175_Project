What I do know is that African-Americans' fear that black boys are being hunted down at every turn by white men is just as toxic as the fear white people have of the black boogeyman. It presupposes white people -- men in particular -- have a pathology as great as the one put on black men: that they are violent beasts. We can't justify feeling imperiled by the idea that white men are gunning us down while rejecting sweeping generalizations regarding black men, some of whom are responsible for many of the murders in urban cities. Much of modern-day talk centers on the reality that store clerks, police and people generally do view black men with suspicion, says analyst Corey Dade. In the two years since, black parents have added "beware white gunman" to the long list warnings they issue to their black sons.
