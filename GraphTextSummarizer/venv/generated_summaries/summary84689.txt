The complaint, filed Friday in the 2nd Judicial District Court in Washoe County, Nevada, alleges that Roethlisberger sexually assaulted the woman -- an executive casino host at Harrah's Lake Tahoe -- while he was staying at the resort for a celebrity golf tournament in July 2008. -- NFL quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, accused of sexually assaulting a woman last summer, said Thursday that he is innocent. According to the complaint, on July 11, 2008, the woman was working on the 17th floor -- the same floor as Roethlisberger's room -- when Roethlisberger told her that his television and sound system were not working. The woman filed a civil complaint against Roethlisberger last week. Marybel Batjer of Harrah's declined to comment on the suit, other than to say that the alleged victim still works at Harrah's Lake Tahoe as an executive casino host.
