The embassy of Sweden acts as our protecting power for issues involving U.S. citizens in North Korea," Nuland said Tuesday. -- An American citizen has been detained in North Korea for more than a month, U.S. officials said Tuesday. Bae's detention was first reported by South Korean newspapers, which said that Bae, a tour operator, entered North Korea at the port city of Rajin accompanied by five other tourists. The U.S. government does not believe that Kenneth Bae, who has traveled to North Korea several times before, is being mistreated, a U.S. official told CNN. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland would only say that the United States was aware of the reports of Bae's detention, but because of privacy considerations, it would not discuss the issue further.
