Telepresence is designed to capture the gestures and expressions of human communication. I'd gone to the UK offices of Cisco to report on the latest innovation in the field of video conferencing, 'Telepresence'. See the 'Telepresence' system in action, and hear more about the potential positive impact it will have on business and the environment in this month's CNN Business Traveller. The man on the opposite side of the table is in fact thousands of miles away in California. My expectations weren't high, but what I saw was so exciting that I bored friends, family and colleagues with talk of it for days afterwards.
