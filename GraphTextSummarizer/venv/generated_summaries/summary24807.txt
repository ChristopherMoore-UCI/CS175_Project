-- New Kids on the Block singer Jonathan Knight left fans confused and concerned Thursday when he walked off stage in the middle of a concert in New York. On his Twitter account, Knight appeared to give fans a simple apology, tweeting "I'm sorry......" on Thursday evening. According to reports, the five-member boy band was performing a mix of their old hits from the late '80s and early '90s, along with music from their new album, "10," when onlookers noticed that Knight seemed out of place. NKOTB, one of the heartthrob boy bands of the late '80s and early '90s, came off a lengthy hiatus in 2008, and have issued two albums since then. The rest of NKOTB went on singing as fans chanted for Knight's return, but he never came back.
