"We plan to send a full squadron of 12 to the White House for President Obama as a present," said Reza Kioumarsi, a spokesman for the Aaye Art Group, a Tehran-based non-profit, non-governmental company that makes novelty items. -- An Iranian non-profit company says it will honor U.S. President Barack Obama's request that Iran return a drone that crashed there last year. In December, Obama said the United States has asked Iran to return the highly classified RQ-170 Sentinel drone. President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad gave a speech in December that seemed to suggest that Iran wouldn't return it. Iran has said the country's armed forces had downed the drone near Kashmar, some 225 kilometers (140 miles) from the border with Afghanistan on December.
