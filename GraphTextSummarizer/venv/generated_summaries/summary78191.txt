Dubuque Police Lt. Samuel Baxter told CNN that quite a few people called in to alert the police about a "zebra and parrot trapped in a vehicle parked at a bar. "They love going for rides," John Reiter's girlfriend, Vicky Teters, said to CNN affiliate KCRG. Reiter was arrested Sunday and held overnight, while the zebra and parrot were taken safely to a friend's house. What makes this case unusual are the passengers that police in Dubuque say were with him: a parrot on his shoulder and a zebra in the back seat. We take them for car rides," Teters told KCRG.
