Many Americans are concerned about this administration's effort to exert greater control over car companies, banks, energy, and health care, but over-regulating employers won't create more employment, overtaxing investors won't foster more investment. Here in Virginia, we've faced our highest unemployment rate in more than 25 years, and bringing new jobs and more opportunities to our citizens is the top priority of my administration. Now is the time to adopt innovative energy policies that create jobs and lower energy prices. Advances in technology can unleash more natural gas, nuclear, wind, coal, alternative energy that will lower your utility bills. Last year, we were told that massive new federal spending would create more jobs immediately and hold unemployment below 8 percent.
