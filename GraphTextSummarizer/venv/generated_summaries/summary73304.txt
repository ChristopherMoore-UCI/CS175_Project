The lawsuit is framed similarly to a case brought in California, in which a judge in June deemed teacher tenure unconstitutional, saying it kept bad teachers in the classroom and forced out promising good ones. Reformers say tenure laws and union protections make firing a bad teacher almost impossible, but teachers and their unions argue that school boards and their firing criteria have unfair, overtly political standards. But the New York State United Teachers union said tenure laws are "wildly misunderstood" and claimed teacher tenure does not ensure a job for life, as is commonly believed. Mona Davids and Sam Pirozzolo -- the parents union's president and vice president -- said in a statement that the legal action was not an attack on teachers or unions, but rather an attempt to give their children a voice and establish a system that "rewards and retains excellent teachers" while providing appropriate resources to struggling teachers. Reforming teacher tenure and firing laws is a hotly debated issue in American education, with the California case widely seen as setting the stage for similar action nationally.
