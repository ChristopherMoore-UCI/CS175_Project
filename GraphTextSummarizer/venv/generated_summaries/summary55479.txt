The pro-election protesters started to yell at an anti-government protest group who had just arrived with a big loudspeaker truck on the other side of Lak Si intersection in Bangkok. We had decided to go to a suburb of Bangkok, an area called Lak Si, where I had heard a group of pro-election campaigners were marching to the Lak Si administration office where voting ballots for that constituency were kept. I saw pro-election protesters flinch and throw themselves to the ground. I crawled past six pistol-wielding gunmen who were mingling with anti-government protesters. That office had been blocked by anti-election protestors.
