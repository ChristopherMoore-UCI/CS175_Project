The video, which is viewable online for a fee, drew dramatically increased traffic during the weekend of Kardashian's much-publicized wedding to Humphries, Vivid chief Steven Hirsch said. "Recently, I was approached by a private party who asked us to look into the possibility of acquiring all rights (and copies) of the Vivid 'Kim Kardashian Sex Tape,'" The porn video, made with R&B singer Ray J, brought Kardashian celebrity and launched her reality show career, but she entered a new phase of her life with her marriage this month to NBA player Kris Humphries. Nashville attorney Adam Dread confirmed to CNN he sent a letter to Vivid Entertainment on Monday asking to start negotiations for the sex tape's sale. "I was surprised to receive the attorney's letter offering to buy kimksuperstar.com," Hirsch told CNN Tuesday.
