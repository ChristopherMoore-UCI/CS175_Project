The bus incident also affected the race's electronic timing function, but the official Tour de France website announced that because of the incident all the riders would be awarded the same time. The race continues Sunday with a 156 km second stage in Corsica from Bastia to Ajaccio. -- The opening stage of the Tour de France in Corsica Saturday descended into chaos after a team bus became trapped under the finishing gantry in Bastia.
