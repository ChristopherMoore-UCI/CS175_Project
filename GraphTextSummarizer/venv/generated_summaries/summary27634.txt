"Elizabeth's desire was for what most women want â€” to celebrate her nuptials in a private wedding with family and close friends," Thomas told the affiliate. "Yes, Elizabeth did get married today and we are all thrilled," said Smart's father, Ed, on Saturday. -- Elizabeth Smart, the Utah woman abducted as a teenager and held captive for months, tied the knot at a private ceremony in Hawaii over the weekend.
