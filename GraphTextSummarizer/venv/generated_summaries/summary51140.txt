On Sunday, top officials from the two countries, including South Sudan President Salva Kiir Mayardit and Sudan President Omar al-Bashir, met at the Sheraton Hotel in Addis Ababa in an attempt to bridge these differences. South Sudan formally became a new nation in July 2011, though significant issues with Sudan remain. -- The leaders of Sudan and South Sudan met Sunday in Ethiopia, attempting to resolve -- under international pressure -- issues arising from the latter nation's independence just over a year ago. At the United Nations headquarters in New York, Sudan's ambassador to the U.N., Dafalla Al-Haj Yousif, likewise pointed to what he described as "good progress in all the issues discussed between the two parties. "Our purpose is to spur the parties to meet their obligations and to create a foundation for lasting peace." Peter Wittig, Germany's U.N. ambassador and the current president of the U.N. Security Council, noted the governments have failed to reach a peace deal in the past but said they cannot afford to let the disagreements linger.
