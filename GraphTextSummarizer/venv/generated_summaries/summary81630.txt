Total is not developing an enormous oil field it has held since the 1970s despite recent entreaties from Southern Sudan to do so, Ajak said. They have not yet come in," he said, suggesting that the newly independent country would break up the block Total holds and auction parts off to other companies. In addition to Total, China and Malaysia are big investors in Southern Sudan's oil fields.
