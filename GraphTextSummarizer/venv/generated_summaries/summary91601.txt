"Millennials are consuming things differently, and that includes going to the movies,"  MoviePass's chief executive and co-founder Stacy Spikes told the Times. Younger people are already enthusiastic users of subscription services like Netflix for movies and Spotify for music, which allows them to consume what they want, when they want. AMC Theaters is reportedly exploring that with a pilot partnership with MoviePass, a company which offers a subscription service where movie lovers can attend a movie a day for a monthly fee. "It frankly wouldn't be smart to ignore the success of subscription in other areas of media," Christina Sternberg, the senior vice president for corporate strategy at AMC, told The Times. A $45 per month option includes 3D and IMAX films.
