Morris surrendered after a third party tipped off police, said Police Chief Jane Castor. Castor said Brantly was arrested by Hillsborough County sheriff's deputies in Brandon and is facing federal charges of witnessing a felony, and not reporting it. Curtis pulled the vehicle over about 2:15 a.m. Tuesday and Brantly gave him identification and vehicle registration that did not match the vehicle, according to police. They meant the department would be able to provide officers Jeffrey Kocab and David Curtis with the honorable tribute they deserve, Castor said. Castor said the two women were supposed to have met for the first time at a party planned for Saturday night.
