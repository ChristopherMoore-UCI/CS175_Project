Cranston, who's directing the upcoming April 11 episode of ABC's Modern Family, is expected to direct the ninth episode of Breaking Bad's final season (the 2013 premiere, assuming all goes according to plan). -- The question of whether AMC will indeed split the final season of Breaking Bad is close to an official verdict. With Breaking Bad production under way and summer right around the corner, obviously the schedule should get firmed up soon, though AMC has shown a willingness to engage in some production brinksmanship in the past. Emmy-winning series star Bryan Cranston says AMC will break the award-winning drama's final 16-episode season into two separate runs, as has been speculated for months.
