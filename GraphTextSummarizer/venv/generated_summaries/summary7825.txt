Wellington is of special significance to Lomu after he spent three years playing for the regional Hurricanes team in the southern hemisphere's Super Rugby competition, while also representing the city in provincial competition. New Zealand great Jonah Lomu, a veteran 63 caps for the All Blacks in the 15-a-side form of the game, will act as an ambassador for next month's HSBC Sevens Worldwide Series event in Wellington. "He is a legend in the game of fifteens, and more importantly, he's a legend in the game of sevens," Sevens Wellington general manager Marty Donoghue said in a statement. Despite his many triumphs, sevens success in Wellington evaded Lomu. " Before becoming the youngest player to be selected for an All Blacks Test match in 1994, Lomu shot to prominence with his performances at that year's Hong Kong Sevens event.
