The film is directed by Alex Gibney, whose work has included acclaimed documentaries "Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room" and "Taxi to the Dark Side." "Client 9" traces the prostitution scandal that ended Spitzer's term as governor of New York in 2008. Spitzer: What I've said throughout this is that I resigned because I thought it was the appropriate step to take in the context of what I had done, whether there were other things going on or what others were focused on. CNN: Did you have any rules going in about things you wouldn't discuss? Spitzer: I don't recall that there were any ground rules. Spitzer: If you begin with the premise that he was making the movie, it just seemed to me to make more sense to participate and present the facts as I saw them. I think I'm many different things to many different people.
