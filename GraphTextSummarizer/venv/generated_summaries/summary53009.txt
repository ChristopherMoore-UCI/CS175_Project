Brooks, the former chief executive of Rupert Murdoch's UK newspaper arm, News International, and onetime editor of the News of the World and The Sun newspapers, has denied having a long-running affair with Coulson but said they were close. -- Chasing stories on soccer star David Beckham for rival papers put a strain on the relationship between former newspaper chief Rebekah Brooks and ex-Downing Street spin doctor Andy Coulson, a court heard Wednesday. Brooks also told the court Wednesday about how she learned while on vacation in Italy in 2006 that police had raided the News of the World offices and royal editor Clive Goodman had been arrested, accused of intercepting voice mails of members of the royal household. Brooks, Coulson and five others are on trial facing phone hacking charges, including conspiracy to intercept the voice mails of high-profile figures in Britain. She told the court he was alleging that other people at News International knew he was accessing voice mails, that others knew about the practice and were involved in it.
