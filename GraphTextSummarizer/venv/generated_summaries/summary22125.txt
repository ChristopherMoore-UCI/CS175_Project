Grieving mother's mission to stop hot car deaths The Connecticut death came a month after a similar incident in suburban Atlanta garnered national headlines. In the Georgia case, a grand jury ended up indicting Justin Ross Harris on eight counts, including malice murder and two counts of felony murder, over the death of his 22-month-old son, Cooper. At least 44 children died in 2013 from heatstroke caused by being left in cars in the United States, according to the national nonprofit organization KidsAndCars.org. The death of Benjamin Seitz was ruled a homicide in August. On July 7, the elder Seitz was supposed to drop his son off at day care, but the dropoff never occurred, his wife, Lindsey Rogers-Seitz  said.
