Facing former Australian fast bowler Brett Lee, a man who took 310 wickets in 76 Tests, Morgan was pummeled during a six-ball blast. CNN digital writer Chris Murphy plays amateur cricket with Morgan, so what was his analysis of his teammate's performance? And from the cosy surroundings of his U.S. home, Morgan took to Twitter to criticize England's wretched batting in the first three Ashes Tests -- matches in which Australia cruised to victory. With Lee not holding back, Morgan gave the appearance of a rabbit caught in the headlights as he backed away from nearly every delivery. Morgan, who likes to tweet from the lip, has been one of England's most outspoken critics over the past few weeks following the team's embarrassing capitulation against Australia in the fiercely contested Ashes series.
