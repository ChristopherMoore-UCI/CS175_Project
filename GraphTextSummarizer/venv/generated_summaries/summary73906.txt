-- A  free concert in Manhattan by Canadian  rapper Drake and pop trio Hanson was canceled Tuesday evening because of an unruly crowd, police said. The  mayhem erupted before Drake, whose widely anticipated new album hit stores  Tuesday, took the stage. "NYPD will not let me go on stage tonight," he tweeted  shortly before he was supposed to perform. One  third of Hanson, Zac, talked about the incident on his offical Twitter account: "Had to cancel the free NYC show  today because of a crazy audience that was breaking things at the mixing  board." A  spokeswoman for the NYPD disputed the idea that police called off the concert,  telling CNN that the event's promoters made that call.
