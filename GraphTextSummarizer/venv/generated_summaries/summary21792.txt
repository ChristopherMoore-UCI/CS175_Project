With mom in 'heart and soul,' Rochette goes for medal "I don't know how I ever got through this whole program. " Joannie Rochette rose through the ranks of Canadian skaters, winning junior national titles before winning six straight senior national championships from 2005 to 2010. Rochette made her mom very proud Thursday night, winning a bronze medal in the women's figure skating final, just four days after Therese Rochette died of a heart attack. Without her mother to support her, Joannie Rochette skated into Canada's collective heart by relying on all those years of training, all those years of committing jumps and spins to muscle memory. When things weren't going so well in the first week Rochette was here for Olympics training, she called her mom, seeking her advice on what to do about her triple Lutz.
