"Photos of society and social inequality can help eliminate poverty by creating social awareness," explained Mohammad Rakibul Hasan, the 2010 CGAP Photo contest winner and a judge on this year's panel. The purpose of the contest is to give amateur and professional photographers a chance to show the different ways that poor households manage their financial lives and make their lives better through financial inclusion. Housed at the World Bank, CGAP is an advocacy group that works with development agencies, foundations, and national governments to advance the lives of the poor by improving their access to finance. Every year, the Consultative Group To Assist The Poor (or CGAP) hosts a photo contest asking entrants to submit photos based around the idea of microfinance.
