Take a closer look at the Western lowland gorilla Â» While the discovery in northern Congo indicates that the gorilla population remains stable in some areas, it is likely that gorillas will remain critically endangered because the threats facing the species are so great, Rainey said. Acting on a tip from hunters who indicated the presence of gorillas, Rainey said that the researchers trekked on foot through mud for three days to the outskirts of Lac Tele, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) from the nearest road. "When we went there, we found an astonishing amount of gorillas," said Rainey, speaking from the International Primatological Society Congress in Edinburgh, Scotland. "This is the highest-known density of gorillas that's ever been found," Rainey said. Though researchers did spot some gorillas, they based their estimate on the number of gorilla nests found at the site, Rainey said.
