Speaking at a breakfast hosted by the Christian Science Monitor, White House senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer told reporters that after Friday's address on the topic in Las Vegas, Obama will head to Chicago next Tuesday to speak with activists. Some Republicans have floated attaching a policy rider to the upcoming must-pass government spending bill that would defund implementation of the executive order, which President Obama would then veto, effectively leading to another shutdown. Pfeiffer defended the choice to move on key issues unilaterally, arguing that, for the President, even "getting out of bed in the morning comes with Republican opposition." "Certainly, our hope is that Republicans will listen to Senator McConnell, who has said two things: one is that Republicans have to demonstrate to the American people that they can govern, and two, there'll be no shutdowns or threats or things [like impeachment]," Pfeiffer said. -- The White House is planning a "very aggressive sales job" that will involve the Vice President, cabinet members and travel across the nation for President Barack Obama's executive action on immigration, a top White House aide said Friday.
