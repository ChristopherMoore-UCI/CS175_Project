"Our peaceful protests (are) stronger than any weapon, and we don't accept any violence," said Murad Mohamad Ali, media adviser to the Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party. The Sinai Peninsula is a lawless area that was the site of frequent attacks even before Egypt's latest round of turmoil. -- Suspected militants armed with rocket-propelled grenades killed at least 25 Egyptian soldiers in the border city of Rafah, state-run Nile TV reported Monday. In May, seven Egyptian solders were kidnapped and held for six days in the Sinai Peninsula, a spokesman for Egypt's armed forces said. In the past week, about 900 people have been killed -- mostly in Cairo -- after supporters of ousted President Mohamed Morsy clashed with the military-backed interim government.
