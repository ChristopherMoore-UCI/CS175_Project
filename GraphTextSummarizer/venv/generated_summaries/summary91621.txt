After an outpouring of people offered to keep an eye out, one Reddit user found Jack wandering in the parking lot of a grocery store and reached out to let Below know. Below, a professor at the University of Texas School of Public Health, told HLN that she was originally worried that she couldn't dedicate the time to Jack that he deserved. That night, Below decided to take to Reddit to see if she could spread the word to look for Jack. Below finally found Jack with the woman who had contacted her, and when she did, the reunion was nothing but tears and palpable relief. A Reddit user put her in touch with a man that maintains a large email list of people involved in animal rescue, which eventually led to one of the people on the list finding Jack.
