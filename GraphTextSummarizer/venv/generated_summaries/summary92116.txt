Gloria Borger says Democrats seem to be aiding the GOP in its attempt to defeat President Obama on health care. Here's where you have to give President Obama credit: He promised health care reform during the campaign, and he's trying to do what he said he would do. And the Democrats' foray into taxing the rich hasn't done Obama any favors, either: Just one month ago, voters earning more than $50,000 liked Obama more than the GOP on health care by a 2-1 margin. Instead, Obama's Democrats have so far given him higher costs (according to the Congressional Budget Office) and higher taxes. He has held health care symposiums and town halls, met with recalcitrant conservatives and moderates, and kept tabs with congressional leaders on their progress.
