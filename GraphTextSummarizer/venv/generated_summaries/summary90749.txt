Eventually, crew members radioed back saying they had been taken hostage by heavily armed pirates, officials said. The M/V Iceberg has a crew of 24 from Yemen, India, Ghana, Sudan, Pakistan and the Philippines, officials said. The M/V Iceberg denied it had been taken over, saying it was having mechanical difficulties. "The vessel may have been on its way to either assist other pirates in distress, or look for another merchant vessel to attack," he said. The M/V Iceberg was last been seen off the coast of the Somali town of Garacaad, a known pirate haven, but its exact location was unknown until USS McFaul positively identified it.
