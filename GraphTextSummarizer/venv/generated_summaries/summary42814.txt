But the Krugers were uncomfortable with their options for healing her skin: temporarily use skin from a cadaver or from a pig, or take her small portion of undamaged skin and graft it elsewhere. He explained that in Pippi's case, the price tag of new skin is $82,000. After days on the Internet and hours reaching out to reconstructive specialists in the United States, Pippi's mother discovered a company in Boston called Genzyme whose specialty is growing layers of human skin by cloning a 2-square-centimeter sample from a patient. The grafted skin could tear, and infection is possible from the trace amounts of murine cells, which come from lab rats or mice, used to aid skin growth. Even when the skin does make it to the patient within 24 hours -- as it did for Pippi last Monday after a trans-Atlantic flight -- potential risks are many.
