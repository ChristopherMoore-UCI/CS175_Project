-- Despite being an 18-time world-record holder, Japanese swimmer Mieko Nagaoka is determined to win more medals and break more world records. With the world's longest life expectancy (84 years), and one of the lowest birthrates, Japan is expected to see sales of adult diapers overtake those of baby diapers by 2020. Her coach is also full of praise for Nagaoka, saying she is "the type who just doesn't want to be defeated and is strongly determined to win more gold medals, world records.
