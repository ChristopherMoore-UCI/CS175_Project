If Summit's estimates hold up, that's just a touch ahead of "Breaking Dawn -- Part 1," which started with $138.1 million last year, and just a touch behind New Moon, which opened with $142.8 million in 2009. About that 'twist'... There's still a chance that Breaking Dawn -- Part 2 could become the highest grossing Twilight film domestically â€” though it seems unlikely given the fact that Breaking Dawn -- Part 1 ($281.3 million) earned substantially less than Eclipse ($300.5 million). That consistency may be why Breaking Dawn -- Part 2 didn't experience an expected box office boost, despite being the grand finale of the popular franchise. Fortunately for Summit (a Lionsgate company following their acquisition earlier this year), who spent about $120 million to produce Breaking Dawn -- Part 2, that cult of loyal fans is still gigantic. Twihards are known for rushing to the theater at the first possible moment, so Breaking Dawn -- Part 2 is expected to fall quickly from here, but with the lucrative Thanksgiving frame coming up, it should enjoy at least one more massive weekend and climb to about $300 million total.
