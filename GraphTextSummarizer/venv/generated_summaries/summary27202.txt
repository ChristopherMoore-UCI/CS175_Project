He has called for a "discretionary power" to exclude citizens from the UK, though this seems to imply an arbitrary competence exercised according to the rule of government, not the legal certainty and procedural protection required by the rule of law, and with no regard either to the rights and interests of other states, or to the necessity for improved international cooperation. Exclusion orders have been used against UK citizens in the recent past, limiting freedom of movement between Great Britain and Northern Ireland from the 1970s to the 1990s; but these orders were an internal matter, applied to citizens within the United Kingdom, whereas the Prime Minister's notion is to exclude citizens from the UK. Time and again, the Security Council has stressed that whatever measures states take to deal with terrorist-related threats must comply with all their obligations under international law. Passports can be withdrawn or "canceled" for a number of reasons, including public interest grounds such as suspicion that the holder might be involved in international organized crime or in terrorism. Whether more are needed is a matter for debate, but clearly, as the U.N. Security Council affirmed last September in its unanimous resolution on "foreign terrorist fighters," states must also address the underlying factors, as well implementing rehabilitation and reintegration strategies.
