Terreblanche, 69, was bludgeoned with clubs and stabbed with a machete during the attack at his farm near Ventersdorp in South Africa's North West province, police said. -- A South African man was sentenced Wednesday to life in prison for the killing of white supremacist leader Eugene Terreblanche, a lawyer in the case said. The AWB is best known for trying to block South Africa's effort to end apartheid. Chris Mahlangu was convicted on four counts including murder, for which he got life, lawyer Zola Majavu said. Terreblanche, the leader of the neo-Nazi Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (Afrikaner Resistance Movement, or AWB), was killed in April 2010 following an apparent dispute over wages with workers on his farm.
