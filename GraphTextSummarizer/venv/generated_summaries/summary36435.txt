The number represents the 28 million people currently living with cancer worldwide -- a cause near to cancer survivor Armstrong's heart. The start of the final stage of the Tour de France was delayed Sunday when race officials asked Lance Armstrong and his team to remove their commemorative jerseys for cancer survivors. Armstrong was not a top finisher in his last Tour de France ever, but he and his team had planned to ride into Paris' Champs-Elysees with pride Sunday, wearing jerseys with the number 28 emblazoned on them. Armstrong, 38, was diagnosed with advanced testicular cancer in October 1996. The officials told Armstrong and his team to remove the all-black jerseys and continue to wear their official jerseys throughout the race, according to CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent Sanjay Gupta, who was at the event.
