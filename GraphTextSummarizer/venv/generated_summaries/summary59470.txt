FIFA suspend officials amid allegations of World Cup bid corruption The "bribes for votes" scandal took another twist earlier this week when the president of the South American football confederation claimed he received an invitation to last month's British royal wedding the day before the December 2 ballot in Zurich. Meanwhile, former FIFA executive committee member Amos Adamu has appealed against his three-year suspension for allegedly agreeing to accept bribes in the build-up to the votes for the 2018 and 2022 World Cup tournaments. " FIFA investigates officials amid match-fixing claims More than 300 club and international matches are under scrutiny, including two friendlies involving Bolivia, Latvia, Estonia and Bulgaria in Turkey in February. "The threat from match-fixing to the integrity of the global game is significant," FIFA's head of security Chris Eaton told the paper. The announcement came after British newspaper The Daily Telegraph reported that FIFA's investigation centered on a Singapore-born convicted match-fixer who was based near London's Wembley Stadium -- the home of England's national football team.
