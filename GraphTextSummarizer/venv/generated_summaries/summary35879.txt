Watch: Flirtey Zookal flies "As one of the few countries in the world to allow commercial drone activities, Australia is uniquely placed to create a new drone industry and shape the development of regulations in this space," said Zookal CEO Ahmed Haider. Australian textbook rental startup Zookal will begin utilizing drones to make its deliveries in Australia next year, with ambitions of bringing the unique, unmanned delivery method to U.S. customers by 2015. Flirtey, the company that's providing the drones for Zookal's ambitious plan, is in the process of seeking regulatory approval with Australia's Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA). The FAA will need first need to outline a clear policy for commercial drone usage before such a system can make its way to the US, something it hopes to do in 2015. Both the location of the user and the drone's GPS coordinates are transmitted via a smartphone app, and Zookal claims deliveries can be completed in as little as two to three minutes once a drone takes flight.
