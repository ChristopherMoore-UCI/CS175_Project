Los Angeles lawyer Nareg Gourjian will assist lawyers Ed Chernoff and J. Michael Flanagan in defending Murray, who is charged in pop star Michael Jackson's death. The defense lawyers and prosecution will meet for a hearing Tuesday to discuss discovery motions and other issues as they prepare for the start of jury selection on March 24. Gourjian currently represents Joe Finley, an "America's Got Talent" prospect whose wife was found dead last fall at a Los Angeles hotel. Judge Michael Pastor ruled last week that the trial can be televised. Murray is accused of killing Michael Jackson in June of 2009 with an overdose of the anesthetic propofol.
