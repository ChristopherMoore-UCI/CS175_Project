The away win saw Tottenham move up to fifth in the Premier League table, which is led by north London rivals Arsenal. Spurs put victory beyond the home side when Roberto Soldado collected Paulinho's pass and chipped past American keeper Brad Guzan in the 69th minute. The 22-year-old scored on his England debut, signed a new four year contract with Tottenham and then duly rewarded the club by helping them to a 2-0 victory at Aston Villa in Sunday's only Premier League match. There was a sour note to Tottenham's victory when a flare was thrown from the club's section of traveling fans in response to Townsend's opening goal. "It's been one of the best few weeks of my life," Townsend told broadcaster Sky Sports after the match.
