Chan and other protest leaders have proposed a "community education" campaign, in which democracy supporters would enter Hong Kong neighborhoods to sway locals to their cause. In a random survey of 513 people conducted by the University of Hong Kong, 83% said pro-democracy protesters should cease their eight-week occupation of major roads in Hong Kong, while just 13% said the occupiers should continue. The protest has now blocked major roads around Hong Kong nearly two months in an attempt to pressure officials into giving Hong Kong open elections for its next leader. Six were arrested, and the Hong Kong government released a statement denouncing the protesters as "violent radicals." But neither the Beijing or Hong Kong governments have shown any willingness to compromise, and some protesters have grown agitated.
