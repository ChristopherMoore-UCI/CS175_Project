In an unrelated case, Wayne also faces felony drug possession and weapons charges in the state of Arizona. "It's not his gun, they know whose gun it is," Wayne's attorney, Stacey Richman, said after a hearing last month. Dwayne Carter, as he is known legally, pleaded guilty to felony gun charges in a deal with prosecutors October 2009. His latest album, "Rebirth," was released last month. The plea agreement was a result of the rapper's 2007 arrest outside New York's Beacon Theater.
