Pakistani politicians have chosen a close ally of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to serve as the country's president, Pakistani state broadcaster PTV reported Tuesday. Hussain would succeed President Asif Ali Zardari, one of Sharif's longtime political rivals. But after Zardari became president, a constitutional amendment reduced presidential powers in April 2010. Since the presidency is a nonpartisan role, Hussain would have to resign from the Pakistan Muslim League-N party, which Sharif leads. Pakistan's Election Commission said a formal announcement would be made later Tuesday.
