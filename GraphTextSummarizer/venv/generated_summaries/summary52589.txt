Ross said the bill unveiled Tuesday by House Democratic leaders did not address concerns he and other conservative Democrats outlined in a letter late last week to Speaker Nancy Pelosi. "We remain opposed to the current bill, and we continue to meet several times a day to decide how we're going to proceed and what amendments we will be offering as Blue Dogs on the committees," said Rep. Mike Ross, D-Arkansas. Rep. Mike Ross, D-Arkansas, is a leading negotiator for the Blue Dog Democrats on health care. -- A leader of the conservative "Blue Dog" Democrats told CNN Wednesday he and other group members may vote to block House Democrats' health care bill from passing a key committee if they don't get some of the changes they want. Blue Dogs also say the bill fails to fix the inequities in the current system for health care costs for rural doctors and hospitals.
