"We were in Dick's (Sporting Goods) and all of sudden a whole bunch of people started running,"  Madison Strohl told CNN. Miller told CNN that the hospital's emergency department is in lockdown because a suspect had not been apprehended. " A woman who picked up the phone at the Macy's refused comment, telling CNN to reach out to the corporate office before she hung up. At least three people were shot Saturday evening at a Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania-area mall, said a spokesman for the hospital treating the victims.
