-- "It's a woman's world," Vogue contributing editor Andre Leon Talley said as he prepared an installation of little black dresses for a new exhibit at the Savannah College of Art and Design. But as a SCAD trustee and now curator of a museum exhibit consisting entirely of black dresses, Talley is inarguably an expert on the matter, too. Talley believes that if men are willing to put on utility kilts, sooner or later they'll be putting on black lace dresses, like his friend Jacobs. Men don't commonly wear little black dresses, which is why Talley asked some of his favorite female designers -- plus Marc Jacobs, himself known for slipping into a tiny black number -- to help define this iconic piece of clothing in the exhibit's accompanying catalog. "There is room in today's world for men to wear dresses," Talley said.
