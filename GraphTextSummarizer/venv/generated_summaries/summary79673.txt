" It's a surprising statement considering where Merritt is now -- behind bars, charged with murder in the deaths of McStay; his wife, Summer; and their two small children, Gianni and Joseph Jr. The last time anyone heard from the McStay family was February 4, 2010. McStay connected with Chase Merritt, who manufactured custom indoor waterfalls. But when Patrick McStay asked about the call, Merritt said it was a follow-up to their conversation at lunch. Joseph McStay also told his father he was frustrated with Merritt's work. San Bernardino County District Attorney Michael Ramos said he can't yet say what the motive was, but he said his team had been watching Merritt on a daily basis.
