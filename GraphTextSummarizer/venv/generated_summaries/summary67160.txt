-- Lawyers for George Zimmerman, the Florida man who was acquitted of second-degree murder in the killing of Trayvon Martin, plan to ask the state to reimburse Zimmerman for at least $200,000 of expenses incurred during his trial. "I do have an agreement with George that if he comes into money, I would get paid." Despite being currently unemployed, Zimmerman could potentially get income through other sources such as writing a book, or any money resulting from a defamation lawsuit against NBC News for airing an inaccurate editing of Zimmerman's call to non-emergency dispatchers the night Trayvon Martin was shot and killed on February 26, 2012. The costs may include money spent for expert witnesses, travel expenses and fees for transcripts.
