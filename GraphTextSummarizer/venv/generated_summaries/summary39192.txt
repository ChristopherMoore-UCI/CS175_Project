Lobo assumed the presidency in 2010, the first leader elected after a 2009 coup that ousted former President Manuel Zelaya. At an impromptu press conference at an event Monday, Lobo was asked by reporters why the presidential home was undergoing security upgrades, including the installation of a perimeter wall. -- Honduran President Porfirio "Pepe" Lobo has said that there are "high up" forces in his country that want him killed, but declined to give details. The threats stemmed from a new security tax that would be collected and used to fund police operations, Lobo said. "It's unfortunate, but these safety measures must be taken, even more so when they are threatening me," Lobo said.
