Changes on the horizon Though the Obama administration has been campaigning for prison reform for some time, it has recently begun to take concrete steps to alleviate overcrowded federal prisons that are flooded with non-violent offenders. And in April, the U.S. Sentencing Commission voted unanimously to back a Justice Department proposal to change the sentencing formula for drug offenders that could shorten prison stays for as many as 70% of federal drug defendants. Sentencing guidelines The history of federal mandatory minimum sentencing for drug offenses dates back to the 1950s, when a mandatory 10-year sentence could be imposed for crimes such as selling heroin to a juvenile. "My dad died in prison, how much blood does society feel they need?" Many of his supporters believe that minimum mandatory sentencing is an inhumane and inefficient way to fight the war on drugs. In January, Holder urged Congress to pass the bipartisan "Smarter Sentencing Act," which would allow judicial leniency in the sentencing of those convicted of federal non-violent drug crimes.
