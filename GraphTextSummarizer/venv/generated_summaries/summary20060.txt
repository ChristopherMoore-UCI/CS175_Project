-- Anger swept Port-au-Prince on Wednesday as protests erupted throughout the Haitian capital the day after election results were announced. The Joint OAS (Organization of American States) - CARICOM (Caribbean Community) election observation mission said Wednesday the results were not the last word on the Haitian election. Veteran Haitian journalist Ernest Moskolot said Haitian people were simply fed up. Instead he issued a short statement Wednesday evening. "Since last night, the (electoral council) put our country in total chaos by publishing manipulated results," he said. At the smoldering headquarters of candidate Jude Celestin, one man shouted that life was better under the Duvaliers, referring to years of Haiti's father-son dictatorship.
