The Libyan General National Congress (GNC), which is drafting a new Libyan constitution, has demanded Egyptian authorities release Abu Obedia immediately. According to news sources, Abu Obedia's group was responsible for the kidnapping of Libyan Prime Minister Ali Zeidan last October. The envoys, who were abducted by unknown gunmen, included the administrative and cultural attachÃ©s. A spokesman for the Libyan foreign ministry, Said Al-Aswad, told the Egyptian MENA news agency that the motive behind the kidnapping is still unknown and that Libyan authorities were investigating. Earlier on Saturday, the Libyan ambassador to Egypt said that the kidnappings could be in retaliation for the arrest of the LROR head, Shaaban Hadiya, also known as Abu Obedia El-Zawy, in Alexandria on Friday. Al-Marghani said the Libyan government is in touch with the Egyptian government about releasing the LROR chief.
