Turbulence ahead as climate changes The amount of carbon dioxide varies daily somewhat and has cycled historically in accordance with changes in the Earth's orbit, a phenomenon known as Milankovitch cycles. Study: Climate change may contribute to civil wars It may appear that, in the grand scheme of things, there's not a lot of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere to begin with. "Most experts that really study CO2 amounts estimate that we haven't seen that amount of CO2 in our atmosphere in about 3 million years," said J. Marshall Shepherd, climate change expert and professor at the University of Georgia. And in terms of reaching new carbon dioxide highs, 450 will come even faster than than the change from 350 to 400, given observed trends, Shepherd said. Carbon dioxide changes climate and drives acidification of the ocean.
