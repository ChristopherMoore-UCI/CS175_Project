-- Events in North Korea have left the world wondering: Where's leader Kim Jong Un and is he still running perhaps the most isolated country on Earth? Ambassador avoids Kim health question On Tuesday, Ri Tong Il, deputy ambassador from North Korea to the United Nations, declined to respond to CNN's questions about whether such reports mean something larger, such as instability and pending change within the regime. If the worst of political skullduggery has occurred -- that is, Kim is out of power -- then North Korea becomes a place of greater concern, Cha said. "The fact that the No. 2 and No. 3 people in the North Korean system traveled out of North Korea at the same time, after the No. 1 Kim Jong Un has been out of the public eye for weeks, and his wife as well, is very unusual," Green added. But a surprise weekend visit by the No. 2 and No. 3 leaders of North Korea to South Korea has many wondering if bigger intrigue is afoot.
