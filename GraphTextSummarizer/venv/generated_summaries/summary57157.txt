During these critical years, it became clear that party leaders had been abusing their influence by focusing on expanding their own power rather than advancing the agenda of the right. Many Republicans were forced to resign, and Democrats regained control of Congress in 2006. Not only did the scandals offer campaign fodder for Democrats who wanted to challenge the Republicans' self-promotion as the righteous party, but even more importantly, they deflated the enthusiasm of conservative activists who believed their energy and money had been wasted and that their party was just as corrupt as the opposition. Republicans will need to clean their house quickly and find leaders who do not look more interested in the lavish ways of Washington than in the more modest ways of Main Street. Local Republican victories in gubernatorial elections in Virginia and New Jersey boosted the spirits of conservatives who feared Democrats might be on the verge of another New Deal.
