And Marriott has been touring U.S. cities this fall with its "Teleporter," a booth that invites visitors to climb inside, strap on an Oculus Rift and take a virtual tour of Wai'anapanapa Black Sand Beach in Maui and Tower 42 in London. They have an accelerometer, gyroscope and compass to track the position of your head and sync the visuals to the direction where you are looking -- allowing Oculus to improve on the sometimes jerky visuals of other virtual-reality systems. Virtual travel is in its infancy and a long way from being mainstream. The idea is not that virtual travel will replace real-world travel, because nobody in the industry would go for that. It's all part of a new experiment by Marriott, the global hotel chain, to let guests sample virtual destinations with the Oculus Rift, a headset whose high-definition, 3-D display immerses wearers in a lifelike interactive world.
