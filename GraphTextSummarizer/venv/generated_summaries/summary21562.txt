-- Starbucks, better known for amusingly complicated premium coffee offerings, took a cue from fast-food chains and announced a plan Monday to sell pairings of coffee and breakfast for $3.95, citing the economic downturn. The survey found that when adjusted for size differences, some varieties of Starbucks coffee were cheaper than Dunkin' Donuts. But the move may be more targeted to drawing back business lost to more cost efficient retailers like McDonald's and Dunkin' Donuts. Over the last two decades, Starbucks transformed coffee from a commodity drink into a luxury item, growing into a chain with over 10,000 cafes internationally. Starbucks says it's offering breakfast pairings.
