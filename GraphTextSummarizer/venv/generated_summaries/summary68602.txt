The order -- a routine step after a major accident -- requires the railroad to "modify its existing signal system to ensure speed limits are obeyed and to provide two qualified railroad employees to operate trains where major speed restrictions are in place until the signal system is updated." " The railroad also is ordered to identify appropriate modifications to its existing "automatic train control system or other signal systems to enable adequate advance warning of and adherence to such speed restrictions," the FRA statement said. In addition, the statement said, the railroad must submit an action plan ensuring safe operations for passengers and employees by Dec. 31, including target dates and milestones for implementing signal system modifications. Metro-North, meanwhile, must operate trains with two qualified train crew members in the controlling locomotive cab or passenger car control compartment at the locations where speed limits change by 20 mph or more until the signal work is complete.
