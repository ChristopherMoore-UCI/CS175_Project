-- North Korea twice came back from behind to hold Greece 2-2 in a friendly between two sides heading to the World Cup next month, while fellow finalists Paraguay lost 2-1 to the Republic of Ireland. In Dublin, first-half goals from Kevin Doyle and Liam Lawrence helped Ireland to victory over the South Americans. Wolves striker Doyle bundled the opener after Paraguay forward Roque Santa Cruz had headed against his own bar. Lucas Barrios pulled a goal back on his Paraguay debut but Giovanni Trapattoni's men held on for victory. The Koreans leveled when Jong Tae-se beat two players and fired a shot past goalkeeper Michalis Sifakis.
