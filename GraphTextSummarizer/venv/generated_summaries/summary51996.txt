" It was in New York that Roberts befriended legendary amateur golfer Bobby Jones, who in 1930 completed the unique feat of a calendar Grand Slam, by winning the U.S. Open, British Open, U.S. Amateur and British Amateur.

"From the time I met Clifford Roberts until his death, I never knew him to do anything that was not in the best interest of Augusta National. Sampson called Roberts an "iron fist in a velvet glove", and the many stories of Roberts ruthless pursuit of perfection at the course attests to this. He sought money and sanctuary, and together with Roberts conceived the idea of building an ultra-exclusive club in the more temperate south where monied New Yorkers could head for retreat and rounds of golf in the sun.
