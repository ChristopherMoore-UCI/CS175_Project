"Self-presentations can change the way Internet users interact in a manner that increases the risk for online sexual advances," they say. They found that girls are more likely to experience online sexual advances or have offline encounters if they have previously been abused or have a provocative avatar, which is a digital image meant to represent the user online. Looking at the girls' avatar choices, the authors found that girls who present themselves provocatively in body and clothing choices are more likely to have had online sexual advances. Participants were also asked to rate how many times they had had online sexual advances, which were described as "explicit sexual chatting in virtual worlds," and how many times they had met someone in person after meeting first online. "The extent to which provocative self-presentations ... translate into increased online advances or offline encounters is unknown, but it is plausible that these types of presentations constitute an initial invitation for exploitation and a familiar avenue by which sexual advances are initiated," the study says.
