There was also positive news in the Chiba Prefecture Friday, where all five water treatment facilities had levels of radioactive iodine less than 100 becquerels per kilogram of tap water. The previous day, Tokyo Gov. Shintaro Ishihara lifted the previously announced recommendation that babies not drink tap water after tests from Tuesday night showed levels of radiation more than twice the limit for babies. Radiation levels in the food would not cause health problems right away, Edano said, but if they rise, they may reach levels risky to human health. Tokyo's waterworks bureau reported Friday, based on tests conducted that morning, that there were 51 becquerels of radioactive iodine per kilogram of tap water. One chief concern is the presence of radioactive substances in tap water.
