Art enthusiasts ranging from aficionados to the causal tourist queued up in New York on Wednesday to catch a glimpse of Norwegian artist Edvard Munch's "The Scream," which went on display in Manhattan's Museum of Modern Art for a six-month exhibition. Dubbed "the portrait of a soul" and "the face that launched 1,000 therapists," "The Scream" depicts a distorted human figure -- hands flat against its sunken face, eyes and mouth wide open -- in the foreground of a nightmarish landscape. "Seeing it in real life is so special," said Julianna Rees, a San Francisco resident who attended the opening. The exhibit opened Wednesday and runs through April 2013. The previous record for a Munch work of art tallied just over $38 million.
