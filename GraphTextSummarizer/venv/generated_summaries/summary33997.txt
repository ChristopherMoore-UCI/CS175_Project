The body of her daughter, 7-year-old Somer Thompson, was found in a South Georgia landfill, Clay County, Florida, Sheriff Rick Beseler said Thursday. A medical examiner in Savannah, Georgia, used dental records to identify the body positively as Somer's, said Clay County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Mary Justino. On Monday, Somer became separated from her siblings and schoolmates on her way home from school in Orange Park. Somer's family was making funeral arrangements Friday, Justino said, and many in the community had offered to help financially. She was seen in a fight at school before disappearing, according to a police report Thursday.
