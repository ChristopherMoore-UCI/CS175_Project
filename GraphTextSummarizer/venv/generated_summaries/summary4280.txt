The Manhattan clinic that treated comedian Joan Rivers before her death made a number of serious mistakes, including failing to identify deteriorating vital signs, and providing timely intervention, according to a report released Monday. Failing to identify deteriorating vital signs and provide timely intervention; -- Failing to record Rivers' weight, prior to the administration of medication for sedation; -- Failing to consistently document the dose of Propofol, a sedative, administered; -- Failing to get Rivers' informed consent for each procedure performed; -- Failing to ensure that she was cared for only by physicians granted privilege in accordance with the clinic's bylaws; -- And finally, failing to abide by its own cell phone policy (the report found that a photograph was taken of a surgeon and Rivers while she was under sedation). "As any of us would be, Ms. Rivers is outraged by the misconduct and mismanagement now shown to have occurred before, during and after the procedure," it read. The New York medical examiner ruled last month that Rivers died of "therapeutic complications" during a procedure to evaluate her "voice changes" and stomach reflux. The famed 81-year-old entertainer died September 4, a week after an appointment at Manhattan's Yorkville Endoscopy clinic.
