" iReport: Sunderland speaks out Sunderland's brother, Zac, family spokesman Lyle Mercer, and Jeff Casher, a technical advisor for her voyage, also spoke at the news conference. "I mean, I'm living proof that things don't always work out the way you plan, but you can only plan so far on an adventure." Asked her response to those who said she was too young to have embarked on her journey, she said, "I've crossed two oceans, I've sailed around Cape Horn and Cape Argus -- the question of my age should have been over weeks if not months ago. Despite falling short of her goal, she sailed a total of 12,000 nautical miles and became the youngest person to sail around Cape Horn at the tip of South America. They plan to name the child Paul after the captain of the ship that rescued Abby Sunderland, Mercer said. The young sailor's mother and father, Marianne and Laurence Sunderland, missed the news conference because Marianne was in labor, Mercer said.
