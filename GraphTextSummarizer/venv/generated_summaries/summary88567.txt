Vidic's injury limits United's options in central defense, with experienced England international Rio Ferdinand to partner Northern Ireland's Jonny Evans or one of versatile young duo Phil Jones and Chris Smalling. -- Two days after an embarrassingly early European Champions League exit, Manchester United have been dealt a further blow with the news that club captain Nemanja Vidic will miss the rest of this season. "We'll now have to choose between Jonny Evans, Phil Jones and Chris Smalling. The Serbia international has ruptured cruciate ligaments in his knee, and manager Alex Ferguson said the 30-year-old will see a specialist on Monday to reveal the full extent of the injury. " Vidic is part of a growing injury list at Old Trafford, with Mexico striker Javier Hernandez also sidelined after damaging an ankle during last week's 1-0 win over Aston Villa.
