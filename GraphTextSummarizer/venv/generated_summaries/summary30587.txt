" Noriega -- convicted of drug trafficking, money laundering and killing political opponents -- is serving out a prison sentence in Panama, where he was extradited in 2011. Noriega was indicted in the United States on charges of racketeering, laundering drug money and drug trafficking. Amid growing unrest in Panama, then-U.S. President George H.W. Bush ordered the invasion of the Central American nation in December 1989, saying Noriega's rule posed a threat to U.S. lives and property. Former Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega has a message for the publishers of a popular video game that features a mission to capture him: You owe me money. Noriega fled his offices and tried to seek sanctuary in the Vatican Embassy in Panama City.
