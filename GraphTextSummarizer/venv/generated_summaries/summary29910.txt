"I think it's my duty to go out and live life to the full, really." Just a day before the attacks, Wright watched with her colleagues on large TV screens as London was awarded the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games. It was at a "taster" day for disabled sports that Wright first sampled sitting volleyball, a version of the sport that allows anyone to play, including those with a disability. "It's just another weird coincidence that I'm here on the 7th. Britain remembers London terror attacks That date seems to be quite significant in my life." Wright is on Britain's first-ever women's sitting volleyball team, and the 2010 championships in Edmond, Oklahoma, are seen as an important training ground for the 2012 Paralympic Games, which will be held in her hometown.
