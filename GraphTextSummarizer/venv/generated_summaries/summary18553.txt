Anne Kirkbride, who played Deirdre Barlow for more than 40 years on the long-running UK soap opera "Coronation Street," has died. The raspy-voiced character -- Kirkbride had a long smoking habit -- was Kirkbride's main claim to fame, though she started in the theater and was first noticed in another program, a 1972 filmed play called "Another Sunday and Sweet F.A." Intensely private, she once told the Guardian's Anthony Hayward that she was perfectly happy with staying true to "Coronation Street. " Kirkbride was a survivor of non-Hodgkin lymphoma -- she lost her hair and acted in a wig for a time -- and talked about her depression in a 2012 documentary, "Deirdre & Me: 40 Years on Coronation Street." " Kirkbride first showed up on "Coronation Street," the world's longest-running soap opera, in 1972 as a teenager with a handful of lines. According to the Guardian, at one point, the scoreboard at a Manchester United game informed a stadium full of fans that "Deirdre and Ken united again!"
