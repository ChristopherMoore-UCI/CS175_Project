Gholam Shakuri, an Iran-based member of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, is also accused in the alleged hit. Officials in Washington said Monday they would grant consular access to the U.S.-held suspect in an alleged Iranian plot to assassinate the Saudi Arabian ambassador to the United States. "Iran's Foreign Ministry reiterated that any delay by the United States in facilitating consular contact with the Iranian national would be contrary to the logic of international law and the United States' obligations," the Foreign Ministry said. Two State Department officials said Susan Rice, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, met with Mohammad Khazaee, Iran's permanent representative to the United Nations. The State Department said last week there had been direct contact with Iran about the alleged plot, but a senior Iranian official denied it.
