Besides, if Jenkins feels he lacks any knowledge of investment banking, he can simply walk down the corridor and speak to the new chairman of Barclays Sir David Walker who is a veteran of Morgan Stanley as well as the Bank of England and the UK treasury. Barclays badly needs someone who has enough perspective on investment banking to ask tough questions about which parts of the business make sufficient returns to justify the risks being taken, and that genuinely provide customers with a service. Last month the SFO said it was probing the manipulation of Libor and other benchmark lending rates, the scandal that earlier this year cost Barclays both its former chief executive Bob Diamond and chairman Marcus Agius. Barclays also needs to change the "anything goes" trading culture at the investment bank, and come up with an overall strategy that can provide growth against the backdrop of a poor economic environment and a raft of new regulations. New UK regulations, arising out of the commission led by Sir John Vickers, already stipulate that retail must be ring fenced so that depositors' funds are protected from any losses arising in the investment bank.
