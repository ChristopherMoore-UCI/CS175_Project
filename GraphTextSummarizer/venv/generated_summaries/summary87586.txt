"Taha has given a directive for immediate application of the Emergency Act along the border with South Sudan state," the official Sudan News Agency said. The report of the bombing of the towns of Bentiu and Rubkona came days after South Sudan pulled its troops at the request of the United Nations from the disputed oil-rich region of Heglig, though Sudan says its soldiers retook the area from South Sudanese soldiers. He called on Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir and South Sudan's President Salva Kiir "to stop the slide towards further confrontation and urges both sides to return to dialogue as a matter of urgency," the statement said. "He said that the attempt of South Sudan state to destroy the oil facilities in Heglig can never cripple the Sudanese people, affirming that the Sudanese people are capable to renew its economic strength, provide resources and doubling its capability for production at all arenas. South Sudan said it was complying with a request from the U.N. Security Council to pull troops out, while Sudan said it had defeated the southern army and forced it to retreat.
