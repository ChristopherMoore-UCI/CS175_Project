Another Spanish player, Ruben de la Red of Real Madrid, has been unable to play since collapsing during a Copa del Rey tie in October 2008 with what doctors suspect is a heart-related problem. -- Spanish club Sevilla have been rocked by the news that defender Sergio Sanchez has been ruled out for an indefinite period due to a heart problem.
