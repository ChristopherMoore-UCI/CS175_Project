After a slump in the fortunes of Australian Rugby in the early 1970s, an in-depth survey of the past, present and future Rugby Union was carried out, resulting in a re-appraisal of coaching Rugby World Cup techniques and a restructuring of the administration. The inaugural meeting of the Australian Rugby Football Union was held on November 25, 1949, with 11 delegates from New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia, Tasmania and Victoria. In 1892 the Southern Rugby Union of New South Wales and the Northern Rugby Union of Queensland (formed in 1883) became New South Wales and Queensland Rugby Unions, respectively. Sir Leslie Herron, the President of New South Wales Rugby Union, was a guiding hand in the formation of the Australian Rugby Football Union and overseeing activity through his role as chairman. Rugby Union formally began in Australia with the formation of the first clubs, the oldest of which is the Sydney University Club, formed in 1864.
