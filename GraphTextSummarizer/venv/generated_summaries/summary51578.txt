Routh apparently believed his co-workers were cannibals, his neighbor was dealing drugs for the Mexican mafia and that Kyle and his friend, Chad Littlefield, were "hybrid pig people," Mitchell Dunn, the psychiatrist, testified. The defense rested its case Thursday in the trial of the man accused of killing Chris Kyle, subject of the hit film "American Sniper," and Kyle's friend at a Texas firing range two years ago. However, Dunn also testified that Routh told him: "As soon as I did it, I realized I made a mistake," in an apparent reference to shooting Kyle and Littlefield. Kyle and Littlefield took Routh to the firing range as a kind of therapy. Correction: Earlier versions of this report incorrectly described the military background of Chad Littlefield, who was killed with Chris Kyle.
