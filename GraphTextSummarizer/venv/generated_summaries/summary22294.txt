The reigning world champion has proved all-conquering on his Repsol Honda but was pushed all the way in Indianapolis by Yamaha pair Jorge Lorenzo and Valentino Rossi, who occupied the other podium positions. Marc Marquez continued his record breaking 2014 MotoGP season with a 10th straight win Sunday to match the feat of Australian Mick Doohan in 1997. Pol Espargaro (Monster Yamaha Tech3) took a fine fifth with his British teammate Bradley Smith in sixth after a heavy crash in Saturday practice. Rossi briefly led before slipping back to the third place, but the points saw him become the first man to top 4,000 in MotoGP. Smith's compatriot Cal Crutchlow (Ducati) was seventh with his teammate Andrea Dovizioso in eighth.
