We even make excuses for the name-callers because it's difficult to decipher, especially for young girls, when the offender means it in a tough love, sisterly kind of way or a "he didn't mean it in that kind of way," as Little League standout Mo'ne Davis said on ESPN's SportsCenter on Monday. It was the right call and the university's action spoke volumes about its integrity -- and how it values women and girls. Men who grow up to disrespect women do not only learn those lessons by watching TV or playing video games. You see, for generations, black girls have been so conditioned to being called these over-sexualized names -- first by our slave masters, then our mothers, sisters, friends and eventually the world -- that today many times we don't even take offense. but I know he's hurting even more," said Davis, the first girl in Little League World Series history to earn a win and pitch a shutout.
