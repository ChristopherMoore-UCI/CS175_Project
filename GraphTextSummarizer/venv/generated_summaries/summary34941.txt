Some people online say the Megaupload takedown, which came a day after Wikipedia and other sites went black in protest of the pending legislation, was largely symbolic -- singling out one site while bigger ones still thrive. People who paid for a premium account on the site were able to upload and download larger files. MegaVideo was the site's video service, letting even nonmembers view more than an hour of video at a time on the site, and MegaPix was a photo storage and sharing site in the mold of Flickr or Photobucket. But to millions, the 6-year-old site, based in Hong Kong, was a fast, easy way to store massive files in a "locker" online and then share them with friends or colleagues. Seng Ung of Boston said he recently paid roughly $260 for a lifetime membership so he could store old files from childhood and college.
