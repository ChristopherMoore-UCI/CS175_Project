Gaze across a line-up of Google security staff today and you'll find women like Tabriz are few and far between -- though in the last few years she has hired more female tech whizzes. Meet Parisa Tabriz, the 31-year-old with perhaps the most enchanted job title in engineering -- "Google Security Princess." Her job is to hack into the most popular web browser on the planet, trying to find flaws in the system before the "black hats" do. Tabriz's biggest concern now is the people who find bugs in Google's software, and sell the information to governments or criminals. To defeat Google's attackers, Tabriz must firstly think like them. "What we've seen in the last couple of years is what we suspect to be governments trying to intercept communications," said Tabriz.
