-- When flight attendants needed help with a disruptive passenger, Mets pitcher LaTroy Hawkins didn't balk. Hawkins, 40, tweeted about the experience, which he said interrupted his American Airlines flight from Dallas-Fort Worth to Santiago, Chile, where the ballplayer planned to go dove hunting. Hawkins said a passenger became upset when a flight attendant told him he couldn't sit in an open seat in business class. "The plane was met by local law enforcement when it arrived" in Lima, spokesman Matt Miller told CNN. "Other passengers on the flight helped our flight attendants escort the individual off the plane."
