On Monday Williams retweeted the NBC tweet adding: "This is going to be so fun." " "It's been a huge year for Pharrell, with recognition for his contribution in the world of music -- the Despicable Me franchise soundtracks, his Oscar-nominated song 'Happy' and his Grammy-winning collaboration with Daft Punk on the breakout dance hit 'Get Lucky.' Yet another reason for fans of "The Voice" to get "Happy." NBC tweeted confirmation on Monday that Pharrell Williams will be joining the show as a coach for Season 7 of the reality singing competition. His dominance in record sales in 2014, coupled with his incomparable accomplishments in the world of fashion and design, make him an irresistible addition to The Voice family," said Paul Telegdy of NBC Entertainment. That's music to the ears of many fans who have been clamoring for Williams to be involved with the show.
