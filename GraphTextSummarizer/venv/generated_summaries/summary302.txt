"This was not good as we hoped for," Lois Greste, mother of Australian journalist Peter Greste, told reporters at the court. In a statement issued after the ruling, Al Jazeera urged Egyptian authorities to move swiftly to a retrial. Amnesty International has said that Greste, Fahmy and Mohamed are pawns in a geopolitical dispute between Egypt and Qatar, the tiny but oil-rich Middle Eastern country that finances Al Jazeera. Peter Greste, Mohamed Fadel Fahmy and Baher Mohamed were convicted in June of supporting the banned Muslim Brotherhood. "Baher, Peter and Mohamed have been unjustly in jail for over a year now," an Al Jazeera spokesman said.
