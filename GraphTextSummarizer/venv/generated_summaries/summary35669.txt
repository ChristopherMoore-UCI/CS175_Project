-- A top-secret court has renewed the authority of U.S. national security officials to collect telephone data as part of an anti-terror surveillance program that was exposed by intelligence leaker Edward Snowden. The national intelligence office did not say when the periodic renewal order from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court was handed down, but NSA legal authority under the Patriot Act to collect telephone metadata surveillance was due to expire on Friday. Although Verizon was singled out in the Snowden leak on telephone surveillance, it is believed that the government obtains similar orders for other telecommunications providers. Following the Snowden leaks, certain information about telephone collection was declassified "in order to provide the public with a more thorough and balanced understanding of the program," a statement from the national intelligence office said. Forget it, we're all celebrities online now "Consistent with his prior declassification decision and in light of the significant and continuing public interest" in the matter, the office decided to declassify and disclose publicly that it had filed an application to renew telephone metadata collection "in bulk" and that the court "renewed that authority.
