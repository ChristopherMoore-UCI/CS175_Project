Porpoises are smaller and stouter than their dolphin cousins; they have shorter beaks, and live in smaller groups. Pollution, overfishing, and intensive development on the Yangtze have all combined to push the porpoise near extinction. That hope, such as there is, can be found West of Wuhan in Tian-e-Zhou oxbow lake. Professor Kou and his colleagues research the rare mammal in a series of deep blue pools at the Institute for Hydrobiology in Wuhan. He said the prospect of survival in the Yangtze is bleak, but he clings onto hope for the species.
