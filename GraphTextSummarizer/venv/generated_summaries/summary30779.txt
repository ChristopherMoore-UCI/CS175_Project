Besides bequeathing everything to Chunmun, the couple say they have started a fund that will raise money to rescue monkeys and build centers for their rehabilitation. An Indian couple who are estranged from their families say they've named Chunmun in their will as their only "child," bequeathing to it their house in northern India's Uttar Pradesh state, other properties and all their money. The couple didn't specify how much money could be coming Chunmun's way, other than to say they have millions of rupees in bank accounts. Shabista told CNN on Friday that bought Chunmun, then just a month old, from a roadside artist in 2005 after seeing the owner beat the animal with a stick. Though she and her husband have no children, Shabista said they take care of Chunmun like he's their son.
