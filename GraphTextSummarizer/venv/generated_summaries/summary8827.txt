The airline called in the FBI, which Thorenson said has jurisdiction over anything that happens to a commercial passenger airliner in flight. -- FBI investigators were working Tuesday to discover what caused a small hole in the body of a US Airways jet. The puncture in the Boeing 737 airliner is the size and shape of a bullet hole, but that doesn't mean someone shot at the plane, said Amy Thorenson, a spokeswoman for the FBI in Charlotte, North Carolina. It was not immediately clear how many people were aboard that flight, but all of the passengers were accommodated on other flights, a US Airways spokeswoman said. It's unclear whether the hole appeared before or during that flight or while the airliner was on the ground in Charlotte, but investigators and the airline were operating under the assumption that it happened in flight, Thorenson said.
