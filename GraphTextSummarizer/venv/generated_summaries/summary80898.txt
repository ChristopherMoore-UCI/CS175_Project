The former star of the TV series "The Partridge Family" was booked in a Los Angeles jail on a driving under the influence of alcohol charge early Saturday, the statement said. Former teen idol David Cassidy faces his third drunken driving charge  after being stopped for an illegal turn in Los Angeles on Friday night. Cassidy, 63, blew .19% -- twice the legal level --  on an alcohol test administered by the California Highway Patrol officer who stopped the singer-actor's rented Chevrolet Impala, according to a CHP statement Saturday. Cassidy was arrested on a drunken driving charge in Schodack, New York, last August after he failed to dim his car's headlights at a police checkpoint, according to the police report. When the show was canceled after four seasons, Cassidy launched his own pop music career, filling concert halls with screaming teenage girls attracted to such hits as "I Think I Love You."
