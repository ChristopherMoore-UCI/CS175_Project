-- A chemical accident involving chlorine gas injured nearly 40 people Tuesday at a plant for security technology in Bruhl. The incident occurred when two chemicals -- sodium hypochlorite and hydrochloric acid -- came into contact, emitting chlorine gas. Air tests were conducted inside the building where the accident occurred and in surrounding buildings, Brachschoss said. More than 46,000 people live in Bruhl, about 10 miles south of Cologne. Of the 39 victims, seven were seriously injured, according to Markus Brachschoss, a spokesman for the local fire department.
