Security cameras at the Bogota intersection recorded a man crossing the street while cars were stopped at a red light, CNN affiliate Caracol TV reported. Several bomb blasts occur every year in Bogota, but assassination attempts are uncommon, said Ben West, senior tactical analyst for Stratfor. "This kind of attack in Bogota has become extremely rare, but nonetheless seems designed to drive home a political point, that the guerrillas retain this capacity for violence," Arnson said. Earlier Tuesday, police detected and deactivated a car bomb in central Bogota. "Nobody else could have done it, and we have reasons to say what we are saying," Bogota Police Chief Luis Eduardo Martinez told reporters, according to Caracol.
