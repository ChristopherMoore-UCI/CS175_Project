-- What has Jay Leno done lately for NBC in late night? Networks increasingly see this as a key ingredient in times when conventional TV ratings continue to sag amid myriad channel choices. But Fallon, as well as Kimmel and TBS' late night standard-bearer, Conan O'Brien, all excel in a social media arena that remains of little if any interest to either Leno or Letterman. Fallon and Kimmel also boast a number of "viral videos" with star supporting players ranging from first lady Michelle Obama to actor Ben Affleck. He did so year after year against a variety of competitors in a much less crowded late-night field.
