Dozens of Atlanta public school educators falsified standardized tests or failed to address such misconduct in their schools, Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal said Tuesday in unveiling the results of a state investigation that confirmed widespread cheating in city schools dating as far back as 2001. Investigators compared the results with test results from other Georgia schools and found that such patterns did not occur normally, Deal said. Interim Superintendent Erroll B. Davis Jr. received school board approval to mandate ethics training for employees and provide remedial help to perhaps thousands of Atlanta Public Schools students who may have improperly advanced because of the cheating. While she believed Hall was supportive of schools in her neighborhood, Cynthia Briscoe Brown, co-president of North Atlanta Parents for Public Schools (NAPPS), told CNN she hopes the new superintendent will extend that to all areas of the city. Administrators must ensure there are equal opportunities at all schools, she said, while parents must become more involved in their children's education -- both at school and home.
