Many of the kids in Occupy Wall Street are graduating from college with thousands in college debt and no jobs are to be found. Deep into a recession that nearly drove the world economy over the brink in 2008, the eurozone crisis and the recent downgrades of European countries remind us ever to starkly that the dangers of economic collapse remain with us today. Student loan debt now exceeds credit card debt, and our youth are finding it increasingly difficult to enter, and stay in, college. On Wall Street, young students have created a free democratic space in a place they call Liberty Square. It was reported that the Wall Street traders drank champagne in their offices as they looked down on the drenched and straggly demonstrators in Liberty Square.
