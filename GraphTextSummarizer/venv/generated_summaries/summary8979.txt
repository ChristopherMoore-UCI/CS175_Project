The arraignment for Sonia Hermosillo -- once planned for Thursday -- has been pushed back to Monday, said Farrah Emami, a spokeswoman for the Orange County District Attorney's Office. But after the boy died Wednesday, prosecutors upgraded it to one felony count of murder and one felony count of assault on a child with force likely to produce great bodily injury resulting in death. The baby had medical conditions that required regular treatment at the children's hospital, the district attorney's office said, and he wore a helmet for one of his medical conditions. Authorities initially charged Hermosillo, 31, of La Habra, California, with attempted murder.
