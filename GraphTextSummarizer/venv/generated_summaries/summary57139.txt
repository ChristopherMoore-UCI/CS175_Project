"In Port Vila, there's a lot of activity now -- people are starting to emerge," said Tom Perry of the aid group CARE International. Port Vila is more than 1,770 kilometers (1,100 miles) northeast of Brisbane on Australia's east coast, and some 2,200 kilometers (1,367 miles) north of Auckland, the closest city in New Zealand. The Australian government said a first contingent of officials and supplies arrived in Port Vila around noon Sunday and more flights were expected to follow. Aerial assessments are being carried out by military aircraft from New Caledonia, Australia and New Zealand. The evacuation centers are beginning to be set up." Perry, who arrived on one of the first Australian military flights into Port Vila, told CNN the damage there was "very significant" with trees that looked like "snapped toothpicks."
