-- The president of Botswana has invited the internationally recognized president of Ivory Coast, Alassane Ouattara, for an official state visit, the Foreign Affairs Ministry of Botswana announced Wednesday. " But it's not clear when that time may come, since Ouattara is virtually blocked inside the Golf Hotel in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, by troops sent by Laurent Gbagbo, who claimed the presidency after the November 28 runoff. Immediately after the election in Ivory Coast, Botswana joined the African Union, the United Nations, the European Union and the United States in endorsing Ouattara as the winner of the disputed presidential elections. "The government of Botswana is deeply concerned about African leaders who reject elections results that are not in their favour. While an independent electoral commission declared Ouattara the winner, the country's Constitutional Council invalidated the results in some provinces and proclaimed that Gbagbo, the incumbent president, had won.
