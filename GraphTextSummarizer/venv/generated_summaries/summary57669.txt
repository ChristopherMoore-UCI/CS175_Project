From conversations with the renowned neuroscientist Dr. Vilayanur S. Ramachandran and their discussions on the psychology of music to collaborations with the artist Takashi Murakami on a sculpture, Pharrell is a man who revels in cross-platform communication because for him, life is about maximizing existence in every way. That's how I would describe the producer, songwriter, musician Pharrell Williams if I could only use one word. For Williams though, the most important message he could share to his fans is his perspective on humanity --it is one in which we all have something to offer and it is our duty to our self-respect to live life on our terms. Pharrell capitalizes on this shift by turning the consumer generation he influences into fellow entrepreneurs. Justin Timberlake to Jay-Z. Most recently, Robin Thicke probably wasn't a name you would have been familiar with until you heard this year's biggest hit "Blurred Lines" featuring Pharrell.
