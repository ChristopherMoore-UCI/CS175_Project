The protests were staged in Berlin and other cities days after a powerful earthquake damaged nuclear plants in Japan and spurred fears of radiation there. -- Thousands of German demonstrators urged their leaders Monday night to shut down nuclear power plants in their country. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has announced a three-month moratorium on the extension of the operation periods for German nuclear plants. Germany opted out of nuclear energy during the Gerhard Schroeder administration and the country is waiting for the operational periods of its nuclear plants to expire. There were hundreds of people at the Berlin protests and shouts of "turn them off," a reference to German nuclear reactors, rang through the demonstration.
