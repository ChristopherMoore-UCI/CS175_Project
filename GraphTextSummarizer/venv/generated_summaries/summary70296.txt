After hearing about Cooper's horrible death and  that 44 children died last year in hot cars, you might have searched for information about it. And even if Leanna Harris cashes it in, as her husband has been instructing family members to do, it doesn't prove she was involved in Cooper's death either. Thousands of things new parents do might strike the rest of us as strange: they buy fabric inserts for shopping carts because they are germophobes, they boil every bottle, throw out pacifiers that drop on the floor. Her Internet searches about hot car deaths mean nothing. If he did leave Cooper in the car by mistake, he could have realized it in the afternoon and just couldn't face what he had done.
