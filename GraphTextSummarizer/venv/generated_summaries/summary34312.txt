Abortion rates stall after decade-long decline "The decline in abortions coincided with a steep national drop in overall pregnancy and birth rates," Rachel Jones, lead author of the study, said in a statement. As Jones said, several variables affect abortion rates, including the economy, access to contraception and the availability of abortion services. In 2011, abortion clinics represented just 19% of facilities offering abortion services. "As we monitor trends in abortion going forward, it is critical that we also monitor whether these state restrictions are preventing women who need abortion services from accessing them. "(Women) would consider abortion when they might not consider it before." National Right to Life recently released its own report on "The State of Abortion in the United States," which states that more than "3,000 unborn children are still killed every day."
