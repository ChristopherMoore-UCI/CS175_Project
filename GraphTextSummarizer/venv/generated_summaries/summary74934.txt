Clarkson was suspended for allegedly hitting a producer, the BBC reported last week, and "Top Gear" -- a highly popular show with a big global audience -- was not broadcast as scheduled Sunday. Last year, the BBC show hit the headlines when Argentina complained about a "Top Gear" special filmed in the country in which the number plate H982 FKL was used -- interpreted by some as a reference to the 1982 Falklands War. A supporter of suspended "Top Gear" host Jeremy Clarkson delivered a petition with nearly 1 million signatures calling for his reinstatement to the BBC's headquarters in London on Friday -- driving an armored tank up to the building. "I don't know exactly what happened," Cameron told the BBC last week. In a previous article on its website, the BBC said "Jeremy Clarkson is not a man given to considered opinion." Journalist Monica Sarkar contributed to this report.
