" Internationally, Nordic airlines are leading the connectivity charge, with Icelandair and Norwegian both offering Wi-Fi on more than 80% of their flights. "Wi-Fi is one of the most sought-after new amenities fliers want to access on their flights, and there has been significant investment by airlines since our last report," says Routehappy CEO Robert Albert. "Coverage is starting to be meaningful on flights worldwide, along with a wide variety of speeds, coverage availability and pricing models, including free of charge. Aeroflot, Emirates and Japan Airlines are in the 20-30% range, while Qatar Airways, Thai Airways and Turkish Airlines score between 15 and 20%. (The number of flights this represents isn't specified.)
