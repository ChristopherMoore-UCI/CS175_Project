"The Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC) essentially watches the sun, watches for activity on the sun originating from sun spots," explains Bob Rutledge, Forecast Office lead. "Space weather can have a variety of impacts across many different customer bases -- commercial aviation, precision GPS use, power grid operations -- all these are really critical," says Rutledge. The flares and eruptions are collectively known as space weather and although they create dazzling visuals in space, it isn't just a harmless fireworks show for the galaxy. -- From Earth, the sun appears as a constant circle of light, but when viewed in space a brilliant display of motion is revealed. The sun is currently at its "solar maximum" -- the point in its cycle where it is at peak activity -- but the SWPC says that activity is modest compared to recent cycles.
