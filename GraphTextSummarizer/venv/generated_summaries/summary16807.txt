Years ago Nanda helped draft some of India's population stabilization policies and he now runs the Population Foundation of India. The Aroras know a little something about population issues; their daughter was given the official title of India's one billionth citizen when she was born in 2000. On World Population Day this year India's new health and welfare minister came out with an idea on how to tackle the population issue: Bring electricity to every Indian village so that people would watch television until late at night and therefore be too tired to make babies. He lives in India's most populous state Uttar Pradesh and has certainly done his part in contributing to India's burgeoning population. The numbers show 14 of India's 35 states have reached the two child per family target.
