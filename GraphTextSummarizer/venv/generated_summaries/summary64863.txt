One of them is working directly with rebel forces defending one of their last bastions against government forces. We drove another 20 minutes to a small village on the front lines - you could hear the constant shelling as government forces were nearby. The second one is supposed to allow you to photograph military areas -- although in practice it's up to the discretion of the local military commander and usually they're friendly but they'll say 'no.' They put us in different cars, drove us to their headquarters in Donetsk, and forced us to delete all the photos. This accreditation also carries another risk -- if you're in Ukrainian Army-controlled areas and they see that, they'll probably arrest you ... because it's official documentation from the "Donetsk People's Republic."
