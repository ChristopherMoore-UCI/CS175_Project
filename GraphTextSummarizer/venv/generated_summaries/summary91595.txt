He was convicted in 1991 of sexual assault on a child and again in 2003 of third-degree criminal sexual misconduct involving a 31-year-old woman, CNN affiliate WHNS reported, citing police and court records. The Moodys went to their Jonesville home pretending to have car trouble, entered the home and killed the couple, Union County Chief Deputy Perry Haney said at the time. Jeremy Moody, 31, told police he killed the Parkers because Charles Parker was on the South Carolina sex offender registry, Haney said. In bond court, Christine Moody, 37, called Charles Parker a "demon," and she and her husband claimed to be part of a white supremacist group called Crew 41, WHNS reported. "Child molesters do not deserve to live," Jeremy Moody said as he was led out of a Union County courthouse Tuesday wearing handcuffs and striped prison scrubs.
