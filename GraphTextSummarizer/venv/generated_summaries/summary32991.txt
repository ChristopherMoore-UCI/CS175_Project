"There have been enough similar cases over the last few years that -- according to Chinese media reports -- some government officials have now acquired 'Internet phobia,'" observes Goldkorn. During the two-and-a-half hour trial Wednesday in the northern city of Baoding, Li admitted causing the death of Chen Xiaofeng, 20, according to Chinese media reports. "It spread on the Internet -- on blogs, forum websites and the Twitter-like microblog service Weibo," recalls Goldkorn, a long-time observer of China's social networking sites. " Official media have reported that Li was drunk when he ran over two female students on the Hebei University campus, killing Chen and injuring fellow student Zhang Jingjing. In November, according to Chinese media reports, Li Gang reached a civil settlement with the victim's families, agreeing to pay 460,000 yuan (US$67,700) in restitution for the Chen family and 92,000 yuan (US$14,000) to Zhang's family.
