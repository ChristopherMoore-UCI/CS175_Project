-- The body found in a creek near Indianapolis is not missing Indiana University student Lauren Spierer, a medical official said Tuesday. Forensic tests found no link to Spierer and have determined the body belongs to an African-American female, said Alfarena Ballew, chief deputy coroner for Marion County. Bloomington police have been searching for Spierer, a 20-year-old sophomore, since June 2, when she was last seen leaving a sports bar after a night out with friends. In mid-June, police found possible new clues to Spierer's disappearance -- images of a white pickup caught on a security surveillance video. "Perhaps it was a terrible accident that happened and we can deal with that," Charlene Spierer said in late June.
