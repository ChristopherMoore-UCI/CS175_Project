-- Jeremiah Pauley remembers all too vividly the moment that shrapnel from a roadside bomb in Iraq tore into his body and left his right arm dangling uselessly. Having already presented a check for $735,000 in January, Hill hopes this year's fundraising will break through the $1 million mark. "Americans are passionate about assisting these brave individuals." Finding closure Pauley will be playing at Lincoln Hills in California, where he will be pressed into speaking duties before the tournament starts. Private First Class Jody Missildine of Plant City, Florida, just 19 years of age, had died that day, April 8, 2006 and Pauley blamed himself. Competitors pay a standard green fee and $10 donation to Wounded Warriors to play prestigious courses and to get a taste for the game.
