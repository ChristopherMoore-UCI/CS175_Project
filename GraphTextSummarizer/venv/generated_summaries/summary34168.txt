The former partner of French President Francois Hollande made her first public appearance two days after bidding farewell to the Elysee presidential palace, following global headlines about Hollande's alleged affair with an actress. Smiling and dressed in a salmon pink top, Trierweiler addressed reporters during a trip to Mumbai, India, where she is lending her support to an anti-hunger charity. Hollande's private life has been the subject of global headlines since the French magazine Closer claimed this month he'd been having an affair with actress Julie Gayet for two years. An arts columnist for weekly magazine Paris Match, she was not married to Hollande but assumed the role of first lady at official functions following his election in May 2012. "I wish to make it known that I have ended my shared life (partnership) with Valerie Trierweiler," Hollande told the Agence France-Presse news agency.
