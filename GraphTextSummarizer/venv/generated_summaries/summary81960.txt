Drew Peterson, 56, who was found guilty Thursday of the 2004 killing of ex-wife Kathleen Savio. Savio was Peterson's third wife; Stacy, his fourth. " Peterson was married to Savio in 2001 when he had an affair with then-17-year-old Stacy Cales, who eventually became his fourth wife. But before Peterson can be charged again, prosecutors would have to prove that Stacy is dead and then that she was murdered. Schori testified that Stacy told him she woke up in the middle of the night -- the same night that Savio was killed -- and noticed her husband was not in bed.
