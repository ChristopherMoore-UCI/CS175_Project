The flame, which has already made a weeklong journey around Greece after being lit at ancient Olympia, birthplace of the Games, will be carried back to the UK by the British delegation on Friday. Following a display by performers representing the high priestesses of ancient Greece, the torch was accepted by Princess Anne, the British Olympic Association president. The torch relay also will tell the story of a "modern and confident United Kingdom," he said, ahead of Games that he hopes will unite the world in challenging times. -- Greece handed over the Olympic flame to Britain in an elaborate ceremony Thursday, 71 days before the start of the London 2012 Olympic Games. It was attended by soccer player David Beckham and London's recently re-elected mayor, Boris Johnson, as well as five young Britons picked for their commitment to sport.
