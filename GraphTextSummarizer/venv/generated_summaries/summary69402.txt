Tzemi Zimmerman, a ninth-grader from Chicago, Illinois, says he struggles with attention deficit disorder (ADD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It's one of a few Yeshivas nationwide that combines religious teaching with a focus on students with special learning needs. "We wanted to try and help those kids out there that need more attention," Weiss said, sitting in his office after just returning with the students from a twice weekly hockey trip to the local ice rink. "Throughout last year, lots of our parents lost their jobs," Weiss said, adding that they also "lost donations due to the economy, some large." The school aims to help kids who are "stuck in the middle" -- who can't keep up with the pace of regular schools, but haven't completely given up either.
