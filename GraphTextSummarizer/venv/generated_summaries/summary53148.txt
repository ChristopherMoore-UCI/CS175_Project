A federal jury at the New York trial of a Pakistani man allegedly involved in al Qaeda conspiracy to carry out attacks in New York and Europe will be the first presented with evidence seized at the 2011 raid in which Osama bin Laden was killed, a prosecutor said in opening statements Tuesday. According to the indictment and other court filings, al Qaeda leaders in Pakistan in 2008 recruited Zazi, Ahmedzay and another suspect to conduct a suicide bombing attack in New York. He called the charges false and said he went to Pakistan not to meet with al Qaeda operatives but to see his mother after she had bypass surgery. Abid Naseer, 28, who was arrested in 2009 in Manchester, England, where he had been living on a student visa, was described by Brooklyn federal prosecutor Celia Cohen as a "key member" of a broad scheme to "take innocent lives" during a series of failed attacks at a Manchester shopping center, a newsroom in Copenhagen and the subways of New York. Naseer was allegedly named in paperwork found in the walled and fortified compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, where Osama bin Laden, the former leader of al Qaeda, was killed in 2011 by a group of U.S. forces, including Navy SEALs, according to Cohen.
