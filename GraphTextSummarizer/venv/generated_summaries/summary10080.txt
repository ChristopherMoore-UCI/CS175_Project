Gontmakher's Russian lawyer, Vladimir Odyagaylo, said that knowing how things work in Russia, he believes his client could have been set up by unscrupulous competitors who wanted to sideline the successful American. "Gontmakher is suspected of (laundering the profits from selling) crab products in 2006-2007 fished in Russia's exclusive economic zone, without having proper permission," said senior investigator Galina Saigushkina, who is leading the new probe. It was the largest American importer and supplier of Russian crab and other seafood products to the United States and internationally. Gontmakher and his legal team have continuously appealed to Russian authorities about his severe heart condition that needs immediate treatment. Arkadi Gontmakher is the owner of the company that used to be the largest U.S. crab importer from Russia.
