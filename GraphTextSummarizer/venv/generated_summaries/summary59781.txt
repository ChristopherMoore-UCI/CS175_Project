A search warrant dated October 27 shows police were looking for latex gloves used to dismember Zahra and trash bags used to store the remains. Elisa Baker, the stepmother of Zahra Baker, 10, is accused of marrying the girl's father before divorcing her previous husband, a Catawaba County court official said Tuesday. -- The stepmother of a disabled girl whose remains were found after she went missing in North Carolina has been indicted on a bigamy charge. Documents released after Zahra's remains were found tell a grisly story. The stepmother told police the girl was killed two weeks before she was reported missing, according to search warrants.
