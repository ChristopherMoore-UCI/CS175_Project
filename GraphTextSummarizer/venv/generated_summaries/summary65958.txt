But planning for Sunday's scheduled presidential election and legislative elections is moving forward, U.S. Ambassador to Haiti Kenneth Merten told reporters Tuesday from Port-au-Prince. Campaign manager Joseph Flambert called into Haiti's Radio Caraibes to say the convoy retreated after a "hail of bullets." Celestin, a director of Haiti's road construction department, is the endorsed candidate of outgoing Haitian President Rene Preval. A number of observers are in Haiti, including the Joint Electoral Observation Mission, an effort of the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community of Nations. According to a recent report by the International Crisis Group, Haiti has held 13 elections since 1987, the "majority of which have been marred by delays, suspensions, widespread irregularities, fraud, boycotts, unrest and violence. Another 5,000 to 7,000 electoral observers belonging to Haitian civil society groups will be "keeping an eye on things," Merten said.
