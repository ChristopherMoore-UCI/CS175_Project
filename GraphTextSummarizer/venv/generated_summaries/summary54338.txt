Colombian Defense Minister Juan Carlos Pinzon criticized the apparent kidnapping and called for his immediate release. "The information that we have collected indicates that this American citizen came to this area of the country and even at the time the police warned him not to enter certain areas," Pinzon said. New details emerged Monday about a former American soldier that Colombian rebels have said they are holding hostage and plan to release. The rebels described him as an American soldier, saying they would release him as a "gesture" to advance peace talks. The government initiated preliminary peace talks last year.
