The latest controversy comes after a series of child sex abuse scandals involving Catholic Church clergy in Ireland. The leader of Ireland's Catholics, Cardinal Sean Brady, issued a statement Monday admitting that "inappropriate imagery was inadvertently shown by a priest at the beginning of a PowerPoint presentation." -- The Catholic Church in Ireland has launched an investigation into claims that a priest accidentally showed gay pornography pictures during a presentation to parents. Brady's statement said: "The archdiocese immediately sought the advice of the PSNI (Police Service of Northern Ireland) who indicated that, on the basis of the evidence available, no crime had been committed." Parishioners planned a protest outside the local church Sunday, but the demonstration was called off when it emerged that the priest involved in the communion presentation, the Rev. Martin McVeigh, would not be present at Mass.
