"Under the previous night raid directive, Afghans military officials were involved in the coordination and approval of night raids, but Gen. David Petraeus has made clear that his intent is to have night raids conducted with even greater care and preparation throughout the country," the source said, referring to the top coalition military official in Afghanistan. The raids are considered effective tools to rout insurgents, but they have angered Afghan civilians and government officials. Such raids have been considered major intrusions into Afghan lives. The source said all of the measures have been devised "to reduce the possibility of unnecessary violence, create more transparency, and minimize the impact on people who are not involved in insurgent activity." -- Coalition troops in Afghanistan have been issued revised guidelines for conducting night raids, an official from NATO's International Security Assistance Force said Friday.
