Flugence told detectives Wednesday that he killed Ahlittia on Saturday with a knife that investigators found on him when he was arrested, Normand said. Matthew Flugence told investigators that he killed Ahlittia after finding her early Saturday outside the Harvey apartment where her mother and her stepfather -- Flugence's uncle -- lived, Normand said Wednesday. When asked Wednesday whether it was hard to believe that Flugence's relatives didn't know about the sexual assault warrant, Normand said: "No." "A lot of that information came about during the course of this investigation" into Ahlittia's death, he said. They found a pool of blood in one of the buildings, Normand said, and when DNA results came back Monday evening showing the blood belonged to Ahlittia, investigators searched the area again. Ahlittia suffered four stab wounds -- two to her neck, likely the fatal wounds, and two to the abdomen, Jefferson Parish Coroner Gerald Cvitanovich said.
