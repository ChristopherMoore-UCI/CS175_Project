In an interview with CNN en Espa√±ol this week, Zambrano-Montes' mother, Agapita Montes, denounced police treatment of her son. After two officers were hit by rocks -- at least one of them as large as a softball -- police said they shot Zambrano-Montes. The widow and children of Zambrano-Montes have filed a $25 million claim against the city of Pasco alleging that officers killed the unarmed man "execution style." Officers attempted "voice commands and low-level force" and used a Taser, police said, but those efforts didn't work. Police have alleged that Zambrano-Montes was throwing rocks at cars and trucks when he was confronted by officers.
