The main event Saturday night features Bernard Hopkins, 46, who first became a world champion 16 years ago. Bozella's story resonated with Hopkins, who served a five-year stretch in Graterford Prison in Pennsylvania between 1983 and 1988. Dewey Bozella defeated Larry Hopkins by unanimous decision in the four-round match at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. "It inspired me," said Hopkins of Bozella. Dawson, currently ranked by Ring Magazine as the fourth-best light heavyweight in the world, is 29, 17 years younger than the Pennsylvania-born Hopkins.
