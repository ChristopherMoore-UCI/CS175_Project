Diego cut inside Esteban Cambiasso and lashed a low shot through the legs of Inter goalkeeper Francesco Toldo. Inter Milan came from behind to defeat Juventus 2-1 in Thursday's Italian Cup quarterfinal, increasing the pressure on Juve coach Ciro Ferrara. But Lucio levelled after 72 minutes and Mario Balotelli grabbed a last-gasp winner for Inter to secure a two-legged last-four date with Fiorentina next month. Ferrara's side came into the match on the back of five defeats in six Serie A games and lying sixth in the table -- a mammoth 16 points adrift of leaders Inter. But Inter fought back after the break and levelled 18 minutes from time when goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon was left wrong-footed when Wes Sneijder's free-kick took a wicked deflection -- and Lucio nipped in at the far post to prod home the equalizer.
