Once they got started, one memory led to another, and I ended up talking with them for hours and filling notebook after notebook. Longtime friends gave me a series of letters that my mother had written in the happy early years of her marriage, when I was a toddler and my parents took me with them to England and Africa while they did field research. My mother found a diary that her father had written as a missionary in Africa in the 1930s, dreaming of returning to Europe to help battle Hitler. Mine was a story with some superficial details that had always made for good dinner party conversation: My parents were an interracial couple who met in the mid-1950s, when "miscegenation" was still illegal in most states in America. And if you're like me, you will find it enlightening to start seeing your family members not just as forces in your life, but as characters in a drama -- shaped by historical time and geographical place and their own personal angels and demons, like protagonists in a novel.
