She added that such notifications are standard for times like a parade or a marathon when there's a situation with "a large amount of people that could escalate quickly." Savannah Mayor Edna Branch Jackson said that after talking to "the victim's family" and West Savannah residents, she shares "many of (their) questions" about the incident, concerns she has relayed to police officials. For now, I hope the citizens of Savannah will join me in remaining calm and patient as authorities gather the facts." Speaking to people congregating in West Savannah, the mayor said: "This will be cleared up. Dozens of people gathered in a Savannah neighborhood at the shooting scene, which was cordoned off by police tape. Police say a Savannah, Georgia, police officer killed a handcuffed, armed man Thursday as the man tried to break out of a patrol car, a shooting that stirred up citizens and prompted the mayor to acknowledge that the community has "many questions." The incident occurred shortly after 11 a.m. in the historic coastal city, Savannah-Chatham Metropolitan Police Chief Julie Tolbert said. David Jannot, a 10-year veteran of the Savannah-Chatham Metropolitan Police Department, has been placed on paid administrative leave pending the outcome of the investigation, police said in a statement.
