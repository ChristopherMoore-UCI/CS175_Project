Over the past year, Suu Kyi has met repeatedly with Myanmar's President Thein Sein and the country's minister for labor and for social welfare, relief and resettlement, Aung Kyi. Aung San Suu Kyi is the very embodiment of Myanmar's long struggle for democracy. Known as the "lady" in Myanmar, Suu Kyi has been compared to former South African President Nelson Mandela, who spent a chunk of his life in jail for fighting apartheid. In an interview with CNN several years ago, Suu Kyi, in fact, likened Myanmar's plight to South Africa's former brutal race-based system. Over the years, Suu Kyi repeatedly challenged the junta and discouraged foreign investment in Myanmar.
