Hurricanes Iselle and Julio left the state intact this week, but a Democratic primary election washed Gov. Neil Abercrombie from office. Abercrombie defied that request, instead appointing Schatz, who was then the lieutenant governor. President Obama, in a rare move, chose sides in a Democratic primary, supporting Schatz's bid earlier this year. His primary race against Rep. Colleen Hanabusa is too close to call. It's even rarer when an incumbent governor or senator loses a primary election in the state.
