He added that the Syrians who lost residency permits had been "involved in other activities" -- but would not detail what those activities were. Emirati authorities canceled dozens of Syrians' residency permits after a protest against the Syrian government in the United Arab Emirates, sources said. The first source, the one close to the SNC leadership, said UAE authorities gave the Syrians a Wednesday deadline to leave the country. He said protesters are "asking for mercy from UAE authorities, as this won't just affect the men whose residencies were canceled -- but their families as well." But a United Arab Emirates official said the number of Syrians affected was much lower.
