In the photographs, retired FBI agent Bob Levinson stares straight at the camera and holds signs, his hands shackled. U.S. officials believe Levinson, now 64, is being held hostage somewhere in southwest Asia. In 2010, Levinson's captors sent a "proof of life" videotape and photographs of him to his family. " On Tuesday, Levinson's family released the images, showing the former agent in an orange jumpsuit with long, unkempt hair. It's been six years," Christine Levinson, the missing man's wife, told CNN.
