The Australian led the crivers' championship for Red Bull for most of the season only to be pipped at the post by team-mate Sebastian Vettel, who secured the title in the final race at Abu Dhabi. But Webber says it is important for Red Bull that he and Vettel enjoy a harmonious start to the season. " Away from the track, the relationship between Webber and Vettel was a running theme throughout the season as the pressure of the title race set in. Even if we'd had one more race after Abu Dhabi four guys could have still won the championship. " Red Bull were propelled into the limelight as their drivers finished first and second in the title race, while the team romped away with the constructors' championship.
