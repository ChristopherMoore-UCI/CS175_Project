That's when Internet users start ditching online videos if they're not loading properly, according to a new study from the University of Massachusetts Amherst and Akamai Technologies. "The study ... contains no startling surprises -- most of us probably suspected that people give up on watching videos that don't load," Jeff John Roberts writes on the site GigaOm. " Some technology bloggers were surprised people didn't click away from glitchy videos faster. People who are trying to watch videos on a mobile phone are likely to be a bit more patient than those on desktop computers with high-speed connections. The study finds video quality has a potentially longtime impact on a website's popularity.
