Not far away from the bustling scene at Copacabana, city employees in white jumpsuits are making sure the 6.3 million Cariocas -- Rio locals -- are safe. Rio has hundreds of favelas and the city authorities have launched a regeneration project called 'Morar Carioca' that aims to "urbanize" them all by 2020 -- improving the infrastructure in the favelas and integrating them better with the city. A smarter city welcomes the world Brazil's growing economy and the fact that Rio will host the World Cup in 2014 and the Olympic and Paralympic Games in 2016 have reinforced the city's focus on sustainable initiatives. Up to 20% of Rio's inhabitants live in favelas, and many of them are at risk of landslides. It's a blazingly warm day in Rio de Janeiro and people flock to the Copacabana beach for a swim in the sea and a round of volleyball.
