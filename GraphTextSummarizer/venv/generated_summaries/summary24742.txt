A noted tech journalist and early adopter of Google's Glass headset is declaring the technology "doomed," at least for 2014. Glass's part-futuristic, part-dorky look has been mocked in such spots as the blog, White Men Wearing Google Glass.ï»¿ Scoble said he thinks the price will be too high and there won't be enough apps or useful functions to make the wearable tech worth the cost. But Scoble, who got his Glass headset in April on the second day the devices became available to some journalists and early testers, predicts the connected eyewear will flop with consumers when it goes on sale to the general public, presumably this year. While still in limited release, Google Glass has already stirred up some controversy.
