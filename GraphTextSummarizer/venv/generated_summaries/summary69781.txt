Knox was convicted earlier this month of murdering British exchange student Meredith Kercher while the two roomed together in Perugia, Italy, in November 2007. The delegation brought Knox some English-language books as a Christmas gift, which made her "really happy," Polidori told CNN. Knox, 22, seemed very pleased by the visit, which included members of the Italy USA Foundation, said Catia Polidori, a member of the foundation and a member of the Italian Parliament. Knox is also grateful for the foundation's interest in her case, Polidori said. While Knox is aware of the seriousness of her situation, Polidori said, she is "resolute" about proving her innocence.
