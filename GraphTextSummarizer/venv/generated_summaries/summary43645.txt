-- Cyprus, the tiny Mediterranean island bailed out a year ago, remains "in difficulty...but not as bad as one would have expected," its finance minister Harris Georgiades told CNN during an interview in the capital city Nicosia. Cyprus, crippled by losses on Greek debt, set a precedent in the euro crisis by imposing losses on bank depositors. Georgiades said Cyprus -- along with its EU partners -- was supporting a "clear coherent common stance" and was not pushing toward a "new cold war. Cypriot banks were big buyers of Greek bonds during the pre-crisis boom, before the 2004 Athens Olympics and until the bottom fell out of economy in 2008. One of the key challenges during the rebuilding effort is dealing with an estimated $40 billion of non-performing loans which are holding back fresh lending.
