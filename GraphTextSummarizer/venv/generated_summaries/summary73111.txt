But it's also one of the biggest predictors of women (and their husbands) doing more child care, according to a forthcoming paper by Paula England, a New York University sociologist and research fellow at the Council on Contemporary Families, and her collaborator, Anjula Srivastava. Well-educated fathers also spend more time in child care than less-educated dads. Educated parents find more time to spend with their children by reducing time dedicated to home-based activities that involve little interaction with children. Having more education is one of the biggest predictors of women having careers. On the other hand, when a mother works outside the home, her husband generally does more child care and has higher parental knowledge about his childrens' friends, routines and needs, cutting across the tendency for fathers to be second-string parents at home.
