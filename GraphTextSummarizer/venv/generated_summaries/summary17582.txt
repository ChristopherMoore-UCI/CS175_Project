Historically, New York courts have required more than a single act of negligent conduct before upholding a very serious charge like criminally negligent homicide. In most cases in which the charge of criminal negligence or recklessness is upheld by appellate courts, a defendant must exhibit at least two forms of negligent conduct in the commission of the crime. A robbery suspect who ran over a nun while fleeing police in a minivan was convicted of murder in yet another example of reckless homicide while operating a vehicle in New York. Under New York law, criminally negligent homicide can be charged in cases where death is caused by acts of grossly negligent or reckless conduct. Although such charges are difficult to prove in accident cases, this one may prove to be an exception to the rule.
