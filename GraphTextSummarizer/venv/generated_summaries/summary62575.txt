The sheriff's report says Maldonado, 53, then drove about 460 miles north to Tallahassee in an attempt to kill his older son, JosÃ© Maldonado, who attends Florida State University. I never heard anything from the house -- no screaming, no fighting, nothing," neighbor Ana Maldonado, who is not related to the family, told WSVN. The violent, long-distance rampage took Pedro Maldonado Sr. While the Broward County Sheriff's Office continues to piece together a time line, detectives believe Maldonado shot and killed his 47-year-old wife, Monica Narvaez-Maldonado, and their 17-year-old son, Pedro Maldonado Jr., with a crossbow in their Weston townhouse sometime on Monday. "Then his father tried to choke him, and JosÃ© luckily was able to get away." JosÃ© Maldonado never reported the attack to police, but it was his father's confession to a friend on Tuesday that set authorities on his trail.
