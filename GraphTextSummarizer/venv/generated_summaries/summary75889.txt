The Regional Response Plan for Iraqi Refugees includes the plans of 40 international organizations and non-governmental organizations supporting Iraqi refugees in 12 countries, including Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt, Turkey, Iran and the six Gulf states, according to a statement from Antonio Guterres' office. The U.N. high commissioner for refugees announced an inter-agency appeal Wednesday for $280 million to support Iraqi refugees. "I appeal to donor governments to recognize the critical needs of Iraqi refugees, particularly those who are becoming more vulnerable by the day," the high commissioner said in the statement. The U.N. refugee agency said more than 190,000 Iraqi refugees are registered in the region, with the majority living in Syria and Jordan. The high commissioner's office also noted thousands of refugees suffer from critical health conditions.
