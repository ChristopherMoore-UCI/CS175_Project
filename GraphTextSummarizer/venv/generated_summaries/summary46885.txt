My rule of thumb has always been that you want to buy 20 percent below fair market value for homes and 30 percent below fair market value for condos. These are the kinds of houses that sit on the market as wounded ducks because the owners endured job loss, divorce, relocation or any other of a host of troubling scenarios. There are similarly dismal numbers in Las Vegas and Miami (both down more than 40 percent) and San Francisco and San Diego (both down 40 percent). When searching for foreclosures or distressed property in the single-family home market, be on the lookout for several things: an established neighborhood that's 10 years or older; a neighborhood that is mostly owner-occupied; and a house that is structurally sound with cosmetic damage only. But you've got to realize that housing stats are skewed by bubble markets such as these, where people were trying to get rich quick on someone else's money.
