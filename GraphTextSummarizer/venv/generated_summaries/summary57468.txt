-- Actor Jonah Hill told radio host Howard Stern on Tuesday that he lost his cool with a paparazzo and is heartbroken that he used a "disgusting" homophobic slur. The actor, who was nominated for Academy Awards for his roles in the 2011 film "Moneyball" and last year's "The Wolf of Wall Street," told Stern he never meant to insult gay people. CNN sent a request for comment to Hill's publicist but had not heard back late Tuesday. Celebrity gossip site TMZ early Tuesday morning released a video of the incident in which Hill tells a man following him to "Suck my d---, you f-----." "I played into exactly what he wanted and lost my cool and in that moment I said a disgusting word that does not at all reflect how I feel about any group of people," he told Stern.
