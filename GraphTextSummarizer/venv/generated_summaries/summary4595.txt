Several of the reports to the NHTSA involve vehicles not covered by previous recalls, the agency said in a letter to Ford's Environmental and Safety Compliance Global Director on Thursday. All 730,000 are 2001-2004 Ford Escape and Mazda Tribute SUVs with V6 engines, according to the NHTSA. The NHTSA now has identified 730,000 vehicles potentially affected, expanding the scope of vehicles in question. -- After receiving nearly 100 reports of stuck gas pedals in Ford and Mazda vehicles, federal regulators said Tuesday they have launched an investigation into the problem, which is a suspected cause of one death and nine injuries. Ford and Mazda said 591,245 vehicles were potentially affected, according to the automakers' reports to the NHTSA in 2004.
