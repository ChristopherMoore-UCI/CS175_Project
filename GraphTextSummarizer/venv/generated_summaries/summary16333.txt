They constitute the "liudong renkou," or floating population, that moves in and out of China's urban areas every day, taking up odd jobs in construction sites, public infrastructure projects, restaurants and households. That is why, he says, megacities like Beijing and Shanghai are trying to limit population growth, even as small and medium-sized cities are encouraging migrant farmers to shift from being rural to urban hukou residents. "The increase of urban population poses a challenge on the distribution of resources," said Li Jianmin, a professor at Nankai University's Institute of Population and Development. It has yet to officially scrap the hukou system but more cities are now allowing farmers to move in, some temporarily and some permanently. This hukou system has been a source of controversy among experts who advocate its abolition and city planners who worry about mass migration.
