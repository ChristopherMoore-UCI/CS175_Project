But Newark Mayor Cory Booker most definitely did not feel like the Man of Steel on Friday as he recovered from smoke inhalation and second-degree burns suffered during the rescue of his 47-year-old neighbor the previous night. "I'm a neighbor that did what most neighbors would do, which is to jump into action to help a friend," Booker said. Once inside, Booker had what he described as his "proverbial come-to-Jesus moment" as he felt the intensity of the heat and had trouble finding Hodge. But just as he was "praying, thinking, hoping," Hodge called out and Booker found her in a back room. To the family of Zina Hodge, the man who dashed into their burning home and pulled their loved one to safety through intense heat, falling embers and dense smoke could just be Superman.
