The resignation announced Friday by the university's president came the same day that former NBA player Eric Murdock filed a lawsuit against Rutgers, alleging he was fired as the team's director of player development for blowing the whistle on Rice. -- Rutgers University Athletic Director Tim Pernetti has resigned in the wake of a basketball player abuse scandal, saying that he regretted not fighting the school's decision to initially suspend, rather than fire, men's head coach Mike Rice last year. In his resignation letter, Pernetti wrote that his "first instincts" after seeing the video last year, months before ESPN aired it, "was to fire him (Rice) immediately. Assistant coach Jimmy Martelli resigned the same day the school fired Rice. Murdock alleges in the lawsuit he first notified the university about Rice's behavior last summer and in November supplied Rutgers officials with a copy of a video that culled together a number of allegedly abusive incidents involving the head coach.
