We did this not out of fear -- the chance that they would come down your street with guns blazing was minuscule -- but because it was all we could do to help bring to justice the murderers who attacked our city at a moment of civic celebration. In fact, if taken to an extreme, it can cause us to forget some of our rights and freedoms, just as the memory of 9/11's horrors led us to cede freedoms of movement and privacy to which we had been long accustomed. In part it was because of the calm determination of those who took care of the injured at the site, moving them to  medical facilities where professionals cared for them immediately and through long rehabilitations. Boston was strong because Bostonians acted in solidarity. We'll be reminded of those facts by the heightened security at the 2014 Boston Marathon.
