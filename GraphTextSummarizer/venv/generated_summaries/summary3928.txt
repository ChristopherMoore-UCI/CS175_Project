But they believe it was Nowsch who shot Tammy Meyers soon after she'd gotten out of her car outside her Las Vegas home, about a block from his own home. That was the extent of what authorities knew about the back-and-forth between Nowsch and Tammy Meyers until Thursday, according to Las Vegas police Capt. Most of America first saw his face and learned his name Thursday, when Las Vegas police announced the 19-year-old's arrest in connection to what they called a road rage incident February 12 that ended with a mother of four mortally wounded by a gunshot. It's not clear how any of his past led to Nowsch's arrest Thursday, one week after his neighbor Tammy Meyers was shot. It was then that Robert Meyers first told reporters that Nowsch and his wife had known each other for some time.
