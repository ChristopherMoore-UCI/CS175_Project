-- In his September 4 op-ed, Jack Schlossberg presents his case that young Americans should cast their ballots for President Obama this fall. Or that Obama presided over the first credit downgrade in American history. In 2008, Obama regaled us with promises of hope and change, but his time in office has exposed the emptiness of these promises. Rather, they are the residue of generational theft, of promises unmet, of false hopes and of crushed dreams. He compares Caulfield's desire to escape phonies to young people's support for Barack Obama in his first presidential campaign.
