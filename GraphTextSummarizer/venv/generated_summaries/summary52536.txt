Kasem's children hope family will put aside dispute in his last moments Kasem "won't be with us much longer," Danny Deraney, the representative for daughter Kerri Kasem, said Friday. " Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Daniel Murphy will reconsider at a hearing Friday who should make medical decisions for Kasem: his daughter, wife or a neutral party. Martin attacked Jean Kasem for ignoring court orders and removing her husband from a Los Angeles nursing home "where he had no bedsores, where he had no infections, and took him on a road trip, over a thousand miles, to a place that wasn't his home, and didn't give him proper medical care. Monday's hearing was the latest in a series of court battles over control of health decisions for Kasem, 82. The decision came during a hearing in which a lawyer for the iconic radio host's wife accused Kasem's daughter of denying food, water and medication to her father to hasten his death.
