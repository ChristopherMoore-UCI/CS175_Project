Gary Player Design, Greg Norman Golf Course Design and Nicklaus Design join Hawtree Ltd., Hanse Golf Design, Renaissance Golf, Robert Trent Jones II and Thomson-Perret Golf Course Architects in the competition to design the course that will be built in the Barra da Tijuca area of Rio, the part of the city that will host the largest number of Olympic venues. "I think the Olympics is the greatest thing that could happen to golf on an international basis," the American said in 2010, because it means governments will support the game by building courses that young people have access to, and some of those young people will turn to golf in search of glory. When making a pitch to Olympic organizers to include golf for 2016, a younger LPGA star, Hawaii's Michelle Wie, emphasized what it could mean to kids. "This facility can, and should be, a catalyst for golf in Brazil long after the Olympic competition is complete." Whichever group wins the Olympic bid, Norman says, they won't be doing it to make money. "Whoever gets the golf course design job, they have to be the spokesperson for golf in the Olympics, because golf is only in for 2016.
