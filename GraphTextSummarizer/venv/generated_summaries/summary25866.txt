I am proud to say that this program not only introduces adaptive sailing to people living with disabilities, but also goes far beyond and has led to opportunities for further education and employment for many individuals. Then I was introduced to a program called "Challenged America," which is designed to teach people with disabilities of all kinds how to sail. Many people don't realize the daily, if not hourly requirements that people with diabetes face. The sea is a demanding environment, so people always ask, "How are you able to sail if you can't see?" The answer: I have an acute "spacial" awareness and directional ability, and I use the wind's varying pressure and patterns of waves to determine the direction I'm headed. Having logged thousands of coastal and offshore sailing miles in my youth, I've been able to add to my experience by sailing and racing on the West Coast with "Challenged America."
