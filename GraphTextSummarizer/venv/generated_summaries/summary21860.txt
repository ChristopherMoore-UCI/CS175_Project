"For that reason, I ask that the league clarify its position by issuing a public statement that any form of discrimination or harassment on the basis of sexual orientation by league teams or their employees or agents against potential recruits or players constitutes a violation of state, local and, in some cases, contractual law, and will not be tolerated. "Any team or employee that inquires about impermissible subjects or makes an employment decision based on such factors is subject to league discipline," NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said at the time. -- New York's attorney general wrote NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell on Thursday, urging him to firmly state that potential players won't be discriminated against because of their sexual orientation. League policy states that teams "neither consider nor inquire about sexual orientation in the hiring process," Aiello said then. The combine is a skills audition for NFL general managers and coaches to evaluate players before the draft, which this year will be held April 25 to 27.
