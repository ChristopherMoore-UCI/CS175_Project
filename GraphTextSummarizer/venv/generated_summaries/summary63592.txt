Watch an FBI agent talk about why clues were missed Â» Interviews with public officials show that parole officers, law enforcement officials and firefighters visited the Garrido household but left without realizing that the kidnapped girl had grown to adulthood and was living in a soundproof shed hidden in the backyard. As recently as June, two months before Dugard was discovered with the Garridos, Contra Costa County firefighters responded to a fire on the property. Garrido's most recent parole agent visited the home at least twice a month since December, according to California corrections officials. Parole officers also checked on Garrido frequently before 2008, Hinkle said, but he did not know how often or how many parole officers visited Garrido's residence. There were at least 16 visits from parole officers and seven by the fire department.
