"The King's Speech" won the best picture, best actor, best director and best original screenplay Oscars at Hollywood's Kodak Theatre Sunday night. The saga of how a college student created Facebook, which is now credited with helping citizens overthrow their leader in the Mideast, lost out on the big awards, but "The Social Network" did win Oscars for best musical score, film editing and best adapted screenplay. Two awards went to "Toy Story 3" for animated feature film and best original song. "King's Speech" writer David Seidler pointed out that at 73, he was the oldest person to ever win best original screenplay. "Alice in Wonderland," which was not among the 10 best picture nominees, was rewarded Sunday night with two Oscars, for costume design and art direction.
