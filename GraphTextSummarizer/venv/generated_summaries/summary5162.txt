" There's little chance of Germany letting up against Argentina when the tournament's top two go head-to-head. In 1978, Argentina, which hosted the tournament, defeated the Netherlands 3-1 after extra time in the final in Buenos Aires to spark spectacular scenes of celebration. Having topped Group F, Argentina progressed to face Switzerland which was defeated by a goal just two minutes before the end of extra-time. Not since 1986 has Argentina triumphed in the World Cup, but that wait could be over should Lionel Messi and co. see off the Germans. After defeating the Netherlands on penalties, Argentina is targeting its a third World Cup win after reaching its fifth final.
