What went terribly wrong is that white supremacist James von Brunn allegedly walked into the museum and started firing his rifle, shooting security officer Stephen Johns in the chest. Despite their initial shock, Weeks and McCuiston kept their composure enough to draw their weapons and start shooting at von Brunn, 88. -- When shots rang out at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum last week, security officers Harry Weeks and Jason McCuiston were stunned. Harry Weeks, left, and Jason McCuiston fired on James von Brunn at the Holocaust Memorial Museum. McCuiston and Weeks, however, deflected suggestions that they may be heroes as well because if they had not stopped von Brunn, there's no telling how many of the more than 2,000 people visiting the museum at the time could have been injured or killed.
