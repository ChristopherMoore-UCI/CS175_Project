A 9-year-old girl was laid to rest Wednesday as a 15-year-old girl, described as an acquaintance, was in court on charges she carried out the younger girl's murder Elizabeth Olten was coming home from a friend's house last week in St. Martins, Missouri, when she disappeared. It didn't lead them to a stranger, a child predator or a convicted sex offender -- avenues police had originally considered because of Olten's age Instead, it led them to a 15-year-old girl who, according to Peggy Florence, a family spokeswoman, had played with Olten. "She wanted to be a mother, she wanted to love others and take care of others," family spokeswoman Florence told HLN's Nancy Grace. On Wednesday, Olten's family looked towards closure as two drastically different scenes unfolded in Missouri. The Olten family spent the day of Elizabeth's funeral remembering a very special little girl and mourning their loss, choosing to celebrate her life, instead of attending the court hearing of the teen accused of killing her.
