In a new book Guant치namo Diary, Slahi paints a horrifying picture of life at the hands of interrogators in the notorious U.S. military prison in Cuba. Is it good to say yes or to say no?" Responding to Slahi's allegations of torture, Caggins, the Pentagon spokesman, pointed to a number of investigations into Guant치namo detainee treatment. In his early years at Guant치namo, Slahi was exposed to a number of special interrogation techniques that were personally signed off by then Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, according to reports by the Armed Services Committee and the Department of Justice. The U.S. military continues to hold Slahi as an enemy combatant under the Authorization for the Use of Military Force of 2001 informed by the laws of war, according to Department of Defense spokesman Lt. Col. Myles Caggins. When U.S. President Barack Obama took office in 2008 he promised to close Guant치namo, but as he enters his seventh year in the White House 122 prisoners remain.
