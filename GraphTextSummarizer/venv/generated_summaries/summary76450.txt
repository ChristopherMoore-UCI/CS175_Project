Kuwait's Serbian coach Goran Tufegdzic was unhappy that Australian referee Benjamin Williams did not award his team a penalty in the opening 20 minutes when China skipper Du Wei brought down Bader Al Mutawa. Defender Zhang Linpeng put China ahead in the 58th minute when his shot took a big deflection to leave goalkeeper Nawaf Al Khaldi stranded, with Kuwait having failed to properly clear a corner. Hosts Qatar shocked in Asian Cup opener Kuwait had to play for almost an hour with only 10 men at Al Gharafa Stadium after defender Musaed Neda was sent off in the 35th minute for kicking out at Yang Xu following a tussle for the ball. "I think the relevant commission will have to look at the match and give a punishment for this referee." China next play Qatar on Wednesday, when Kuwait face Uzbekistan.
