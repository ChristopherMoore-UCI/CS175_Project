But Alonso still wants a cycling team and might start one up from "scratch." Formula One's highest-paid driver reached an initial agreement to buy Euskaltel Euskadi, Alonso's website stated early this month, but negotiations since broke down. "The negotiations between Euskaltel and the representatives of Fernando Alonso for the acquisition of the cycling team Euskaltel Euskadi on behalf of the Asturian driver, which began with an agreement in principle on August 31, have ended without an agreement," the team said in a statement posted on its website. -- Fernando Alonso won't be saving Euskaltel Euskadi after all. "For Euskaltel it is sad news that after the hope generated by the agreement in principle a definitive agreement has not been formalized to guarantee a professional future for the members of the team and to reward the fans that have been loyal until the last moment. "We've tried it until the end but it's just been impossible to have a cycling team in 2014," said Alonso.
