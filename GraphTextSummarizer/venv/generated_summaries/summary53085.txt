The election of a new governor in Okinawa looks set to complicate controversial plans to relocate an unpopular U.S. air base on the Japanese island. The U.S. and Japanese governments want to move the Marine base to a more sparsely populated area in Nago City and to build runways out into the sea for the new facility. The defeat of Nakaima, who had the support of Japan's governing Liberal Democratic Party, creates a headache for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. A number of rape cases involving U.S. military personnel over the years have intensified the anger. Before Nakaima's approval last year, the relocation had been held up by local opposition since 1996, when Washington and Tokyo agreed on the original plan to move the base.
