The family calls it "Aimee's Wing." "What blows me away is that the construction should be complete in roughly 40 days, hopefully in time for Aimee's 'graduation' from rehab," dad Andy Copeland said in his blog Tuesday. -- When Aimee Copeland, a 24-year-old Georgia woman who lost parts of four limbs to a flesh-eating bacteria, returns home from rehab next month, she'll find it much different and much bigger than when she left in May. "Her face was red and the vein in her neck was bulging as she pressed herself into her repetitions with serious determination," Copeland said of Aimee's Tuesday workout. Andy Copeland says his daughter is "knocking it out in rehab," committed to her exercise regime like an Olympic athlete. Aimee Copeland was released from the hospital to a rehab facility on July 2 after nearly two months of treatment and surgeries.
