" Bayern lost 3-1 to Schalke last week in the Liga Total Cup friendly event, as coach Louis Van Gaal fielded several reserve players. Bayern angry as Dutch star Robben is ruled out Schalke coach Felix Magath fielded his marquee signing, former Real Madrid striker Raul. Mueller slotted into the empty net when veteran striker Klose put the ball past onrushing goalkeeper Manuel Neuer. But the Dutchman included six World Cup stars -- minus the injured Arjen Robben -- in a traditional pre-season fixture between league and cup winners which has been reinstated on the calendar after a 14-year absence. "A dream has come true for me, and not just in the course of last season," Mueller, who was joint top scorer in South Africa and also named best young player, told the Bayern website.
