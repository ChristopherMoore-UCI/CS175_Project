The match was cleared to go ahead despite the snow that has blanketed the north of Britain in the past few days, with Newcastle's suspension-depleted line-up boosted by the presence of veteran former England defender Sol Campbell for the first time in the league since joining the promoted club in pre-season. The Londoners were deposed at the summit after Manchester United's 7-1 thrashing of Blackburn on Saturday, but could have returned on goal difference with victory away to mid-table Newcastle. Liverpool remained on 19 points in 10th place, behind Newcastle on goal difference. The home team -- beaten 5-1 by Bolton last weekend -- took the lead in the sixth minute when recent England debutant Carroll took advantage of a mistake by Brazil defender Alex to score his ninth league goal this season. Ancelotti said Chelsea hope to welcome back England internationals John Terry and Frank Lampard from injuries ahead of next weekend's clash with Everton, while Ghana midfielder Michael Essien returns from suspension.
