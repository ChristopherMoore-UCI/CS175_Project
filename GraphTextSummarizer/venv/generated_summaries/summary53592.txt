Each year, thousands of paper lanterns are released into the night sky to symbolically ward off bad luck, while rivers are covered by floating flower lanterns, adorned with candles and joss sticks, cast into waterways to wish for good luck. It seems that despite threats of fines and prosecution, Chiang Mai residents and visitors alike chose to respect the ancient traditions rather than modern laws. With flower and flame, the city of Chiang Mai in particular comes alive during these festive days each November. "The real meaning of the festival is to worship Buddha and the goddess of the river," says Sarah Wahtong a native of Chiang Mai. During this year's festival, like years gone by, dozens of flights from the local airport had to be diverted or canceled the moment thousands of lanterns took to the air.
