She is expected to remain at New York Presbyterian Hospital for the next 48 hours so doctors can monitor her condition and treat her with anti-coagulants, said Philippe Reines, deputy assistant secretary of state. Clinton spent the holidays with her family last week after working from home. "Her doctors will continue to assess her condition, including other issues associated with her concussion," Reines said. The medical setback comes as Clinton is wrapping up her busy tenure as secretary of state, during which she has logged more than 400 travel days and nearly a million miles. Deputies Thomas Nides and Bill Burns appeared in her place.
