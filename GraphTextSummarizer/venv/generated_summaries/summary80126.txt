An image of Winters and the others bent over Cirillo was captured by photographer Wayne Cuddington. Several people worked together in an attempt to save Cirillo's life, including a nurse and another corporal, Winters told interviewer Carol Off. " Moments later the beauty would dissolve into scenes of panic, chaos and mourning as shots were fired and one of those guards, Cirillo, was hit. It is believed Bibeau shot Cirillo and drove a short distance to the Parliament building, where he opened fire again. Winters said she was already walking toward Spark Street when she heard the shots and found herself moving toward the sounds as other people ran away.
