Mueller's remarks at a House Judiciary Committee hearing led an effort by Obama administration officials and some in Congress to push back against a firestorm of criticism about domestic surveillance in the aftermath of classified leaks last week that disclosed details of covert surveillance programs. FBI chief: Programs in adherence with Constitution One of the programs, under Section 215 of the Patriot Act, collects billions of phone records to create a database for use in tracking suspected terrorists. Claiming Section 215 of the Patriot Act "is being used to engage in a nationwide dragnet of telecommunications records" and that the government is relying too much to cover up what it's doing through classified programs, Conyers said he is co-sponsoring legislation that would address "the overbreadth and impenetrability of the surveillance programs. The White House spokesman also reiterated Obama's support for programs he says have "helped thwart dozens of attacks." However, other legislators of both parties joined Mueller in defending the programs that were disclosed through leaks of classified information.
