The explosion took place after months of demonstrations targeting Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh, as well as a weekend of clashes between government forces and al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. The country has been wracked by a Shiite Muslim uprising, a U.S.-aided crackdown on al Qaeda operatives, and a looming shortage of water. The provincial governor on Tuesday blamed al Qaeda for the explosion, the nation's official news agency, Saba, reported. Protests were taking place Tuesday in 11 locations throughout the country, with the largest crowds estimated in Taiz province, followed by the capital, Sanaa, witnesses said. The president has said he accepts opposition demands for constitutional reforms and holding parliamentary elections by the end of the year.
