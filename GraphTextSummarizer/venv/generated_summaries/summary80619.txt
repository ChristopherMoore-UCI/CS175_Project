Although the 20-year-old victim's cell phone was never found, investigators were able to review call and text messages made by Watson and Steven Pieper, the man she was breaking up with, Onondaga County District William Fitzpatrick told CNN. Police looked at Pieper's phone, which was left November 19, 2010, at Watson's home in the Syracuse suburb of Liverpool, and pored over records, Fitzpatrick said. After dumping Watson's body, Pieper, 21, tried to cover up by texting a mutual friend of theirs, pretending to be Watson, Fitzpatrick said. Pieper pleaded guilty in Onondaga County Court to second-degree murder in the strangling of Watson. "Steven made it clear that he did not want to put the Watson family or his family through a trial in this matter, from the very beginning," defense attorney Scott Brenneck told CNN affiliate YNN.
