You're likely not the kind of addict that Moore has seen -- women who don't bathe and abuse drugs to help them stay "up" for more online time. "I started following coupon sites and became so engrossed in finding deals that I neglected the important things, like time with my son, for a while." After the Internet, real life can seem, well, unproductive. I'd heard about Internet addiction before, but always assumed it was something limited to socially challenged guys who played too much World of Warcraft. Coleen Moore, coordinator of resource development at the Illinois Institute for Addiction Recovery in Peoria, says that she's seeing more and more women coming in for Internet addiction. There's a movement among psychiatrists to recognize Internet addiction as an official mental disorder (just like alcohol dependency).
