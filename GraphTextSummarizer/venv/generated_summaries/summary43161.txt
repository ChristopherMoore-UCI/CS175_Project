Hanging out of an open-door helicopter flying high above San Francisco Bay, is all part of a day's work for sports photographer Ezra Shaw, who took these remarkable images of the America's Cup. So to be able to work those two elements into the picture gave me a chance to get a variety of different images that wouldn't have been possible in other America's Cups," said Shaw.
