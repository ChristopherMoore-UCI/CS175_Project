Bill Cosby: Guns, not race, key issue in Martin case Recksiedler is assigned to the Zimmerman case. Meanwhile, news media organizations, including CNN, petitioned Recksiedler Monday to reverse an order sealing court records in Zimmerman's prosecution. But on Friday, she said she would entertain motions to disqualify her from the trial because her husband is a law partner of Mark NeJame, an attorney whom Zimmerman approached about representing him and has since widely commented on the case in the media. O'Mara's office filed paperwork Monday asking that Recksiedler not preside over second-degree murder proceedings involving Zimmerman and the motion to "disqualify" the trial judge "will be ruled on in the appropriate manner," a court official said. Prosecutors did not object when Zimmerman's attorneys asked Recksiedler to seal records last week.
