Family scion Rahul Gandhi, son of Sonia Gandhi -- the Italian-born head of the Congress party -- had earlier this year suggested a constitutional designation for the Lokpal to protect it from being dismantled by ordinary laws in the future. -- India's beleaguered government huddled with various political parties Wednesday, trying to come up with a way forward on an anti-corruption bill as ailing, elderly campaigner Anna Hazare continued his fast for a second day to protest legislation he slammed as too weak to deal with endemic graft. "Lokpal bill passes, statute change fails," said a bold header on the Asian Age daily.

On Tuesday, the national assembly's lower chamber, the Lok Sabha, cleared the bill, aimed at creating a citizen ombudsman called the Lokpal.
