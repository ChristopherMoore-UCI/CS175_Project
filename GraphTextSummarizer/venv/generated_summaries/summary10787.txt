Opposition activists said Syrian government forces shelled Qubeir for an hour before militias on foot turned AK-47 rifles on people, some at close range, or slashed them with knives. At least 78 people, including 35 from one family, were killed by Syrian regime forces in Qubeir, said the opposition network Local Coordination Committees of Syria. "The opposition is unable to organize effectively in Syria due in part to the detention, torture and murder of countless opposition activists. On Thursday, the regime put Qubeir's suffering on terrorists and said the massacre was intended "to be used to pressure Syria," state media reported. The international rights group Avaaz sent out a report card Thursday on Syria's failing truce.
