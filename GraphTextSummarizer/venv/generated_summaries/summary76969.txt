And yes, the majority of pedophiles are men, but as much as 40% of sexual abuse is perpetrated by women. Grown men are talking openly about abuse they experienced as boys. For many reasons, experts say, men face different feelings of shame and guilt than women experience when reporting childhood sexual abuse. Jerry Sandusky, 67, a former Penn State assistant coach, faces 40 criminal charges in the alleged rape and sexual abuse of eight boys over a 15-year period. Abuse experts say that men under-report these childhood incidents when they are called "abuse," but when they are asked about "unwanted sexual experiences," the numbers may be higher than one in six.
