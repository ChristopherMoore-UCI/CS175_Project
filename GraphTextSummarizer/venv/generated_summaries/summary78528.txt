Video from Fort Bend County showed wind damage, including debris from building roofs and broken glass, and people trapped by the storm described terrifying moments. The Houston/Galveston weather forecast office will examine the area and two other reported areas on Tuesday to confirm reported strikes, said Timothy Oram, an emergency response meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Fort Worth. "We have a lot of roadways closed, and some evacuations are going on," said Alan Spears of the Fort Bend County office of emergency management. As much as 6.3 inches of rain had fallen in the past day, nearly all of it during the previous 12 hours, Oram said late Monday afternoon. Though flash flood warnings were still in effect for Chambers County and Galveston County, the worst was over, he said.
