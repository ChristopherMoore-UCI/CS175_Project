Monday's gold medal win in the Alpine Combined, to go with a silver in the Super-G and gold in the Downhill at this year's Alpine World Ski Championships, means Maze is on the verge of making history. The American last week won her first medal at a World Championships in four years with bronze in the Super-G, but Thursday's Giant Slalom now looks to be her only chance of claiming gold at Beaver Creek, having also finished fifth in the Downhill. Maze will also be readying herself for the Giant Slalom event, knowing that if she can replicate Monday's form there, as well as in Saturday's Slalom, then her place in the record books will be assured. The Slovenian's latest triumph at Beaver Creek saw her prevail by 0.22 seconds in an event that combines the downhill and slalom runs, with Austrian duo Nicole Hosp and Michaela Kirchgasser taking silver and bronze respectively. Should success in the Giant Slalom and Slalom follow then the 31-year-old will become the first woman to ever win five individual medals at a single World Championships, with Lasse Kjus of Norway in 1999 the only man to have achieved the feat.
