India and Pakistan have fought three wars over Kashmir and militants, who India says are backed by Pakistan, have been fighting since the late 1980s to end Indian rule in the region. Pakistani border troops fired for about 90 minutes in Poonch district of the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir, said Biplab Nath, an Indian army spokesman. Such ceasefire violations have been common since 2003, but Nath described the latest incident firing as "major." Kashmir has been a source of bitter dispute between India and Pakistan since the independence of both nations in 1947. The Indian army accused Pakistani troops of violating a cease-fire agreement early Thursday by firing across the Line of Control that divides Kashmir. Under terms agreed by the two countries, Kashmir's rulers could either opt to merge with India or Pakistan or remain independent.
