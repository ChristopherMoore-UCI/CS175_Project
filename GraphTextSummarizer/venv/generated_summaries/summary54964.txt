"Sometimes you do race alone so the U.S. GP wasn't strange for that," said Barrichello with the pragmatism of a racer who has taken part in more grands prix than any other driver in F1 history. After a three-year absence, the U.S. GP is back at a new circuit build outside Austin after an on-off agreement was finally settled and race fees were paid to Ecclestone's company. A weekend of petty squabbling and farcical racing undoubtedly left U.S. fans with a bitter taste in their mouths. Three years earlier he had taken his only U.S. GP victory by just 0.011 seconds -- the second closest finish in F1 history. It was the result of a bizarre sequence of events which left motorsport fans feeling so shortchanged it nearly drove F1 out of the U.S. for good.
