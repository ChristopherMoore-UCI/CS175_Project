-- Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe said Friday he is already enjoying the new Harry Potter attraction at Universal's Islands of Adventure theme park in Florida -- and he's already ridden the thrilling dragon roller coaster five times. " Another ride, called Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey, features Radcliffe and other stars from the cast and simulates parts of the movie, he said. The park is perfect for any fans who want to live parts of the fantastical world of Harry Potter, he said. When I was first told it was going to be a Harry Potter theme park, I was kind of thinking, well, that can go one of two ways. The Harry Potter books have been credited with getting children to start reading again.
