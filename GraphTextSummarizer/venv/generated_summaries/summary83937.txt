-- A vial purportedly containing dried blood from former President Ronald Reagan after a 1981 assassination attempt will not be auctioned online, but donated to Reagan's presidential foundation, officials said Thursday. "Dried blood residue from President Reagan ... can be seen clearly in the vial with a quarter-inch ring of blood residue at the end of the inserted rubber stopper," the listing says. "While we contend that the removal of the vial from the hospital laboratory and the U.S. auction sale in February were not legal acts in our opinion, we are grateful to the current custodian of the vial for this generous donation to the foundation ensuring President Reagan's blood remains out of public hands," Heubusch, the foundation's executive director, said Thursday. The lab was contracted with George Washington University Hospital to handle blood testing, and did Reagan's blood work and testing. The publicity generated by the sale on PFC Auctions "has clearly highlighted the importance of this historical artifact and I would personally be delighted to see this important artifact put on public display by the foundation," the recent seller said.
