"This is not about whether it is right or wrong to eat dog meat," Dalley says. "The sheer number of dogs required means this method is no longer sustainable and rustlers will travel across most of Thailand in search of dogs," says Dalley. Gathering dogs for market was once simply a matter of exchanging plastic buckets for the many soi dogs that live around Thai towns and villages. "We know that St Bernard's are highly prized in southern China, but you can see all types of pedigree animals in these captured Thai shipments -- poodles, shih tzus, you name it," says Dalley. Traditionally the time of peak demand for dog meat in Vietnam, the dog smugglers of the Mekong work deep into the night shipping thousands of animals -- sometimes dozens to a cage -- across the river border with Laos to be trucked on to the dinner tables of the nouveau riche in Hanoi.
