-- With four home-based major champions in the Irish Open field, Indian golfer Jeev Milkha Singh stole the show in Thursday's opening round with a dazzling round of 63. The 39-year-old's eight-under-par effort was six shots better than British Open winner Darren Clarke, seven ahead of U.S. Open victor Rory McIlroy and nine clear of the young Northern Irishman's 2010 predecessor Graeme McDowell. In a tie for seventh place on 69 were Caroline Hedwall, Momoko Ueda, Na Yeong Choi, Amy Hung, Song-Hee Kim, Lorie Kane, Paula Creamer and Mika Miyazato. The 29-year-old fired seven birdies at Carnoustie to be two shots clear of American Brittany Lincicome and three ahead of her compatriot Amy Yang, Germany's Caroline Masson, Sweden's former champion Sophie Gustafson and U.S. player Angela Stanford. I hit a lot of good shots and had lots of chances, but didn't quite have the speed of the greens," he said after his four-birdie 69.
