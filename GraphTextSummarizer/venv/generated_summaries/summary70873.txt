Azarenka out of Dubai Open "I'm really glad how I played today - it was a great match," Kvitova told the WTA official website. -- Petra Kvitova produced another scintillating showing to book her place in the final of the Dubai Open Friday. Tursunov saw off Gilles Muller of Luxembourg 7-6 1-6 7-5, while Czech star Berdych overcame Poland's Jerzy Janowicz 6-3 6-7 6-3. But Kvitova believes she has every chance of springing a surprise Saturday. The World No.8 defeated Caroline Wozniacki 6-3 6-4 to set up a clash for the title against Italy's Sara Errani.
