According to the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, violence between supporters of the political parties and other turf wars in Karachi have killed more than 1,000 people this year alone. -- A former federal lawmaker is among at least 33 people killed in a fresh spate of violence over the past 24 hours in the Pakistani city of Karachi, police officials said Thursday. Officials say the killings appear to be linked to ongoing rivalries between three political parties vying for power in Pakistan largest city: the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM), the Awami National Party (ANP), and the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP). The PPP, led by President Asif Ali Zardari, views Karachi as a crucial political battleground, but politics in Pakistan's economic hub are dominated by the MQM, which represents "muhajirs," descendants of immigrants from India decades ago. Several gunmen opened fire on Wajid Karimdad on Wednesday night shortly after he entered a restaurant for Iftar, the traditional post-fasting meal during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, said Karachi police official Naeem Shah.
