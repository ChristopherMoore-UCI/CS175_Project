Ashik Ali, Ifran Khalid and Ifran Naseer, all from Birmingham, England, were convicted at Woolwich Crown Court on 12 counts of committing acts in preparation for a terrorist attack. The judge told them all to expect life sentences with substantial minimum terms, the police statement said. While their precise targets remained unclear, "the potential for damage and loss of life from their plot should not be underestimated," Jones added. "Had they not been stopped, the consequences would have been catastrophic," said Karen Jones, a specialist counter-terrorism prosecutor for the Crown Prosecution Service.
