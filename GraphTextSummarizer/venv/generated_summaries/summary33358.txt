Men, women and children filed into FPI's Jakarta headquarters, walking past posters of Osama bin Laden and U.S. President Barack Obama, his face crossed out in red. They're more known for thuggish attacks on groups deemed un-Islamic or immoral and minority religious groups, according to human rights groups. In a statement read by its Secretary General Sobri Lobis, FPI expressed doubt about the death of bin Laden, saying the news from "infidel America" should be scrutinized. "Osama bin Laden is a true Islamic warrior figure who defended Islam," FPI said. They sang Islamic songs before chanting prayers for bin Laden.
