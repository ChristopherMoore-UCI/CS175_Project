Carlos isn't running for time. "Dr. Babu initially said he thought he'd be on ECMO for a week," Voglewede recalled. Babu had one shot: a procedure called extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or ECMO. But without oxygen, Carlos' organs would soon shut down. "We walked into the triage, and his oxygen level was only 57%, and everybody turned a corner," Carlos' wife, Brenda Voglewede, told CNN.
