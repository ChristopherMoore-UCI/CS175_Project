Opposition sources cited witnesses in Homs as saying thousands of people had gathered around a mosque. Troops used gunfire amid protests in the Damascus suburb of Douma, according to witnesses and opposition sources, and one witness saw at least six dead demonstrators taken into a hospital morgue. Security forces used tear gas in several locations to try to disperse demonstrators, witnesses said. Witnesses said a mosque in Kafr Sousa, another Damascus suburb, had been surrounded by security forces who had fired rubber bullets, and Maleh said he was told about the unrest there. One witness said security forces attacked thousands of protesters at the "big mosque" in the center of Douma with electric batons, tear gas and live ammunition.
