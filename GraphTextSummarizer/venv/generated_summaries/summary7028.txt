Nebraska State Patrol spokesman Mike Meyer said officers apprehended Christopher Marshall, Jerry Sargent and Bobby Cockerell in Alliance, Nebraska, after a nearly 60-mile chase with speeds reaching up to 100 mph. New arrest warrants charge them with possessing stolen firearms as well as felony possession of firearms, said George Huffman, spokesman for the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. According to Meyer, law enforcement officers tried twice to spike the tires of the minivan the men were traveling in. The three escapees, (from left) Jerry Sargent, Christopher Marshall and Bobby Cockerell, were captured in Nebraska. Two were caught, but the third tried to carjack a vehicle at gunpoint before being arrested by an Alliance Police officer, according to Meyer.
