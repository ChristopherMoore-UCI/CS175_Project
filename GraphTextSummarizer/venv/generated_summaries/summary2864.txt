As Costa Rica began to tire, it was Greece which took control and Mitroglou was denied a dramatic late winner by Navas when the striker looked certain to score. Costa Rica's players, who had already suffered the ignominy of having victory snatched away from them, appeared to be running through treacle as they dragged their tired limbs down the field, stretching every muscle and sinew. It was Greece that produced the only real opportunity eight minutes before the interval when Dimitris Salpingidis forced Navas into a fine reflex save from close range. And hold out it did -- Costa Rica's tenacious approach kept goalkeeper Navas almost unemployed as the clock began to tick down. "Think big" is the motto that Costa Rica coach Jorge Luis Pinto has always subscribed to.
