-- Gunfire struck nine people on Bourbon Street in New Orleans early Sunday, police spokesman Frank Robertson said. Additional information on the victims has not been released so far, but Serpas said some of them were not from New Orleans. The 700 block, where the shooting occurred, is a popular gathering place for tourists and revelers, where many of them pack bars and clubs between St. Peter and St. Ann Streets. The scene is around the corner from other famed attractions, such as jazz concert venue Preservation Hall and the popular bar Pat O'Brien's. Superintendent of the New Orleans Police Department Ronal Serpas said Sunday that the shooting may have occurred due to a heated exchange between two young men.
