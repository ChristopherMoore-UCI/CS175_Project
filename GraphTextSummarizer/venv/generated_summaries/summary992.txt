-- Spain on Sunday marks the eighth anniversary of the Madrid train bombings, this year embroiled in controversy over a decision by unions to hold nationwide protests over the economic crisis. The UGT union has announced that Pilar Manjon, a leader of the largest victims association whose son died in the attacks, will join union members at the Atocha station on Sunday morning for a memorial observance, before the protest march. The March 11 demonstrations follow union protests last month which drew large crowds nationwide. Spain's two main unions -- the Socialist-leaning General Workers Union (UGT) and the Communist-leaning Workers Commissions (CCOO) -- scheduled the demonstrations on March 11 to protest against the new conservative government's labor reforms, which unions say make it cheaper and easier to fire workers. The unions said the protest in Madrid will take a different route on March 11 than the protests last month, out of respect for the victims.
