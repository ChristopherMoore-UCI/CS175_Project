Officials are concerned that a large influx of people may take marijuana to the airport and transport it across state lines. Despite the hundreds of people queuing on public sidewalks, no significant problems emerged Wednesday, Denver officials said. In a vivid example of how recreational pot is a new reality for the state, Denver officials posted public signs in the tourist-populated corridor known as the 16th Street Mall. "It's huge," he said at a marijuana store along a light industrial corridor outside downtown Denver. The organizers canceled the party because officials said it would violate a Denver ordinance prohibiting the public consumption of marijuana.
