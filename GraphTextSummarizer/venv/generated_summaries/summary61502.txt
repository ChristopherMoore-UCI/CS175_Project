Newcastle United have sacked manager Chris Hughton, the first English Premier League dismissal of the season. " Hughton, who became Newcastle's eighth manager in six years when he was promoted from first team coach following the club's relegation in 2008-2009, had never held a managerial post before. The 51-year-old Hughton led the club back to the Premier League at their first attempt, following relegation the previous season, and had guided them to 11th place in the table. Meanwhile, Italian Serie A side Brescia have sacked coach Giuseppe Iachini after a run of 11 league games without a win which has left them fourth bottom of the table. The Magpies have produced some superb results in recent weeks, notably a 1-0 victory at Arsenal and a 5-1 destruction of north-east rivals Sunderland.
