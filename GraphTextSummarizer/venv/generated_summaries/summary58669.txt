Jaafari, the daughter of Syrian U.N. Ambassador Bashar Jaafari, was described in March as a Syrian government press officer in New York. " Walters, in her statement Wednesday, described the interview as "hard-hitting" and said "the fallout for Assad from the interview was such that the Syrian government went to great lengths to discredit me and ABC News." Jaafari was among those who coached al-Assad before the interview on how to describe the violence, according to e-mails purportedly from Syrian officials released in February by the hacking group known as Anonymous. In e-mails from Jaafari to al-Assad, she writes, "hey handsome" and adds "I love u." Walters said Wednesday that Jaafari was "looking for a job" when she contacted her. In other e-mails from Jaafari to al-Assad, she strikes a more personal tone. Sheherazad Jaafari appears to have a close relationship with the Syrian president, according to e-mails obtained by CNN.
