-- Spanish rider Alejandro Valverde won stage 17 of the Tour de France on Thursday, as Bradley Wiggins edged closer to Britain's first overall victory in cycling's premier race. Valverde finished 18 seconds ahead of Wiggins and Froome on the final stage in the Pyrenees, recording Team Movistar's first win at this year's Tour. "When I felt that Froome and Wiggins were approaching me on the final climb, I gave everything I could to resist their chase and, after 500 meters from the finish line, I started to tell myself that it was good," Valverde told the Tour website after finishing first on the 143.5 km route between Bagneres-de-Luchon and Peyragudes. With three stages remaining, Wiggins leads his Team Sky colleague Chris Froome by just over two minutes. " Wiggins has worn the yellow jersey for most of the three-week event and is now almost certain to become the first Briton to win the prestigious race following its final day in the mountains.
