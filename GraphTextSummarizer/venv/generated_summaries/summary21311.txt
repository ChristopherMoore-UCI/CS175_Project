Officials said earlier that as many as 25 passengers could have been involved in the wreck, but Greyhound spokeswoman Maureen Richmond said later that a total of 18 people were on the bus. -- A Greyhound bus overturned in southeastern Pennsylvania early Saturday, injuring at least 14 people, none of them seriously, the company said. The bus originated in New York with a destination of St. Louis, Richmond said. Four of those passengers were uninjured and able to continue with their scheduled trips, Richmond said. The bus was on the Philadelphia to Columbus, Ohio, leg of the trip at the time of the accident, she said.
