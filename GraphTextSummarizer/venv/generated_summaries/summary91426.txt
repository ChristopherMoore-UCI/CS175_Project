Liberty was sold out of red roses Thursday and other colors were costing between $58 and $96 per dozen. Growers need 50 to 70 days to produce enough roses for Valentine's Day after the demand for red roses at Christmas is filled. Bangkok, Hong Kong and Tokyo are some of the more expensive places in which to buy red roses for Valentine's Day, according to an informal price check by CNN on Thursday. But if it was Kenyan roses they were selling Thursday at London's Liberty department store, the cheap prices weren't filtering down to consumers. Plus, in order to grow a single long-stemmed rose -- a Valentine's Day favorite -- growers have to nip off several rosebuds along the stem, reducing the total number of roses they can grow, the society said.
