The company says that the odor is a result of oils improperly breaking down in the cookies that "are not up to our quality standards." The Lemon Chalet Cremes were distributed in 24 states -- Alabama, California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Wisconsin -- and the District of Columbia. Little Brownie Bakers of Louisville, Kentucky, one of two bakeries in the United States that make Girl Scout cookies, posted a statement on its Web site Friday saying it had received several complaints from customers who encountered a foul smell and taste in boxes of Lemon Chalet Cremes. But for those who are eagerly running to their pantry to open a box of Lemon Chalet Cremes, a foul odor may dampen their cookie-eating experience. -- Everyone has their favorite Girl Scout cookie: the popular Thin Mints, the coconuty caramel delight of the Samoas, the simple yet lovable Shortbreads. The number of potentially stinky boxes totals 636,000, according to a spokesperson for Little Brownie Bakers.
