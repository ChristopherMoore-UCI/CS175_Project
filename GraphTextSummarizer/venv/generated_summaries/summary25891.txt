-- Cristiano Ronaldo's stunning extra-time header gave Jose Mourinho his first trophy as Real Madrid coach on Wednesday, winning the Spanish Cup final 1-0 against arch-rivals Barcelona. The Portugal captain rose high at the far post to power in a 103rd-minute effort from a teasing cross by Angel Di Maria, who was sent off for a second booking at the end of the second spell of extra time. Ten-man Madrid deny Barcelona in Clasico Madrid waited for counter-attacking opportunities, and the first came in the 98th minute as Ronaldo raced clear before driving just wide of Jose Manuel Pinto's far post. Captain Iker Casillas then saved Real with superb efforts to deny Messi and Pedro in rapid succession, and the match went to extra time. Barcelona battled back into the game in the second half, and had the ball in the net with 69 minutes gone but Pedro was ruled to have been marginally offside as he gathered a superb pass from Lionel Messi.
