Hall's seven decades in music covered the evolution of modern jazz, and his role included showing that the guitar could replace the piano, said guitarist Julian Lage. -- Jazz guitarist Jim Hall, who played with the jazz greats of the 20th century and influenced the younger ones, died Tuesday, his family said. "I wouldn't be doing what I am doing if not for him," said Lage, 25, who played for several years in Hall's trio. Hall died in his sleep of heart failure at his home in New York's Greenwich Village early Tuesday, his wife Jane Hall told CNN. "One of the things that made Jim so special as a player, he had a beautiful sound on the instrument," guitarist Russell Malone told CNN on Wednesday.
