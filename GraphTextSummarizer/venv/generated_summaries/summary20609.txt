On Saturday, the menu was roughly the same as any J-J Dinner — or Lincoln Day Dinner or Reagan Dinner on the GOP side — you'd find in counties and states from Maine to Hawaii. In places like Iowa and New Hampshire, the dinners take on an added importance: Ambitious pols with their eyes on the White House come here to test drive their national appeal and forge relationships in crucial early nominating states. Democrats have their J-J Dinners, and Republicans convene at Lincoln Day Dinners or Reagan Day Dinners. "He hadn't said he would run in 1972, but there he was on the rubber chicken circuit, glad-handing county chairmen and looking for early commitments," the legendary AP scribe Walter Mears wrote four decades ago in a profile of Ed Muskie, the Maine Senator who never made it to the Oval Office. "If we lose this concept of having political parties, where people can gather and have a platform and join together, we really lose what's been at the core of democracy," Klobuchar said when we asked her about the importance of these dinners.
