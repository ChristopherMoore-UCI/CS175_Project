"There is a growing trend for young people to communicate through telephone text messaging and also over the Internet, whether it's e-mail or within chatroom forums. "Teenagers are one of the most 'at risk' groups and increasingly use the internet to access advice from support services which they may be less inclined to seek through other routes," Langan said. "We don't know if it is some weird cult or copycat suicides or if they have had some bizarre pact to kill themselves," Clarke said. "Suicide is an issue for society as a whole; the internet provides a window into the issues young people are dealing with." Police are examining Randall's computer after the teenager posted messages on a social networking site, Bebo, prior to her death dedicated to 20-year-old Liam Clarke, who was found hanged in a Bridgend park last month.
