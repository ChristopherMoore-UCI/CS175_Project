The African-American community bears a huge burden of HIV in D.C. -- way above and beyond the proportions of the demographics of the D.C. area," says Justin Goforth, who works with the Whitman-Walker Clinic, a health center specializing in HIV/AIDS care. Flanked by national health care administrators and community activists, Obama said his national strategy is to increase prevention and improve treatment while reducing disparities among groups hardest-hit by the disease. For Goforth, who tested HIV positive 18 years ago, the daily battle to reduce infections is more than just a job. HIV/AIDS rates in the district are "on par with Uganda and some parts of Kenya" where the disease has raged for years, says Shannon Hader, Washington's former HIV/AIDS administration director. Obama told the crowd assembled at the White House, "We're here because we believe that while HIV transmission rates in this country are not as high as they once were, every new case is one case too many."
