Your brain on food: Obesity, fasting and addiction Jennifer Gibson, a sports dietitian at the U.S. Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs, suspects he might have simply cut out meat or tried some kind of liquid diet: "With a no-food fast for 15 days, we would have seen a noticeable change in his body, and we didn't." Fasting isn't for everyone Some people should never fast: pregnant women, anyone on medication that needs to be taken with food and diabetics -- not to mention anyone else with a medical condition that requires regular food intake. Keep it short It takes about three days without food for the body to go into an unhealthy starvation mode -- less if you don't have a big meal before the big fast, according to Gibson. "We focused on foods that are really easy to digest and not overly fatty," Gibson says. For example, last year during the monthlong Ramadan, Gibson laid out a special meal plan for Olympic fencing hopeful Ibtihaj Muhammad.
