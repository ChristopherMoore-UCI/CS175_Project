Residents in the woman's Mill Creek Drive neighborhood said Roberts had told them she was expecting a child, according to CNN affiliate KPTV. "They also discovered that Ms. Roberts had not delivered a child at anytime in the recent past." Deputies returned to the home, where they found the body of 21-year-old Heather Snively in the crawl space under the kitchen, Thompson said. Rescue crews first went to Korena Roberts' home in Washington County on Friday in response to a call of a newborn in distress. Roberts told deputies the baby was hers, the county sheriff's office said. The outcome could result in another murder charge for Roberts, deputies said.
