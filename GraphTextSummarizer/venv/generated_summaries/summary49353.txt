The South Korean coast guard stopped hundreds of Chinese boats last year on suspicion of illegal fishing in the sea. -- A South Korean court on Thursday sentenced the captain of a Chinese fishing boat to 30 years in prison for murdering a South Korean coast guard officer during a confrontation in the Yellow Sea last year. At the time of the confrontation, Seoul asked Beijing to "strictly clamp down on illegal fishing and the illegal acts of Chinese fishermen. The court in the port of Incheon also handed down prison terms to several other crew members of the Chinese vessel, which the South Korean coast guard officials boarded on December 12 because they suspected it of fishing illegally. Disputes over fishing rights have resulted in dozens of boat seizures.
