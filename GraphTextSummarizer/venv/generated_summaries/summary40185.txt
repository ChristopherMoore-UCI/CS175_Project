The pair were released Monday morning at Parker River National Wildlife Refuge on Plum Island in northeastern Massachusetts, after nearly eight weeks of treatment and rehabilitation, said Dr. Flo Tseng, director of the wildlife clinic where the birds were treated. A greater number of owls have been reported at the airport this year, Tseng said. Tseng said the rise and fall in the number of owls they treat each year varies. The yellow-eyed, white birds were taken in March to the Tufts Wildlife Clinic in North Grafton, where one was treated for soft-tissue wounds and the other had lifesaving surgery for a broken wing, said Tseng. The owls were rescued by Norman Smith, director of the Massachusetts Audubon Society's Blue Hills Trailside Museum, after they were injured at Boston Logan International Airport.
