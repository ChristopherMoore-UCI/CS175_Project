The Marshals Service said it worked "with international investigative resources in Port Harcourt, Nigeria, to bring Tata to justice." -- A woman convicted of murder in the 2011 deaths of four children in a fire at her Houston day care center was sentenced Tuesday morning to 80 years in prison. Tata, then 22, left seven children unsupervised at her home day care while a pan of oil was on an activated stove, authorities said. After the fire, Tata fled to Nigeria, and the U.S. Marshals Service named her one of its most wanted fugitives. The home was on fire when she returned, authorities said.
