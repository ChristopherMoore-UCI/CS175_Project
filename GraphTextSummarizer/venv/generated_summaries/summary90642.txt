Potential liability flows from journalists at News of the World to its parent, News International, and to that company's parent, News Corp., which is a publicly held company in the United States, and runs Fox News. News Corp. is owned by media baron Rupert Murdoch, who last year answered questions before a British parliamentary committee looking into press conduct. Lewis said he had not yet approached News Corp., whose now defunct News of the World newspaper has been accused of hacking the voice mail of crime victims, politicians, celebrities and veterans in search of stories. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, enacted in 1977, makes it illegal for a U.S. citizen or company to pay foreign officials to obtain or retain business. News International, the British publishing arm of News Corp., declined to comment on the matter.
