Marussia F1: car not a factor in crash "Marussia - the staff, race drivers Timo Glock and Charles Pic, and all those associated with the team - wish Maria well with the next stage of her recovery. " De Villota joined Britain-based Marussia in July after a career which has included spells in Spanish Formula Three, the Euroseries 3000 and the Daytona 24 Hours. The Madrid-born racer is the daughter of former March team Formula One driver Emilio de Villota. -- Maria de Villota, the Formula One test driver who lost the sight in her right eye in a crash earlier this month, has left hospital and returned home to Spain. More comfortable and familiar surroundings, plus the support of her wider family and friends, will undoubtedly provide a more conducive environment in which Maria can commence the next phase of her recovery," Marussia said in a statement.
