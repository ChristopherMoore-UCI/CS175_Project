Mike Parker comes into the Helvetica story as the director of typographic development at Mergenthaler Linotype Co. "He oversaw its development into a font published for the Linotype machines," Harry Parker said. His son, Harry Parker, considers his father to be the "godfather" of the Helvetica font, as a Fast Company headline described him. After Linotype, Carter and Parker formed a company called Bitstream in 1981, the first company dedicated to producing digital fonts, ex-wife Sibyl Masquelier said. "My dad didn't draw Helvetica, but he was very instrumental in it," Harry Parker said. One of the people responsible for the popular use of Helvetica, Mike Parker, died Sunday at age 84.
