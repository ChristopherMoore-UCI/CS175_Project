But by postponing for a year the implementation of the ACA's requirement that employers with more than 50 full-time workers offer insurance of minimally acceptable quality or face fines of $2,000 to $3,000, the administration has weakened the core of health care reform. The vast majority of Americans get medical insurance through their employers, although the number of employers that offer insurance has fallen 10% since 2000, and the insurance they do offer is increasingly lousy. In its notice announcing the ACA delay, the administration correctly states that the vast majority of employers already provide insurance. The ACA is as much about regulating insurance as encouraging businesses to provide it. True health care reform must end this sorry state of affairs in the workplace, where health care is centered.
