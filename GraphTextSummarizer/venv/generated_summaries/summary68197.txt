Controversial politically Politically, the issue remains controversial, a reflection nationwide over how it will be resolved: whether the courts, state legislatures, or the voters should decide the future of same-sex marriage. Because the judge -- an appointee of President Barack Obama -- did not immediately stay enforcement of his decision until the subsequent appeals process is exhausted-- as other judges have done-- it prompted same-sex couples to quickly obtain marriage licenses, despite the state's ongoing legal challenge. A near unbroken string of state and federal court victories nationwide in the past year gives marriage equality supporters unbridled encouragement their ultimate goal will be achieved: eliminating all laws limiting the rights of gays and lesbians to wed. U.S. District Court Judge Robert Shelby struck down Utah's ban on same-sex marriage five days before Christmas, saying the state's "current laws deny its gay and lesbian citizens their fundamental right to marry and, in so doing, demean the dignity of these same-sex couples for no rational reason. Among states, Mississippi led the list, also at 26 percent. Round Two The high court's recent precedents set the stage for Round Two of the debate, and now the 10th Circuit will become the first federal appeals court to confront the over-arching constitutional questions over gay marriage.
