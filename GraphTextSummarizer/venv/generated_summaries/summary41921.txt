The game featured classic arcade games such as "Centipede" (Wilson's favorite as a kid), "Lunar Lander" and "Missile Command" as well as games from the Atari 2600 home console such as "Adventure," "Haunted House" and "Yars' Revenge." Atari has been synonymous with games and gaming since Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney founded it in 1972. They will hold true to the Atari brand but could appeal to those gamers outside the male-dominated, core audience of traditional Atari games. Wilson is counting on a blend of reinterpreted classics and original games for the social and mobile gaming arena to drive Atari's business for the near future. Men older than 30 make up the company's core audience, he said, so they've grown up with Atari, and they have the money to spend on games.
