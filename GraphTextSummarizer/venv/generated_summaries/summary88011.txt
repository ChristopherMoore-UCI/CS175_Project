-- Four aid workers, who were abducted from Kenya's vast Dadaab refugee complex near the Somali border last week, were freed late Sunday during a shootout with kidnappers, a military official said.. Kenya Defense Force soldiers, working with Somali government troops, confronted the abductors after tips from local residents, Col. Cyrus Oguna said. Police have not said whether the kidnappers were from Al-Shabaab, an al Qaeda-linked group that is fighting to impose Islamic law in Somalia and controls large parts of the troubled nation. Also in October, gunmen abducted two Spanish workers with the medical charity Doctors Without Borders from Dadaab, the world's largest refugee camp, which houses nearly 500,000 people about 50 miles west of the Somali border. The aid agency said only that a convoy "was involved in an incident" in Dadaab and that Secretary-General Elisabeth Rasmusson and Country Director Hassan Khaire were at the camp but neither was in the convoy. Kenya has blamed previous abductions of tourists and aid workers on Al-Shabaab.
