Oslo police said Cortés had been fined 15,000 kroner ($2,040) for nuisance and for entering the City Hall illegally. Oslo police have come under fire over the incident, with critics asking how someone who wasn't on the ceremony's guest list managed to slip through security checkpoints and make it to the front of the room, standing just steps away from Yousafzai and other dignitaries before security hauled him out of the auditorium. In a matter of seconds, the 21-year-old Mexican student's face was seen around the world last week as he stood in front of Malala Yousafzai at the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in Oslo, Norway. " The students' case has sparked national outrage in Mexico and drawn global attention to the country's continued struggles to deal with police corruption and drug-related violence. Cortés said he was seeking asylum in Norway, but authorities there have informed him that he'll be sent back to Mexico on Monday, Cortés and his attorney said.
