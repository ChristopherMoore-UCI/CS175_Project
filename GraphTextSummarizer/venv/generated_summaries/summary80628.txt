"There is an ongoing situation which involves a rescue of people off Christmas Island," a statement from Australian Customs and Border Protection said. The group will be transferred to Christmas Island where they will undergo security, identity and health checks and their reasons for travel will be established, according to the Customs and Border Protection statement. Christmas Island is an Australian territory in the Indian Ocean, nearer to the Philippines than to Australia. -- At least 28 people were killed Wednesday after a boat carrying asylum seekers crashed into cliffs along the shore near the coast of Christmas Island, Australia's minister for immigration and citizenship said. "It's a very difficult situation for everybody involved and of course, particularly, for those on Christmas Island: for the asylum seekers and for those involved in the rescue," Minister Chris Bowen said in an Australian radio interview.
