Prosecutors will review whether hate crime charges are appropriate against England and Watts, Tulsa County District Attorney Tim Harris said Monday. Police Chief Chuck Jordan described England and Watts as apparently close friends who shared a home in Tulsa. Police arrested Watts, 33, and Jake England, 19, early Sunday after tips led investigators to England's burned pickup. A judge ordered England and Watts held Monday on $9.16 million bond each pending formal charges on allegations of murder, shooting with intent to kill and gun possession. Fellow suspect Alvin Watts confessed to shooting the other two people, according to the documents, which include only summaries of the reported confessions and few details.
