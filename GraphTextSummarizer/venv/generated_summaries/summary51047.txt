Tsonga had not won a title in 18 months after struggling with injury and loss of form, but has returned to his best with a vengeance ahead of the U.S. Open later this month. Later Sunday, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga completed a triumphant week at the men's Rogers Cup in Toronto with a straight sets victory over Roger Federer. -- Venus Williams could not find the energy and inspiration which had seen her defeat sister Serena in the last four as she slipped to a straight sets defeat to Poland's Agnieszka Radwanska in the final of the Rogers Cup in Montreal Sunday. The Frenchman had beaten world number one Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray on his way to the title match at the Masters 1000 tournament and Federer went the same way in a 7-5 7-6 victory. The 13th seed had also gone into this match as the underdog, with Federer looking for a remarkable 300th win at this level.
