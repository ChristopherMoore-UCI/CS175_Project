-- Hundreds of women nationwide are suing the manufacturer and designer of a hair smoothing product that they say caused them severe hair loss and other damages. The product, which Unilever said was discontinued last year, might still be for sale at some retailers, said Amy Davis, an attorney with Dallas-based law firm Christiansen Davis Bullock LLC that's representing some women in a New Jersey state court. Josephine Wells and Catherine Reny, among some other plaintiffs in a California federal court, wrote in a lengthy complaint that the manufacturer, Unilever, knew but failed to disclose that the product "contains an ingredient or combination of ingredients that causes significant hair loss upon proper application." At the center of the dispute is Suave Professionals Keratin Infusion 30-Day Smoothing Kit, a hair treatment product for women who wanted "smooth, shiny manageable hair with no frizz." " In an e-mail sent to CNN on Thursday, Unilever spokeswoman Anita Larsen declined to comment on the pending litigation.
