The 29-year-old, who broke ranks with her national skiing federation to set up her own team, last weekend had the satisfaction of breaking the iconic all-time World Cup points record of the legendary Hermann Maier as she shrugged off pre-race death threats. -- Whether it's breaking records on the piste, or making hit records in the studio, Tina Maze is determined to do things her way. Maze has had to play second fiddle to the likes of American superstar Lindsey Vonn, the previous holder of the women's points record of 1980, but no longer. At one point, Maze dons a skiing helmet and uses a ski as a mock guitar, but fooling aside it is clear she has more than a modicum of musical talent. The accompanying video -- which sees Maze moving in time to the catchy up tempo song -- has had over a million hits on YouTube.
