Pilar Sanders was released a day later and said she hadn't been given a "fair shake" over allegations that she attacked Sanders in an incident he made public in a series of bizarre Twitter postings. Authorities responded to a domestic disturbance call the afternoon of Monday, April 23, at a Prosper residence where Sanders, 44, complained he was assaulted by Pilar Sanders, 38, and another woman identified as Dianna Boswell, also 38, according to an earlier police statement. -- Police in suburban Dallas are recommending that ex-football star Deion Sanders face a charge that could land him in prison for a year, after a dispute last week that led to his estranged wife's arrest, authorities said Thursday. After further investigation, police cited Boswell and Deion Sanders for "Class C simple assault," but neither was taken into custody. In one of the messages posted last week on his verified Twitter account, Deion Sanders included a photo of what he said were his children filling out complaints to give to police in Texas.
