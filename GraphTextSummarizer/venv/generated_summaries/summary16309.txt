My Take: My hijab is my hoodie Many hijabis, or wearers of hijabs, are stigmatized for the practice, Khan said, speaking from experience. " She became involved in hijab activism in 2014, when Quebec's national assembly began hearings on a secular charter to ban overt religious symbols in the public-sector workplace. " So Khan started World Hijab Day to build empathy for this perspective and to encourage non-Muslims, and Muslims who don't normally wear a hijab, to try it out. It's progress for me as a Muslim woman, the next step in my faith," said Khan (no relation to Nazma Khan). This year, "ambassadors" in 33 countries organized World Hijab Day events.
