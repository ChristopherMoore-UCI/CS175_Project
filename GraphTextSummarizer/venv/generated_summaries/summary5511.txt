Boxing great Muhammad Ali, also an American Muslim, appealed to Tehran last month to give Rezaian full access to legal representation and free him on bail. The State Department also reacted with term "absurd" after hearing of reports in Iran's press about the charges. He is accused of economic spying, the Post reported, citing Iranian state media. It took more than four months for a judge to hear charges against him. Iran's human rights chief, Mohammad Javad Larijani, told news outlet France 24 last year that he hoped Rezaian's case would come to a positive conclusion.
