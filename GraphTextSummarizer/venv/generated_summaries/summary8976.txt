NY attorney general investigating Macy's Inc and Barneys New York Inc over racial profiling claims Student sues Barneys, NYPD, alleges racial profiling CNN's Susan Candiotti contributed to this report. -- HBO television actor Robert Brown filed a lawsuit Wednesday against the New York Police Department and Macy's Inc., accusing them of racially profiling him, according to court documents. Brown is the fourth person to say they were targeted after shopping at a New York department store because of race this year, and the second to cite Macy's as the store in question. Brown filed the lawsuit as a class-action complaint, on behalf of himself as well as similarly situated individuals of color, according to the documents filed in federal court in New York. Most known for his starring role in HBO's "Treme," Brown went to Macy's in New York in June to buy a graduation gift for his mother, the documents said.
