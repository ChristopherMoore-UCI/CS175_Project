On Thursday, Christie said he discussed immigration issues the day prior in a meeting with Mexican President Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto, saying they talked about how "it's a very difficult issue for both parties" in the United States and how it's Washington's responsibility to fix the problem. -- Gov. Chris Christie, who has long avoided wading into the immigration debate, said Thursday in Mexico City that he won't lay out his position on immigration reform unless he decides to run for president. During a trip to Iowa in July -- at the height of the crisis involving children crossing the border illegally -- Christie declined to answer questions from reporters about immigration. "Until that time I have no role in the immigration debate, except for how it may affect the individual citizens of New Jersey, which I'll deal with as governor," the New Jersey Republican told reporters. "But I won't have anything to say on immigration unless and until I become a candidate for president of the United States," he continued.
