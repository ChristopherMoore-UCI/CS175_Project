In anger over the recent death of an Internet activist who faced federal charges, hackers claiming to be from the group Anonymous threatened early Saturday to release sensitive information about the U.S. Department of Justice.

The "warhead" names appeared as links, most leading to 404 error messages of pages not found, but some leading to pages of raw programming code. "The commission's publications, training materials and federal sentencing statistics are again readily accessible to visitors to the site," it said in a statement. His family has issued a statement saying that federal charges filed over allegations that he stole millions of online documents contributed to Swartz's decision to take his own life.
