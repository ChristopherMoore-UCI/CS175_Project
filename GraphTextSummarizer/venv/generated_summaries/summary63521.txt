-- Fashion designer Alexander McQueen hanged himself in his wardrobe and left a suicide note, a coroner told a London inquest Wednesday. McQueen, whose real name was Lee Alexander McQueen, had a reputation for controversy that earned him the titles "enfant terrible" and "the hooligan of English fashion. In an interview with CNN's Jim Bittermann in October, McQueen spoke of the changing nature of runway shows for fashion designers. A police officer told the inquest that McQueen's death was "nonsuspicious," according to Martindill. The cause of death was asphyxia and hanging, said coroner's officer Lynda Martindill.
