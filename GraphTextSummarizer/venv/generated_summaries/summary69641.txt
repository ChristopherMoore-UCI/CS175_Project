"These changes are essential to reduce the thousands of accidental exposures of children that occur every year from rat and mouse control products and also to protect household pets," said Steve Owens, assistant administrator for EPA's office of chemical safety and pollution prevention. Children are especially at risk, the agency said, because poisons are often put on the floor and kids will sometimes put bait pellets in their mouths. The agency in 2008 gave makers of such poisons until last week to research, develop and register new products that would be safer than those that were then on the market. The EPA also intends to ban the residential sale of poisons that contain certain compounds -- brodifacoum, bromadiolone, difethialone and difenacoum -- because of their toxicity. Among the targets are such popular rodent poisons as D-Con, Victor and Hot Shot, the agency said.
