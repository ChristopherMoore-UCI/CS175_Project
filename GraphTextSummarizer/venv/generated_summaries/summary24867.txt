Tsarnaev lawyer David Bruck argued that letting federal agents monitor their conversation would intrude on the defense. CNN's Ronni Berke reported from Boston; Matt Smith reported and wrote from Atlanta. -- Accused Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev should be allowed to view autopsy photos of the attack's victims and meet with his sister without being watched by the FBI, a federal judge said Wednesday. Defense lawyers are expected to argue Tsarnaev was under the "domination and control" of his brother. Tsarnaev, now 20, is accused of planting the bombs at the finish line of the 2013 race along with his brother Tamerlan, who was killed during the manhunt that paralyzed Boston.
