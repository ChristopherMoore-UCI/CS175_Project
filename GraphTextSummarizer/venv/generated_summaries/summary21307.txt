Jibril said the absence of a civic structure in Libya, which was dismantled by leader Moammar Gadhafi during his decades in power, means people of all political ideologies can be part of a new government and its 200-seat parliament. "It has nothing to do with who prevails in those elections or those who do not prevail." Libya is unique among nations that have held elections after Arab Spring uprisings. Voters in the North African nation chose a more liberal coalition to lead, while voters in Egypt and Tunisia both opted for Islamist parties. Balloting took place 17 months after political demonstrations against Gadhafi broke out in two Libyan cities. -- The leader of the political coalition expected to win the first election in Libya in 42 years said Thursday that it is vital for Islamists, liberals and secularists to "sit around one table" and form a new government.
