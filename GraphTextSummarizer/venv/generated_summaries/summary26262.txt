"I want to apologize to everyone, Freddie Roach if he will accept my apologies," said Margarito, who was filmed shaking his hands in mock horror when a journalist told him Roach said Pacquiao would win by a knockout. He returned in May to win the vacant WBC International light middleweight title from Roberto Garcia before being signed up by promoter Bob Arum, with Pacquiao still unable to seal a deal for his dream clash with Floyd Mayweather Junior. It is Pacquiao's second visit to the venue, having retained his WBO welterweight title there against Nigeria's Joshua Clottey in March. " Roach said he had been angry about the video, but was prepared to move on, the Sweet Science boxing site reported on Thursday. The Mexican-American boxer made a surprise appearance at Thursday's press conference for the undercard bout between Brandon Rios -- who was also in the video -- and Omri Rowther in a bid to make peace ahead of Saturday's fight in Arlington, Texas.
