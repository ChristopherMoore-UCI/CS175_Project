Their Piper Aztec twin-engine aircraft had just taken off from Guyana's Ogle Airport when it encountered engine trouble, according to Robeson Benn, the South American country's minister of transport. -- Two pilots, an American and a Canadian, were killed Saturday when the small aircraft they were flying crashed into a house in Guyana, officials said. The only person in the house, Florence Dyer-Tyndall, 69, told reporters she ran out of the house after hearing the impact and seconds before it burst into flames. Residents in Sparendaam said they heard a loud explosion as the aircraft crashed into a small wooden house. The plane was registered to an American aerial photography and survey company based in Miami, the Guyana Civil Aviation Authority said.
