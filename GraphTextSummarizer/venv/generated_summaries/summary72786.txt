" National reconciliation has been a key demand of democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi as well as Western powers, including the United States. And last week, Suu Kyi met with William Hague, the first British foreign secretary to visit Myanmar in more than 50 years. Thursday's announcement coincides with a meeting between U.S. diplomats and Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Prize winner and the face of democracy in Myanmar. -- Myanmar plans to release 651 prisoners starting Friday, state television reported, one day after the country's leadership announced a cease-fire with an ethnic rebel group that has waged a bitter, decades-long insurgency for greater autonomy. "It has been a longstanding goal of the international community to see a ceasefire, and indeed it was one of the key issues on which I urged the Burmese government to make progress during my visit last week when I also met with Karen representatives," he said.
