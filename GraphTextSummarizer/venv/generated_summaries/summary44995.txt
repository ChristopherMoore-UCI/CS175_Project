The problem came to light Wednesday when Marco Arment, the creator of mobile app Instapaper, blogged and tweeted that an update to that app was crashing and fading to black immediately after people downloaded it. "We had a temporary issue that began yesterday with a server that generated DRM code for some apps being downloaded," Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller said. -- Apple says it has fixed a glitch that was causing apps downloaded from its online store to crash this week. The glitch was impacting apps for the mobile operating system that runs iPhones and iPads as well as apps for Macs. Users who had trouble launching an app can delete and download it again, Muller said.
