While the international community has pledged to help rebuild Georgia and provide massive international aid, Rice said Russia has precious little international support. " Rice's aides have heavily promoted her speech, inviting Russia experts and journalists to the State Department on Wednesday to preview the remarks. While the United States has taken issue with Russia's behavior for some time, Rice called its invasion of Georgia last month a "critical moment for Russia and the world. Rice also said that Moscow's other behavior, including using oil and gas as a weapon, threatening countries with nuclear attack, selling arms to rogue states and political persecution of journalists and dissidents, paints a picture of "a Russia increasingly authoritarian at home and aggressive abroad. "Russia's invasion of Georgia has achieved -- and will achieve -- no strategic objective," Rice said.
