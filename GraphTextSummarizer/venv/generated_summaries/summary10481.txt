As of Friday, monitoring of radiation levels at 47 sites across Japan showed minor increases in radiation, but at doses that are "far from levels which would require action," Andrew said. TEPCO Managing Director Akio Komiri, upon leaving a news conference Friday in Fukushima at which worker exposure levels were discussed, burst into tears. The company said Friday afternoon, though, that radiation levels at the plant's west gate, at 0.26 to 0.27 millisieverts, had been fairly stable over the prior 12 hours. TEPCO President Masataka Shimizu said Friday in a written statement that he was taking "very seriously" the increase in level of seriousness. "The limit for radiation workers in the United States is 50 millisieverts per year, but we try to keep them to less than 5 millisieverts per year."
