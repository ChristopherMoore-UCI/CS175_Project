"Based on the sophistication of what was used, this had to be well-executed and planned," Enfield Police Chief Carl Sferrazza said. He said they then rappelled into the building, disabled the alarm and proceeded to steal several dozen pallets of prescription pills, loading them onto one or more getaway vehicles. A spokesman for Eli Lilly, Ed Sagebiel, said the company is working closely with both the Enfield Police and the FBI. -- Local and federal authorities in Enfield, Connecticut, are investigating how a band of burglars broke into a large pharmaceutical warehouse and made off with approximately $75 million in prescription medications. "We have a closed system here in the U.S. that makes it more difficult to distribute them in the United States for legitimate means." Based in Indianapolis, Indiana, Eli Lilly is the ninth-largest pharmaceutical company in the world.
