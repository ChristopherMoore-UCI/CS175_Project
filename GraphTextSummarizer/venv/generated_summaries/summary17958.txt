Forbes magazine last year registered 45 billionaires in Hong Kong with a combined wealth of US$214 billion -- almost 80% of Hong Kong's GDP in 2013. A survey published in early 2014 by Demographia International Housing Affordability revealed that Hong Kong's property market has become the world's most expensive, with the median housing price reaching $4,024,000 Hong Kong dollars, or US$519,216. But with high property prices and hundreds of thousands waiting for public housing in Hong Kong, Fung, has no other places to go. "The reality is that a part of Hong Kong society's income is not increasing, while the rich are getting richer," says economist Richard Wong Yue Chim. "I used to own property in Shenzhen, but I moved back to Hong Kong four years ago so my daughter can have a better education here," Fung said, as his neighbors trickled out to join the conversation.
