-- Former teen idol David Cassidy faces a drunken driving charge after a Florida Highway Patrol officer stopped him on a Fort Pierce, Florida, highway Wednesday night. Cassidy, 60, failed roadside sobriety tests and registered at .14 on an alcohol breath test, according to the arrest report. Cassidy's publicist said his lawyer advised her not to comment yet on the incident. Cassidy starred on "The Partridge Family" in the 1970s, launching his pop music career. The trooper pulled Cassidy over after his car left the roadway and went onto the shoulder rumble strip two times before cutting off another car at an exit ramp, the police report said.
