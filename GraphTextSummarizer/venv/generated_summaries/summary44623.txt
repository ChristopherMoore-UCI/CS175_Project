It culminated in Brady being instrumental in a 96-yard drive, tied for the longest in Super Bowl history, as he finally found the excellent Danny Woodhead for a touchdown. It was the fourth Super Bowl triumph for the Giants, repeating their 2008 success over Brady's Patriots. The Giants had made the more confident start and had the first score of the night as Brady made an incomplete pass from his own endzone and referee John Parry awarded a safety and two points to the team from New York. It had been a 79-yard drive and on the way Brady made it 14 straight completions, breaking a Super Bowl record held by Joe Montana. Brady was sacked on the next Patriots drive, the Giants regained possession and Tynes converted again for a 33-yard field goal.
