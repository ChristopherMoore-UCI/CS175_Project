New Zealand is set to become the one of the latest nations to allow same-sex marriage after the country's Parliament passed a bill legalizing the practice Wednesday. If the laws in New Zealand and Uruguay are enacted, the count of nations allowing same-sex marriage would rise to 13. The bill's sponsor, Louisa Wall, released a statement saying she was "very proud to be a member of a Parliament that has voted overwhelmingly to give New Zealanders, regardless of their sex, sexual orientation or gender, the right to marry. The Supreme Court of Nepal ruled in favor of legalization in 2008, but those rights haven't been put into effect because the country's new constitution has been stuck in limbo for years. Parliament voted 77-44 on the bill's third reading, which is the penultimate step to enact laws in New Zealand.
