According to Bild's report, Sondenheimer told co-pilot Lubitz that he didn't manage to go to the bathroom before takeoff. Much attention has focused on Lubitz's state of mind, with suggestions that he may have had mental health issues. An official with Lufthansa, which owns Germanwings, said that the exam only tests physical health, not psychological health. Lubitz's breathing can still be heard on the voice recorder, according to Bild's report. The prosecutor's office confirmed what some media outlets had reported about doctors deeming Lubitz unfit to fly, though there were no physical illnesses found.
