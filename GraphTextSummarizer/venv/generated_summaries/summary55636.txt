Indonesian investigators say audio recordings from the plane's cockpit contain no sounds of gunfire or explosions, making it unlikely the plane was brought down by terrorism. If the plane was climbing at 6,000 feet per minute, Schiavo said, numerous alarms would have sounded in the cockpit. The latest data show the AirAsia plane, an Airbus A320, was climbing at a rate twice as fast as it "could and should do on its own,"  CNN aviation analyst Mary Schiavo said. "The plane ascended suddenly, with a speed that was above the normal speed limit, and then it went up," Transportation Minister Ignasius Jonan told reporters after he briefed lawmakers at a parliamentary hearing. And experts have speculated since Day One that storms might have played a role in the plane crash.
