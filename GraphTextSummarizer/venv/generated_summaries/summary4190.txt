-- Few female Chinese artists have attained the level of international recognition that sculptor Xiang Jing enjoys. Every three years, Xiang puts on a solo show containing series of works that represent a particular line of questioning, she says. In fact, she rejects the notion of inspiration altogether. Xiang says her work is always a kind of ongoing philosophical inquiry. Xiang first garnered attention for her sculptures of women.
