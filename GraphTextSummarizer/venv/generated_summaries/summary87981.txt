The activists say the treaty -- called ACTA, or the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement -- amounts to Internet censorship. SOPA, introduced by the U.S. House of Representatives, and a sister bill in the Senate called PIPA, aim to crack down on copyright infringement by restricting access to websites that host or facilitate the trading of pirated content. A group of lawmakers in parliament also protested the signing Thursday in Tokyo by the Polish ambassador to Japan. The legislation must be ratified by the Polish parliament before coming into effect. It says the agreement would not censor or shut down websites and, unlike the SOPA bill recently put on hold in the U.S. Congress, it would not change legislation.
