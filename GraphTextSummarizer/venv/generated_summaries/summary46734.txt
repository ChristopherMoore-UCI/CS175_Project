Khobragade, India's deputy consul general in New York, was arrested and strip-searched last week on charges of visa fraud related to her treatment of maid and nanny Sangeeta Richard. At the heart of this case is diplomat Khobragade's treatment of Richard, her maid and nanny. "There's a Cold War legacy when India was at odds with the United States over a range of issues," said political scientist Sumit Ganguly. India claims U.S. marshals overstepped their bounds in their treatment of a diplomat. Nicholas Burns, former U.S. undersecretary for political affairs, considers India one of American's most important allies.
