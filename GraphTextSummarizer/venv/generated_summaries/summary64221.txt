-- Serbian authorities have put up wanted posters for war crimes suspect Ratko Mladic at police stations across the country in their search for the highest-ranking figure from the Bosnia-Herzegovina conflict to remain at large, according to Serbian media reports. Mladic is the top-ranking figure from the conflict to remain at large following the July arrest of former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic. Last month, the office of the war crimes prosecutor in Belgrade announced that Serbian police -- acting on the prosecutor's request -- searched for Mladic and Hadzic around the town of Arandjelovac, 45 miles (75 kilometers) south of Belgrade. The posters remind people of the 1 million euro ($1.3 million) reward for information leading to Mladic's capture, according to Serbian media reports. Authorities also recently put up notices about the 250,000 euro ($334,000) reward for information leading to the arrest of Serbia's other fugitive, Goran Hadzic, according to the reports released Saturday.
