In April, the U.S. State Department released a report with similar findings, saying violence, corruption and organizational failings among government agencies, as well as actions by violent extremist groups, were contributing to significant human rights problems. " Much of the concern over human rights involved armed insurgent or terrorist groups, according to the report. Womens' rights also deteriorated, with so-called honor killings and domestic violence against women widespread and female genital mutilation widely practiced in northern Iraq, according to the report. "The human rights situation throughout Iraq remains fragile as the country slowly transitions from a conflict to post-conflict country that faces enormous development challenges that the Government and people of Iraq must now address," the report's authors wrote. -- Violence by extremists, widespread economic problems and significant failures in the judicial system contributed to shortcomings in Iraq's 2010 human rights record, the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq said in a report released Monday.
