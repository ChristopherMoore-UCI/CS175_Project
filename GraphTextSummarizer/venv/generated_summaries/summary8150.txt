The stop-and-frisk policy -- in which police stop, question and frisk people they deem suspicious, even if they've committed no crime -- has been one of the most controversial policing techniques in recent time, fueled by clashes between civil rights and civil liberties groups challenging the practice as racist and illegal. Judge Shira A. Scheindlin, the appeals court said, jeopardized "the appearance of partiality ... by a series of media interviews and public statements purporting to respond publicly to criticism of the District Court." Scheindlin, in a related 2007 proceeding, said, "If you got proof of inappropriate racial profiling in a good constitutional case, why don't you bring a lawsuit? Scheindlin, ruled that the policy violated plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment rights barring unreasonable searches, finding that police made at least 200,000 stops from 2004 to June 2012 without reasonable suspicion. Thursday's ruling effectively stalls changes mandated by Scheindlin, who said stops should be based on reasonable suspicion and made in a racially neutral manner. On Thursday, Kelly said he has been "concerned about the partiality of Judge Scheindlin, and we look forward to the examination of this case."
