-- Typhoon Melor roared into central Japan on Thursday, leaving two people dead and lashing the region with heavy rain and gusty winds. In western and northern  Japan, Melor tore roofs off homes, downed power lines and flooded roads. The storm contributed to the deaths of a 54-year-old newspaper delivery man in Wakayama, who ran into a fallen tree, and a 69-year-old man from Saitama, who was crushed by a tree. By late Thursday, Melor had weakened to a tropical storm and was heading out to sea. Utility poles lie buckled in the wake of Typhoon Melor.
