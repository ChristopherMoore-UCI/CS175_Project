The new owners, most notably pop star/actor Timberlake, have effectively stopped trying to compete with Facebook and other social sites, instead focusing on Myspace's superior platform for posting and listening to music. The new Myspace player offers unlimited, on-demand listening to both established and unsigned artists, personalized radio modes, a recommendation engine and easy integration with Facebook. But with Spotify beginning to limit the number of songs users with free accounts can play, it seems possible there could be space for a new online music player serving up similar content for free. "Myspace is building meaningful social entertainment experience around content, where consumers can share and discover the music they love," Vanderhook said. Myspace, the once dominant social-networking site that faded into obscurity during Facebook's rise to dominance, added 1 million new users over the past month, according to the company.
