Before recently cutting their pay, Bell City Council members received $96,000 a year, compared with $4,800 a year earned by council members in similar-sized cities. "This is a very serious matter when public officials breach their duty to the public and enrich themselves with enormous obscene salaries which then trigger pensions of similar magnitude," Brown said. -- Three current or former Bell, California, city officials, accused of misappropriation of public funds, won bail reduction Wednesday. The charges allege that the officials misappropriated more than $5.5 million, including being paid for phantom meetings, District Attorney Steve Cooley said Tuesday. City Council member Luis Artiga, former council member George Cole and Vice Mayor Teresa Jacobo showed that their bail funds come from legitimate sources and can post it anytime, a judge ruled.
