-- An ALS Ice Bucket Challenge went terribly wrong in Campbellsville, Kentucky, when four firefighters were seriously injured after participating in a group event, according to Campbellsville Police Chief Tim Hazlette. A photo obtained by CNN and taken by witness Tyler Arterburn shows the firetruck's aerial ladder hovering over the challenge participants as firefighters inside the ladder's bucket spray them with water. The university's Baptist Campus Ministry held a prayer service on Thursday evening. Captain Tony Grider, 41, and firefighter Simon Quinn, 22, were inside the bucket. Electricity from a power line shocked the firefighters after they had sprayed water on students.
