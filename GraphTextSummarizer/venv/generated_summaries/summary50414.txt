It is my best day," she added Treve is only the seventh horse to win successive Arcs and the first since the Vincent O'Brien-trained Alleged was ridden to a 1978 success by legendary English jockey Lester Piggott. Andre Fabre's Flintshire rode a strong race, ahead of Oaks and King George heroine Taghrooda and St. Leger winner Kingston Hill. She controversially took the decision to take famous jockey Frankie Dettori off the filly, replacing him with Jarnet, who rode Treve to the 2013 success and was winning his fourth Arc. Given the perfect ride by jockey Thierry Jarnet, 11-1 shot Treve stormed to the front in the final furlong to win from Flintshire and favored English filly Taghrooda. "This is a great personal satisfaction for me," said the 66-year-old from the famous Head racing dynasty, who have secured a string of Arc victories over the years as jockeys and trainers.
