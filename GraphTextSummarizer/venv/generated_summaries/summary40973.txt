-- When Russia invaded and annexed Crimea, Western leaders warned Russia against trying the same trick in mainland Ukraine. Russia is now trying the same trick in mainland Ukraine. Such a move would violate the terms of the 1997 agreement with Russia on NATO expansion, which is precisely why it's an apt response to Russia's violation of the 1994 agreement on Ukraine's territorial integrity. Over the past several days, masked, heavily armed men have seized strategic locations in eastern Ukraine. The most urgent necessity now: deploy teams of NATO observers to the cities that are targets of Russian activity in eastern Ukraine.
