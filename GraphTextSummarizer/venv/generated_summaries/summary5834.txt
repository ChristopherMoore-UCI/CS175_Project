-- Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu launched a major review of the country's defense strategy on Wednesday, as the embattled regional power tries to adapt to a post-Arab Spring world. An increased defense budget is needed to counter new threats all around the country, a former Israel Defense Forces deputy chief of staff said Wednesday. "The Muslim Brotherhood is forming a ring around Israel, out of Sinai and other places so with all this we need more money for the home front," said the retired officer, Uzi Dayan. "If ... weapons from there get into the hands of terror organizations, this is a threat," he said, as is the ongoing possibility of missiles from Lebanon and Gaza. The toppling of Egypt's long-time President Hosni Mubarak last year destabilized Israel's southern border, while the civil war in Syria could affect its northern frontier.
