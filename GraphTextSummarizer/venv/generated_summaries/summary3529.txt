Julie K. Schenecker, 50, is charged with two counts of first-degree murder in the deaths of her 13-year-old son, Beau Powers Schenecker, and her 16-year-old daughter, Calyx Powers Schenecker. In November, police opened a child abuse investigation into allegations Schenecker had abused Calyx, according to a report from the Tampa Police. But McElroy said police determined on January 28 after they arrived at the family home that Schenecker had plotted to kill the teens. Schenecker had initially planned what she called the "massacre" -- killing the children and then herself, McElroy said on Monday -- for January 22, but she put it off after learning there would be a three-day check before she could buy a gun. He is a member of U.S. Central Command and police told CNN affiliate WFTS that he was in Qatar when his children were killed.
