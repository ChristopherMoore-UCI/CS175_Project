A House leadership aide said the second resolution is aimed at U.S. military drones and any other combat role by U.S. forces in Libya, and is likely to pass in the Republican-controlled chamber. The second House resolution would remove U.S. forces from hostilities in Libya, except for those engaged in nonhostile actions including search and rescue; aerial refueling; operational planning; intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance; and noncombat missions. The House proposal seeking a noncombat role reflects frustration in Congress over what Boehner and others call President Barack Obama's failure to get necessary congressional authorization under the War Powers Resolution for engaging U.S. forces in the Libya military campaign. The White House argues the president didn't need congressional authorization because U.S. forces are playing only a supporting role in Libya and haven't engaged in what the law defines as hostilities. Meanwhile, House Speaker John Boehner proposed two resolutions on the Libya mission that could come up for votes on Thursday.
