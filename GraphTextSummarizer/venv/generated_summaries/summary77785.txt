" With Federer committing to every round of the Davis Cup this season -- unlike in years past -- and the emergence of compatriot Stan Wawrinka, it greatly boosted Switzerland's chances of success. When Federer defeated Richard Gasquet of France 6-4 6-2 6-2 in front of another record crowd Sunday, it gave Federer a maiden Davis Cup title at the not so tender age of 33. He did, and Federer was sharp Saturday in doubles alongside Wawrinka and then dominant against Gasquet in Lille, northern France. Though he applied the knockout blow, Wawrinka's performance this weekend shouldn't be forgotten, and Federer took note. When Wawrinka was asked for a percentage regarding his availability for Switzerland's opening tie against Belgium next year, he replied, "I think the percentage we're going to drink alcohol tonight is very high." If the French players were to drink some alcohol, it would be for different reasons.
