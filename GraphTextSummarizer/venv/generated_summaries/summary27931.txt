Opening statements in the murder trial of movie theater massacre suspect James Holmes are scheduled for April 27, more than a month ahead of schedule, a Colorado court spokesman said. The jury selection process, however, appears to be moving faster than expected, according to court spokesman Rob McCallum. Holmes, 27, is charged as the sole gunman who stormed a crowded movie theater at a midnight showing of "The Dark Knight Rises" in Aurora, Colorado, and opened fire, killing 12 people and wounding 58 more in July 2012. Holmes, a one-time neuroscience doctoral student, faces 166 counts, including murder and attempted murder charges. If there's a conviction, the death penalty phase could last another month, which means court proceedings could last until fall.
