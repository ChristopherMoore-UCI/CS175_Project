The 35-year-old Woods, who has not yet decided on a replacement, missed the British Open at Sandwich last week with knee and Achilles injuries having also missed the U.S. Open last month. New Zealander Williams, 47, has caddied for Australia's Adam Scott at the last two majors and he later issued his own statement confirming that he would now caddie for Scott permanently, while expressing surprise at Woods' decision. " The pair joined forces in March 1999, at a time when Woods had won just one major title, and since then they have flourished as a partnership -- claiming 13 majors as well as a remarkable 50 other PGA Tour titles. Former world number one Woods, who has slipped to 20th in the world and is currently out of action with injuries to his left leg, confirmed the news on his official website. He had been out of action for two months prior to the British Open, initially suffering the injuries at the Masters in April before withdrawing after nine holes of the Players Championship at Sawgrass in mid-May.
