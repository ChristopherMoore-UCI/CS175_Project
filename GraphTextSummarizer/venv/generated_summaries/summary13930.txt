Mistake: Lost patients     • Cause: Patients with dementia are sometimes prone to wandering. Consequences: Patients can die from infections spread by hospital workers. Prevention: Doctors listen to other doctors, so on your way to the hospital call your physician and ask them to call the emergency room. Mistake: Fake doctors     • Cause: Con artists pretend to be doctors. "Mistakes are happening every day in every hospital in the country that we're just not catching," says Dr. Albert Wu, an internist at Johns Hopkins Hospital.
