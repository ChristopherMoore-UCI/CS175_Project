Under the law, in cases where the owner permanently leaves the country, the state confiscates the home and turns it over for free to any legitimate co-owners or family. The National Assembly in August approved a plan to permit the sale of real estate, and the legislation itself officially was put on the books Wednesday. Before the law, a black market for real estate existed, where houses were swapped. In a move that could reshape the Cuban economy, the government on Thursday announced a new law that allows for the sale of real estate. The new law allows for the sale, exchange, donation and gifting of real estate even in cases of divorce, death, or the owner leaving the country permanently.
