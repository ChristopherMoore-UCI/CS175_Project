Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva told reporters on Sunday that the king visited hospital on doctors' advice. Â» Thailand abolished absolute monarchy in the 1930s, so the king wields little power although he last month appealed for unity amid Thailand's four-year-long political crisis. King Bhumibol Adulyadej, 81, was admitted to a Bangkok hospital on Saturday night. The statement was carried by Thai News Agency and other local media. From my chats with doctors, there is nothing to be concerned about," Abhisit said after signing a visitors' log book at the hospital, according to Reuters.com.
