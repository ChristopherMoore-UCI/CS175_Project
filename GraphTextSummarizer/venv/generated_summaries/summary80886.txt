Raffaele Sollecito was a 23-year-old computer science student when his girlfriend's roommate, Meredith Kercher, was found dead in the house she shared with Amanda Knox in Perugia, Italy, in 2007. When their successful appeal saw Knox and Sollecito freed in 2011 -- after four years in prison -- they set about trying to rebuild their lives, a continent apart. The memoir, "Honor Bound: My Journey to Hell and Back with Amanda Knox," draws heavily on diaries he kept and letters he wrote to friends, family and his hometown newspaper during his years in prison, the preface says. Sollecito chronicles the day of the murder, admitting that he and Knox smoked marijuana that afternoon, which he says he regretted because it clouded his memory of what happened.
