Mobs of Buddhist Rahkine extremists have been torching whole Rohingya villages. Near Sittwe University, which sits amid several Rohingya villages and camps, RohingyaS on foot, bicycle or scooter are forced to pull off the road when Buddhist Rakhine students are leaving classes. The soldiers that patrol the area are supposed to protect the Rohingya from further attacks by hostile locals, but videos taken by Rohingya purportedly showing an outbreak of violence in Aung Mingalar in June show the troops doing little to put out fires set in Rohingya homes. This island of Rohingya houses is now effectively a ghetto surrounded by barbed wire. Even mentioning the name Rohingya is controversial for some in Myanmar.
