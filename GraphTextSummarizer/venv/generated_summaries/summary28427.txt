"There are times in business when even though you execute your business plan and even though your employees do their jobs beautifully, external forces prevent you from controlling your own destiny," Eos CEO Jack Williams said in a statement. The airline becomes the latest in a number of small carriers that have gone out of business in recent month. The privately-held airline, in a news release Sunday, said it had secured additional financing. The seats also allowed passengers -- or "guests" as they airline prefered to describe them -- to sit face-to-face to dine or hold business meetings. Eos asked passengers to contact their credit card companies or travel agents to find out how to obtain refunds for unused tickets.
