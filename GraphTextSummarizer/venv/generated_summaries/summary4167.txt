-- World Bank President Robert Zoellick has warned that the eurozone crisis could have a dire effect on emerging markets if it continues in 2012. The World Bank is trying to shield emerging markets by making $27 billion available over next two years, specifically in central and eastern Europe. "Europe has sort of stumbled up to each crisis, put together a package, managed to get through the crisis, and it's bought time but it hasn't fundamentally addressed the problem." Solving the crisis now required "paying attention to the politics of reform, not just the economics of the balance sheet. He said the issues underlying Europe's crisis were yet be resolved. He said that while developing countries had provided about two-thirds of growth globally over the past five years, "we're all in this boat together and so if Europe really stumbles and fails it's going to hurt everybody."
