-- India is trying to reclaim the famous metal-rimmed glasses and some other artifacts from freedom leader Mahatma Gandhi that are up for auction next week in New York, a top official said Saturday. "The government will be doing whatever is required to get them back," India's culture ministry secretary Jawhar Sircar told CNN. When asked whether India planned any indirect participation in the bidding reportedly scheduled next week at the Antiquorum auction house on New York's Madison Avenue, he said it is one of the "speculative" options. Mahatma Gandhi was known for his peaceful opposition to tyranny, which led to India's independence. He said there were "several options" in place for India.
