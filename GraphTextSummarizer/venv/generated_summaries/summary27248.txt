Like Twitter, Instagram also allows people to follow other users. Launched by Systrom and partner Mike Krieger less than two years ago, Instagram already has more users than location-based network Foursquare, despite only being available on Apple's iOS. "We've been able to put together one of the most incredible Android apps you will ever see," said CEO Kevin Systrom told audience members during a session at the South By Southwest Interactive conference, waving an Android phone with a prototype on it. The app lets users enhance their photos with filters, share them with their friends or other people and comment on friends' photos. And a long-awaited version of Instagram for the Android platform is coming soon.
