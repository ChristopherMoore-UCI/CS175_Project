" "Respondents also failed to establish a nexus between photo identification -- showing voters are who they say they are, and the integrity of elections -- when prior elections accepted a number of types of proof to verify identify," McGinley wrote. "The issue of voter ID has served to mobilize the electorate in PA about the issue of voting rights in general as well as the specific of the mandate of Act 18. And the record is rife with testimony from numerous Pennsylvania voters whose right to vote will be -- and indeed already has been -- denied or substantially and unnecessarily burdened by the Voter ID law." People are signing up for Obamacare with IDs, why don't we require them for something as simple as voting." Pennsylvania was one of 31 states with some form of voter ID measure in place; and one of only a handful to require it to be a photo ID. Supporters contend the law would prevent voter fraud.
