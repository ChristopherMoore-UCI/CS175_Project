Meanwhile on Wednesday coalition forces fighting in southern Afghanistan killed four militants, the U.S. military said. But since then, the Taliban militant movement has regrouped, international troop deaths have increased and there has been an increase in terror attacks, mostly in eastern and southern Afghanistan. Afghanistan has already registered 3 million voters and is holding voter drives to register more. The elections are a critical moment for Afghanistan as President Hamid Karzai's five-year term ends. The United States will deploy additional troops in coming months to provide much-needed security in the run-up to the election.
