Bigelow and Whitney are confident that cinema audiences have a thirst for knowledge about volatile regions like Iraq and Afghanistan that goes beyond what is reported on the news. "I think the conflict [in Iraq] has been somewhat abstract for the general public, certainly speaking for myself," Bigelow told CNN. It was terrifying to know that somebody was trying to attack us, trying to shoot us," Whitney told CNN. "The film provides kind of a window, a lens onto what this particular conflict might be like, and gives it some specificity." David Whitney hopes "Kandahar Break" can have a similar effect. Whitney hopes the authenticity will help "Kandahar Break" enjoy the same level of success as Kathryn Bigelow's "The Hurt Locker" -- the first film about the Iraq war to make a profit at the U.S. box office.
