Season 3 brought us tragic deaths, new additions to the family and staff, and Shirley MacLaine. Did we mention fans can expect both special guest star Paul Giamatti and another helping of Shirley MacLaine in the roles of Harold Levinson and his mother, Martha? Season 3 wrapped with most of Downton's downstairs players riding cloud nine. A major player will be taking time away from Downton, making room for a few shakeups. There's nothing we look forward to more than one-liner standoffs between Martha and the Dowager Countess.
