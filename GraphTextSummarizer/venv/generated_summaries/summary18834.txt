While observers will be interpreting the meaning of each word in Obama's speech through the prism of domestic politics, examining each handshake with foreign leaders to glean the implications for international policy, the speech itself and Obama standing in Mandela's shadow should be powerful reminders of the progress that we have made in race relations. Nelson Mandela and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. were part of a global struggle for equality in the 1950s and 1960s that rocked societies that were built on the foundation of racial inequality. " Obama praised what this leader had accomplished for racial equality and in bringing down the apartheid regime. Racism, moreover, has reared its head in recent years among some of Obama's detractors. In South Africa, Mandela would eventually help to bring down the apartheid regime and dismantle a brutal system of white rule.
