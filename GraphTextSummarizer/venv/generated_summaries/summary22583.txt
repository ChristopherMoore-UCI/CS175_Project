-- French-led forces battling Islamist rebels seized the town of Tessalit in northern Mali on Friday, France's defense ministry said. Despite the withdrawal, troops will continue operations to flush out militants in "some terrorist havens" in northern Mali, French officials said. The monthlong French offensive has killed "hundreds" of Islamist fighters in Mali, the French defense minister said this week, as his troops prepared to start withdrawing. "Unfortunately, we expected the Islamists to return to these type of attacks as they were driven out of the city," said Lt. Col. Philippe at the French army base in Gao.
