Congress can then control federal debt simply by paying attention to the gap between spending and taxes. Issuing debt beyond the debt ceiling would be unconstitutional but not as unconstitutional as raising taxes or cutting spending. Unilaterally raising taxes or cutting spending would usurp more congressional authority. Indeed, anything he does would be unconstitutional because all of the relevant powers -- spending, taxing and borrowing -- belong to Congress. Many Washington insiders have assumed that if Congress fails to raise the debt ceiling, Obama could simply cut spending.
