-- Thousands of government supporters demonstrated in at least five Shiite provinces in southern Iraq on Tuesday, opposing protests by thousands of people in mainly Sunni provinces that have gone on for more than two weeks. They also are demanding the release of detainees they said were held without charges, calling the government corrupt and accusing it of unfairly targeting Iraq's Sunni people. Tens of thousands of demonstrators have protested for more than two weeks, demanding that the Shiite-led government stop what they call second-class treatment of Iraq's Sunni community. Demonstrators carried banners reading, "Yes, yes to al-Maliki implementing the constitution" and "No to canceling accountability and justice law," referring to Baathists and opposing protesters' demands in Sunni provinces like Anbar and Salaheddin. "We reject dividing Iraq into three regions: Sunni, Shiite and Kurd." Al-Moussawi also called for a comprehensive dialogue among all political parties to achieve stability in Iraq.
