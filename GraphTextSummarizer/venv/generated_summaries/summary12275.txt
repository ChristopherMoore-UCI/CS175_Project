-- A Maryland man pleaded guilty Tuesday to selling on eBay sound recordings donated to the National Archives, including one of baseball great Babe Ruth. He worked at the National Archives and Records Administration, known as NARA, for more than 40 years and was once the head of the department involving motion picture and sound recordings. Waffen admitted to selling a December 1937 voice recording of Ruth out hunting for the sum of $34.74 on eBay. The plea agreement does not list the additional stolen recordings the government says Waffen sold on eBay. Court documents say agents searched Waffen's home last year and found at least 955 sound recordings belonging to NARA that are worth at least $30,000.
