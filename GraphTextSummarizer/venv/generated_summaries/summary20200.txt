" "If I'd been foolish enough to depend on something like Skype or some other VOIP service for 911, I would have been hosed," Vrignaud said, arguing that internet service has become a utility much like water and electricity -- services that can't easily be turned off, due to regulations. The policy is ostensibly meant to help with congestion at peak times, but it makes no differentiation between data used in the evenings and that used from midnight to 8 a.m. when internet usage typically falls off. Median data usage for its cable internet customers is 4 to 6 GBs per month, according to Douglas. Vrignaud, it seems, committed the foul of using more than 250 GB of data on Comcast two months in a row, triggering the company's overage policy that results in a year-long ban from using its services. And Vrignaud, a hardcore geek who at one point worked as a Microsoft technology evangelist for XBox 360 and XBox live, has a lot of data he shares with the cloud.
