So what's changed between the shooting death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, in August, and that of Walter Scott in North Charleston, South Carolina, last weekend? "I think if officers know that their actions are being recorded on a consistent basis, it's going to protect good officers who do the right thing," Morial said. Ferguson: It took Ferguson police six days to publicly identify Wilson as the officer who shot Brown, and in the immediate aftermath of the shooting, then-police chief Thomas Jackson decided not to visit Brown's family. Outside of that, the highly publicized police shootings in Ferguson and North Charleston bear only mild resemblance. As for the city councils, the latest election in Ferguson makes its governing body more representative than North Charleston's.
