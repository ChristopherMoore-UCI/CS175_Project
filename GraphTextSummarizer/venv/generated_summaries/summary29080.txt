"We've been fighting this case now for the best part of seven years," said Fahey, before turning his attentions to other sports. Fahey hopes that the trial will be a watershed moment for doping in sport. "I don't think anything has changed, there have been doping cheats in sports for a long, long time, and there are still doping cheats in sports," John Fahey, president of the World Anti Doping Agency, told CNN. Blood doping involves using hormones or transfusions to boost the numbers of red cells in the body. The scheme will see a biological profile taken from each player two months before so that any marked changes in that profile at the tournament could point to blood doping or hormone use.
