Last summer, Sacramento launched a coalition of hiring agencies to grow job opportunities for youth. Training programs don't fulfill their potential if they are providing either generalized skills or skills that don't correlate to job demand. Similarly, last year JPMorgan Chase worked with local governments and nonprofit partners to support programs in 14 cities across the country from Jersey City to Seattle to create jobs for 50,000 teens and learning opportunities for another 50,000 young people. There's a reason why many parents want their children to get summer jobs during college or even the last years of high school. In some cases, summer jobs help them discover career pathways.
