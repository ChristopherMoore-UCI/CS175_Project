Police Chief Jaime Montoya said his officers still "aggressively follow new leads as they come in" but they're continuing to ask for the public's help in finding the men. Las Cruces police investigators updated sketches of the men back in 2005 to reflect 15 years of aging, but still haven't had any significant leads. On an early February morning almost 25 years ago, a bleeding 12-year-old Melissa Repass somehow summoned the courage and wherewithal to call 911 after she and six others were shot execution-style at a New Mexico bowling alley. After stashing the money, the men shot all seven victims at point-blank range and set fire to the office, apparently hoping to destroy evidence, police said. Today, the older suspect would be in his late 50s or early 60s, authorities say.
