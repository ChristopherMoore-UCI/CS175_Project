" On Tuesday, the ruling coalition sacked the heads of both chambers of parliament, who were Basescu allies, and replaced them with politicians close to Ponta. Ponta received Parliament's vote to go to Brussels on behalf of the country, but the Constitutional Court ruled that president Basescu had the right to attend the event. The motion is the latest in a series of attacks over the past month between Basescu and Prime Minister Victor Ponta. -- Romania's leftist government began impeachment proceedings Wednesday to suspend President Traian Basescu. In addition, Ponta accused some Constitutional Court judges of political bias and incompatibility and suggested that they be replaced.
