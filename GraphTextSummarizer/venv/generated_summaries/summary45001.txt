The group has connections to the Jabhat al-Nusra front, described as an active al Qaeda group in and around Syria, and to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria , but "there are increasing references to carrying out jihad at home," the judge warned at the time, referring to potential attacks in Spain. In a court order issued in June, Judge Ismael Moreno of Spain's National Court wrote that the suspected cell in Ceuta was "a structure based in Spain, with connections in Morocco, Belgium, Turkey and Syria, dedicated to radicalizing, recruiting and sending mujahedeen (fighters) to Syria with the aim of conducting jihad and achieving martyrdom." A suspected Islamic militant returning to Europe from the war in Syria was arrested on Sunday at Malaga airport in southern Spain as a potential "threat to national security," the Interior Ministry said in a statement.
