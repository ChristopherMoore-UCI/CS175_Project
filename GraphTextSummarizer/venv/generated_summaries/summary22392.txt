NATO members Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey have Black Sea coastlines, as do non-members Ukraine, Russia and Georgia. The movement of the Navy warship into the Black Sea comes ahead of an April 15 meeting of top NATO political representatives to discuss and potentially approve a series of recommendations for additional military measures, including shortening the "response time" of NATO forces if there were a crisis. Those troops remain positioned so close, and are so heavily armed, that the U.S. and NATO calculate they could "roll across" eastern Ukraine in three to five days, one official said. Washington also believes that the recent unrest in eastern Ukraine around the city of Donetsk is the work of "paid or compelled persons, heavily influenced by Russia," the official said. Other options on the table include more military exercises with member nations including the United States and potentially providing military advisers to Ukraine.
