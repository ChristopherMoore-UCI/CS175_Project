Lower college football divisions -- the Football Championship Subdivision, Division II, and Division III -- already have playoff systems in place. " Steger said that some issues -- such as access to nonplayoff bowls and financial distribution -- have not been finalized. -- For the first time in the history of NCAA Division I college football, there will be a playoff system, starting with the 2014-2015 football season. The current BCS system uses human polls, computer rankings, and strength of schedule to match the top two teams in the country to play for the national championship, and the process has always been open to criticism. A group of 12 college presidents -- the Presidential Oversight Committee of the Bowl Championship Series -- approved a plan Tuesday for a four-team seeded football playoff.
