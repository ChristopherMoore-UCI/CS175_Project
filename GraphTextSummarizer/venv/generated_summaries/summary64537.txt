The couple still love each other, but their relationship is a mess — a whirlwind of fights, lies, negotiations, teamwork, good sex, bad sex, and general confusion. Pete and Debbie were supporting characters in "Knocked Up," and now they're turning 40, with two lovely daughters (nicely played by Apatow's own daughters, Maude and Iris) and two crusty fathers (a terrific Albert Brooks and John Lithgow), who each have young families of their own. The comedy is there in how Pete leaps like a puppy to do his wife's bidding, without realizing that he's already in the doghouse for not having taken the initiative himself; or in the way that Apatow never once stages a marital-therapy session — but has Pete and Debbie lapse into the euphemisms of therapy-speak, even as it still sounds like they want to kill each other. -- Pete (Paul Rudd), the floppy-haired hero of Judd Apatow's winningly nimble and close-to-the-bone family-mishegoss comedy "This Is 40," is a married father of two in L.A. who escapes the frazzled swirl of his existence by engaging in deep, dark secret activities.
