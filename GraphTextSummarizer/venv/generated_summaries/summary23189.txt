The 27-year-old, who passed up the chance to draw level with American Pete Sampras on 14 grand slam titles when losing in Melbourne, had hoped to train for the first time on Thursday. "Since I came back from the Australian Open with my back injury I have not been able to train," he said in Thursday's video, which came against a backdrop of several trophies. The world No. 1 said he has yet to train following the back injury that hindered his performance in last month's Australian Open final, which he lost to Switzerland's Stanislas Wawrinka. -- Rafael Nadal has pulled out of next week's ATP tournament in Buenos Aires, posting an online video in which he apologized to both fans and organizers as he did so. There was no word from the Spaniard on whether he believes he will be able to play in the future tournaments in Rio de Janeiro, Indian Wells and Miami.
