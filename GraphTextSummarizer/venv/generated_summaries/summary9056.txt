German Nico Hulkenberg was a surprise fourth for Force India ahead of Brazil's Felipe Massa in his Ferrari. -- Britain's Jenson Button won the Belgian Grand Prix Sunday after a spectacular first corner crash ended the hopes of championship leader Fernando Alonso and three other drivers. Seven-time champion Michael Schumacher marked his 300th Grand Prix with a fine drive for seventh in the Mercedes ahead of their Toro Rosso pair of Jean-Eric Vergne and Daniel Ricciardo. Frenchman Romain Grosjean clipped the McLaren of Button's teammate Lewis Hamilton and catapulted into the air in his Lotus, flying over Ferrari's Alonso and narrowly avoiding the head of the two-time champion from Spain. Vettel has closed up to 24 points behind Alonso in the title standings, with teammate Webber, sixth in Belgium, eight points further adrift.
