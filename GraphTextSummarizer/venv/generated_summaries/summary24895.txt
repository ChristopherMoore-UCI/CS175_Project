-- A frigid winter storm system that put Dallas in the deep freeze will hit the East Coast on Sunday. On Sunday, temperatures are expected to only reach about 10 degrees in the northern and central Rockies, the northern Plains and the upper Midwest. From the central Appalachians through central New England, snow is expected into early Saturday morning, the National Weather Service said. The high temperature at the Dallas/Fort Worth airport Saturday was 26 degrees -- the coldest high temperature ever recorded there on December 7 and the coldest December day in Dallas/Fort Worth in 23 years, CNN affiliate WFAA-TV reported. The FAA said Saturday operations had returned to normal.
