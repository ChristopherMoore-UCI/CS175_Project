London police said Friday they are investigating a car accident in which Prince Andrew reportedly struck a police officer while driving into Buckingham Palace. Prince Andrew is Queen Elizabeth's second son after Prince Charles and is also called the Duke of York. A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police did not name anyone involved in the incident, but Buckingham Palace confirmed Prince Andrew was the driver of the car. British papers reported last year that the prince bought a 200,000-pound ($312,400) Bentley Arnage, which joined his existing limited-edition Aston Martin Virage V8 Volante. It happened as the policeman tried to move two Japanese tourists out of the way of Andrew's 4x4 car at the palace, the BBC reported.
