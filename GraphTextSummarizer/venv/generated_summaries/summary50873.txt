-- A British science teacher admitted Monday to trying to help anti-Assad regime fighters commit acts of terrorism in Syria. Police said the father of one had helped four associates travel to Syria for terrorism purposes last year and had planned to join them in the war-torn country. The defense said that Javeed did not know he could be prosecuted for making plans to travel to Syria to fight pro-Assad forces and would not have gone if he had known so. "He bought equipment for himself and for ISIS fighters to use once he arrived in Syria," Greater Manchester Police said in a statement. " Javeed's actions followed footage of chemical weapons use against civilians in Syria and British Prime Minister David Cameron's failed attempt to get Parliament to approve joining military action against the Assad regime, said a document setting out the basis for the guilty plea.
