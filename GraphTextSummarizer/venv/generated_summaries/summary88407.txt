In that isolated area, it would take 26 days on foot to reach care, Brock recalled, and he wanted to find a way to bring medical care to such remote areas. Tuesday marks the final day of its eight-day operation in Los Angeles, which so far has resulted in the provision of at least $2 million in free health care services, according to Brock's early estimates. On the final day of the Los Angeles operation, Brock said crowds were still gathering with the hope of receiving care. Over the last week, thousands seeking free medical care have turned up at the mobile health care clinic set up by Remote Area Medical, a non-profit organization founded by Brock. The lack of accessible health care from an economic standpoint is a problem that has been going on for decades, Brock said.
