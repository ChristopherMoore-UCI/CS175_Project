It is still unknowable whether markets will consider them safe, given that the Europeans, especially the Germans, have insisted on insurance of limited rather than unlimited liability, to guarantee against some of the losses that bondholders might suffer. Merkozy have lightened the debt load of Greece considerably by talking the banks into a loss of 50% on the face value of their Greek loans; they have ring-fenced other weak nations by introducing a recapitalization mechanism for banks; they have leveraged the existing bailout fund -- the European Financial Stability Facility -- to a maximum capacity of $ 1.4 trillion; they have pressured Italy into another round of structural and budget reforms; and they have agreed to improve the governance of the currency union by way of treaty change. Such an event triggers an insurance payment to the investors (an insurance scheme called credit default swap kicks in to minimize bank losses). There could be no doubt allowed that the "euro-Europeans" (those who share Europe's single currency) would do absolutely everything to preserve the credibility of their currency and restore trust that investments in European bonds remain safe. They might seek new capital -- as is suggested to them -- to reach the new core capital requirement of 9% by next summer.
