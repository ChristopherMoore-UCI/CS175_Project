Frank and April Wheeler (Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet) are about 30, with two kids, and both believe they can evade the traps of the existence they've chosen. "Revolutionary Road" was directed by Sam Mendes, who made the glibly scathing "American Beauty," only here he wants us to share not just Frank and April's misery but the frail reveries that hold them together. Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio share a happy moment in "Revolutionary Road." The best thing about "Revolutionary Road," a cool-blooded and disquieting adaptation of Richard Yates' 1961 novel about a powerfully unhappy Connecticut couple, is that it doesn't end with that rote vision of bourgeois anomie. Winslet has the tricky job of making us see the glimmer of wisdom in April's cockeyed plan, and she pulls it off, even as DiCaprio's Frank -- chipper, forthright, wholesome even in betrayal -- tugs the couple back to reality.
