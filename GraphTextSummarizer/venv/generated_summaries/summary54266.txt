Ugandan military helicopters go missing One of the aircraft could be seen burned out on the side of Mount Kenya, said Gen. J.J. Odongo, Uganda's defense minister. The helicopters were part of the first deployment of air support for the African Union Mission in Somalia in Mogadishu, where Ugandan, Burundian and other African Union forces are fighting Al-Shabaab, an al Qaeda-linked group. According to the Mount Kenya park service and UNESCO, elephants, rhinos, giant forest hogs and leopards are among the creatures that live in the area. -- Rescue teams searched Tuesday for seven people thought to have survived after three military helicopters came down on the side of Kenya's highest mountain, in a remote area that is home to leopards and rhinoceros. Al-Shabaab, which has battled Somalia's weak transitional government since 2007, controls much of southern Somalia and is active around the capital city of Mogadishu.
