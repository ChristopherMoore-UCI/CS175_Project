Gaga and Lauper are on a mission, along with cosmetics giant MAC, to ensure women are tested for HIV and AIDS. " Pop icon Gaga, who has enjoyed worldwide success thanks to songs such as "Poker Face," "Just Dance" and "Telephone" is known as much for her distinctive fashion sense and extravagant performances as she is for her music. Lady Gaga has paid tribute to pop icon Cyndi Lauper as they join forces to raise HIV and AIDS awareness among women. Because I think that's the very sort of pre-assumption, that women aren't getting tested and allowing negotiations to go on in the bedroom and are not putting their foot down." Gaga and Lauper told CNN's "Connect The World" women "need to put their foot down" in the bedroom.
