Widespread violence throughout northern Mexico in the past few weeks has led U.S. officials to take precautions, including the temporary relocation of State Department employees' families in border-area consulates. The latest killings were carried out by a local gang known as Los Aztecas, who are allied with the Juarez Cartel, Juarez Mayor Jose Reyes Ferriz said. Ciudad Juarez is the most violent city in Mexico, with more than 2,600 drug-related deaths in 2009. Canada, likewise, issued an advisory Tuesday urging citizens not to take nonessential trips to Ciudad Juarez and to "exercise a high degree of caution" throughout Mexico. "What it says is that he has really decided that success in Juarez is essential for stemming the tide of organized crime," said Andrew Selee, director of the Woodrow Wilson Center's Mexico Institute.
