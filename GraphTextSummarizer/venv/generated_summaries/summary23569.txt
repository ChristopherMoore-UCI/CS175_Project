He noted that while most luge courses "flatten out" around the 11th turn, the Whistler track "just keeps on dropping so there's really kind of no break from gathering speed toward the end." -- The luge track on which a Georgian athlete died during an Olympic training run will reopen Saturday after officials found it had no deficiencies, the Vancouver Olympic committee and International Luge Federation said. Georgian luge athlete Nodar Kumaritashvili, 21, was on his final official training run when he had a "serious crash" near the end of the 4,500-foot-long course Friday afternoon. The FIL said it will resume men's training Saturday morning with two full training runs before competition takes place as scheduled at 5 p.m. (8 p.m. ET).
