"My interest in wine began during a scouting trip in France and, over time, my enjoyment of discovery and collecting grew," Ferguson, who retired in May 2013 after guiding United to 13 English Premier League titles and two European Cups, said in a statement. During 26 years at Manchester United, Ferguson raised a glass to many memorable wins and toasted countless vintage performances. The lots span over a quarter of a century, including six bottles of Romanee-Conti Grand Cru 1999 from the year United won an historic Premier League, FA Cup and Champions League treble. "While Alex Ferguson's reputation and standing in football is renowned the world over, we are thrilled at Christie's to be able to showcase his exceptional taste in fine wine," said David Elwood, Christie's head of wine. "The importance of collecting wine was that it served as a distraction and gave me a balance in my life that helped me in dealing with the intensity and demands required of me as the manager of Manchester United.
