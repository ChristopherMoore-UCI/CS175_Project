"As this case has proved, working against sophisticated terrorist organizations and against the clock, our law enforcement and intelligence agencies can detect, disrupt and destroy terrorist cells before they strike, saving countless innocent lives," U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch said in a statement on the verdict. Berger told jurors that al Qaeda leaders assigned the mission to Medunjanin in 2008, while he was in Pakistan's tribal region with his friends. Prosecutors said Medunjanin sought to join the Taliban, but ended up being recruited by al Qaeda to perform a suicide mission back in the United States. Robert Gottlieb, Medunjanin's attorney, said his client "was always realistic about the environment in which the case was tried," referring to U.S. court proceedings in a post-9/11 America. In closing arguments last week, Assistant U.S. Attorney Berit Berger said the defendant was willing "to strap a suicide bomb to himself, walk into a New York City subway and blow it up."
