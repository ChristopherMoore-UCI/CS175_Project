Brad Dayspring, a senior adviser to YG Action Fund, a super PAC that supports House Republican candidates, told CNN that in 2010 candidates talked about repealing President Barack Obama's health care overhaul, criticizing the spending in the stimulus program and opposing Democratic proposals such as cap and trade, but this year the message centers on "solving problems." Dayspring, a former Cantor aide, said the party's ideology and issues aren't changing as Republicans work to increase the GOP majority, but he noted "a conservative in Massachusetts is going to look a lot different from a conservative in Arkansas." Although Boehner recently warned there was a 1-in-3 chance Republicans could lose seats in the House, McCarthy was more bullish on the party's electoral position, telling CNN that "there's an opportunity to gain in the overall number" of GOP seats. His group is evaluating GOP candidates across the country and plans to support 15 to 25 this cycle. The three were concerned their party wasn't doing enough to grow its base and recruit candidates in districts where the GOP lost in 2006. Early and often Democrats are tying all of these challengers to the House GOP budget authored by Ryan, which passed without a single Democratic vote and which, they argue, will end Medicare.
