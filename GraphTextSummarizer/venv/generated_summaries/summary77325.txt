He watched horse racing on TV for the first time in 2008, attended his first meeting at the start of 2010 and, by April of that year, had started buying horses. After his early successes, Sheikh Fahad has increasingly tried to take more of a back seat in horse racing, allowing his brothers to come to the forefront, but along with Joann he remains the integral figure for his country. As the field entered the turn for home, the grey and maroon racing silks of Sheikh Joann Al Thani nudged ahead of early pacemaker Joshua Tree -- and from then there was only going to be one winner. The first in the sport dated back to 2011 when the stallion Dunaden won the Melbourne Cup at the first attempt by owner Sheikh Fahad, cousin of Joann. Sheikh Fahad has spent admirably but also wisely, pushing his acquisitions through Pearl Bloodstock and Qatar Bloodstock to feasible limits while still ensuring both are money-making businesses.
