-- Doctors who treat breast cancer patients are very excited about an experimental drug that presents a whole new way of knocking out cancer cells. About 20% to 25% of women with breast cancer have HER2-positive breast cancer, a particularly aggressive and deadly form of the disease that was very difficult to treat until the FDA approved Herceptin in 1998, revolutionizing how this type of cancer was treated. " "It's producing very promising results, and as someone who sees a ton of patients, what I'm really excited about is the side effect profile," said Dr. Jennifer Litton, who treats breast cancer patients at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston but who was not involved in the study. This is the first group of (breast cancer) patients where we have to worry about fixing their hair for media interviews. "It really changed their whole outlook on what it meant to be on cancer treatment," said Blackwell, who treats patients at Duke University.
