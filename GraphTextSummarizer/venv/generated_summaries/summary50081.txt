If you combine those TV examples with the NCAA setting another record for football attendance last year, the money/incentive for the big boys to continue as bad boys regarding NCAA rules is outrageous. The Miami situation is so egregious that NCAA president Mark Emmert issued the following statement: "If the assertions are true, the conduct at the University of Miami is an illustration of the need for serious and fundamental change in many critical aspects of college sports." Now, there rarely is a month, week or day that passes without a big-time program in college football sprinting deep into scandal while daring the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) to tackle it. The University of Miami is just the latest team on the verge of drawing penalty flags from NCAA officials for unnecessary silliness. " Through it all, with NCAA enforcement people looking more powerless than Barney Fife from those old Andy Griffith sitcoms, there have been sordid tales involving automobiles, houses and even prostitutes.
