Suleman will handle the camera for much of the taping of her TV show, reducing the intrusion into her children's lives by television crews, Czech said. Suleman has said no to some opportunities to make money, Czech said. The advance money for the TV show deal will help Suleman pay her bills, Czech said. Jeffrey Czech also confirmed details of a "less-intrusive" reality show about Suleman and her 14 kids, although no U.S. network has been signed to carry it. Suleman was set to sign an agreement with a ghost writer for her book Monday, Czech said.
