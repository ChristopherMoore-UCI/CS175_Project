Lippestad said Breivik had told him that he was in touch with two terror cells in Norway and in contact with other cells abroad, but that he acted alone in carrying out the attack on Utoya and the Oslo bombing. He is being held in solitary confinement at Ila Prison, near Oslo, police said Wednesday. Meanwhile, police are using a mini-submarine and a specially equipped boat to continue to search waters around Utoya Island, they said Wednesday. Norway's security forces were aware of the danger of violent attacks and were prepared for them, he added. Police captured the man, who was not linked to Breivik, said police lawyer Per Thomas Omholt.
