While ads and visits are taking off on mobile devices, the company's latest big feature is still Web-only. For the first time, the number of active daily visitors checking Facebook on mobile devices is higher than the number of people checking the social network on the Web. The big story this quarter is mobile ads, which the company said accounted for 23% of its ad revenue, a huge leap from the third quarter of last year when it was just 14%. Facebook also makes some money off social games like Zynga's "FarmVille," which share revenue with the social network. Of those, 618 million of them are visiting daily and 157 million are doing it from mobile devices.
