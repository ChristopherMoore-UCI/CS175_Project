Having an arrest record or failing to complete high school were less consequential for white men than for African-American men: 84% of whites without a high school degree were employed at 22; among African Americans, just 40% were. It fits a broader pattern evident as far back as high school: About one-fifth of white men who grew up in disadvantaged families had after-school and summer jobs in these industries -- important experience that can help secure a full-time job -- while not a single African-American person did. But even without the benefit of a college degree, whites, and white men especially, had vastly better employment outcomes. Because white poverty is less expected, less recognized and less studied, we often exclude poor whites from our discussions. Indeed, throughout the course of our study, it was clear that African- Americans face greater barriers to employment.
