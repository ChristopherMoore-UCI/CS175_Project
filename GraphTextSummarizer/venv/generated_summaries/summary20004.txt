Body cameras have the potential not only to expose when cops break the rules, but they will also help expose laws that are unjust. A study commissioned by the Police Foundation in 2012, for example, found that cops with body cameras were involved in far fewer use of force incidents than cops without. Law enforcement, for their part, should not see body cameras as a threat, because they might well also show us that when cops have to make life or death decisions, they usually get it right. But that raises a point that is often lost when we are debating the actions of individual officers -- cops are not a gang of miscreants, waiting to murder and scheming to deny civil rights. "I think that 98% of the time, cameras help improve relationships with the community." We should also be careful not to draw too many conclusions about the ineffectiveness about video cameras simply because there was no indictment in New York.
