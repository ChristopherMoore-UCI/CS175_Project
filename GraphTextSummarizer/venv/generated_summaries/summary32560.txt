-- South Korea's actions toward Pyongyang after the death of the North Korean leader Kim Jong Il were intended to show that Seoul does not have animosity toward the North, President Lee Myung-bak of South Korea said in a meeting with political leaders Thursday. Lee told members of the governing and opposition parties that he believed North Korea had probably not expected South Korea to take such measures toward the North. It contrasted with Seoul's reaction to the death of North Korea's founder, Kim Il Sung, in 1994 when the conservative South Korean government at the time did not offer its condolences. North Korea delivered the message -- addressed to the chairwoman of Hyundai Group, Hyun Jeong-eun -- through the company's office in the North's Kaesong Industrial Park some 45 kilometers (27 miles) north of Seoul, said Roh Jee-hwan, a Hyundai spokesman. " Kwon said he believes that by extending sympathy to the people of North Korea, as opposed to North Korea as a country, the Lee administration has found its own compromise.
