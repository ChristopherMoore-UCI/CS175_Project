"Spamhaus will resolutely continue its mission to provide reliable protection against cyberthreats such as spam, malware and botnets and work with Internet service providers and organizations worldwide to create a safer Internet," the organization said in a statement. Last month's attack appears to be part of a fierce feud between organizations that monitor spam and try to block it and companies that accuse spam blockers of unjustly blacklisting them. Security experts said the attack used more sophisticated techniques than most distributed denial of service, or DDoS, attacks and targeted the Web's infrastructure, which led to other sites performing slowly. The arrest comes a month after Internet users around the globe faced slowed-down service during the prolonged denial-of-service assault on The Spamhaus Project, a European spam-fighting group. The Spamhaus Project is a nonprofit that patrols the Internet for spammers and publishes a list of Web servers those spammers use.
