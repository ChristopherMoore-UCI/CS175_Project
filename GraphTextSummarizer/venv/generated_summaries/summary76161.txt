But fans of present-day hits are more likely to recognize the wilds of post-apocalyptic Atlanta and "The Walking Dead's" fictional Woodbury than the whitewater rapids of northeast Georgia. Fans of the wildly popular AMC series "The Walking Dead" are making their way to Atlanta and surrounding small-town Georgia to sniff out traces of Rick Grimes' crew of survivors and the voracious zombies on their trail. UK-based Pinewood Studios recently opened a new facility, where Marvel's "Ant-Man" has started filming, and Atlanta mogul Tyler Perry is hoping to develop studio space at the shuttered Army base Fort McPherson. Just down the street from the tour office is the Nelson Street Bridge, where Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) rode on horseback over a tangle of railroad tracks to seek refuge in Atlanta in the first season. The "Big Zombie" tours ($65) are operated by Atlanta Movie Tours, which launched in 2012 with a single "Walking Dead"-themed tour.
