New software is designed to prevent printing blank pages from the Web, its inventor says. This printing pain in the neck happened to Hayden Hamilton so much that he invented a solution: GreenPrint, software that analyzes what a computer sends to a printer. GreenPrint also allows users to avoid printing altogether by saving documents as PDF files. "The average employee prints about 10,000 pages a year, and roughly 20 percent of that is waste," Hamilton said from his GreenPrint office in the Old Town section of Portland, Oregon. But now, GreenPrint is offering a free version of the software for non-business use, supported by advertising.
