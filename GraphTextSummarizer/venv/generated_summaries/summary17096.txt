-- Manager Arsene Wenger and midfielder Samir Nasri will both miss Arsenal's next Champions League match after opting not to appeal against one-match suspensions. Wenger was enraged by the Swiss official's decision to send off striker Robin van Persie for a second yellow card for kicking the ball away early in the second half. A statement on the club's official website read: "Arsenal have decided not to appeal against UEFA bans for Arsene Wenger and Samir Nasri. The pair were handed the bans by UEFA, while Wenger was also fined $14,00, for "inappropriate language" towards referee Massimo Busacca following the 3-1 defeat to Barcelona earlier this month. Van Persie was cautioned for taking a shot at goal, just one second after being blown for offside, with the Dutchman protesting that he had not heard the referee's whistle due to the noise of the 95,000 crowd at the Camp Nou stadium.
