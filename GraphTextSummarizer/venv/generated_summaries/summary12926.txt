On Friday, India summoned the Pakistan high commissioner "to convey our strong feelings about (the) Lakhvi verdict," said India's external affairs spokesman Syed Akbaruddin. In the attacks, heavily armed men stormed landmark buildings around Mumbai, including luxury hotels, the city's historic Victoria Terminus train station and a Jewish cultural center. "It is very disappointing that the accused of the Mumbai attacks has been granted bail," the nation's home minister, Rajnath Singh, said in December. Last year, the court granted Lakhvi bail, a decision the Pakistani government had said it would challenge. Pakistan's highest court Friday ordered the release of Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi, the alleged mastermind behind the Mumbai attacks, calling his detention illegal.
