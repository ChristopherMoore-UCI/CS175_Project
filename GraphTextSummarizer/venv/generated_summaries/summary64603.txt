-- While Florida Gov. Rick Scott and former Florida Gov. Charlie Crist took aim at each other during a bitter debate on Thursday night, viewers participated alongside the candidates, reacting in real-time using Microsoft Bing Pulse technology. But when Scott attacked Crist, calling him a "divider" and a "mudslinger," he only had a slight bump from his fellow Republicans. "If you're somebody like Rick Scott, and you have a private jet, and you fly 30,000 feet above people all the time, or you live in an oceanfront mansion, you're out of touch, and you're not feeling what people that are watching tonight are feeling at home," said Crist. Democrats and independents tended to stick relatively close together in their sentiment, strongly agreeing when Crist spoke and strongly disagreeing when Scott spoke. When Crist attacked Scott's personal fortune, Democrats and independents strongly agreed with him.
