By the 1930s, there were hundreds of Jews living in Zambia and the rise of the Nazis in Europe brought and a new wave of Jewish immigration. New arrivals formed a small community together with Jewish families who had immigrated to Northern Rhodesia in earlier years. He says of the early Jewish settlers: "The Jews arriving in Northern Rhodesia were both economic migrants and refugees, escaping from a kind of religious and political persecution in the Russian Empire, and also economic migrants looking for a place where they could make a better living. European Jews first came to Zambia at the end of the 19th century, when it was still Northern Rhodesia. In 1938 and 1939 around 300 German Jews fleeing Nazi persecution found their way to Northern Rhodesia, as did smaller numbers of Jews from Lithuania and Latvia.
