-- A U.S. Supreme Court ruling on Friday will enable a religious-affiliated non-profit and other groups like it to remain temporarily exempt from Obamacare requirements for covering birth control and other reproductive health they oppose on moral grounds. In a once-sentence order without any noted dissent, the Supreme Court said the Obama administration could not enforce the mandates if those involved tell the Health and Human Services Department in writing that they are a non-profit and hold themselves "out as religious and have religious objections to providing coverage for contraceptive services." Although the high court order applies specifically to the Little Sisters of the Poor and its administrator, Christian Brothers Services, it will likely have the practical effect of keeping the government from forcing other religious non-profits that raised similar objections to comply with the mandates. In March, they will take up a related challenge to the birth control mandate when the court hears arguments over whether some for-profit corporations should be exempt, again on religious liberty grounds. "This is a case about paperwork, not religious liberty," Richards said in a statement.
