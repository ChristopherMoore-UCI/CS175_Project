This wonderfully absurd theory doesn't stand up, according to CERN researchers, at least not since they observed cosmic rays with energies equal to and much higher than the LHC. "We have been working for many years to build up CERN's public profile," says Gillies, "seeing the LHC as a unique opportunity to raise the profile of science in general." It's arguably the fastest racetrack in the universe, able to create things like quark-gluon plasma and, if theory holds up, the Higgs boson, the so-called Holy Grail of particle physics. During the 1980s, American physicists looked with a fevered hope to a giant construction site in Texas, where the Department of Energy was building the Superconducting Supercollider, a particle accelerator intended to be the last word, for a few years at least, on particle physics research. He argues that CERN's proton collisions could generate dangerous miniature black holes.
