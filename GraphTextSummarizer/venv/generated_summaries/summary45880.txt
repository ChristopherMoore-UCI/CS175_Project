"Scottish businesses deserve the security and opportunities a United Kingdom brings," he said on Twitter. Scotland's First Minister and SNP leader Alec Salmond has been a vocal proponent of independence. -- Beatles star Paul McCartney became the latest high-profile figure to sign a letter calling on Scottish voters to choose to remain part of the United Kingdom in a vote on independence next month.
