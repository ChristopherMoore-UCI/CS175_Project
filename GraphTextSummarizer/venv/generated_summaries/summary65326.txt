But shortly before 5 p.m., authorities received another call about an active shooting at the residence, said Maj. Donnie Lowe of the Louisa County Sheriff's Office. "This was part of a property dispute," Virginia State Police spokeswoman Corinne Geller said Monday. -- A property dispute between family members apparently led to a shooting in which a man killed two people in the central Virginia town of Louisa before he was shot by police, authorities said. The man then directed his gunfire at police and released a pit bull terrier on them, authorities said. The incident began when deputies responded to a report of an argument at the home, police said.
