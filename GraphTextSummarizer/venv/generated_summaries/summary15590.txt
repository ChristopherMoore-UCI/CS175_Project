Boehner is known as a fiscal conservative who made spending reforms a key point of his campaign for House leadership. House Republican Leader John Boehner is poised to lead the House Republican agenda, which promises to cut spending, repeal parts of President Obama's health care program and push targeted tax cuts for small businesses, which they say will lead to job growth. "He will run that place not seen since the likes of [former Speaker of the House] Tip O'Neill." Boehner, who will likely be voted speaker by his party when Congress returns on November 15, twice during his speech said that despite a landslide Republican victory in the House, it was not a time for a victory lap. "To the extent he is willing to do this, we are ready to work with him." Boehner, the House Republican leader, watched much of last night's results with wife Debbie at the National Republican Congressional Committee's command center at Washington's Grand Hyatt Hotel, where he also started calling Republicans who won their races. Texas Republican Jeb Hensarling, a conservative who has bucked his leadership in the past as a former chairman of the conservative Republican Study Committee, is expected to run for the post.
