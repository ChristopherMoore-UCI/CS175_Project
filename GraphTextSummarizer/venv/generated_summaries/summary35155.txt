This is problematic because nonprofit hospitals are supposed to provide a certain level of charity care in exchange for their tax-exempt status. I'm not suggesting care should be given out freely or that hospitals should be forced to operate at a loss. What's important to remember is that you can't be refused emergency care. After all, it is a commonly held belief that no one can be denied care there. Let's start with the idea that emergency rooms must provide you care.
