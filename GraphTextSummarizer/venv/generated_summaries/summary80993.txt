Last month, China executed three it said had masterminded an October 2013 suicide car crash in Beijing's Tiananmen Square. The other three who stood trial were caught by police when they were trying to sneak out of the country a few days before the attack, the court said The train station attack shook the country and state media labeled it "China's 9/11."
