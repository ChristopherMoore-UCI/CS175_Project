Often called "the father of modern gospel music," Crouch  was inducted into the Gospel Music Association Hall of Fame in 1998 and his songs have been covered by artists as varied as Bob Dylan, Elton John, Barbara Mandrell, Paul Simon, Elvis Presley and Little Richard. While Crouch was well-known for his gospel work with his choir, the Disciples, he also produced and arranged songs for pop artists such as  Michael Jackson. "Crouch was an innovator, a path-finder, a precursor in an industry noted for its conservative, often derivative approach to popular music," Robert Darden wrote for Christianity Today. Crouch revolutionized gospel music in the 1970s, giving it a power and verve that propelled him out of the church and into the mainstream, although he really never left the church either. "He combined gospel and rock, flavored it with jazz and calypso as the mood struck him and the song called for it."
