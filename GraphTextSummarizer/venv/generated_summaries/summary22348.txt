In 2012: Two children killed in Afghanistan acid attack In 2012, Mukherjee decided to participate in the country's most popular game show -- the Indian edition of "Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?" She took part because she needed the money and she wanted the world to know her plight as a victim of an acid attack. " India passed a new law in April that punishes perpetrators of acid attacks with 10 years to life in prison, along with a fine. Mukherjee has appealed the court's decision but years on she's yet to get a date in court. On a hot summer day when Mukherjee was fast asleep on the roof of her house, the three men threw a jug of acid on her. She had no ears, no eyes, no eyelids, no nose, no lips, no scalp and no chest," said her doctor, BLK Hospital's Sanjeev Bagai.
