In addition to being mindful of common space, carve out individual space so you can have some time alone if you wish. The solution, Richey says: "Discuss a limit on sentimental items before hand, given there will probably be limited space. If you're a pack rat like Nguyen or Sotelo, negotiate space for what's most important to each of you. Assess space constraints, sort out what you want and what you need, and get rid of duplicate items. If one partner is financially supporting the other -- helping pay for graduate school, for instance -- there should be "no expectation of payback, no strings attached," says marriage therapist Richey.
