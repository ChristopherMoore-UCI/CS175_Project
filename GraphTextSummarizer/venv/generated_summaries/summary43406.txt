-- Rwanda will not pull its troops from U.N. peacekeeping missions despite a leaked draft report that accused Rwandan soldiers of genocide in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwandan President Paul Kagame told the U.N. secretary-general Sunday. In the 100-day genocide, militias made up of ethnic Hutus slaughtered ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus nationwide. Kagame complained to Ban about the leaks from the report, which alleges that the Rwandan military and an allied rebel group massacred ethnic Hutus in Congo between 1993 and 2003. Kagame first took power on 1994 after the genocide of 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus. The United Nations said that Ban "was very satisfied" after Sunday's meeting "to learn that Rwanda would continue its important role in U.N. peacekeeping operations, and particularly in the strife-torn western Sudanese region of Darfur."
