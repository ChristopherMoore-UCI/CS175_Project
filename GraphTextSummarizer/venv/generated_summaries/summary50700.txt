"My postdoctoral fellow Dr. Carrie Nugent brought to my attention the fact that although many asteroids have been named, very few have been named to honor the contributions of women (and particularly women of color)," Mainzer wrote in a note to Malala. After reading her story, scientist Amy Mainzer, who also consults for PBS on a children's educational science show, decided Malala deserved to be immortalized. Malala's asteroid circles the sun between Mars and Jupiter every five and half years, Mainzer said. But Malala recovered with no serious neurological damage to become a powerhouse for her cause. As a scientist, her support for Malala's work is logical.
