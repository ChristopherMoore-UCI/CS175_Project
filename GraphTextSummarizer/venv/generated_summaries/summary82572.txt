The Fourmile Canyon fire already had charred nearly 6,400 acres of countryside and destroyed 169 homes west of Boulder by mid-morning Thursday. -- Authorities in Boulder, Colorado, warned some residents to prepare to evacuate Thursday as winds gusting as high as 50 mph threatened to drive a raging wildfire out of the hills and into city limits. No evacuations have been ordered for city residents yet, but Boulder municipal spokeswoman Sarah Huntley said they should "think about the possibility of evacuating" and have clothing, important documents and needed medication ready to go if necessary. But while overcast skies and a bit of rain helped firefighters on Wednesday, the projected high winds raised new concerns Thursday. High winds that could whip the fire toward the city were expected to kick up Thursday evening and last throughout the night, forecasters predicted.
