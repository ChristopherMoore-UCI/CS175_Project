-- Former English Premier League referees have jumped to the defense of Howard Webb after criticism of his performance in Sunday's World Cup final. Webb, the first referee to officiate the European Champions League final and World Cup final in the same season, dished out 13 yellow cards and one red as Spain defeated the Netherlands 1-0 in a tempestuous clash at Soccer City, Johannesburg. " Winter, Webb's room-mate when he joined the Premier League circuit in 2003, has no sympathy for the Dutch. The official declined to dismiss Spain center-back Carles Puyol for a tug on Arjen Robben as he bore down on goal in the second half and failed to award a corner to the Dutch when a free-kick was deflected wide shortly before Spain's goal. Players from both sides flew into challenges from the first whistle and Dutch midfielder Nigel De Jong was fortunate to escape with only a yellow for a chest-high kick on Spain's Xabi Alonso.
