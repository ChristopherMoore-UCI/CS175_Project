To this day, U.S. citizens who reside in Puerto Rico, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands and other U.S. territories do not vote in presidential elections, but may vote in local elections. In some states, a voter could vote in primary elections only if his grandfather had been able to vote in primaries; other states only allowed whites to vote in the primaries. By the turn of the century, women were voting in many western states, but most states still banned them from the voting booth. As a result, most states still ban incarcerated felons from voting, and several states extend that ban to ex-felons. By 1972, most adult citizens of the U.S. had the right to vote based on provisions in the Constitution.
