AOL Autos: Aggressive car buying tactics â€¢ You can shop the lowest price around to other dealerships to see if any of them are willing to beat it. Then, if you'd like, you can visit (or call) the Fleet Departments of other dealerships to compare prices. It usually consists of only a handful of salespeople who specialize in selling fleets of cars -- large orders of several vehicles direct to businesses. In return, you'll receive - via e-mail - low bottom-line selling prices from dealerships in your area for the exact vehicle you want to buy. When you arrive at the dealership, the Fleet Manager will show you the vehicle, allow you to test drive it, and then bring you to the office to discuss price.
