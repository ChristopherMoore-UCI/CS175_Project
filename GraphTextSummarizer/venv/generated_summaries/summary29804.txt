"He was a great mountaineer, beyond all controversy, who was able to reinvent himself and succeed in public action," former French Foreign Minister Michel Barnier told French radio RTL. Maurice Herzog, a celebrated French mountaineer who was the first person to reach the top of an 8,000-meter peak, died early Friday in France, the French presidential palace announced. Under President Charles de Gaulle, Herzog became the French minister for youth and sport in 1958, and he served a mayor of Chamonix from 1966 to 1977. In his best-selling book "Annapurna," Herzog gives a painful account of the difficult descent, which cost him and Lachenal several fingers and toes due to frostbite. French President Francois Hollande issued a statement expressing his condolences to Herzog's family, and added that the climb was an "exploit that will remain in our collective memory."
