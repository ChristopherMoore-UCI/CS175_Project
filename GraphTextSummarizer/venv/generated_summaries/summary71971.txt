-- Coca Cola was born in Atlanta, Georgia, on May 8, 1886. And in South Africa, for every one job created by the Coca-Cola system, 16 jobs are created in the informal retail sector. More than 58,000 of those employees work for the company outside of the U.S. They are the largest private-sector employer across all of Africa. The company entered China in 1927 and its 100th country -- Sierra Leone -- in 1957. The company was placed in the top 25 places to work by Essence magazine and was named Wal-Mart's International Supplier of the Year in 2006.
