I remember vividly in 2001 the cases of Muslim foreigners deported for spurious reasons, such as mere accusations of having made anti-American statements, not even related to terrorism, in reported private conversations. France has had no murders but saw more anti-Muslim attacks -- ranging from insults to depredation of mosques -- in the rest of the country from January 7-20 than in all of France in 2014. But the French have long had a set of anti-terror laws that have been the envy of America's police and intelligence departments. Attacks by opposition politicians stating that the legal hurdles of France's "soft on crime" and "socialist" government -- which they claim prevented phone taps of the terrorists -- are a joke. The same must be true in France as the horror of January makes us look at the truth about our country.
