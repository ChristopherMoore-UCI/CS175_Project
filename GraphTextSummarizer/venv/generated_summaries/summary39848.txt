The officer fired two shots when the man charged at him, said Cedric Alexander, the public safety director of DeKalb County. DeKalb County police officers undergo some degree of training on how to deal with the mentally ill. "What I have requested here [is] a result of what's going on currently across this country as it relates to police shootings," Alexander told reporters. As fatal police shootings come under increased scrutiny in the current climate, police departments also appear to be more forthcoming in proactively releasing information for transparency's sake. The officer was white; the deceased man was African-American, Alexander said.
