-- Formula One legend Michael Schumacher has admitted his relief after visiting stricken Ferrari driver Felipe Massa in hospital. He told his personal Web site that he felt better after actually seeing Massa -- who is managed by Nicolas Todt, son of former Ferrari team boss Jean -- at Budapest's AEK hospital. He was knocked unconscious and his car hurtled into a tire barrier at 200kph in the final qualifying for Sunday's race which was won by Lewis Hamilton, who pipped Massa to the world title last season. Michael Schumacher will make a dramatic return to Formula One as a replacement for Felipe Massa. The 40-year-old had not previously had the time to visit Massa, last year's world championship runner-up, as he has been undergoing medical tests and getting up to speed for his eagerly-anticipated racing return by practicing in a 2007 Ferrari.
