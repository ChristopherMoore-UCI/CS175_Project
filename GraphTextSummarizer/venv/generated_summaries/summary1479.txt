As the White House convened a day-long summit on working families with a heavy focus on work-life balance, I remembered a major survey last year that took issue with the prevailing notion that juggling work and home life is mainly a woman's issue. After Marissa Mayer of Yahoo! banned working from home shortly after taking over as the company's chief executive officer, many women and men wondered if more companies might follow her lead and move in the direction of less flexibility as opposed to more. "The significance of the research is that it proves that the way we think and talk about work-life flexibility doesn't track with reality," said Cali Yost, chief executive officer and founder of Flex+Strategy Group/Work+Life Fit Inc. "As a result, both business and people aren't reaping the rewards of a more thoughtful, deliberate, strategic approach to managing work and life. It can also provide more opportunities for working parents, especially mothers who would choose to continue their professional paths if they and their partners had more flexibility to balance the demands at home. According to a survey by the Pew Research Center, 56% of working mothers said it was very or somewhat difficult to balance the responsibilities of their jobs and their families; 50% of working fathers, nearly as many as working mothers, said the very same thing.
