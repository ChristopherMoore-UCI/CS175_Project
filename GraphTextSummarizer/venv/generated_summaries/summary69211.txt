He later added, while addressing Tyson, "There's no denying the fact that Mike Tyson had the hardest hitting right hook in history -- your opponents spent more time bleeding in the corner than Charlie's ex-wives." Comedians Seth MacFarlane, Jon Lovitz, Jeffrey Ross and Mike Tyson (?), among others, were all on-hand for Sheen's sometimes brutal Comedy Central roast, which aired shortly after his character's mock funeral on Two and a Half Men (poetic timing much?). From getting fired from his gig on "Two and a Half Men" to flooding Twitter with non-sensical ramblings (#winning anyone?), and most recently, appearing on the Emmys to wish his old co-stars good luck, he's had his share of ups and downs. The comedian also singled out Sheen's ex-wife Brooke Mueller (who was in the audience), in an especially touchy bit alluding to the actor's previous domestic violence charges. "[Brooke Mueller] is not very bright unless Charlie throws a lamp at her," Ross said.
