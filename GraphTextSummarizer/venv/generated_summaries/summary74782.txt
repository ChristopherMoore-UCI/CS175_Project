It's also because it's bristling with communications gear, including radios, automatic beacons, GPS and computer communications systems, according to CNN aviation correspondent Richard Quest. Asked to detail the communications devices aboard the missing jet, Boeing spokesman Doug Alder said, "It's not appropriate for us to discuss that right now." Still, there is precedent for a modern jetliner to fall from the sky while "in the cruise" and lay hidden for months, Quest said. "The occurrence of the failure in the context of flight in cruise completely surprised the crew of flight AF 447," the report said. On June 1, 2009, Air France flight 447 was en route from Rio De Janeiro to Paris' Charles de Gaulle International Airport when communications ended suddenly from the Airbus A330, another state-of-the-art aircraft. "If anything fails, it will send a signal to Malaysia Airlines," Quest said.
