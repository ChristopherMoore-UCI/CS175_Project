"The car and the child have been recovered," said Lt. Ronnie Armstead, a spokesman for the Richmond Police Department. Police have issued an arrest warrant for Jamal Clemons, 27, on suspicion of abduction, robbery, robbery with a firearm, using a firearm in the commission of a felony and a felon being in possession of a firearm, Armstead said. -- A 2-year-old boy who authorities say was abducted by a stranger Saturday following a home invasion robbery that ended in a double homicide has been found, police in Virginia said. Authorities have put together the events of the alleged home invasion and shooting through the statements of a witness who was inside the house at the time of the shooting, Armstead said. The suspect has no relation to the child, Armstead said.
