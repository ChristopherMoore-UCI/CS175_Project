Iranian President Hassan Rouhani acknowledged the meeting between him and British Prime Minister David Cameron with a tweet -- picture included -- from the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York. -- Leaders from Britain and Iran met Wednesday for the first time in 35 years, a potential breakthrough conversation that occurs at a time when Tehran is trying to shed Western-led sanctions over its nuclear program and Western nations are trying to garner international support for their campaign against ISIS. How is that they were not categorised as #terrorists then?" Saying that his country never "had doubts or delays in countering #ISIS," Rouhani tweeted, "Why is it that #ISIS went from not-so-bad to extremely-bad depending on who they had targeted in their #terrorist operations?" Notwithstanding such criticism and the fact he didn't meet with Obama in New York, Rouhani didn't close the door to major changes in his nation's relationship with its longstanding, often bitter rival, the United States. " Then again, Cameron added, "Iran's leaders could help in defeating the threat from ISIL," using a commonly used acronym for ISIS, which calls itself the Islamic State. Iran has been one of the biggest allies of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, the man who U.S. President Barack Obama and other Western leaders have publicly said they want out of power -- even going so far as to support moderate opposition elements fighting to oust him.
