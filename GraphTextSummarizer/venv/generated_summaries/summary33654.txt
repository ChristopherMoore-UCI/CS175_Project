The case has spurred protests across Mexico, and the governor of Guerrero state -- criticized for not acting quickly enough after the abductions -- has taken a leave of absence. Iguala Mayor Jose Luis Abarca and his wife, Maria de los Angeles Pineda -- dubbed "the imperial couple" by local media for how they presided over their southern Mexican city -- were detained early Tuesday morning at a house they had rented in Mexico City's Iztapalapa neighborhood. Rogelio Ortega, the academic tapped to take over for Gov.  Angel Aguirre, told CNN en Español last month that Guerrero state faces a tough road in light of the alleged corruption and kidnappings. On September 26, they traveled on buses and vans to nearby Iguala for a protest. The couple had been staying in a house that appeared to be abandoned, and investigators first got suspicious when they saw a woman repeatedly entering and leaving the building, Mexican Attorney General Jesús Murillo Karam told reporters.
