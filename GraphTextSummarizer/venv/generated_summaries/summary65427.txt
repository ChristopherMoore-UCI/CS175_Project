Kenya marked the signing Friday of a new constitution expected to usher in major change, though the celebration swirled with controversy when Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir, wanted for war crimes, joined the ranks of African leaders in attendance. Al-Bashir was invited to the celebrations in Nairobi by the Kenyan foreign ministry in his capacity "as the head of a friendly, neighboring country," said the spokesman for Prime Minister Raili Odinga. He also said that he had not spoken to Odinga but described the situation that developed as "impossible." Asked about Kenya's obligations to the international court to arrest al-Bashir, the spokesman said he did not think the Sudanese leader would be arrested on Kenyan soil. Debates over a new Kenyan constitution had spanned two decades, but intensified after postelection violence left more than 1,000 dead in 2008. Al-Bashir is wanted by the International Criminal Court in The Hague, Netherlands, on allegations of war crimes and genocide in western Sudan's Darfur region, where violence that erupted in 2003 has left at least 300,000 people dead.
