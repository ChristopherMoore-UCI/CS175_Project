The ad, which comes weeks before voters will decide the fate of incumbent Rep. Lee Terry, slams Democrat Brad Ashford for supporting a "good time" law that released convicted robber Nikko Jenkins from prison after he served half his sentence. "Nebraska voters deserve to know that Brad Ashford supports policies that have made them less safe. " Jenkins is black, and the ad drew immediate comparisons to the 1988 Willie Horton attack ad, which overtly tied Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis to the crimes convicted murderer Willie Horton committed while on weekend furlough under Dukakis' governorship. "Still, the ad reflects the issues of this campaign, one of which is why does Brad Ashford still support the good time law?" The NRCC expects to spend about $1 million in the contentious Nebraska race. "This repellent, race-baiting ad has no place in America," Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spokeswoman Ashley Lewis said.
