The transformer exploded after road salt swept into the air gradually corroded power lines, Mayo said. The lights were back on at Cleveland, Ohio's largest airport Sunday afternoon after a transformer explosion cut power at terminals for more than seven hours, an airport spokeswoman told CNN. "I think they were anticipating the lights would pop on any minute, but a couple of hours in they were resigned to the fact that they weren't going to come on for a while," Mayo said.
