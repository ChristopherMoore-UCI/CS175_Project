Armaan Jaffer, the nephew of former India international batsman Wasim Jaffer, hit the highest score ever made by a schoolboy in a local under-14 competition on Wednesday. It was only three runs short of the alltime first-class record set by West Indies star Brian Lara in 1994. " Like millions of young cricket hopefuls in India, there is one man who Jaffer hopes to emulate when he is older. Jaffer and his teammates talk about his feat on YouTube His uncle Wasim had previously broken the same record, but Jaffer insisted beating the landmark figure never crossed his mind and he thanked his coach Raju Pathak for his guidance during the innings. -- A 13-year-old Indian boy has batted his way into cricket history with a record-breaking innings of 498 in a school tournament in Mumbai, India.
