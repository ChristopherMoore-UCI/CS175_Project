Doctors in the province first began seeing cases of alcohol poisoning last Tuesday, Ecuador's government said. The liquor was sold in unlabeled bottles, with no indication of its contents or where it originated, Los Rios Gov. Jesus Narvaez told CNN affiliate Ecuavisa. The 21 patients who died all haled from Los Rios, but similar poisoning cases have also been reported in at least four other areas, the government said. Hospitals treated more than 100 people who fell ill after drinking bootleg liquor over the past week, the country's government said, and at least 21 people died as a result of apparent poisoning. Officials announced the 72-hour national dry law Sunday  after detecting alcohol poisoning cases in several parts of the  country.
