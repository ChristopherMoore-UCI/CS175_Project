Students strive to make themselves extremely attractive to specific colleges, and colleges work hard to make themselves more appealing to specific students. Ironically, we know from a survey of human resource managers (these are the people who actually hire college graduates) that the colleges they recruit from most enthusiastically are not necessarily the same as the ones U.S. News implies students should strive to enter. The annual report of national college rankings published by U.S. News & World Report is, regrettably, one of the most powerful forces in American higher education. And it should not be surprising to learn that schools also game the system by slicing and dicing their numbers in a fashion that makes them appear more appealing in one or more U.S. News category, and thus more attractive to potential students and their families. U.S. News & World Report has been highly successful at inducing far too many high school students and their families to think that there are only a handful of colleges worth attending in the entire country, and by extension saying that if a student doesn't get into one of the 'select' few, then life will never be worth living.
