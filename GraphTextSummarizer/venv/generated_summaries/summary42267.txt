While not necessarily performance enhancing, diuretics can be used as a masking agent for steroids. However, one of Jamaica's most decorated athletes must now wait to see if the IAAF, track and field's world governing body, agrees with the recommendation made by the Jamaica Athletics Administrative Association (JAAA). Garth Gayle, general secretary of the JAAA, confirmed to CNN Thursday that it recommended Campbell-Brown receive a warning following her positive test for a banned diuretic in May.
