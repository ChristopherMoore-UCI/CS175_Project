Wearing street clothes, Rangers Carlos Lopez, 30, and David Ray White, 28, and Army medic Stefan Andre Champagne, 28, appeared in federal court Friday. -- Four active-duty U.S. soldiers -- three of them elite Army Rangers -- have been arrested and charged with planning to rob drug traffickers. "These men were trained to defend the people and principles of this country, not to use their skills to steal cocaine from drug dealers at gunpoint. All four were to get a cut of the spoils of the robbery, the affidavit from ATF Agent Brett Turner says. They're charged with conspiracy to possess and distribute cocaine and with carrying firearms in connection with that conspiracy.
