On Tuesday, Biden told reporters the United States "shared responsibility" but also noted that Central American countries must work to stop drug production. -- U.S. Vice President Joe Biden vowed Tuesday to help Honduras and other Central American nations defeat drug traffickers and fight corruption. On Tuesday night, Honduran President Porfirio Lobo said Central American leaders meeting in Tegucigalpa "listened with attention and interest to the proposal of the president of Guatemala about the search for alternative mechanisms for the fight against drug trafficking" and would debate the issue at a meeting in Guatemala on March 24. Lobo and other Central American leaders have repeatedly argued that drug use in the United States fuels escalating violence throughout the region. But at a meeting with Central American presidents in Honduras, Biden stopped short of supporting a proposal that has gained growing attention in the region in recent weeks: drug legalization.
