" Two suicide truck bombers exploded almost simultaneously at a police station and a school in al-Qubba -- a predominantly Shiite Turkmen area in the northern outskirts of Mosul -- Sunday morning, Mosul police officials told CNN. In the al-Baya neighborhood of southwestern Baghdad, a makeshift bomb exploded Saturday evening inside a coffee shop, killing two people and wounding 10 others, Baghdad police told CNN. The explosion killed at least seven people and wounded 30 others, Baghdad police told CNN. Also Saturday, at least two Iraqi security forces were killed and three others were wounded when gunmen attacked a security checkpoint south of Falluja, a predominantly Sunni city about 60 kilometers (38 miles) west of Baghdad in Anbar province, police in Ramadi told CNN. "In the aftermath of yet another series of bloody attacks that indiscriminately hit pilgrims, school children, journalists, as well as ordinary citizens trying to go about their daily lives, the Special Representative of the United Nations Secretary-General for Iraq, Mr. Nickolay Mladenov called on political, religious and civil leaders to work together with the security forces and take joint action to halt the accelerated surge in violence and bloodshed," the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq said in a statement Sunday.
