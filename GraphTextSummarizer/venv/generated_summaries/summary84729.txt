For each of the next seven months, we are going to roam the American countryside in the CNN Express bus asking people, communities and businesses how they're finding ways to succeed despite the hard times we are all facing. We'll also spend a lot time just traveling around and listening to ordinary citizens: blue-collar laborers and white-collar business folk; farmers and field hands; musicians, housewives, students and more. The simple truth is, the real secret to any hope we have for a recovery lies out there, not inside the Beltway in D.C. It rests with all sort of normal people who, despite the downturn, have never stopped "Building Up America" and have a lot of lessons to share with all the rest of us. In the Lone Star State, we found people with big smiles, determination, enormous pride in their home and their country. One thing I know already from a lifetime of traveling over and over again to all 50 states: America is filled with independent, hard-working, innovative souls who find ways to succeed even when success seems unreachable.
