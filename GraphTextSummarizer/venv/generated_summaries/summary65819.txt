The trade of five Taliban members at Guantanamo to free Bergdahl, the last remaining American captive in the Afghanistan war, ignored congressional restrictions President Barack Obama signed in the annual defense policy law that require him to notify Congress 30 days before transferring prisoners. To that end, the Justice Department in recent weeks issued a legal opinion saying that Guantanamo detainees transferred to the United States for trial or indefinite detention under the laws of war don't have rights under immigration law to be released on U.S. soil. The Senate version would allow transfers of Guantanamo prisoners to the United States on the condition that the administration first submits a closure plan and Congress has a chance to disapprove. President Barack Obama appeared to have his most promising window yet in the coming months to keep his promise to close the military-run prison at Guantanamo Bay. "Our policy on Guantanamo Bay is the same now as it was prior to Sergeant Bergdahl's recovery -- the United States will repatriate, resettle, or prosecute detainees at Guantanamo Bay to the greatest extent possible, consistent with U.S. national security interests and our humane treatment policy," she said.
