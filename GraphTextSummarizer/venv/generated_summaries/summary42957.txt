I take umbrage with the fact that, even though this doll is backed by an awesome group of diverse women â€” aimed at providing positive representation â€” Barbie still represents this problematic view of women." She also comes with a marketing back story in which Mattel partnered with eight real-life female entrepreneurs to serve as "chief inspiration officers." "Having positive role models for dolls that are inspiring young girls to be entrepreneurs is exactly what we need to inspire a generation of young women to start running businesses," Reshma Saujani, founder of Girls Who Code, said in an interview with TechCrunch. Barbie caused a stir in February when Mattel and Sports Illustrated revealed that she would appear in the 50th anniversary edition of its annual swimsuit edition. Mattel stood by Barbie's "unapologetic" stance, and continues to use the #unapologetic hashtag in its social media campaigns for Entrepreneur Barbie. Mattel says it hopes to inspire a generation of female entrepreneurs with Entrepreneur Barbie, which went on sale Thursday on Amazon.
