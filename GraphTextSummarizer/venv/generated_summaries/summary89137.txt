"When we release our S5 device, you can also expect a Gear successor with more advanced functions, and the bulky design will also be improved." Speaking at the International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Lee wouldn't say whether the eye scanner -- presumably an effort to one-up Apple's iPhone 5S with its fingerprint security feature -- is a sure thing. An executive for the Korean tech giant confirmed to Bloomberg that the phone will hit stores this year on roughly the same time table as previous iterations of the device, which has emerged as the chief rival to Apple's iPhone. Released in September, Galaxy Gear helped push the growing wearable tech trend forward but, like some other smartwatches, met with mixed reviews. Lee Young Hee, executive vice president for Samsung's mobile business, also told the news service that a new version of the company's Galaxy Gear smartwatch will be released at the same time as the new phone. "We've been announcing our first flagship model in the first half of each year, around March and April, and we are still targeting for release around that time," Lee said.
