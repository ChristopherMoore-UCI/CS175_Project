Chinese world heritage sites in Lijiang in the neighboring province of Yunnan and Pingyao in northern Shanxi province have seen locals move out and karaoke bars move in. At a meeting in Dali's schoolhouse, village elders, some wearing the faded Mao suits of China's past, welcome the early plans for the village's future -- a wider road, a commercial area for hotels and a museum, plus upgrades to their homes. Balance It's no easy task to balance a desire for economic development and heritage preservation, says Han Li, China director of the Global Heritage Fund, a U.S. NGO. In January, the village, along with 20 others in the region, was added to a list of sites that China's leaders believe should qualify for world heritage status -- a step that could put the tiny settlement on a par with The Great Wall or Egypt's pyramids and transform it from a sleepy backwater to a tourist magnet. Tourism costs Despite their enthusiasm, few of the villagers grasp what attaining world heritage status might involve given the advent of mass tourism in China.
