All three face charges that include joint assembling of explosive devices, joint possession of explosive devices without permits and causing an explosion injuring other persons. The Thai police are seeking more suspects in connection with the series of bombs that went off in Bangkok last week as they try to piece together the facts in a murky affair that has fueled accusations between Israel and Iran. The Bangkok blasts went off a day after a device attached to an Israeli Embassy van in New Delhi exploded, wounding several people. A court on Monday issued an arrest warrant for Norouzi Shayan Ali Akbar, a 57-year-old Iranian man, on charges of possession and assembly of explosive devices. Moradi also faces charges of attempted killing of state officials on duty and the intentional attempted killing of other persons.
