"This kind of sidewalk is not a fundamental solution and could be an indulgence for mobile phone addicts in the long run, in my mind -- and this could even lead to more problems in the future," Xing Xing told the China Daily. The sidewalk is in the city of Chongqing in southwestern China. It is estimated that the number of smartphone users in China will exceed 500 million this year, the paper said. One Chinese city thinks it has the answer: It has divided a sidewalk on one of its busiest streets into two lanes -- one for cellphone users and the other for those without. Long Cheng, a spokesperson for the developer that came up with the idea, said that the sidewalk lanes reminded tourists not to walk while playing with their cellphones.
