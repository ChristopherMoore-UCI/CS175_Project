-- The family of an American citizen who was detained for several months in North Korea said Saturday it was ecstatic over news of his release and thanked the U.S. and North Korean governments for the roles they played in it. Jun, a Korean-American businessman, was detained for "committing a crime" against North Korea after entering the country, KCNA had reported. That same month, it detained Jun. Two State Department officials, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to release details, told CNN in April that Jun was a Korean-American businessman who had a visa to enter North Korea. The news agency also said former U.S. President Jimmy Carter asked North Korea to pardon Jun. "Taking all this into account, the ... government decided to set him free from the humanitarian" standpoint, KCNA said. In November, North Korea shelled Yeonpyeong Island, killing two South Korean marines and two civilians.
