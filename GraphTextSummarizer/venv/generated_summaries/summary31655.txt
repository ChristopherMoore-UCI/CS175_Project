Zynga games like "FarmVille" led the way for games that are free to download and play but then require players to pay small fees for in-game upgrades or premium content. -- Apple has settled a lawsuit filed by parents who say their kids downloaded free games from the mobile App Store and then proceeded to rack up hefty bills buying in-game extras. The settlement notes that Apple offers paid content on free games that are rated appropriate for children older than 4, 9 and 12 in its App Store. The lawsuit came after media reports of several cases in which kids' in-game purchases led to parental sticker shock. In 2011, Apple revised its in-app purchasing policy, requiring users to re-enter their account password before paying for enhancements within games.
