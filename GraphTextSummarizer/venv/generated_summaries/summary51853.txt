"We want to let voters, the national media and also Democrats know that this is a red state and we're not going to give an inch." Democrats aren't rolling over to let Republicans catch up, though, and the DNC's Vice Chair of Voter Registration and Participation Donna Brazile said the Democratic turnout operation has been operating in every state that has early voting. The focus on early voting in Iowa came this summer when the governor's campaign pushed the state party to make early voter mobilization a priority. In Iowa, where residents have been voting for the last two weeks, Republicans are already starting to close the gap with Democrats after investing more than $1 million to mobilize early voters. In key battleground states like Georgia, where early voting begins Monday, Republican operations are pouring more resources than ever into get-out-the-vote efforts ahead of Election Day. And while both parties have gotten their voters to submit more ballots than in 2010 so far, early Republican votes have more than doubled from 2010 while Democrats have only posted a 36% bump.
