-- Spanish football club Real Madrid completed the signing of Gareth Bale from English Premier League side Tottenham Hotspur Sunday, to end weeks of speculation over one of the off-season's most anticipated transfer deals. Real, then managed by Jose Mourinho, had to play second fiddle in La Liga last season to Barcelona and were beaten in the semifinals of the Champions League by Borussia Dortmund. " Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy said the club had no intention of selling Bale but the "attention" from Real Madrid and the player's own wishes ultimately took precedence. "Such has been the attention from Real Madrid and so great is Gareth's desire to join them, that we have taken the view that the player will not be sufficiently committed to our campaign in the current season," Levy told Tottenham's website. " "I am not sure there is ever a good time to leave a club where I felt settled and was playing the best football of my career to date," Bale told Tottenham's website.
