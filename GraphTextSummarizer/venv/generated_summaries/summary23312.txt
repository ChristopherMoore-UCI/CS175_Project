The White House menu Thursday featured traditional Thanksgiving fare, including turkey, ham, two kinds of stuffing, sweet potatoes, mashed potatoes and pumpkin pie, along with macaroni and cheese, greens and five other kinds of pie. President Obama wished the nation a happy Thanksgiving on Thursday and also used his weekly address to renew his call for bipartisan cooperation on addressing major issues facing the nation. Obama called for Americans to think about those less fortunate and saluted the "countless" Americans serving their country and communities, from soldiers on guard around the world to volunteers at local soup kitchens and food pantries. The day before, the first family spent an hour handing out Thanksgiving dinner packages to people at Martha's Table, a local aid organization. In the remarks usually delivered on a Saturday, Obama said the first family will have the same kind of holiday experienced by millions of Americans -- filled with friends and relatives, good food and football.
