-- International envoy Kofi Annan said Tuesday he sees Iran as a factor in diplomatic efforts to forge peace in Syria, a stance not shared by the United States. " Peace moves have failed to get off the ground at the United Nations and among Western and Arab nations, despite world outrage over Syria's brutal crackdown on anti-government demonstrations. The opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria recorded at least 68 deaths Tuesday. But the diplomatic wranglings, such as Annan's recent Action Group meeting in Geneva and the U.S. and Arab-backed Friends of Syria initiative, have failed to stop the killings of thousands since March 2011. The U.N. and Arab League special envoy to Syria, Annan is visiting leaders in the region to find ways to implement his six-point peace plan, an initiative that has yet to gain traction.
