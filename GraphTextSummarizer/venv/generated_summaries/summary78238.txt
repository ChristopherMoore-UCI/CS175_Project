" African elephant slaughter highest in more than two decades Gabriel said the Chinese government has done a "great job" in banning online trade of ivory products, ordering online shopping sites to remove such items and closing ivory trade websites. Thailand is also a good market for the criminal gangs that traffic the ivory because it is a popular tourist destination with weak laws governing the sale of ivory products and lax policing, according to Huijbregts. "With the price of ivory skyrocketing over the past few years, it becomes a very lucrative business for local people," Huijbregts said. The chief reason for the deteriorating situation today is the rising demand in Asia and the weak law enforcement against poachers and illegal ivory traders in central African countries like the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic, Huijbregts said. The numbers available are stark: The poaching of elephants is the most intense it has been in a decade, and the number of documented ivory seizures has reached its highest level since 1989, a group of agencies that monitor elephant populations and the ivory trade said in June.
