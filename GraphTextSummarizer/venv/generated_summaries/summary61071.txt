Eight passengers aboard a Cathay Pacific plane were injured last year after an Airbus A330 with engine problems made an emergency landing in Hong Kong. It was the second time one of the Hong Kong-based airline's Airbus A330 planes has made an emergency landing. Less than a month later, an Airbus A330 plane operated by Afriquayah Airways crashed just before landing in Tripoli, Libya, killing all but one of the 104 passengers on board. The photographer, Beawiharta, who uses only one name, told the news agency that his 15-year-old son spotted flames out the window of the twin-engine Airbus A330, which was on the way to Jakarta, Indonesia, but turned back after the engine problems began. Cathay Pacific and Rolls Royce, the maker of the engine, have launched an investigation into the incident, which has been reported to the Hong Kong Civil Aviation Department, the airline said.
