-- Little Gabriel Johnson was 8-months-old when he was last spotted alive at a Texas motel in late 2009. On December 17, 2009, a judge awarded Johnson and Logan McQueary, the boy's father, joint custody of Gabriel. McQueary didn't hear from Johnson until several days later, when she reportedly sent him a text message saying she'd killed Gabriel and put his body in a Dumpster. Jury selection begins Wednesday in the trial of Gabriel's mother, Elizabeth Johnson, who is charged with kidnapping, custodial interference and child abuse in the case. This May, Smith was found guilty of forgery and conspiracy to interfere with Gabriel's custody.
