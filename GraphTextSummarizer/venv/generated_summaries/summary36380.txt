"Despite simple, best-practice guidelines, which have been updated three times since the initial international conference on concussions, FIFA has failed to enact the policies and rules needed to protect soccer players," he said in a statement sent to CNN by his firm Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP. The lawsuit, filed in California, claims FIFA guidelines appear to suggest it is referees and players who diagnose brain injuries and not medical professionals. In 2013, the NFL struck a deal worth $765 million to fund medical exams, concussion-related compensation, medical research for retired NFL players and their families, as well as litigation expenses. This led to a significant decrease in such incidents and head injuries. "FIFA has always assigned high priority to the topic of prevention and treatment of head injuries," it read.
