The best places to photograph Corfu are ... Metallinos: To capture the old town of Corfu in the photograph, the best angle is from Kontokali Bay, about seven kilometers northwest of Corfu town. Other beautiful places with a nice dark sky include Chalikounas Beach (Lake Korission) in southwest Corfu and near Aggelokastro Castle just above Palaiokastritsa Bay. Metallinos: Corfu's night sky is not perfect but we still enjoy dark skies and see lot of celestial objects within the city walls of the Old Town of Corfu -- a UNESCO World Heritage Site -- next to our monuments. Vasilis Metallinos: This is my fifth time-lapse video so far and it was inspired by my love for Corfu island, my birthplace -- its long and rich history, breathtaking landscapes and my passion for the night sky. The first Astronomical Society of Greece was founded in Corfu in [1927] by French astronomer Felix Lamech.
