Cynthia Ramirez of the Bastrop County Sheriff's Office said the department could not comment because of the pending litigation, but a court document from the county's attorneys alleged that Nino de Rivera "failed to comply with the lawful orders of Deputy McMillan and therefore Deputy McMillan used the reasonable amount of necessary force to maintain and control discipline at the school. Noe Nino de Rivera was transported to the hospital on November 20 after Bastrop County Sheriff's Deputy Randy McMillan, serving as a school resource officer, used the device on him after the teen tried to defuse a school fight involving two girls, one of them his girlfriend, said attorney Adam Loewy. When they did, Nino de Rivera was taken to a local hospital and later airlifted to St. David's Medical Center in nearby Austin, where he "underwent surgery to repair a severe brain hemorrhage and was placed in a medically induced coma," court documents say. The letter to the Texas Commission on Law Enforcement cites more than a dozen media reports on officers who used Tasers or pepper spray on students, and Fowler cited high-profile cases in Wake County, North Carolina, and Syracuse, New York, but said she suspects such media reports are "just the tip of the iceberg. The parents have filed a lawsuit alleging their son never posed a threat to the deputy and that Nino de Rivera suffered a permanent brain injury when he hit the ground after McMillan tased the teen.
