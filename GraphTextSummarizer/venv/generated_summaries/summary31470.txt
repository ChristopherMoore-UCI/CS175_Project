Memo warned of high security risk at health care website An internal government memo obtained by CNN on Wednesday that was written days before the website launched warned of a "high" security risk because of a lack of testing. Sebelius promised a "vast majority" of consumers will have an easier time shopping online for health insurance under Obamacare by the end of November. Security questions Republican Rep. Mike Rogers of Michigan, who chairs the House Intelligence Committee, accused Sebelius of putting the private information of Americans at risk by failing to properly test security measures on the website. Sebelius said the sweeping health care program has delivered on its promise to provide affordable health care coverage. "In these early weeks, access to HealthCare.gov has been a miserably frustrating experience for way too many Americans, including many who have waited years, in some cases their entire lives, for the security of health insurance," Sebelius said.
