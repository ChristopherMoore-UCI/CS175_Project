-- Omar Suleiman, whom former President Hosni Mubarak had appointed vice president shortly before his exit, announced Friday that he plans to enter the race to become Egypt's next president. Leading opposition figure Mohamed ElBaradei has said that Suleiman and Mubarak are "twins." "His loyalty to Mubarak seems rock solid," a former U.S. ambassador wrote in 2007 in a classified U.S. diplomatic cable leaked to the website WikiLeaks. " Suleiman is no stranger to the Egyptian government, and has been closely tied to Mubarak -- the man whose resignation, under intense pressure, spurred the political upheaval that led to, among other things, this election. More than 450 people have entered the race -- including Muslim Brotherhood candidate Khairat al-Shater; former Egyptian Foreign Minister and Arab League Secretary-General Amre Moussa; and Ayman Nour, an opposition leader jailed by Mubarak who was recently pardoned. The former head of Egyptian intelligence recently said he did not plan to seek the presidency in the first election for the post since the revolution that led to Mubarak's exit.
