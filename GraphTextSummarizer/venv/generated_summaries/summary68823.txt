We need to try and change the language used to discuss climate change, from all about burden sharing, to opportunity sharing. But I think the real point is this: over the last 15 years it has always been the Annex 1 countries, the rich countries, that have been the bad guys blocking agreements; countries like the United States, Australia, Canada and Japan have all been seen as obstacles to progress. The politics look so difficult at the moment because the interests of different countries aren't really aligned, but that's a job for political leaders. I also think it's important to keep developing countries and small island states as low carbon emitters, and make sure that the low-emission path is one that brings them prosperity. The point is that all countries have to move towards peaking their emissions and the U.S. is at the table to do that and we need other countries to behave likewise.
