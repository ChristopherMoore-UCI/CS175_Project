It's not only workers without the right papers who suffer; when employers can get away with exploitation, the whole workforce suffers and deplorable conditions ripple through the entire labor market. International Workers' Day, or May Day, started in 1887 as a day for workers to press their demands for an eight-hour work day. The American Friends Service Committee sees that as a reasonable desire, consistent with a belief that all work should confer dignity on workers, employers, and consumers. This would enable workers to stand up for their rights without fear of deportation simply for being an unauthorized worker. About 8 million of the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S are workers.
