Swann's intention is that the introduction of the ABC syringe should be accompanied by a public information campaign so that patients would also associate a red syringe with danger and would be able to insist on sterile equipment. His design for a new kind of syringe that changes color after it has been used was nominated for an INDEX: Award. "In addition to being cost-effective, which will ensure the accessibility of the solution, it also allows patients to take charge of a critical issue â€” great example of empowerment through smart design." "It accounts for over 30% of hepatitis A and B cases and 5% of HIV cases." According to Swann's calculations, if the ABC syringe is used for 5% of injections administered in India, after five years it will have prevented more than 700,000 infections and saved $130 million in medical costs.
