" World number one Westwood fared better on day two, posting a score of 69 to move to one-under, while Masters champion Charl Schwartzel missed the cut in spectacular style -- finishing on 12-over. It was a great day, it's big fun. -- Teenage sensation Matteo Manassero and Spaniard Alvaro Quiros joined world number two Luke Donald at the top of the leaderboard after the second day of the BMW PGA Championship. " Manassero couldn't match the standards he set on Thursday, but said he had been inspired by the crowd of over 25,000 that helped to pay tribute to Ballesteros -- one of the sport's biggest characters. Spaniard Jose Manuel Lara, Thomas Aiken, from South Africa, and England's David Horsey all sit two shots off the lead on four-under.
