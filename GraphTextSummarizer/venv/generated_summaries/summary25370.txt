Built in 1962, before Tokyo's last Olympics, the hotel is a masterpiece of Japanese aesthetics and modernist design that's remained largely untouched over more than five decades. If you've never been to Tokyo's Hotel Okura, you're missing out on one of the true accommodation stars of Asia -- a beautiful time capsule of a hotel that glorifies the design and service of Japan in the 1960s. Hotel Okura Tokyo, 2-10-4 Toranomon, Minato-ku, Tokyo; +81 (0)3 3582 0111; rooms from Â¥23,500 ($230) Sending the most petite lady on staff to deliver 100 kilos of camera equipment to my room isn't a great display of hotel management. The folks at Monocle magazine have started a petition to save the old Okura.
