Former Obama campaign manager David Plouffe tweeted that it "takes guts" for Christie to back the rival Cowboys when he's "surrounded by Giants, Jets & Eagles fans." The approach has earned Christie plenty of love for being himself and sets him apart from other potential 2016 presidential contenders such as Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush, who often come across as stiffer and more disciplined. Christie is certainly aware that he has to tone himself down at times. But striking that perfect balance of authenticity without being too hot or too cold is "one of the most difficult lines to navigate" for a politician, said GOP strategist Ford O'Connell. Still, Christie mentioned the Clinton example in a 2013 radio interview defending his adoration of the Cowboys.
