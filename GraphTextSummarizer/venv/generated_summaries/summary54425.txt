British Open champion Ernie Els tied for sixth following a final round 67, while Sergio Garcia, under fire last week for "fried chicken" jibe, ended up tied for 19th. The dramatic finish at Wentworth helped make up for the early departures of Rory McIlroy, the world's second ranked golfer, and defending champion Luke Donald. Khan found the water with his second shot on the deciding hole in fading light at Wentworth, and when Manassero struck a birdie to clinch victory, he surpassed Bernard Gallacher as the youngest champion. Manassero edged England's Simon Khan on the fourth extra hole of a playoff after Scotland's Marc Warren exited on the first extra hole. At 20 years and 37 days, Manassero was two months younger than Gallacher when the Scot triumphed in 1969.
