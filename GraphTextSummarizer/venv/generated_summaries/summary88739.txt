" UK-based travel company Holidaysplease is offering a luxury world drinking tour in which you can learn and demonstrate the art of conspicuous consumption. With a dash of Grand Marnier, a soup√ßon of Chartreuse, a hefty dose of Cognac and a dash of those much sought after select Caribbean Angostura Bitters, one was sold in February 2013 for nearly $13,000, earning it a Guinness World Record for the costliest cocktail in the world. Vegas venture No over-the-top, absurdly decadent vacation is complete without a stay in Las Vegas where drinkers will be served an iconic Ono Champagne cocktail-for-two at the Aria Resort and Casino Las Vegas. There's more wining and dining at astronomical prices before a visit to New York's Algonquin Hotel Times Square, Autograph Collection, and a thirst-quenching $20,000 diamond-filled martini, served by the man with the steadiest hands in the city, food and beverage director Alex Aubry. "We spend the first three nights in London in the five-star Corinthia Hotel and hang out in the Playboy Club, Park Lane, Mayfair," says Byron Warmington of Holidaysplease.
