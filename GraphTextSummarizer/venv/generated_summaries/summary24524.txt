" The team estimates that it has scanned about 18 percent of the area that the Israeli army blanketed in cluster bombs during the conflicts with Hezbollah. Procedurally, the task is daunting: Inch by inch, they push forward, chopping the long grasses with garden shears to increase ground visibility and then running over the area slowly with minesweepers. The minesweepers are handheld devices that look like typical metal detectors, emitting a variety of high-pitched whines that vary depending on the density of the ground. Originally used by the Israeli military to combat Hezbollah forces firing rockets across the border, the bombs impacted in the soil were being ferreted out by a small U.N. team from the French battalion. Eddy Moretti, VBS's creative director, and a small film crew donned camouflaged PPO -- protective personal equipment -- and tagged along on one of their minesweeping missions in October 2007.
