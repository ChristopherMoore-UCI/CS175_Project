-- A suicide bombing at a police station in Istanbul killed at least one police officer and left at least four wounded, police in Turkey said Tuesday. The attacker first threw a hand grenade and then detonated his suicide bomb, Istanbul police chief Huseyin Capkin said in a news conference. Ambulances rushed to the scene, according to Turkey's semi-official Anatolia news agency. Capkin said police had "more or less" determined the identity of the attacker, a male aged about 25 years old, but were not releasing it. The blast appears to have taken place at the entrance to the police station in the Sultangazi neighborhood.
