More than 20 inches of rain have fallen over the past 24 hours in spots in Escambia County, the county's emergency management director John Dosh told CNN around noon Sunday. -- Parts of the Florida Panhandle and coastal Alabama were under water Sunday, with an onslaught of torrential rains causing not just extensive flooding but also damage to roads and buildings, local officials said. The National Weather Service issued a flash flood watch through Monday morning for parts of southwest Alabama, northwest Florida and southeast Mississippi, where three to six more inches of rain are expected. Leroy Bonifay, 90, told CNN affiliate WALA that he and his grandson got stuck along Airport Boulevard in Pensacola when water "washed up over my hood and drowned my engine." The facility's central booking facility, where inmates are brought in, was under about six feet of water at midday Saturday, according to Escambia County Sheriff's Office spokesman Mike Ward.
