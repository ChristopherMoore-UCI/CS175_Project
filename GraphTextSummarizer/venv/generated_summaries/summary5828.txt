According to Goodell, NFL teams are clamoring to visit London as they bid to spread the word about their teams and their cities, attract new fans and to tap into potentially lucrative new revenue streams. "Attendances for NFL games in cities like London have been healthy and are likely to generate a financial return for the NFL. But if a team is to base itself in Europe, be it in London or anywhere else, it must commit to ingraining the culture of the game in the city it adopts as a new home and guard against antagonizing U.S.-based fans, according to sports business expert Simon Chadwick. -- It has become a permanent fixture on the football calendar, and as the NFL prepares to descend on London once again, it seems a permanent touchdown is fast approaching. With the league having voted to persist with the experiment until at least 2016, and the Jacksonville Jaguars committing to four years of visits to London, the NFL is hoping to build on the spike in interest since landing firm feet on foreign shores in 2005.
