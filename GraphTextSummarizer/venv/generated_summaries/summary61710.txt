At a demonstration on Monday in Al Dair, in the north east of Bahrain, many pro-democracy protestors carried anti-F1 slogans. F1 chief Ecclestone: Sport and politics should not mix- Most teams have maintained they are happy to race in Bahrain but one of Force India's drivers, Nico Hulkenberg, was quoted by BBC Sport as saying: "We shouldn't have been put in this position." -- Two members of Force India's Formula One team have left Bahrain after a petrol bomb was thrown at one of the marque's cars during an anti-government protest. Bernie Ecclestone, the head of Formula One, has continually insisted that sufficient security measures are in place in Bahrain and that the sport had nothing to do with the politics of the country. "The team was returning from the circuit last night," Force India press officer Will Hings told CNN.
