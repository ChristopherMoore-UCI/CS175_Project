He said the government must show compassion in dealing with people affected by the tragedy, reminding officials that "money would not bring lost loved ones back. -- Acknowledging strong public anger and skepticism over the government's handling of a deadly bullet train collision last weekend, Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao Thursday promised a thorough investigation into the accident and its aftermath. "During the process, we should release information to the public timely and accurately." Wen, China's third most senior official after President Hu Jintao and legislative chief Wu Bangguo, has long been the public face of the top leadership in times of disasters and tragedies. In a nod to such sentiment, Wen said railway officials owed the public an answer while stressing the importance of an open and transparent investigation. Wen made the pledge on the crash site near Wenzhou in eastern Zhejiang province, where a bullet train was struck from behind Saturday night by another train, killing at least 40 people and injuring almost 200.
