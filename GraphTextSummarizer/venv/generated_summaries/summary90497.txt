Either way, there are renewed concerns that executions, which are supposed to be quick and painless, are neither. Typically executions are performed using three drugs in stages. Then the United States turned to European manufacturers, but they refused to sell the drug for use in executions. Since sodium thiopental was taken off the market for executions, states have turned to a drug called midazolam for the anesthetic. Whether they're "botched" or not, plenty of executions don't go by the book.
