Neuroimaging shows physical form of dreams Physically identifying dream activity in the brain has seemed hopelessly ambitious but this too is now entering the realm of the possible. Dream researchers estimate that 95% of dreams vanish upon awakening. Wiseman's Dream: ON app monitors sleeping movement in order to identify the REM stage, the state of deep sleep which is most fertile for dreams and signaled by the cessation of neurotransmitters that control activity such as seratonin, and paralysis of movement but for the eyes. Efforts to teach people how to access such dreams have been successful, and even electronically induced in clinical trials. The Aurora headband is one of several innovations to smash its crowd-funding goal with the promise of lucid dreams -- consciousness while asleep.
