New South Wales Communities Minister Victor Dominello said Jewish leaders and local government officials were considering increasing security on school buses. -- It started with older youths boarding an Australian school bus, terrifying the elementary-school-aged Jewish children aboard with slurs from "Heil Hitler" to "kill the Jews," and it ended 40 minutes later when the older youths fled before police arrived, according to accounts from some of the young students on the bus. The two dozen children, aged 5 to 12, were heading home from three Jewish schools when the older boys made their way onto the bus and began spouting threats of violence and anti-Semitic slurs, police and the Jewish students said. The youths fled following the Wednesday incident, Sydney police said, but five suspects were arrested Thursday and authorities were waiting on a sixth to turn himself in. The students from Mt. Sinai College, Emmanuel School and Moriah College said they endured verbal abuse from Maroubra to Bondi Junction, east of Sydney, where the teens eventually fled before police, called by parents, arrived.
