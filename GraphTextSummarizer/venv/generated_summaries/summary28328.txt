The fire started on the fourth floor of San Miguel prison's Tower 5 after a riot among inmates, metropolitan regional commissioner Fernando Echeverria said. Chile's president said Wednesday that conditions were "inhumane" at a prison south of Santiago where a fire killed 81 prisoners. Health minister Jaime Manalich said 14 inmates were in critical condition after the fire. The prison housed 1,961 inmates at the time of the fire Wednesday, said Felipe Bulnes, the justice minister. and I think it is not possible that all the responsibility should be attributed to overcrowded conditions."
