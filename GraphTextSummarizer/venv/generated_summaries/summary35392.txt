Man City return to top of English Premier League Tevez also said he wanted to play for City again in an interview on Argentinian television but risked further tension by laying the blame for the argument at Mancini and City's doorstep. Tevez also revealed he and Mancini nearly came to blows after a Premier League match last season and said that City could have handled the Bayern incident differently. Tevez has not played for the Citizens since a domestic cup win against second-tier Birmingham City in September. City manager Roberto Mancini has now hinted he may be prepared to forgive Tevez, who captained the team to a first trophy in 35 years last season, in a bid to bolster the club's chances of clinching their first top division title since 1968. Mancini said he was unsure what condition Tevez would be in upon his return, but said the 28-year-old has the talent to be an asset to City in the closing months of the season.
