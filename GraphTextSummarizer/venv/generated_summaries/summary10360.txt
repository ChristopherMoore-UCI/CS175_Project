" Tuesday was the first time De Villota had been behind the wheel of Marussia's MR01 car, although she did conduct a test for the Renault team last year. The Spaniard, one of only two female drivers contracted to an F1 team, sustained serious head and face injuries when her car collided with a stationary truck during a test event on Tuesday. The only other female driver currently involved in the elite division of motorsport is Susie Wolff, who is a development driver with Williams. "Maria remains in a critical but stable condition," added De Villota's sister. De Villota underwent surgery at a British hospital following the incident, but it was too late to save the 32-year-old's eye.
