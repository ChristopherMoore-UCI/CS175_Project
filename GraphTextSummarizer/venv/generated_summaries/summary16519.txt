Pageant organizers claim Carlina Duran had been married since 2009 but told Miss Dominican Republic contest organizers she was single. The runner-up in last week's Miss Dominican Republic contest, Dulcita Lieggi, will represent the Caribbean nation in the Miss Universe pageant, organizers said. Beauty queens from dozens of countries are scheduled to compete in the Miss Universe pageant in Las Vegas in June. -- Officials are forcing the 25-year-old model who won the Dominican Republic's top beauty pageant to hand over her crown, saying she violated contest rules when she hid her marriage. "If there is an established rule, and it comes out that she is married, she is violating the rule," said Rafael Concepcion.
