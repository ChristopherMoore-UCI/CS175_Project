Thai Finance Minister Korn Chatikavanij told CNN the protests have taken between 0.3 percent and 0.5 percent off the nation's gross domestic product so far this year and have had an "incalculable impact on investor confidence." "Unless there is a resolution to the Thai political situation soon, there is no clear visibility on the Group's performance for the rest of the year," Chairman Ho KownPing said Thursday in a statement. Korn said there was little disruption to business outside the immediate vicinity of the protests. -- The economy of Thailand -- whose growth this year so far has belied its political ails -- is now seeing more of a direct impact as protests grow increasingly violent. A rebel red shirt leader who was shot Thursday while being interviewed by Western journalists was also in critical condition.
