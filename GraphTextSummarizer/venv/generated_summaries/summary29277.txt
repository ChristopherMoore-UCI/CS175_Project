According to the U.S. Marshals Service, the number of threats against federal judges and prosecutors has mushroomed from 500 in 2003 to 1,278 in 2008. That tragic case has led to better reporting of threats against judges, according the the U.S. Marshals. Investigation often reveals that they have made previous threats against judges in state and local courts. As a result, the U.S. Marshals Service, which is responsible for the protection of federal judges, installed an elaborate camera surveillance system at Walton's house. But Walton has his own theory on why the volume of threats has increased.
