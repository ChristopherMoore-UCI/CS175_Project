Speaking Friday at the Armed Forces of the Philippines' headquarters in Zamboanga City, President Benigno Aquino III warned rebel hostage-takers that they face the use of force if they further threaten civilians. Philippine state media reported that the truce was to go into effect at midnight Saturday, but army officers in the battle zone received no orders for a cease-fire, said Zagala from the frontlines in Zamboanga City. The crisis in Zamboanga City began when large numbers of rebels from the Muslim militant group came ashore at the start of the week. Last month, Misuari issued a "declaration of independence" for the Moro nation -- referring to Mindanao's indigenous Muslim population -- after complaining that the MNLF had been left out of a recent wealth-sharing agreement with another insurgent group, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, which has fought for decades to set up an independent Islamic state on resource-rich Mindanao. Thousands of people have been evacuated from the rebel-held districts in Zamboanga, a city of about 800,000 on the southwestern tip of the island of Mindanao.
