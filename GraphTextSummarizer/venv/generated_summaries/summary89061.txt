The United Nations said last week that more than 4,000 people have died in Syria since a brutal government crackdown against protesters erupted in mid-March. " Friday was a day of protest, pain and sorrow in Homs, a center of demonstrations and death in Syria. Women, children and dissident soldiers were among those killed Friday in Syria, the group said. Three shrouded bodies are being carried into a mosque to be laid out alongside Friday worshippers. Out on the streets Friday, Syrian tanks rolled past the wreckage of past confrontations and gunfire echoed.
