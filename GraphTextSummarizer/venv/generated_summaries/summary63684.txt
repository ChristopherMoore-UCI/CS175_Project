At least nine people statewide had suffered injuries as of Thursday night -- before the death in Scott County -- state emergency management spokesman Tommy Jackson told CNN. That figure includes four minor injuries in Oden, three in Clark County and two hurt by a lightning strike in Benton County. Scott County Sheriff Cody Carpenter apparently drowned in the swiftwater rescue bid, according to Keith Stephens, spokesman for the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission. The National Weather Service noted reports of tornadoes in at least seven communities in western Arkansas -- as far west as Polk, as far south as Garland County, and as far north as Oden. Scott County is about 150 miles west of Little Rock, near the Oklahoma border.
