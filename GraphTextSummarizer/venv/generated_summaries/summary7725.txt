Ferraro said alligators are the most active at this time of year, while water levels are at their highest, but unprovoked attacks are rare. Ferraro said the elderly woman, whose home is next to the Florida Everglades, is no stranger to alligator attacks. Margaret Webb was walking in her flooded yard Wednesday in rural Copeland, Florida, about 80 miles west of Miami, when the alligator lunged at her and grabbed her by her left leg, commission spokeswoman Gabriella Ferraro said. In 2010, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission reported six unprovoked attacks in the state. -- An 8-foot-long alligator sank its teeth into a 90-year-old woman's leg and tried to drag her into a canal in southern Florida, a spokeswoman for the state's Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission said.
