Founders of the school saw a need to focus on teenage girls who would never be able to adapt at public school because of their lack of English skills. It's around noon, time for physical education class at the Global Village School, a small private institution for refugee teenage girls who have little or no English education. But here at a baseball field outside Atlanta, a group of giggling teenage girls from Ethiopia, Burundi, Afghanistan and Myanmar have found a level playing ground. There was already a school for refugee boys in Clarkston -- the Fugees Academy, where Robika's brother is a student. Refugee families started streaming into Clarkston in the 1990s after federal officials found a large number of vacant apartment complexes there, he says.
