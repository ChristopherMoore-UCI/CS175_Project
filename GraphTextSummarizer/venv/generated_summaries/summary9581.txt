Earlier reports from the officials indicated the attackers were suspected al Qaeda militants, but authorities later said the suspects were not linked to al Qaeda. Four western embassies in Yemen have been closed since August 4, after U.S. intelligence intercepted information that al Qaeda may target American interests in the region. Last week, an airstrike killed five suspected al Qaeda militants in the province, where the Defense Ministry says at least 100 suspected terrorists are hiding. The official said government authorities are in contact with tribal leaders in the area as they search for the gunmen. A senior Defense Ministry official told CNN that 34 people have been killed by 12 drone strikes since July 28.
