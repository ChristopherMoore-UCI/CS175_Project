-- When a two-member panel holds a California parole hearing for notorious murderer Charles Manson on Wednesday, he will be represented by state-appointed attorney DeJon R. Lewis, who will urge the state to put Manson in a mental hospital If it denies parole for Manson, the two-member panel of the California Board of Parole Hearings can schedule his next hearing three, five, seven, 10 or 15 years from now, said spokeswoman Terry Thornton of the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. In an interview Tuesday with CNN, Debra Tate, the sister of Sharon Tate, said she has been attending Manson's parole hearings for the past 15 years -- and Manson has not shown up. " Manson was initially sentenced to death for the 1969 slayings of actress Sharon Tate and six others by a group of his followers as part of what prosecutors said was an attempt to incite a race war. Manson has been denied parole 11 times.
