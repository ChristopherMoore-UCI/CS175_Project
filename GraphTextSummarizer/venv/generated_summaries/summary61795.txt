Widely regarded as the best coach in the world, Guardiola joined Bayern last year armed with a footballing philosophy that had brought him world domination during his time at Barcelona. His appointment at Bayern Munich was regarded as a something of coup, but less than a year after his arrival in Bavaria the first cracks have appeared in the relationship between Pep Guardiola and the German club. But Guardiola is adamant he will not alter his approach, insisting it is down to Bayern to decide if they want him to continue as manager. Despite the setback in Europe, Guardiola could yet win a fourth trophy this season with Bayern playing Borussia Dortmund in the German Cup final on May 17. "If we don't win, it does not help me when Bayern Munich's chief executive Karl-Heinz Rummenigge and sporting director Matthias Sammer, are backing me," Guardiola told reporters Friday.
