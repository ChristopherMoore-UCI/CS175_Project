Shreve is not a celebrity or executive requiring a personal assistant, but a published writer and photographer who lives in a log cabin on 40 acres in the rolling hills near Ten Sleep, Wyoming. The work-exchange program will give Shreve more time to "concentrate on her next artistic endeavor." Shreve landed in Wyoming after her own unusual journey, a solo, cross-country trip from California to New York on a motor scooter. The wild-born Charlie earns his keep by allowing Shreve to take photos of his everyday activities and write about him in her book as well as on her blog -- both titled the Daily Coyote. Although he walks on a leash, co-exists with Eli the cat, plays with Chloe the dog and often visits inside Shreve's house, Charlie does not like strangers.
