Sakyo was working for trading company Sumitomo when he read about Shibuya Ward assembly member Hasabe Ken's idea of a university based within the Shibuya community that focused on lifelong education. Founded in 2006, Shibuya University is a new system of education that's firmly rooted in its local community. "My idea was to bring together the most interesting elements of education and the attractive parts of Shibuya." Tokyo's bustling, youthful Shibuya district, the backdrop for much of the indie film "Lost In Translation," is a hip, neon-lit hub for Japan's cutting-edge set. Shibuya University is led by Yasuaki Sakyo, a 28-year-old ex-accountant.
