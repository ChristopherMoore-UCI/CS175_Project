The questions -- but more importantly my reaction -- made me consider the possibility that I did subconsciously purchase this house hoping that I would fill those bedrooms with kids instead of workout equipment. Assumptions are made that every personal decision is a reflection of your desire to have, or not have, children. It seems folks get really comfortable with certain questions after you pass that important milestone of 40. These were all questions that I never expected to confront at a casual birthday barbecue. Now, one year into my 40s, I'm blessed with home ownership and the realization that I am officially a "grown-up."
