Lamar Advertising, which owns one of the billboards, removed one of the mannequins a couple of hours later; code enforcement officials from Clark County removed the second one, Elliott said. -- Mannequins hanging from nooses on two Las Vegas billboards Wednesday were part of an apparent publicity stunt that led to dozens of calls from drivers on their morning commute, the Nevada Highway Patrol said. One mannequin dangled above Interstate 15 near the intersection with U.S. 95 downtown, Trooper Jeremie Elliott of the Nevada Highway Patrol told CNN. Despite the flurry of calls from commuters, Elliott said the signs led to no accidents on the freeways. The dummies were dressed in business suits and hung from signs reading "Dying for work" and "Hope you're happy Wall St." It wasn't immediately clear who was behind the stunt.
