As a pediatric oncologist and stem cell transplant specialist, his area of focus was initially cancer research, but he saw a challenge -- and an unmet need -- in rare diseases like EB. Since then, Tolar has transplanted a total of 24 children with EB, and continues to conduct research in gene therapy for EB and other rare diseases. But in New York City, where Rafi lives, a group of neighborhood mothers is hoping to change that, and in doing so, they are helping to change the way rare disease research is funded in the United States. But while the Orphan Drug Act increased the amount of research into rare diseases, the field is still vastly underfunded. Last year, they raised $200,000 that went to Dr. Jakub Tolar, director of the Stem Cell Institute at the University Of Minnesota in Minneapolis, who conducts early-stage research on EB treatments.
