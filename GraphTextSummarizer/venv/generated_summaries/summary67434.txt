"Ms. Hagerty's detailed statement ... is insufficient to support a criminal charge given other contradictory evidence, conflicting witness statements, credibility issues, lack of forensic evidence and denials by Mr. Gore." According to the district attorney's office, Portland police first became aware of the allegations in December 2006, when Hagerty's attorney said his client had been subjected to "unwanted sexual contact" by Gore. The district attorney's office noted several deficiencies in the case: "Ms. Hagerty, who has red hair, states she called Mr. Gore immediately following the alleged incident and told him to 'dream of redheaded women' seemingly in contradiction to her assertions that she was terrified of Mr. Gore," Rees wrote. After Hagerty's allegations were published in the National Enquirer this summer, Portland police opened a full investigation, Rees wrote. "Mr. Gore unequivocally and emphatically denied this accusation when he first learned of its existence three years ago," the statement reads.
