Some of these prices may seem rather expensive for regular iPad users, but autism communities are thrilled. A search for "autism apps" for the iPad in Apple's App Store brings 764 hits. David Niemeijer, founder and CEO of Amsterdam-based AssistiveWare, creator of Proloquo2Go, said that 90% of AAC users use an iPad for communication, and more than 25% use an iPhone or iPod Touch, according to the company's surveys. A majority of the apps on the iPad are paid apps that cost 99 cents to $299.99. Siddiqui, a Columbia, Maryland, resident who shared his daughter's story on iReport, said that before having the iPad, Sharia's only way of communicating was crying.
