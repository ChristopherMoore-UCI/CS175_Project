Game console generations typically last four to six years, but some predict that motion-detection peripherals like Microsoft's Kinect for the Xbox 360 and Sony's PlayStation Move could prolong the current cycle. Sony is gearing up for the release of the PlayStation Vita, a portable game console that follows the PlayStation Portable. Sony, which has sold more than 50 million PlayStation 3 systems, compensated customers with free game downloads. "While others in the space are losing steam, PlayStation 3 is gaining momentum," Jack Tretton, the president and CEO of Sony Computer Entertainment of America, said in a statement. To compete with smartphones, it will have downloadable games, a touchscreen and 3G cellular data connectivity.
