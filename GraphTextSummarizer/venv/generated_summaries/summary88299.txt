Nephew Billy Bulger Jr., son of former Massachusetts Senate President Billy Bulger, was also in court Thursday. Bulger's lawyers have called five retired FBI agents who worked in Boston during Bulger's alleged reign of terror in the late 1970s and 1980s. One of the men featured in a photo with Bulger was identified as a defrocked, formerly high-ranking official of the Boston archdiocese, Frederick J. Ryan, according to the lawyer for two former Catholic Memorial School students who brought sexual molestation claims against the archdiocese in 2002. Bulger, his lawyers say, is calling the shots and will make the decision Friday after the defense reads testimony from one victim's mother and then calls its last two witnesses, an FBI secretary and admitted former hitman John Martorano. Casper is reviewing the defense's motion to include an additional charge of "accessory after the fact to murder" in Bulger's final charges.
