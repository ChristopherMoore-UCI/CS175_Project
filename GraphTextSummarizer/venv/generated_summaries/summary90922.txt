-- The son of the iconic founder of modern Kenya and two other powerful figures in the East African nation -- all accused of crimes against humanity -- made their first appearances before the International Criminal Court at The Hague on Friday. The chaos and violence after the 2007 election escalated into ethnic violence pitting supporters of incumbent President Mwai Kibaki against those of challenger Raila Odinga, who was later named prime minister in a power-sharing agreement. Ekaterina Trendafilova, the presiding judge, said if more crimes are committed, the court could replace summonses with arrest warrants. Muthaura, Kenyatta and Ali are accused of committing or contributing to the killing, rape and other acts of violence against supporters of Odinga's opposition Orange Democratic Movement. "It is an indication that yes, responsibility and public action is possible where it is deemed that crimes have happened; where it is deemed that some people need to be taken to account for their actions," he said.
