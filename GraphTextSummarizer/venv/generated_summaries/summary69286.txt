A jury returned the recommendation late Wednesday, hours after finding George Huguely, 24, guilty of second-degree murder and grand larceny in the May 2010 death of Yeardley Love. The prosecution told jurors that Love's death was slow and painful, claiming she could have remained alive for a couple of hours after Huguely left her apartment. Huguely has never denied he was in Love's apartment nor that they had a fight. Alexis Love told the jurors that not a day goes by that she doesn't think about what happened to her sister. "Every year that goes by, I'm afraid I'm forgetting a little piece of her," Sharon Love told the court.
