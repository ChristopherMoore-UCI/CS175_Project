-- Opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi took the stand for the first time Tuesday and told a Myanmar court that she did not violate her house arrest when she offered temporary shelter to an American man who swam to her lakeside home. " Under questioning by a judge for half an hour, Suu Kyi said she provided Yettaw food but allowed him only to "stay temporarily." Yettaw left late May 5, she said. Suu Kyi has been under house arrest for 13 of the past 19 years -- a confinement the military junta has regularly extended. Watch the U.N. secretary general explain what he is doing for Suu Kyi Â» Her latest round of home detention -- after five years of confinement -- expires Wednesday, according to her supporters at home and abroad. Suu Kyi had earlier told supporters that she did not tell authorities about the latest intrusion because she didn't want Yettaw or anyone else to get in trouble.
