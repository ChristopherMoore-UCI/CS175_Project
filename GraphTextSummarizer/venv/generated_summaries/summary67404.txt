Issawi originally had been set free in late 2011 after nine years in prison but ended up back in detention nine months later for what Israeli officials said was a parole violation. In October 2011, Israel freed more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners -- including Issawi and hundreds serving life sentences for attacks on Israelis -- in exchange for Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, who had been held by Hamas for more than five years. -- Samer Issawi, a Palestinian who once refused solid food in a 266-day protest while in an Israeli prison, was released Monday. He was greeted by hundreds of chanting Palestinians who ignored the warning of Israeli forces against celebrating. After his release Monday, he returned to his home in the Jerusalem neighborhood of Issawiyeh.
