" Now a volunteer for the Immigrant Legal Resource Center, a nonprofit group that advocates for immigrants' rights, Guerrero also wrote about going through high school and college without her parents in a Los Angeles Times op-ed over the weekend. She said her parents had tried to prepare her for the possibility that they could be deported -- but that through high school and college, phone calls and once-per-summer visits to visit her family in Colombia weren't enough.

Diane Guerrero, who plays Maritza Ramos, a character she described as "a tough Latina from the 'hood," on the show, discussed her ordeal in an interview Monday on CNN's "New Day" "It is so difficult for some people to get documented and to get their papers and become legal, and my parents tried forever. "Children who grow up separated from their families often end up in foster care, or worse, in the juvenile justice system despite having parents who love them and would like to be able to care for them."
