Iran has consistently denied U.S. and other international claims that its atomic energy program is aimed at producing nuclear weapons. -- Toyota Motors said Wednesday it's halting shipments to Iran following international moves to put financial and commercial pressure on Tehran to curb its nuclear ambitions. Toyota doesn't have any factories in Iran, and says it stopped shipping vehicles to its Iranian-owned distributor there in June. "It is true that Toyota has stopped exports of vehicles bound for Iran," Toyota spokesman Keisuke Kirimoto said in Tokyo. The world's largest automaker made the move in light of U.S. and United Nations sanctions slapped on Tehran in June.
