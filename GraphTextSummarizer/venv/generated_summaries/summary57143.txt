Authorities have said that Frein hated law enforcement and that they believe that he's solely focused on hurting more officers, but not civilians. They are combing about 200 to 250 square miles of wooded area not far from Frein's family home in Canadensis -- about 20 miles from where Frein alleged shot state police officers. -- Authorities hunting suspected cop-killer Eric Matthew Frein say they discovered an AK-47 rifle, some magazines and a small bag of ammo in the northeastern Pennsylvania woods where they believe he was hiding. He was flanked by State Police Lt. Col George Bivens, who added, "I do believe that we are close to him at this point." Investigators said the items they found were either abandoned or hidden by Frein, who is a skilled marksman and trained survivalist.
