Users of the iPhone spend more time on their devices a day (26 minutes more) but a smaller percentage of time talking and surfing the Web than their Android counterparts and more time texting and snapping photographs. On average, people spend 26% of their smartphone quality-time talking, 20% texting and 9% e-mailing. Watching videos accounted for a small amount of time on average, but those who do usually watch videos a little more than four times a day for a total of five minutes daily. Whatever the operating system, smartphones are still primarily used as communication devices, according to the study. A new study from Experian digs into the details of how people use their phones and finds that users on all systems spend an average of 58 minutes a day on their smartphones.
