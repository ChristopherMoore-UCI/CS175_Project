From the central city, anti-Gadhafi fighters retreated to the outskirts after troops loyal to Gadhafi put up strong resistance. In southern Libya, convoys of pickup trucks loaded with arms and ammunition barreled toward Sabha  -- and the nearby towns of al-Birak and al-Qira, the hometown of Gadhafi's brother-in-law and intelligence chief Abdullah Al-Senussi. -- Revolutionary forces attacked loyalist strongholds Friday in a failed attempt to snuff out continuing resistance from forces loyal to ousted Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi. Two anti-Gadhafi fighters were killed, 22 were wounded, and nine Gadhafi fighters were captured, said Abdelssalam Khamis, head of the transitional council's medical mission around Sabha. Opposition commander Hmaida Al-Majri said NTC forces were in talks with anti-Gadhafi elders from villages around Sabha to arrange for an orderly and peaceful entry of NTC forces.
