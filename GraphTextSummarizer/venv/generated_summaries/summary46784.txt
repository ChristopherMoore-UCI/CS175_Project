Now her life has changed with her daughter and taking temporary custody of [A.J.'s] twins." Jewell, who died at 34 after a fight outside of an Atlanta strip club on October 3, was buried on October 9. Although scenes with Jewell weren't a part of last Thursday's episode, "Housewives" viewers did watch as Kandi debated the future of her engagement to Jewell with castmate Kim. But commercials for this Thursday's episode showed clips from therapy sessions with Burruss, her mother and Jewell. Cast member and purported "sixth housewife" Dwight Eubanks told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that he was "shocked" when he heard of Jewell's passing but does expect the taping to resume eventually. The show is now winding down its second season on the network, and the two-part episode was expected to air on October 29 and November 5.
