"I cannot think of a better way to honor those who fought in the war as well as celebrate Constitution's successes during the War of 1812 than for the ship to be under sail," said Cmdr. Sunday's sail marked the first time Constitution sailed on her own since 1997. The Constitution set out on Boston Harbor in Massachusetts to commemorate the 200th anniversary of her victory over a British frigate during the War of 1812. -- The USS Constitution, or "Old Ironsides," sailed under her own power Sunday for just the second time in some 130 years. Tugs were then reattached to Constitution's sides and she returned to her pier by early afternoon.
