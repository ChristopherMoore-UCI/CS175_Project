An Argentine judge has dismissed a criminal complaint accusing President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner and other top leaders of covering up Iran's involvement in a 1994 terrorist bombing in Buenos Aires. Nisman also alleged that Fernandez and Foreign Minister Hector Timerman sought to withdraw from Interpol their requests for the arrests of several Iranian suspects. " Nisman alleged that Argentina's government agreed not to go after Iranian suspects in the bombing in exchange for a favorable trade deal. Earlier this month, a new prosecutor who picked up Nisman's case said there was enough evidence to continue the criminal investigation. Regarding Interpol, the judge said there is no evidence that the Argentine government took steps to have the international police body remove the so-called red notices against the Iranians.
