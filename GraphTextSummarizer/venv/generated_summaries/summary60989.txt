Earmarks have been a political hot button for years. Of the more than 430 members, 47 provided earmark requests, 68 said they would not release their requests and six said they had not made any requests. Commonly derided as "pork," pet projects are tucked into spending bills. Democrats have agreed to attach names to earmarks -- letting the public know which representative is asking for what -- before votes on bills. Democratic House leaders, including Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Rep. David Obey of Wisconsin, the Appropriations Committee chairman, declined to answer questions concerning earmark funding.
