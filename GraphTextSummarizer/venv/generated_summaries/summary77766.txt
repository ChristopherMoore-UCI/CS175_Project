Lavinder in December said authorities believe Easley and Smith's daughter left Virginia that night or early the next day. Police believe that Tina Smith, who was Easley's girlfriend, was killed between the morning and evening of December 3. The judge also denied Easley's bond request, Roanoke County spokeswoman Teresa Hall said. Roanoke County Police Chief Ray Lavinder has said Easley is a "very good suspect" in the murder of Tina Smith, the mother of the girl he allegedly abducted. Theresa Shanley in December spotted Easley, 32, and the girl outside a Safeway store in the Richmond district of San Francisco, then alerted police.
