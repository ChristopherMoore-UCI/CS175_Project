Two Democratic Mississippi lawmakers who were involved in the case -- state Sen. John Horhn and state Rep. George Flaggs -- told CNN affiliate WLBT that Barbour deserves credit for suspending the sentences. According to The Clarion-Ledger, in Jackson, Mississippi, the sisters had pleaded not guilty as accessories but were convicted of armed robbery, while the three accomplices received lesser sentences and since have been released. In 1993, Gladys and Jamie Scott were arrested and charged with leading two men into an ambush in Scott County, according to CNN affiliate WLBT. Gov. Haley Barbour, who suspended their sentences, said Wednesday that Gladys Scott, 36, must donate a kidney to her sister, Jamie, 38. Jealous said he hoped Barbour's decision served notice to governors in other states where incarcerations are being challenged "that they have a big role to play in advancing justice."
