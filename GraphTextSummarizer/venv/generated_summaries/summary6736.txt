Unveiled at the Italian company's headquarters in Milan on Thursday, the new look tires include softer compounds and new constructions which could lower lap times by up to 0.5 seconds, the company says. " Paul Hembery, Pirelli's motorsport director said in a statement: "The goal is to continuously set new challenges for the drivers and to ensure that all the teams start the new season on a level playing field when it comes to the tires." "Through accumulating more information with each grand prix last year, the teams eventually fully understood the tires, after a spectacular start with seven winners from the first seven races. "Our 2013 range of tires mixes up the cards once more to help overtaking and ensure two to three pit stops per race. -- Changes to tires will make Formula 1 racing faster with more overtaking in 2013, according to the sport's official tire supplier Pirelli. " Color changes to the tire sidewalls have also been made with orange replacing silver to denote hard compound tires.
