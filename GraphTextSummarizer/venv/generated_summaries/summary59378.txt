"Iron Man 3" opened higher than both "Iron Man" ($98.6 million) and "Iron Man 2" ($128.1 million), which isn't all that surprising given that it's arriving after "The Avengers," which earned $623.4 million domestically and became the biggest hit of 2012. It's difficult to imagine that "Iron Man 3" could have garnered such impressive numbers without the boon of "The Avengers" â€” especially because "Iron Man 2" was tepidly received by most viewers and ultimately finished with less than "Iron Man" ($312.4 million vs. $318.4 million). After seven weekends, the caveman comedy has earned $168.7 million (the fact that "Iron Man 3" surpassed that total in just three days is remarkable), and now stands as the third-highest grossing domestic release of 2013 behind "Oz The Great and Powerful" ($228.6 million) and "Iron Man 3." For star Robert Downey Jr., who portrays wise-cracking billionaire Tony Stark, "Iron Man 3" marks the latest incredible success in his Hollywood comeback. "Iron Man 3" earned a solid "A" CinemaScore, and positive word-of-mouth could propel the film to a domestic finish in the $400 million range, though it faces ample competition over the next few weeks from "Star Trek Into Darkness" and "Fast & Furious 6."
