Prosecutors in the Mexican state of Guerrero said Friday they have formally charged former Iguala Mayor Jose Luis Abarca in the disappearance of 43 students. Police killed some students, and the rest are believed to have been turned over to gang members to be executed, Mexican Attorney General Jesus Murillo Karam has said. Opinion: Mexico kidnappings: Authorities said the students -- mostly men in their 20s studying to be teachers -- were abducted by police in September at Abarca's direction. In all, at least 74 people have been arrested in connection with the disappearances and deaths, which have sparked huge protests across Mexico.
