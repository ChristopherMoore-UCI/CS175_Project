In-form Dutch forward Arjen Robben scored a hat-trick while Croatia striker Ivica Olic and young German Thomas Muller both netted twice each to keep Bayern clear of second-placed Schalke, who earlier won 3-1 at home to Borussia Moenchengladbach. Eighth-placed Wolfsburg twice led through strikers Edin Dzeko and Grafite, but Peruvian striker Claudio Pizarro made it 2-2 four minutes after halftime, and midfielder Torsten Frings put Bremen ahead with his second goal on 61. Robben scored the goal that put Bayern into the last four of Europe's premier club competition with an away goals win over Manchester United, and is in hot domestic scoring form after also finding the net in last weekend's 1-1 draw at Bayer Leverkusen. Leverkusen led in the 13th minute when Stefan Reinartz set up striker Stefan Kiessling for his 19th goal this season, but had Tranquillo Barnetta sent off six minutes later for a second booking. Werder Bremen moved up to third place on goal difference with a 4-2 win at Wolfsburg, whose title defense has long been over.
