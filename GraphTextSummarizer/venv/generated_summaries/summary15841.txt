The upgrade is part of a highly criticized decision last year that sent tens of millions of dollars in stimulus funds to revamp or rebuild border stations across Montana's northern border with Canada. Canada has decided to shut down its side of the Whitetail, Montana, border crossing next year because fewer than five vehicles a day use the crossing.

The Department of Homeland Security has stressed the need for spending tens of millions of dollars in Montana to improve security along the border. This is the second time plans for the Montana border stations have been put on hold.
