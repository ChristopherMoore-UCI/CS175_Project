Just two weeks ago, the man was in Raqqa, the ISIS stronghold in northern Syria. Like many cities across Syria and Iraq, Raqqa has been overrun by ISIS militants who show no mercy for those who don't follow their hard line. ISIS may have wanted to show off its global reach by having a militant with a British accent front the videos of the beheadings of American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff. The former insurgent, in his 20s, left ISIS two weeks ago because he said the group is "spreading injustice in the name of justice. And that kind of tactic could also inspire more foreigners, the former ISIS fighter told CNN.
