The cheering Holland enjoyed his compatriot Agnel repeat his performance from the 4x100m relay, where he surged past Lochte in the final leg to claim gold, to claim another French swimming gold. Park, Sun, Agnel and Lochte had already won medals in London. With three gold medals, the French are now one short of their swimming gold medal total from all previous Olympics. French swimmer Yannick Agnel won his second gold of a triumphant Olympics with a dominant performance in Monday's 200 meters freestyle final. The U.S. did enjoy some success in the pool later, with two consecutive gold medals ensuring they ended the day second in the medal table.
