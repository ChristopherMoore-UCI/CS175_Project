But Mayor Trent Crewe said police later believed the gunman was holding fewer than five people and that they have accounted for people they thought could have been inside. The surrounding area of downtown Wytheville has been evacuated within a three- to four-block radius, Crewe said. The gunman is disabled, Crewe said, adding that police told him the gunman entered the post office pushing a wheelchair. He had not identified himself but he has told police he has a military background, Crewe said. There were reports the man had a "device," and it appeared that his car, parked outside the office, was equipped with some type of device as well, Crewe said.
