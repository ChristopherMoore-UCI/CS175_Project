"Airlines have no excuse to reduce flights to Venezuela. Reacting to Air Canada's decision to suspend flights to Venezuela in late March, Transportation Minister Hebert Garcia said Venezuela remains a very attractive destination, regardless of any actions taken by the airlines. Other airlines represented by the International Air Transport Association are considering suspending all flights to Venezuela. Cerda also says in the last year, 11 other airlines have reduced their number of flights to and from Venezuela for the same reason. Venezuela is a very safe country with excellent tourism alternatives like Margarita Island," he said.
