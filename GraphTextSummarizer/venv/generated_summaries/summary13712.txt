Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola is spoilt for striking choice as his side attempt to overcome a two-goal Champions League semifinal deficit against Inter Milan, but faces a defensive poser with captain Carles Puyol suspended. Up front, Guardiola has no less than six in-form attacking options, with Lionel Messi and Pedro Rodriguez forming a lethal combination in recent matches while Swedish star Zlatan Ibrahimovic is returning to full fitness and scored in the weekend league win over Xerez. Puyol picked up a yellow card in the 3-1 defeat to Inter in the San Siro last weekend, ruling him out of the second leg, and he will be sorely missed at center back. Guardiola can also call on the likes of Thierry Henry, Bojan and young winger Jeffren as they attempt to break down Inter. Mourinho's men got their Serie A title bid back in full swing with a weekend victory over Atalanta, but midfield talisman Wesley Sneijder was injured in the 3-1 win and is battling to be fit with a hamstring strain.
