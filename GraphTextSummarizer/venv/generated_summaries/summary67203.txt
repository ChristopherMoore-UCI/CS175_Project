Kidnappers did ultimately free Ayvani -- without getting anything in return -- leaving her at an aunt's house in Conyers, Georgia, and ending a harrowing 36-hour ordeal that began 25 miles away with a brazen pre-dawn break-in punctuated by gunshots, threats and screams. -- The family of Georgia teen Ayvani Perez got a call hours after she was abducted demanding money and drugs for her safe return, according to a criminal affidavit filed Thursday. One of those arrested with him -- on a marijuana trafficking charge, which was later dropped -- was Ayvani's mother, Maria Corral. Authorities haven't detailed how these two men were arrested, beyond Clayton County Police Chief Gregory Porter saying it happened "through hardcore police work. Ayvani was eventually forced at gunpoint down the stairs, then eventually out the back door, over a fence, then behind several houses with the two kidnappers, an FBI agent wrote in the affidavit.
