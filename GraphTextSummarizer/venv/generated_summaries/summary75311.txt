The President has spent much of last year marking the withdrawal of combat troops in Afghanistan, from his announcement in May that U.S. combat troops would leave the country by January 2015, to an appearance at Fort Dix earlier this month acknowledging persistent security challenges there. In a written statement marking the formal end of U.S. combat there, Obama said the remaining 10,000 or so American troops in Afghanistan would still face danger but that the longest U.S. war ever was now history. Hagel said Sunday the work of U.S. troops has "made our world safer and given Afghanistan the opportunity to chart a secure, democratic, and prosperous future. Other U.S. officials — including Vice President Joe Biden and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel — have also marked the end of the U.S. combat mission in Afghanistan. American troops went to fight in Afghanistan following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, and the U.S. spent more than $1 trillion dollars there and lost upwards of 2,200 servicemen and women.
