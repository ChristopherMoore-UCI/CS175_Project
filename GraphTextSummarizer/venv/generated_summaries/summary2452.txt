Diego Simeone's side surrender first place on goal difference following a four-goal swing on Saturday night as Real Madrid beat Villarreal 4-2 and Atletico lost 2-0. A 5-0 drubbing of bottom side Betis Sevilla means Juan Antonio Pizzi's side are now level on 31 points with Sevilla who will be hoping they can repeat Valencia's trick when they host Barcelona on Sunday evening. FC Shakhtar expresses condolences and sympathy to Maicon's family and friends. With Cristiano Ronaldo serving the first game of a three-match suspension after being sent off last weekend, it was left to the Bale, who returned to action after missing the three previous games with a calf injury, to guide Los Blancos to three points. Elsewhere in La Liga, Rayo Vallecano recorded a resounding 4-1 win over Malaga to lift the second-from-bottom side level on 20 points with 18th place Valladolid who play Elche on Sunday.
