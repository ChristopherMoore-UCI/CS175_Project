Pre-race favorite Bradley Wiggins of Team Sky finished in a whittled down bunch given the same time as the leading three, which also included defending champions Cadel Evans of Australia. After the early breakaway was caught on the outskirts of Seraing, the pace went up as riders made their bid for stage glory. The 22-year-old Liquigas rider underlined his reputation as the rising star of the peloton by outsprinting Fabian Cancellara and Edvald Boasson Hagen of Norway after a tough uphill finish to the 198km stage from Liege. Sylvain Chavanel of France, who took third in the prologue in Liege behind Cancellara and Wiggins, made an initial attack, but it was RadioShack's Cancellara who split the field. He came into the Tour as the favorite to claim the green points jersey, having won five of the eight stages of this year's Tour of California and shown his versatility in other races.
