Now they're trying to challenge al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) in its heartland in central Yemen. Only this time, it's not a cry for democracy but a bitter sectarian battle for power -- pitching al Qaeda and other Sunni groups against Shia Houthi rebels. The Houthi -- whose stronghold is northern Yemen -- swept into the capital, Sanaa, a month ago, where they met little opposition. AQAP has taken control of the town of Al Odayn in neighboring Ibb province, as Yemen threatens -- again -- to become a patchwork of rival fiefdoms where the central government has little influence. Adding to an increasingly volatile situation, a secessionist movement in the south of Yemen, al Hirak, is stepping up protests in Aden, Yemen's chief port and the largest city in the south.
