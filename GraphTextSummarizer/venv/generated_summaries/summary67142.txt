-- A Canadian teenage girl has been found guilty of distributing child pornography in connection with "sexting" pictures of her boyfriend's ex-girlfriend, the youth crown prosecutor for Victoria said Friday. She then texted five explicit pictures of the ex-girlfriend that she found on her boyfriend's phone to a group of people, Fisher said. Calling the case "precedent-setting," Fisher said the case should serve as a warning to teens about what they text and post online. The teenager initially threatened the ex-girlfriend on Facebook, the prosecutor said. "The accused was not at all happy that he was still in touch with his ex," Fisher told CNN.
