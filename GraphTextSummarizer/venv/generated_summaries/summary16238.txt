-- Merrill Newman -- the 85-year-old American detained by North Korean authorities earlier this fall -- returned Saturday to the United States, arriving at San Francisco International Airport. "After I killed so many civilians and (North Korean) soldiers and destroyed strategic objects in the DPRK during the Korean War, I committed indelible offensive acts against the DPRK government and Korean people," Newman said, according to that KCNA report. "We are absolutely delighted to confirm that Merrill Newman is on his way home after being released by the DPRK," said Jeff Newman, Merrill's son. Focus now on Kenneth Bae Jeff Newman also called for the release of Kenneth Bae, another American being held in North Korea. Then, just minutes before his Beijing-bound plane was set to depart Pyongyang in late October, Newman was taken off the aircraft by North Korean authorities.
