-- A powerful storm system that ripped through the Louisville, Kentucky, area left thousands of people without power and forced the closing of the internationally famous Churchill Downs racetrack on Thursday. "Nine barns suffered significant damage as a result of the storm, which reportedly produced tornadoes in the metro Louisville area," the statement read. Churchill Downs spokesman Darren Rogers said no one was injured, including any of the 1,400 horses stabled at the facility. The National Weather Service said damage from the Wednesday night system, which also struck the University of Louisville campus, likely resulted from tornadoes. A storm survey confirmed that an F-1 tornado touched down in Jeffersontown, Kentucky, east of Louisville, according to the National Weather Service.
