European startup enterprises face the same regulations that are applied to large corporations, Laurs says, putting an unfair burden on smaller companies. Ilja Laurs, founder of Getjar -- the world's largest app store -- says there are labor, cultural and bureaucratic factors that make it very difficult for Europe to compete with Silicon Valley. " That compares to the thousands available in Silicon Valley, putting Europe at a competitive disadvantage. "The same set of rules that governs big corporations can be very damaging to small startups which operate in a very different environment," he says. He believes changes must be made to labor laws and capital gains tax for small organizations to be viable.
