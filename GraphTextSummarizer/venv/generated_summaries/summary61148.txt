When they arrived, they found Touch Chea, 71, and his wife, Sorn Sreap, 73, dead, apparently due to blunt force trauma to the head and face, Markiewicz said. Active had previously been convicted of sexual assault that involved an 11-year-old child, Markiewicz said. Markiewicz said police were called to the home shortly before 8 p.m. Saturday. The sergeant said the 2-year-old's father told police that he and his wife, who is pregnant, lived in the home with their children -- ages 4 and 2 -- along with Chea, Sreap and another relative. "I've been in the homicide unit for the last eight years and it's certainly one of the worst homicides we've seen in our town, in our city," Markiewicz told CNN's Brooke Baldwin Monday night.
