Paris suffered several plague epidemics during the times that the hospital was in operation, as well as a smallpox outbreak in the 17th century. Abadie told BFM-TV that when the cemetery was shut down centuries ago, most of the remains were moved to the Catacombs of Paris. It's clear they all died around the same time, lead archeologist Isabelle Abadie told BFM-TV, because of the way the bodies were neatly arranged. Workers digging underneath a Paris supermarket have made an unsettling discovery:  as many as 200 skeletons. The area was apparently part of a cemetery for the Hospital of the Trinity, according to CNN affiliate, France's BFM-TV.
