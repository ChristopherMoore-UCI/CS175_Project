Wendy Davis violated Texas election law, GOP opponent alleges -- Wendy Davis is attacking her partially paralyzed Republican opponent Greg Abbott in the Texas governor's race -- with an ad that features an empty wheelchair. The ad argues that Abbott successfully sued for his 1984 injury, but later as a Texas Supreme Court justice and state attorney general opposed similar efforts from other people suing hospitals and corporations. Abbott spokeswoman Amelia Chasse blasted the Davis ad, saying it "completely disqualifies" Davis -- hinting that it could hurt her in future campaigns, too. "Sen. Davis' ad shows a disturbing lack of judgment from a desperate politician, and completely disqualifies her from seeking higher office in Texas."
