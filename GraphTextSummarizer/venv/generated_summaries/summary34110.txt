In one of the attacks, a suicide bomber detonated an explosives-laden vest inside the Justice Ministry building, Iraqi security officials told CNN. At least 18 people were killed and 53 were wounded, police officials in Baghdad told CNN. Iraqi forces continued to search the building to make sure employees were safe, the government-run news outlet said. Iraqi state television reported that three gunmen rushed into the building, but Iraqi forces killed them. It's unclear at this time how the bomber and gunmen were able to get to the Justice Ministry, considering there are multiple checkpoints and other security measures in place to help keep the high-traffic area secure.
