Mitchell, 57, is charged with snatching then-14-year-old Smart at knife-point from her family's Salt Lake City home early on June 5, 2002. But no one expected what happened in March 2003, when Smart was found walking down a street in the Salt Lake City suburb of Sandy in the company of Mitchell and his wife, Wanda Eileen Barzee. Smart was abducted before dawn on June 5, 2002, and led to a campsite that "was her prison for the next four months," Assistant U.S. Attorney Felice Viti said in his opening statements Thursday. Barzee, 64, pleaded guilty in federal court in November 2009 to kidnapping and unlawful transportation of a minor and was sentenced in May to 15 years in federal prison. The three-judge panel vacated the temporary stay it issued Thursday, which halted the trial just after the defense had begun its opening statements in a Salt Lake City federal courtroom.
