" Don Stewart, a spokesman for Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, said that "after presiding over one of the largest expansions of government in history, and a year after raising the issue ... it's interesting to see the president finally acknowledge that Washington is out of control." Republicans frequently cite the rapid growth in deficit spending over the last three years as an example of explosive government growth under Obama. Obama noted Friday that presidents starting in the midst of the Great Depression were authorized to submit federal reorganization plans to Congress for a guaranteed up-or-down vote. "I stand ready to work with President Obama on proposals to reorganize federal agencies," Issa said in a written statement. "Given the president's record of growing government, we're interested to learn whether this proposal represents actual relief for American businesses or just the appearance of it," said Brendan Buck, a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio. And because it's always easier to add than to subtract in Washington, inertia prevented any real reform from happening." Obama's plan -- building on a promise made in last year's State of the Union address to streamline government -- could help to place the president in a more centrist position heading into the election, political analysts note.
