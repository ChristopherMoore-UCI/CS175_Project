Harry Lew in April after Lew fell asleep while on watch after first arriving in Afghanistan. "At 0343 on 3 April 2011, while crouching down in the fighting position he had just dug, LCpl Lew leaned over his M249 Squad Automatic Weapon as it pointed to the sky, placed the muzzle in his mouth, pulled the trigger, and intentionally killed himself," the report said, according to the Marine Corps Times. "We just couldn't believe their own peers could do something like that to their own people." A military investigation report obtained by the Marine Corps Times said Lew killed himself with a two- or three-round burst from an M249 Squad Automatic Weapon in the early hours of April 3. -- A U.S. Marine accused of hazing a fellow Marine who later committed suicide in Afghanistan has been sentenced to 30 days in jail and a reduction in rank at a court-martial in Hawaii. One Marine kicked and punched Lew until being stopped by another, the report said.
