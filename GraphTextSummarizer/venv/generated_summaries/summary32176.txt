Interior Secretary Ken Salazar announced the ban -- which covers the Burmese python, the northern and southern African pythons, and the yellow anaconda -- at a news conference at Everglades National Park in South Florida, where non-native snakes have become a serious problem. "We are very happy to see this finally in place," said park spokeswoman Linda Friar. Although the ban should put a stop to additional pythons entering the country, officials say it will not solve the snake problem in the Everglades. "We think there are tens of thousands of snakes (in the park)," said Friar. The ban will not affect people who currently own these four species of snakes, other than prohibiting the transportation or selling of the animals across state lines.
