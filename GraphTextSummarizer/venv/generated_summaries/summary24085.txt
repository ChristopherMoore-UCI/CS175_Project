If I'm in the car, I can go from one place to another and see different backgrounds, different people and different surrounding -- and for me this is always interesting to show in my work. Art Dubai is an art fair that happens every year in March. There are a couple of old buildings that are turned into art spaces. I think Emirati artists are trying to invent their identity and create a regional style for Dubai. My mum would get fabrics and I think this was where my interest in art and colors started.
