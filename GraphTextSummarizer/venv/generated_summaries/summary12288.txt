"Hundreds of Iraqi soldiers have been beheaded and hung and their bodies have been desecrated," said Iraq's military spokesman, Maj. Gen. Qassim Atta. The first military advisers will focus on assessing the strengths and weaknesses of Iraqi security forces, U.S. officials said. Two security officials told CNN that Iraqi forces have withdrawn from Haditha, 168 miles (about 270 kilometers) northwest of Baghdad. Militants have taken over the Tal Afar airbase in northern Iraq as well as the city of Tal Afar, officials said. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry met Iraqi leaders Monday as radical Sunni militants continue their march toward Baghdad during the country's tensest time since the U.S. withdrawal of troops in 2011.
