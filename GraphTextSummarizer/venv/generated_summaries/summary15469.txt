"Lyrical and expressive on the bass, he embraced a variety of musical genres, ranging from jazz to country to world music," the NEA's bio of Haden said. -- Grammy-winning jazz bassist Charlie Haden, whose music career spanned seven decades and several genres, died Friday, his publicist said Sunday. Haden, a sideman in saxophonist Ornette Coleman's band in the 1960s, is known as a founding father of free jazz. His wife and four children were with him as his life ended following a long illness, ECM Records spokeswoman Tina Pelikan said. The National Endowment for the Arts named Haden a "jazz master" in 2012 for his long career as a musician, composer, bandleader, educator, producer and activist.
