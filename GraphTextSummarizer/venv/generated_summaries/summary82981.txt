Elena Ceausescu was executed by firing squad along with her husband in the last anti-Communist revolution of 1989 in Eastern Europe. His remains were "quite well preserved," his son-in-law Mircea Oprean told Romania's Pro TV. -- A medical team exhumed the body of former Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu on Wednesday to try to ensure that the remains are really his, Romanian state media reported. He became infamous for his lavish lifestyle, and started to build a palace for himself in the 1980s with miles of marbles floors and thousands of crystal chandeliers. Ceausescu was executed on Christmas Day 1989 in the only post-Berlin-Wall-fall of a Communist regime in Eastern Europe that got really bloody.
