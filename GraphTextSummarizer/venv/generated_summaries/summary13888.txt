President Barack Obama on Wednesday outlined a foreign policy vision of "might doing right," arguing that modern pragmatism requires both a strong military and the diplomatic tools of alliances and sanctions to exert influence and provide global leadership. "America must always lead on the world stage," Obama said, and the military "always will be the backbone of that leadership," but U.S. military action "cannot be the only -- or even primary -- component of our leadership in every instance. One of the most strident critics, Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona, responded Wednesday by telling CNN that America remained mighty but Obama has failed to follow through on threats such as his "red line" for U.S. military strikes if the Syrian government used chemical weapons. " Critics of Obama's foreign policy also have said the President's clear assertion that military force is off the table in Ukraine sends the wrong message to other countries -- namely China -- that have their own territorial disputes with neighbor states. On Wednesday, Obama reiterated his policy that the United States will used military force, "unilaterally if necessary," when its people are threatened, its livelihood is at stake or allies are in danger, but he said the threshold was higher when global issues "do not pose a direct threat" to the nation.
