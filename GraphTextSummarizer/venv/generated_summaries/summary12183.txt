-- A truck carrying nearly 400 sheep tipped over while on an Australia overpass, sending the helpless animals tumbling down on shocked drivers below, CNN affiliate Network Ten reported. "We looked up and we could see the truck flip on its side and then the next minute, we were underneath and yeah, raining sheep doesn't happen everyday," said Kristy Davis, a witness. The incident occurred Thursday night in Laverton North near Melbourne. Animal welfare officials said the road was littered with dead and dying sheep. "They were confronted with a very horrific, very distressing sight," the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals said.
