Bangana said at least 200 people had been confirmed dead by Monday morning, and many bodies may be "unfindable." Ministry of Information press attache Bruno Impene said hospitals were overflowing, with the wounded lying in the corridors. -- A series of explosions at an ammunition depot killed 200 people and wounded about 2,000 more in Brazzaville, the capital of Africa's Republic of Congo, Congolese officials said Monday. The explosions occurred shortly after 8 a.m. Sunday (2 a.m. ET) when a fire at the depot set off a cache of tank shells, said Betu Bangana, director of protocol for President Denis Sassou-Nguesso. The force of the explosions broke windows up to 5 km (3 miles) away in Kinshasa, the capital of the neighboring Democratic Republic of the Congo. The DRC's military responded by putting tanks and troops on the streets and the banks of the Congo River, which separates the two cities, until it became clear that no attack on the capital was under way.
