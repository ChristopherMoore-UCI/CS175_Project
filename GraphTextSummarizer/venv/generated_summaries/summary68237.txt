-- President Barack Obama on Tuesday praised Congress' decision to extend the payroll tax cut while also pushing legislators to enact the rest of what the administration characterizes as its economic support plan for the middle class. " Obama outlined a number of proposals believed to have little or no chance of winning approval among Republicans on Capitol Hill, most notably the so-called "Buffett Rule" designed to ensure people earning more than $1 million annually pay at least a 30% tax rate. The roughly $100 billion measure, a key part of Obama's economic recovery plan, has reduced how much 160 million American workers pay into Social Security on their first $110,100 in wages. The president declared he is prepared to move ahead with his domestic agenda whenever possible with or without congressional support -- a message with clear political overtones in the current election season. The payroll tax issue proved problematic for Republicans, who were caught between competing goals of providing the tax cut and paying for it.
