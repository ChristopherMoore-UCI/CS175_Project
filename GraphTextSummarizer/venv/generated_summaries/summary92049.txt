And I think a closer examination of why that's the case reveals quite a bit about language and how it plays a role (and doesn't) in modern America. When immigrants bring foreign languages to our towns and cities, we generally haven't met them in the middle. Learning a second language opens up new worlds, new neural pathways -- even new personalities. And I think it's representative of where we as Americans, in general, stand as language learners. We don't expect anyone who grew up in the United States -- especially those whose parents grew up in America, too -- to be able to speak a foreign language, or we don't expect them to do it well.
