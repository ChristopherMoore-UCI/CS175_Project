Ebola patients fled during an attack at a health care facility in Monrovia, Liberia, on Saturday, Liberian National Police spokesman Sam Collins said. "It was an attack from people afraid of Ebola," Collins told CNN. Tolbert Nyenswah, Liberia's assistant minister of health, told CNN that as of Friday, 154 people in the nation have died from Ebola. Ebola can be contracted by coming into contact with infected organs and body fluids such as blood, saliva, urine and other secretions. On Sunday, Cameroon's information minister told CNN that the country was closing its border with Nigeria over Ebola concerns.
