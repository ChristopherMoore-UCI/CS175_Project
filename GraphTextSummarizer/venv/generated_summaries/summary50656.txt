CNN-sponsored Lotus will now be known as Caterham F1 from next year onwards, while Virgin will be renamed Marussia F1. The penultimate race of the campaign is on Sunday in Abu Dhabi, before the season-ending Brazilian Grand Prix on November 27. Russian carmaker Marussia Motors purchased a significant stake in Virgin in November 2010, and has had its logo present on the car throughout the 2011 season. Team Lotus, Lotus Renault and Virgin were all given permission to alter their names following a meeting of the Federation Internationale de l'Automobile's F1 commission in Geneva last week. "We are very pleased that our chassis name change has been approved," team principal Eric Boullier told Renault's official website.
