Chinese 30th seed Peng Shuai eliminated the conqueror of U.S. Open champion Sam Stosur, winning 6-1 6-2 against 21-year-old Dutch player Arantxa Rus to match last year's effort of reaching the fourth round. Radwanska, a quarterfinalist in 2008 and 2009, will next face 20-year-old Italian qualifier Camila Giorgi -- making only her second grand slam appearance after a first-round loss last year. However, the Russian must first get through a rematch with German 15th seed Sabine Lesicki, who she beat in last year's semifinals before losing the title match against Petra Kvitova. Kerber, who reached the last eight at Roland Garros and the semifinals at the 2011 U.S. Open, defeated American 28th seed Christina McHale 6-2 6-3 to achieve her best result on the hallowed grass turf. Peng will next play Maria Kirilenko following the Russian 17th seed's 6-3 6-1 crushing of Romania's Sorana Cirstea -- who shocked French Open champion Li Na in the second round.
