When Guy Scott takes the reins in Zambia, he'll become the first white African President in sub-Saharan Africa since apartheid. Scott makes history Scott was born in 1944 in Livingstone, Northern Rhodesia, which later became Zambia after independence from Britain. Zambia's constitution requires fresh elections within 90 days. He later took a break from the ministry and ventured into wheat and strawberry farming. "Dr Scott's participation in Zambian politics was inspired by his late father, who was an ally of Zambian nationalists and a founder of anti-colonial government newspapers including the African Mail, now the Zambia Daily Mail," a profile on his party website says.
