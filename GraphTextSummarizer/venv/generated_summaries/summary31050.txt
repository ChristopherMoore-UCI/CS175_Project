FIFA set date for Bin Hammam verdict Bin Hammam withdrew from the presidential election in the wake of the accusations, with Blatter maintaining the position for a fourth term. -- Former FIFA presidential hopeful Mohamed Bin Hammam believes that soccer's ruling body has already decided he is guilty of bribery. "I want you all to know that my legal team and I remain confident that the case and the evidence presented against me are weak and unsubstantiated," Bin Hammam said via his official website on Friday. Jack Warner, the former head of football in North and Central America and the Caribbean, faced similar charges to Bin Hammam. The ex-head of the Asian Football Confederation was suspended pending an investigation on May 29, having been accused of trying to buy votes in his bid to win the July 1 election against incumbent Sepp Blatter.
