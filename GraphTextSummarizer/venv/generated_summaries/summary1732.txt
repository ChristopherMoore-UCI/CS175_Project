Florence and art is something that is part of my life and is part of myself. Designer Roberto Cavalli in Florence My City, My Life spoke to Cavalli about his fashion creations, his inspiration and his city of Florence. I believe Florence has changed less than many other cities because we are more conservative, we try to keep everything that is fantastic, everything that is unbelievable, in Florence. I need to continue to breathe art, the air that is in Florence, to walk in my city, to walk in my streets. Florence has helped me to judge what is beautiful, what is less beautiful, gave me the feeling of art.
