" Hicks was in the theater next door to the one in which a gunman opened fire at a midnight showing of the new Batman movie on Friday in Aurora. -- McKayla Hicks sat in the courtroom Monday and stared at the man accused of a shooting spree that left her with a bullet in her jaw, killed a dozen people, and traumatized a community. "I saw him and he's just this freak lookin' dude with some orange hair," the 17-year-old high school student said, calling suspect James Holmes "pathetic looking." "You could feel in the room all the anger that everyone had for him," she said. "He tried to kill people," Hicks said. Lori Schafer helped save her that night, and was in court with her Monday.
