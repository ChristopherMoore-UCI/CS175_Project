Search for the missing, found Sister keeps vigil Outside, Maxi's half sister, Carline Joaceus, kept vigil. But Maxi, a deeply spiritual young woman, chanted the Lord's Prayer until she was discovered by Peruvian and Nicaraguan rescuers and pulled out of the rubble of Port-au-Prince's GOC University on January 18. Maxi said she plans to become a nurse now, as she had always wanted, so she can give to others the same second chance at life. In early January, Maxi was busy studying for final exams. Buried under a crumbled building, Falone Maxi marked time by the roar of tractors and bulldozers, by the sound of voices.
