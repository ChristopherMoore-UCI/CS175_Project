"Fitness has changed massively from the days when jockeys were just turning up at the races and were drinking," flat racing jockey Martin Lane told CNN. In the English town of Newmarket, ex-jockey Richard Perham runs a boot camp for jockeys at the British Racing School. It is used, along with other simulators like Perham's own Rideaway device, to help jockeys stay balanced -- and stay on the horse. "Balance and fitness are equally important for jockeys but balance must come first," explained Perham. But, in the same way that motorsport drivers rely on the horsepower of their car engines, aren't jockeys mainly relying on real horsepower to win races?
