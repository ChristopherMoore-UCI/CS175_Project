But Press TV said the type of bullet that killed her is not used by Iranian security forces. A boy lights a candle beside a photo of Neda during a protest against Iranian elections in Frankfurt, Germany. "This death of Neda is very suspicious," Ambassador Mohammad Hassan Ghadiri said. "The bullet was apparently fired from a small caliber pistol that's not used by Iranian security forces," the Press TV anchor said. -- The woman whose death has come to symbolize Iranian resistance to the government's official election results did not die the way the opposition claims, government-backed Press TV said Sunday.
