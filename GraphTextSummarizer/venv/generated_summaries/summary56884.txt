-- Spain international Santi Cazorla has joined English Premier League club Arsenal from Malaga on a long-term deal. With the start of the Premier League season less than a fortnight away, the focus will now switch to whether Arsenal captain Robin van Persie will stay at the Emirates. Cazorla's arrival at Arsenal follows the club's summer signings of Germany forward Lukas Podolski and France international striker Olivier Giroud. "I've thought long and hard about it, but I have decided not to extend my contract," said Van Persie. The versatile midfielder has been signed for an undisclosed sum -- believed to be around $23.5 million -- with the length of his contract also unspecified by Arsenal.
