Cesar Millan has been showcasing his talents as "The Dog Whisperer" since 2004, teaching dog owners how to train their energetic and oftentimes misbehaving canines. " Understanding dog behavior is key to creating a lasting relationship with a dog, Millan said. Next, he said future dog owners need to consider how they will set boundaries and limitations for their pet. Recently in Atlanta, Millan shared his tips for adopting a shelter dog with Sara and Casey Giessen, a married couple who recently decided they are ready to adopt a dog. Millan strongly supports adopting pets, but he warns that taking in a shelter dog based on pity isn't in the best interest of the dog.
