"We can confirm there was an unfortunate accident as John Terry left Stamford Bridge last night," a Chelsea spokesman told PA. -- England soccer star John Terry has again been engulfed in controversy after his car hit a club steward on Tuesday night following Chelsea's Champions League defeat by Inter Milan. The 29-year-old Terry has recently been at the center of a media storm following revelations about his alleged affair with the ex-partner of his former Chelsea teammate Wayne Bridge. Italian champions Inter, managed by Terry's former Chelsea coach Jose Mourinho, won 1-0 on the night thanks to a late goal by Samuel Eto'o which sealed a 3-1 aggregate victory. Meanwhile, the Premier League confirmed on Wednesday that bottom club Portsmouth have been docked nine points after going into administration last month.
