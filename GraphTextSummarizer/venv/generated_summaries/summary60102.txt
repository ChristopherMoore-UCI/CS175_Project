-- Days after Columbus Short's wife publicly alleged he threatened to kill her and himself with a knife, the actor on the hit ABC TV series "Scandal" has called it quits. "At this time I must confirm my exit from a show I've called home for 3 years, with what is the most talented ensemble on television today," said Short in an official statement released by his publicist on Friday. " The actor has been to jail at least three times in the past three months after accusations of violence, according to court filings. "As much as I would like to provide my side of events, my counsel has instructed me that a Court of law is the only and proper venue to deal with such matters," Short said at the time, in a statement released to CNN through his publicist. The Season 3 finale of "Scandal" aired April 17 on ABC.
