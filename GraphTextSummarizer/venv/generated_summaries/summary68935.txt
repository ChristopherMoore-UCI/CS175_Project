"We'll possibly never know if these particular ones do have water oceans or signs of life," she said. The telescope's spectrometer allows scientists to look for wobbles in the motion of a star, which happens in response to the gravity of nearby planets. "All these planets that we're finding are quite different than planets in our own solar system," Borucki said.
