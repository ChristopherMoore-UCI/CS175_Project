Caregivers and family members shower, dress and feed Stow, who takes 13 medications a day, said sister Bonnie Stow. Federal authorities plan to take Norwood into custody, if released by local authorities, because Norwood faces a federal charge of a being a felon in possession of firearms, said spokesman Thom Mrozek with the U.S. Attorney's office in Los Angeles. Prosecutors say the men attacked Stow, now 45, in the Dodgers' stadium parking lot after the Opening Day game on March 31, 2011. "Mr. Stow will be forever trapped in the medical condition" that the men put him in, he said during the sentencing. "You blindsided Mr. Stow," the judge said.
