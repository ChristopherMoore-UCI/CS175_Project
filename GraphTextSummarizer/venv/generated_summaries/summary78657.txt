However, CNN was able to obtain footage of piles of clothing, tents and tarps made by police as they cleaned out the park. On Monday, police in Oakland, California, conducted a similar raid when they moved in to the Occupy encampment at Frank Ogawa Plaza near City Hall and tore down tents. The order does not prevent Zuccotti park demonstrations, but says protesters' First Amendment rights not do include remaining there "along with their tents, structures, generators, and other installations to the exclusion of the owner's reasonable rights and duties to maintain" the area. New York City Council member Ydanis Rodriguez was among those arrested, after he rushed down to the park when he heard police were evicting protesters, his spokesman, David Segal, told CNN. Later Tuesday, police said that protesters seeking to claim personal property that was removed from the park can do so starting Wednesday, at a specific Sanitation Department garage.
