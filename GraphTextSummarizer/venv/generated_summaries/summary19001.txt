Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva called an emergency meeting of top officials after the Thursday night attacks, which followed weeks of protests aimed at toppling his administration. Abhisit declared a state of emergency April 7, hours after anti-government demonstrators stormed the country's parliament. Meanwhile, pro-government demonstrators in multicolored shirts have also mobilized to support Abhisit during the crisis. Thursday's explosions took place near an elevated train station where the Red Shirts are gathered, said Col. Sansern Kaewkumnerd, spokesman for the Center for Resolutions under Emergency Situation. They want Abhisit to dissolve the government, hold new elections and leave the country.
