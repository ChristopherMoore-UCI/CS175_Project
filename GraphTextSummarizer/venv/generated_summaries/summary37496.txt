If asteroids as big as DA14 pass close to Earth once every decade or two, and meteors as large as the Chelyabinsk one impact once every 100 years (a similar meteor having caused the Tunguska event in 1908), the chance of both events happening on any one day are indeed very small: 1 in 3,650 days times 1 in 36,500 days, or about 1 in 100 million -- not odds you would bet against. So we don't witness most meteor impacts. It makes sense that smaller asteroids pass Earth more frequently and, on average, closer. For example, the frequency of meteor impacts could be much larger and our estimates too low because we don't notice most of them. Meteors are rocky bodies that enter the Earth's atmosphere.
