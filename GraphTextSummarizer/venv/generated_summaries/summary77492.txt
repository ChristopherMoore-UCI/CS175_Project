"These high profile projects can highlight the importance of retrofitting and cause people to think about installing renewable energy systems on the micro level," says John Alker, director of policy at the UK Green Building Council. Alker is enthusiastic about the benefits of retrofitting famous landmarks, but warns that a balance must be found so that the integrity of historic buildings can be maintained. But while the new-look lighting will go some way to accentuating the structure's unmistakeable features, one green building expert believes retrofitting famous monuments can do more than just add to their aesthetic. -- One of London's most iconic landmarks is being given a green energy makeover as part of the city's preparations to host the most environmentally friendly Olympic Games in history. "But in many cases much of what can be done -- like improving insulation, replacing windows and making air conditioning more efficient -- doesn't necessarily have to be visibly noticeable or negligible on the aesthetic value of the building," he adds.
