And Obama's disapproval rating soared 9 points to 54% since mid-May. CNN Poll: Obama approval falls as controversies pile up Even more surprising: The overall decline in his approval rating was partially fueled by a plunge in support from younger Americans, a huge base of Obama's support. "One explanation may be that younger Americans are more likely to feel they are personally affected by the surveillance programs," said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. So what's behind the dramatic shift of younger Americans, who along with nonwhite voters had been the most loyal part of the Obama coalition? "Today, there are only minor differences between older and younger Americans on that measure, but a month ago, two-thirds of younger Americans considered Obama honest -- at least 10 points higher than any other age category. So maybe one reason why Obama fell so far with younger Americans is that he had farther to fall," he said.
