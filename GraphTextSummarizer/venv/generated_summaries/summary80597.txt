There is no way to predict whether there will be a sudden influx in demand for Michael Jackson memorabilia and merchandise, Ohlinger said. Officials at eBay said that compared with the daily average of the week prior, Thursday's gross merchandise volume for Jackson memorabilia increased by 275 percent and sold items increased by 210 percent. That's the hope at least for many offering Michael Jackson related merchandise and memorabilia, including autographed items and domain names, in the wake of his surprising death. There were Michael Jackson gloves (sparkly, of course), masks, wigs, sunglasses and fedora hats. As of Friday, items purported to be autographed photos of Jackson were ranging in price from just over $5 to several thousand dollars.
