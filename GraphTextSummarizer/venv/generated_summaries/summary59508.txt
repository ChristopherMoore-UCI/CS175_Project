South Carolina GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham, who has expressed interest in a presidential bid, told CNN last month that it would be "difficult, if not impossible" for the GOP to win the White House in 2016 without passing immigration reform. One, given in Spanish by Florida Rep. Carlos Curbelo, asked the President to "cooperate" with congressional Republicans to make immigration reform happen. Dueling official Republican responses to Tuesday's State of the Union address meant to highlight the party's alternate vision for the nation instead underscored the GOP's deep divide on immigration reform. House Republicans had said Curbelo would be delivering a Spanish translation of Ernst's speech in a press release that went out last week, but by Wednesday morning, that note had been deleted from the release. But both Republicans hail from competitive swing states, and represent voting blocs that could be key to the GOP's hopes of winning the White House in 2016.
