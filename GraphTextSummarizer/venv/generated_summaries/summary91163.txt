In June, AQIM executed a British man after the British government did not give in to its demand to release Abu Qatada, a Jordanian considered to be al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden's right-hand man in Europe. In its message on Sunday, the group referred to the execution, saying, "We also call upon the French public opinion and the hostage's family to pressure (French Prime Minister Nicolas) Sarkozy's government to prevent the repetition of Golden (Gordon) Brown's folly against his British citizen. About 2004, it joined forces with al Qaeda and extended its reach across North and West Africa, carrying out a spate of kidnappings and deadly attacks. Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) made its demand in a statement dated Sunday, said the Washington-based Intelcenter, which monitors Islamist Web sites. Camatte was abducted four days before the group kidnapped three Spanish aid workers from neighboring Mauritania.
