States and localities have been raising sales taxes for years now. Meantime, there are already 17% worth of various taxes and users fees on cell phones, which the new proposal would only increase. The president is suggesting that the Federal Communications Commission raise the charges on cell phone users -- that is, basically, all of us (there are today more cell phones than people in the United States) -- by $4 a year for the next three years. Obama was unable to deliver on his campaign pledge to raise income taxes in his first term, but he did raise federal cigarette taxes, for example, by 64 cents a pack in 2009, to just over a dollar, and he recently proposed nearly doubling that level. Raising tax rates on the rich is a once-a-decade affair at best.
