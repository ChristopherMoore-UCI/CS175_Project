With Tilley, Freud said he was "very aware of all kinds of spectacular things to do with her size, like amazing craters and things one's never seen before," according to the 2002 interview with the Tate. -- A picture of an overweight woman lying naked on a couch, painted by British artist Lucian Freud, set a record Tuesday night for the most money paid for a painting by a living artist. She had been introduced to the artist through a mutual friend, Australian performance artist Leigh Bowery, who also posed for Freud. That may have been precisely the aim of Freud, who told London's Tate Gallery in 2002 that he wanted his paintings to "astonish, disturb, seduce, convince." He is the grandson of psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud and came to London from Germany when he was a child.
