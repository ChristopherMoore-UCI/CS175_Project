League chiefs said Lazio supporters in the Curva Nord stand twice directed sustained abuse at the players involved in the traditional Serie A curtain raiser. Organisers of Italy's top-flight championship Serie A said in a statement that it had found Lazio fans guilty of "shouts and chants expressive of racial discrimination against three players of the opposing team" during the Italian Supercup final Sunday. Italian football club Lazio must play their opening home game of the season with a section of their fans banned from the match as punishment for racial abuse. France midfielder Paul Pogba was one of the Juventus players targeted by abuse by some of Lazio's more hardcore supporters. Last season Lazio fans were found guilty of racist behaviour by Uefa four times.
