But generations of Senate leaders from Henry Clay to Bill Frist have felt compelled to seek changes in Senate rules to make the chamber a more governable place. Ratchet down the number of votes required to invoke cloture The first cloture vote would require 60 votes, as is required under Senate rules. Twice this week, the Senate has opened debate with its party leaders engaged in a caustic battle over Reid's plans to seek changes to Senate rules in January. Still, many argue that Republicans go overboard in their willingness to exploit Senate rules. Today, with Democrats in control, I again think changes in Senate rules are due: Senate should limit the number of motions subject to a filibuster A top priority should be to eliminate filibusters of the "motion to proceed" to a bill and the three motions that are required to send a bill to conference with the House.
