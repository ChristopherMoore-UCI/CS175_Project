Bundy felt comfortable lecturing a reporter about race and slavery because for weeks he'd been puffed up by right-leaning media outlets, potential Republican presidential candidates, and current GOP officeholders. Before he wondered if "Blacks might not be better off as slaves," Bundy received support and encouragement from three Republican senators, two of them (Ted Cruz and Rand Paul) with presidential ambitions. And then there's the list of state and local Republicans around the country who supported Bundy, including Texas Gov. Rick Perry, another presidential aspirant. That's one of the points Tara Wall makes in her op-ed attacking CNN for its coverage of Bundy and his self-declared "Range War." The Republican elected officials and their allies supported Bundy's cause cÃ©lÃ¨bre with their actions and rhetoric from the beginning.
