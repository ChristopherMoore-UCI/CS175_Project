It meant that Frankel become detached from his brother and pacemaker Bullet Train, who was meanwhile being held up by jockey Ian Mongan in order to bring his more talented brother back into the race. Caught napping at the start, Frankel appeared to stumble out of the blocks, losing lengths on Cirrus des Aigles and Natheniel, who took up the early lead in the rain-softened ground. -- It wasn't his flashiest performance, but Frankel made sure his final race was also his most dramatic as he overhauled French rival Cirrus des Aigles to maintain his unbeaten record and cap a remarkable three-year career at the summit of his sport. The red-hot favorite powered through the field to close the gap on Cirrus des Aigles, officially the second-best horse in the world, with Nathaniel already beaten. The early blunder left jockey Tom Queally with a dilemma -- either kick on to catch up with the leaders, or settle Frankel in towards the back of the field and hope his sheer class would prevail.
