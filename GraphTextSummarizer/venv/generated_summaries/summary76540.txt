-- Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson confirmed on Tuesday that Wayne Rooney wants to leave the English Premier League club in a series of interviews aimed at ending speculation over the soccer star's future. " Ferguson said United chief executive David Gill had begun new contract negotiations with Rooney before the World Cup started in June. Ferguson has rarely selected Rooney in his starting line-up since newspaper reports emerged last month with claims about alleged marital infidelities, at first saying he was protecting the player and then that he had an ankle injury. Rooney then played in the Champions League clash with Scottish club Rangers, but came off with an injury. " Meanwhile, Rooney has been ruled out of Wednesday's home Champions League clash with Turkish club Bursaspor after suffering another ankle injury in training.
