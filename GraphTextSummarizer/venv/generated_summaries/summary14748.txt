Facebook, meanwhile, will also reportedly soon enable members to add location details to their status updates and release an API so other apps can offer location ability to Facebook users. Without a clear picture of what they're getting in return, users may be hesitant to share location data. During its Chirp developer conference in April, Twitter announced the launch of its annotations feature, which gives users the ability to attach metadata to tweets, including location. Twitter has yet to clearly communicate to users what they get in return for adding location to their tweets. So how they roll out location to users and how well they do at making users feel that their information is safe may be make or break for location on Facebook.
