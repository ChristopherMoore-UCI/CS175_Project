-- March 2012 will go down as the warmest March in the United States since record-keeping began in 1895, NOAA said Monday. There were 223 preliminary tornado reports during March, a month that averages 80 tornadoes, according to NOAA's Storm Prediction Center. A persistent weather pattern during the month of March led to 25 states east of the Rockies having their warmest March on record, NOAA said. In addition, the three-month period of January, February and March was the warmest first quarter ever recorded in the Lower 48 states. A staggering 15,292 warm temperature records were broken, (7,755 record highs and 7,517 record high overnight lows), according to Chris Vaccaro, spokesperson for NOAA.
