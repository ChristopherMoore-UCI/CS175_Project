The president's doctor said the CT scan was normal and that Obama's symptoms "are consistent with soft tissue inflammation related to acid reflux." White House press secretary Josh Earnest said the President was not sedated, so no transfer of authority was necessary. Dr. Ronny L. Jackson, Obama's physician, issued a statement: "This morning, an ear, nose and throat specialist from Fort Belvoir Medical Center conducted a fiber optic exam, under my supervision, of the President's throat based on symptoms of sore throat over the past couple weeks. President Barack Obama underwent a routine CT scan Saturday afternoon while visiting Walter Reed National Military Medical Center because of a sore throat, according to the White House and his doctor. However, Vice President Joe Biden and other senior White House staffers "were kept up to speed," Earnest said. " "They brought in an ears, nose and throat doctor into the White House and placed a scope down the mouth and looking at  the back of throat to see what was causing his discomfort," he said.
