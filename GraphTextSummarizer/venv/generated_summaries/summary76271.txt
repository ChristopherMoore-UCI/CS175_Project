And the presidential election this weekend, once hailed as Egypt's big step toward democracy, is now satirized in an online mock-up of a video game pitting a bare-chested Ahmed Shafik, the last prime minister under ousted President Hosni Mubarak, against the bearded Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood. "Electing president in the absence of constitution and parliament is electing an 'emperor' with more powers than deposed dictator. SCAF, which has been in control of the country since Mubarak's ouster, claimed full legislative power. She said the Brotherhood stood against the idea of creating a presidential council mandated with powers of administration until a new constitution could be drawn up. After the ruling, speculation rose that Morsi, the Brotherhood's candidate, would pull out now that his party's pillar of power had crumbled.
