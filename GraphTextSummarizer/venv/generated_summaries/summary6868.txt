Then the next week, there were more phone calls to her office from deaf immigrants who had entered the country illegally looking for asylum. Such cases seek to expand the criteria for who qualifies for asylum, said Bob Dane, spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, an anti-illegal-immigration group. "The law provides for certain groups to ask for protection in the U.S. Disabilities is one of those groups," There are five traditional categories covered by U.S. asylum law: race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a specific social group. But Stephen Yale-Loehr, an asylum law expert at Cornell University Law School, said that the boundaries of asylum law have always been a busy place for novel claims. According to Bajramovic, these are the first petitions for asylum by deaf people on the grounds that they are persecuted for their disability.
