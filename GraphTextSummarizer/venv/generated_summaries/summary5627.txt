Moses, now 37, said that former New York Police Department Officer Louis Scarcella beat him, wrote the words of a confession he was forced to sign and smudged his signature, according to Ron Kuby, Moses' lawyer. "Moses knew many of the people in that area implicated by gang violence," Kuby told CNN on Monday. Kuby said there were multiple red flags raised through the trial, despite Moses being found guilty and sentenced to 16Â½ years to life. According to Kuby, none of the six eyewitnesses identified Moses at trial, though two said they identified him earlier in a lineup. Moses also insisted on testifying in court, a rare occurrence often insisted upon by the innocent, Kuby said.
