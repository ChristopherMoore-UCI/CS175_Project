"This year's statistics are informed by a number of complex and shifting factors, most notably the 68% increase in migration from countries other than Mexico, predominately from Central America, and a 14% drop in Mexican migration since fiscal year 2013," Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said in a statement. The debate over illegal immigration in the United States is often tied to the relationship the country has with Mexico, but the flow of migration are slowing from Mexico and increasing from Central America. The changes in migration reflect the improving economic situation in Mexico, and the worsening security situation in Central America. For at least four years, the trend has been the similar -- decreases in Mexican migration and increases in migrants from Central America, the official said. ICE noted that its removals reflected the same trend of more Central Americans and less Mexicans.
