"This fight against Texas' sham abortion law is not over. -- The Supreme Court for now has ordered Texas not to enforce a law that had effectively shut down several clinics that provide abortions. The Center for Reproductive Rights had sued Texas this past spring, on behalf of a coalition of abortion clinics. Critics contend the law, in addition to eliminating abortion across huge swaths of the state, will further deny access to many women in rural communities and will force women to seek dangerous "back-alley" abortions. " Clinic supporters said before the bill was enacted, there were 41 facilities in Texas providing abortions.
