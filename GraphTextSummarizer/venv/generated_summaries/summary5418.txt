The U.S. Sentencing Commission voted Thursday to reduce sentencing guidelines that could shorten prison stays for about 70% of federal drug trafficking defendants, backing a proposal supported by the Justice Department and some conservative lawmakers. He said legislation he is championing with some Republican lawmakers, such as Sen. Rand Paul, and Democrats, such as Sen. Patrick Leahy, "would take further steps to reduce our overburdened prison system." Holder, in a statement Thursday, called on Congress to make further changes to sentencing guidelines, particularly those that reduce the discretion of judges on how to deal with drug offenders. "This modest reduction in drug penalties is an important step toward reducing the problem of prison overcrowding at the federal level in a proportionate and fair manner," said Judge Patti B. Saris, chair of the commission. The unanimous vote by the commission sets in motion a change in the formula used to determine sentences for federal drug offenders.
