Solomon has to learn to answer insults or bear whippings with silence, to pretend he's a toady who can't read or write, and the cruelty of that process becomes the film's way of dramatizing the unnaturalness of slavery. But then, after showing too much pride, Solomon gets sold off to Edwin Epps (Michael Fassbender), a seething plantation owner who's a kind of diabolical psychologist of sadism. The scalding power of McQueen's artistry begins with this: He uses the fact that Solomon wasn't born into human bondage to draw us into the experience of slavery. Based on actual events, it begins in 1841 and tells the story of a free black man from Saratoga Springs, N.Y., a musician named Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor), who walks around in a natty gray suit, secure in the courtly modesty of his life as a husband and father of two. 12 Years a Slave lets us stare at the primal sin of America with open eyes, and at moments it's hard to watch, yet it's a film of such emotion that in telling the story of a life that gets taken away, it lets us touch what life is.
