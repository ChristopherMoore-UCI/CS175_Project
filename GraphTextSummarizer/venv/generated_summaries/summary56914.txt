In September the National Transportation Safety Board recommended the Federal Aviation Administration require large planes and other aircraft on which the wingtips are not easily visible from the cockpit to have cameras or other devices to monitor the wings. The US Airways plane that was hit was parked in a remote area away from the gate where aircraft are stored overnight. The Spirit aircraft has resumed flying, while the US Airways plane is out of service for inspection and repair of its damaged tail cone, the airlines reported. "After landing and while taxiing to the gate, our aircraft made contact with another parked aircraft," Spirit spokeswoman Misty Pinson confirmed to CNN. "An A320 was parked in an approved parking spot when it was struck in the tail by another aircraft," Andrew Christie, a US Airways spokesman said.
