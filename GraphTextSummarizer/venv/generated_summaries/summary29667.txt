In Hambantota on the south coast of Sri Lanka, a parent stumbled through mangled debris in the area they assumed their house had once stood, looking for lost children. Residents who had lost everything, who had seen horror beyond imagination, running up to us to offer a face mask to help cope with the unmistakeable stench of death, trying to give us a bottle of water. But how do you tell a six-year-old an address no longer means anything -- houses and roads are gone and in too many cases, so are families. But rather than wait for outside help to arrive, the workers cleared the building of mud, debris and bodies so they could go back to work. One man even apologized we were not seeing his country at its best, begging me to come back when it was all over so I could experience the true beauty and hospitality of the island and its people.
