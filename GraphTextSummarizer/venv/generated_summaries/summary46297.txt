But he has made a life choice by going to Brazil," AC Milan coach Massimiliano Allegri told reporters ahead of the resumption of the Serie A program on Thursday. Mutu has twice been banned for drug use, while with English club Chelsea in 2004 and last year at Fiorentina. Romania striker Adrian Mutu may be seeking a new club after his Italian side Fiorentina threatened to take action following his training-ground walkout on Wednesday. The club released a statement saying the 31-year-old would not play in Thursday's match against Bologna, and that he had left himself liable for possible legal action. Tottenham's Premier League rivals Newcastle, who have also been linked with the 35-year-old former England captain along with Blackburn, tied up a permanent deal for France international Hatem Ben Arfa.
