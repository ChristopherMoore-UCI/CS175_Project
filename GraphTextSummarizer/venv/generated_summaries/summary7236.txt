In this small town, south of Memphis, Tennessee, his picture is back up and people are wondering how someone who committed such a brutal crime could be pardoned by their former Gov. Haley Barbour -- and law enforcement authorities can't seem to find Ozment. Mississippi authorities are looking for Ozment. Authorities said they believe Ozment may be in northern Mississippi. "It's just an every minute, constant, in the back of your mind, where is he, what is he doing?" said Mary McAbee, the sister of Rick Montgomery, the store clerk shot to death by Ozment. He was there in court when Ozment pleaded guilty to murder in the case and was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.
