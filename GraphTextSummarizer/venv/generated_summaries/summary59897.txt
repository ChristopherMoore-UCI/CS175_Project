Snowden's father reacts to Obama statement Lon Snowden appeared on ABC with his lawyer, Bruce Fein, who said the idea that congressional committees, which knew about the classified telephone and e-mail surveillance programs that Snowden disclosed through leaks to media, would have protected him as a whistleblower, is absurd. If Edward Snowden's NSA leaks led to changes in government policy, increased civil liberties protections and sparked a national dialogue, does it stand to reason that Edward Snowden is more whistleblower and patriot than traitor? And the president offered his own support for whistleblower protections for government employees in the intelligence community as evidence that he and his administration want whistleblowers to come forward. Obama: Snowden can make his case in court Edward Snowden, who has been granted temporary asylum in Russia, hasn't spoken up about the president's remarks, but his father did so on ABC News. "No, I don't think Mr. Snowden was a patriot," Obama said.
