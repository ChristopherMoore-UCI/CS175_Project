Heavy rain was still falling Thursday morning across parts of the country. But officials were able to restore electricity to many thousands of homes that had lost power. The most recent numbers released by the Central Disaster Relief Agency indicated that much of the death toll comes from landslides triggered by the rain. In Chuncheon, 13 people were killed by landslides, while 15 were killed by the same phenomenon in Seoul. Earlier, the agency warned that hundreds of families had lost their homes.
