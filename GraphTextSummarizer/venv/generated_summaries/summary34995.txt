She ultimately had too much game -- and experience -- for the 19-year-old Keys, who made her debut in a grand slam semifinal after eliminating Williams' older sister, Venus, in her maiden grand slam quarterfinal Wednesday. " Williams is chasing a 19th grand slam title, which would separate the 33-year-old from retired legends Martina Navratilova and Chris Evert. Having reached the Australian Open final, she'll have to overcome longtime nemesis Serena Williams. If that's not enough, Williams has never lost a semifinal or final in Melbourne, her record improving to 11-0 after topping fellow American Madison Keys 7-6 (5) 6-2 Thursday in the semifinals. She was almost knocked out in the second round, needing to save a pair of match points against qualifier Alexandra Panova.
