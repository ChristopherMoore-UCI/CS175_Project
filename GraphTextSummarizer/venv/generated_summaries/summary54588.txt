"I think the government of Afghanistan has given the Olympic Committee too little assistance and enough attention hasn't been paid to it either," says Olympic Committee member Sami Darayi. Nikpai, who was swimming in the same pool as Malek when we visited, is keenly aware how difficult it is to excel in athletics in Afghanistan. "The budget that the government has allocated to the Olympic Committee is almost nothing while we have got more sport federations than a lot of other countries. " Malek uses two pools in the city to practice, but neither are Olympic regulation size. "I need support, I need help because I'm representing Afghanistan -- especially disabled people," says Malek, who more than anything, wants to swim for his country at the 2012 Paralympic Games in London.
