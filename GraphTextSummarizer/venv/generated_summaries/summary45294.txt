-- President Barack Obama is visiting China, Myanmar and Australia this week for a series of key regional summits. Second, the President has to demonstrate that he has the skills and commitment to complete the critical Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations and lock in a model for regional economic integration that sets high standards for openness before China starts using its economic weight to write new rules. Republicans generally support trade more than Democrats, so this could be an area for bipartisan cooperation -- except that the White House refused even to address the issue before the midterms and is now provoking a partisan fight with promises to bypass Congress on immigration, Iran negotiations and other issues. The President is speaking on U.S. Asia strategy in Australia at the end of the trip. The same polls show that experts across Asia see great resilience in the U.S. economy and expect -- and want -- America to continue leading Asian integration and cooperation in the future despite the sudden rise of Chinese power.
