" Clinton's use of private email was never hidden from anyone, according to a former State Department official. There were no big internal discussion among State Department lawyers, either, about Clinton's use of private email. "Neither career foreign service officers nor State Department lawyers suggested that Mrs. Clinton use a department email address," the Times reported, citing a person with direct knowledge of the inner workings of State Department under Mrs. Clinton. Clinton was not automatically in violation of State Department policy when she exclusively used a private email during her four years as America's top diplomat, the source added, contradicting other media on Thursday. If the department has to withhold documents, questions are likely to be raised about whether Clinton broke State Department guidance for transmuting sensitive but unclassified materials.
