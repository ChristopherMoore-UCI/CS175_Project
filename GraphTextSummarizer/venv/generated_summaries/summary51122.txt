The French Parliament recently passed new anti-terrorism legislation to respond to the increasing concern about French nationals traveling to Syria and Iraq to join ISIS or other jihadist groups. "Our goal is to build the capacity to fight foreign terrorist fighters within the rule of law -- so we can the stop flow of fighters into conflict regions, stem the tide of violence and aggressively combat violent extremism," Holder said. "These personnel will provide critical assistance to our allies in order to help prosecute those who return from the Syrian region bent on committing acts of terrorism," Holder said at press conference. Attorney General Eric Holder said Thursday that the Justice Department has dispatched lawyers to 14 countries -- four in the Balkan region and 10 in North Africa and the Middle East -- to work with policymakers there. One objective is to ramp up international cooperation in areas such as "information sharing, investigations and prosecutions, and countering violent extremism," Holder said.
