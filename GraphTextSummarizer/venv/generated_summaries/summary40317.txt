Belize authorities have said they only want to talk to McAfee about the November 11 shooting death of Gregory Faull, 52, an American businessman who was found dead in his home on the Caribbean island of Ambergris Caye. "I think the best thing is for him to come in and answer a couple of questions." Belize won't seek extradition of McAfee, Martinez said. Authorities aren't unfairly persecuting McAfee, and his attorney "should come to Belize and see what's happening here," Martinez said. A Belize police spokesman said authorities there believe McAfee could still be in their country, and they still want to question him in his neighbor's killing. Earlier Tuesday, a Belize police spokesman said authorities thought McAfee was still in that country, but declined to say why.
