The prospect of competing in the 2012 London Olympics left British rower Mohamed Sbihi with a big dilemma. If he does win gold, Sbihi will follow in the footsteps of some of the biggest names in British rowing. As a practicing Muslim, Sbihi, who has Moroccan family, should be starting his month-long Ramadan fast on July 21, abstaining from food and water during daylight hours. " Gold target Sbihi moved up to the eight crew in 2010, having raced in the pair and the four at youth level, and Britain looks set to renew its rivalry with Germany at the Games. Sbihi -- nicknamed "Moe" by his friends -- spent as much time as possible on the football pitch, but the visit of British rowing's talent identification scouts to his school in Surbiton persuaded him to try a different pursuit.
