-- Americans can expect a roaring debate over social issues in the discussion of  the next Supreme Court nominee, but in the end, President Obama's choice to succeed Justice John Paul Stevens is likely to be confirmed, CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin says. By Supreme Court standards, the last five years have been a period of enormous turnover. Toobin notes that one thing is fairly clear: Obama will probably begin his search for a new justice with the candidates he did not select when he picked Sonia Sotomayor for the court last year. She seems to meet many of the criteria that Obama has talked about: intelligence, integrity, a consensus-builder, and she was just confirmed by the Senate as solicitor general last year, which is not a guarantee that she would get confirmed but certainly can't hurt. Toobin: I think age is a huge factor, because one of the big appeals of Supreme Court nominations is that they serve for life, and a 49-year-old nominee will likely serve 10 years more than a 59-year-old nominee.
