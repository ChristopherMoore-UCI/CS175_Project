"This relationship has been irretrievably damaged to a point where marriage is now inconceivable," said Tsvangirai, 59, in a statement released late Wednesday, referring to the traditional marriage he had with 39-year-old Lorcadia Karimatsenga since November 18. Zimbabwean Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai announced Wednesday he had divorced his wife of less than two weeks, claiming that a "greater and thicker plot" had undermined his confidence in the relationship. Having been married for 31 years, the tendency is to want to use your experience as a yardstick for future relationships. "I was well-meaning and had good intentions to rebuild my family and start a new lease of life following the tragic passing on of my wife on 6 March 2009," Tsvangirai's statement said. Since the announcement of the marriage -- for which Tsvangirai reportedly paid $36,000 -- state and social media has been stalking Karimatsenga.
