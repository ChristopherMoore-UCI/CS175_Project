Is it a coincidence that Cody Horn is the daughter of Warner Bros. President Alan Horn? Scripted by Reid Carolin and inspired by Channing Tatum's own experiences as a Tampa stripper in the 1990s, "Magic Mike" is honest about the attractions of the job (money, girls, fun) without pretending it's a smart choice in the long run (too much fun, too many girls, not enough money). -- There are guy movies and girl movies, the latter of which the guys label "chick flicks" and often only ever see under protest. A college dropout who draws the line at taking any job that requires him to wear a tie, Adam is living with his big sister Brooke (Cody Horn) when his new buddy Mike ushers him into the delights of the Xquisite Male Dance Revue. Because Magic Mike (Channing Tatum) is a stripper, and so is his mentor, club owner Dallas (Matthew McConaughey), and his 19-year-old protÃ©gÃ©, Adam (Alex Pettyfer).
