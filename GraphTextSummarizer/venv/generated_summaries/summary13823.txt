Mayawati's blistering response comes a day after a U.S. cable released on WikiLeaks alleged she was a "paranoid dictator" and that "when she needed new sandals, her private jet flew empty to Mumbai to retrieve her preferred brand. But according to senior political journalist and co-author of Mayawati's autobiography Ajoy Bose, the self-glorification works for her constituency. On Tuesday, Mayawati rejected the allegations that she was "obsessed with becoming Prime Minister" saying they were "baseless" and indicative of "anti-Dalit mentality." As the U.S. diplomatic cable explained, "Dalits will remain with Mayawati regardless of poor governance, simply because the fact that one of their own is chief minister provides them heretofore unimaginable pride. As for whether these cables will affect Mayawati's political pull, Bose said: "She hasn't done that much for the Dalits, but when your leader is attacked by a class and caste which has been seen as the oppressor, then you automatically cling to your leader even more strongly, so all of this may actually be doing Mayawati a favor."
