The Portland Timbers soccer team and the NBA's Portland Trail Blazers have commemorated the  PDX carpet, as it's known by locals, by selling limited-edition T-shirts of the pattern in the team colors. "It is definitely an endearing statement of how much (Portlanders) like the pattern," says Kama Simonds, a communications officer for the Port of Portland. The impending demise of the carpet has also inspired a Facebook page, three Twitter accounts and an Instagram account -- all run independently by carpet groupies. The city of Portland is losing one of its most beloved institutions: its airport carpet. The new carpet design, created by Hennebery Eddy Architects, hasn't quite received the same love (though it does at least have its own Twitter account).
