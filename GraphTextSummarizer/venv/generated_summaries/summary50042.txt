There were salted Mopani worms in Botswana at the hotel buffet (black and squishy); sun-dried nsenene grasshoppers in Uganda (yellow and juicy); whole roasted goat in the desert in Mauritania (delicious), and chicken head and feet soup in Beijing (only unusual if you are not from China). Which all gets me, in a roundabout way, to Wang Fuming, the kingpin of cockroaches in Jinan, China. Scuttling legs Wang has a dream: To put roaches on plates and bowls throughout China as a high protein meal. Wang breeds American cockroaches (actually, they're originally from Africa) and he sells them to pharmaceutical companies in China by the ton. Crunchy, with an aftertaste But Wang prefers them fresh and wants me to try one, so he drags a gas stove into his office and throws a steel bowl full of roaches into peanut oil.
