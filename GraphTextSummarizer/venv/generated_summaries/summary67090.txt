-- Bradley Wiggins' bid to add the Giro d'Italia title to his Tour de France crown suffered another blow Saturday as the British cycling star lost more time in the eighth stage time trial. His former teammate Dowsett, the British time trial champion, is now racing for Spain's Movistar alongside Intxausti in the three-week event -- one of the three elite races on the cycling calendar along with Le Tour and the Spanish Vuelta. Nibali was 21 seconds adrift in fourth but it was enough to give the Italian rider a 29-second advantage over Australia's 2011 Tour de France winner Cadel Evans, who was seventh. Previous leader Benat Intxausti lost more than three and a half minutes as he dropped to 14th overall. But then the second part of the course was really suited to me and I took back a lot of time on people there.
