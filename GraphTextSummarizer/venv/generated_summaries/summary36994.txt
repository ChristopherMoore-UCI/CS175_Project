Coming into the tournament in Dubai, Stenson was still searching for his maiden win of the year, having suffered near misses at both the BMW International Open and Volvo World Match Play Championship. But while Sunday's victory was not enough to claim the Race to Dubai for a second year running -- Rory McIlroy was confirmed as the winner earlier this month -- Stenson was still able to prove once more that he is the man to come good at the year's climax. -- He has a habit of producing the goods at the season's finale, and 2014 was no different for Henrik Stenson as he successfully defended his DP World Tour Championship Sunday. The 38-year-old landed the European Tour's DP World Tour Championship last year to help tie up the Race to Dubai, while also securing the PGA's own season-ending Tour Championship which brought with it the FedEx Cup. "But if I had the choice I would go for a major championship, so I am going to try and be in good shape for them next year."
