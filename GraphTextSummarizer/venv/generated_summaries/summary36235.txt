"U.S. arms shipments to Egypt's security forces must be stopped until there is certainty that tear gas and other munitions, weaponry or other equipment aren't linked to bloodshed on Egyptian streets," Amnesty's Brian Wood, who monitors conventional weapons and arms control, said Wednesday. Amnesty called on Egyptian security forces, including riot police, to be trained in the use of force and firearms. On the front lines of a street battle in Cairo in late November, protesters took turns hurling stones at helmeted riot police. -- Amnesty International is demanding the United States stop allowing the export of arms and riot-control material to Egypt, where security forces have cracked down on protests. He said an ongoing export license has recently expired, but a shipment of tear gas was delivered to Egypt last week.
