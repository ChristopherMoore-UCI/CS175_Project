Former New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin faces prison with few of his former constituents shedding any tears for the man who led them through the biggest disaster in the city's modern history. "At one point or another, just about everybody voted for Nagin," said Clancy DuBos, political editor of the New Orleans alternative weekly Gambit. Nagin maintained his innocence after Wednesday's verdict, which made him New Orleans' first mayor to be convicted of federal corruption charges. 'People are generally forgiving' Nagin drew national attention when Hurricane Katrina hit in 2005, flooding more than three-fourths of New Orleans and killing more than 1,800 people across the region. Nagin won a second term in 2006 despite a controversy over his pledge that New Orleans would remain a "chocolate" city, even as much of the city's African-American population was displaced by storm damage.
