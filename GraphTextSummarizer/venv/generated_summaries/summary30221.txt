Leverkusen went into the match in second place on goal difference ahead of Mainz, but paid the price for poor second-half defending as Dortmund made the perfect start following the Bundesliga's mid-winter break. However, Grosskreutz broke the deadlock four minutes after the break when Leverkusen defender Manuel Friedrich failed to deal with a long throw by Lukasz Piszczek and actually diverted the ball into the midfielder's path with his arm. The 18-year-old Gotze, who made his international debut for Germany last year, then effectively ended the match two minutes later as he calmly slotted the ball through the legs of Leverkusen keeper Rene Adler for his fifth goal this season after being set free by Grosskreutz. " Dortmund hit the post early in the first half with a header by Sven Bender, but Leverkusen slowly got into the game despite leaving veteran Germany international Michael Ballack on the substitutes' bench. The striker had another chance soon after, but shot wide as Leverkusen dropped down to third place.
