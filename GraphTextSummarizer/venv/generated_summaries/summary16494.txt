This is the sixth year CNN has conducted its annual search for CNN Heroes. At the tribute show, hosted by Anderson Cooper in Los Angeles, one of the top 10 will be named CNN Hero of the Year and receive an additional $250,000 to continue their work. They will be honored at "CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute," a globally broadcast event that airs live December 2 at 9 p.m. ET/6 p.m. In addition to receiving $50,000 for being a top 10 CNN Hero, this year's group will also receive free training from the Annenberg Foundation, a leading supporter of nonprofits worldwide. In 2005, she started a children's center that has provided support, such as housing, education and medical care, to more than 140 children of incarcerated parents.
