-- For the fourth year in a row, Iraqis top a growing roster of people seeking asylum in an industrialized nation. In all, the United Nations said 185,000 people filed for asylum in the first six months of 2009, a 10 percent increase over last year. "These statistics show that ongoing violence and instability in some parts of the world force increasing numbers of people to flee and seek protection in safe countries," said Antonio Guterres, the U.N. high commissioner for refugees. The refugee agency said 13,200 Iraqis applied for asylum. Iraqi refugees leave the plane after arriving at the airport in Hanover, northern Germany, on March 19, 2009.
