Ad time for next Sunday's "All-American Muslim" episode is apparently sold out, despite Lowe's decision to pull its commercials from the TLC reality series, a TLC network spokeswoman said. " Simmons, who is an outspoken social activist, sent a series of Twitter messages over the last several days urging Lowe's to reverse its decision: "Dear @Lowes, we got over 21k signatures standing up against ur poor decision. Simmons' website posted a statement Tuesday saying "TLC has announced that Rush Card will not be able to purchase the remaining ad space as they have all been sold out. "He has tried to buy," TLC's Laurie Goldberg told CNN in an e-mail Tuesday. " Lowe's, a national home improvement chain, defended its decision in a statement to CNN last Saturday.
