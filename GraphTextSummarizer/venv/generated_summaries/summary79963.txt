However, the high density of people can generate problems, including health issues such as the rapid transmission of 'flu viruses and psychological problems caused by poverty and stress. Here we highlight some of the world's megacities, such as the most populous: Tokyo in Japan, which, with 35.2 million inhabitants, has a larger population than Algeria, Canada or Uganda; and the rapidly expanding Shanghai, China's economic powerhouse, which is the world's biggest metropolitan area, covering 2,914 square kilometers. Megacities can bring not just wealth and employment but also cultural benefits, says the United Nations. New Delhi, for example, is projected to have 29.49 million inhabitants by 2025, according to Demographia -- up from 20.99 million in 2010. -- Just over 9 percent of the world's urban population lives in a megacity today.
