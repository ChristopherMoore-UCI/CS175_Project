The case began in July of 2003, when MacLean, an air marshal based in Las Vegas, Nevada, anonymously tipped off an MSNBC reporter that the TSA was temporarily suspending missions that would require marshals to stay in hotels -- basically taking them off coast-to-coast or overseas flights -- just days after air marshals were briefed about a new "potential plot" to hijack U.S. airliners. Supporters argue MacLean brought to public light a TSA action that violated federal law, which mandates the agency give priority to flights that present high security risks, specifically mentioning "nonstop, long-distance flights." It confirmed the TSA treated other air marshals less harshly for disclosing information, but said the circumstances were different. MacLean "admittedly knew that he was not permitted to tell anyone about (air marshal) scheduling, yet he did so anyway, and it could have created a significant security risk," the board said. But the Merit System Protection Board said that even if the scheduling directive was not labeled SSI, deployment information was "within the definition of SSI."
