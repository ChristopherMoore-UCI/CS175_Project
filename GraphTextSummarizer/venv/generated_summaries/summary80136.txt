Both the Hamas leadership and the Israeli government have chosen conflict over real peace negotiations again and again in the past. The lead-up to the outbreak of hostilities included the wave of mutual hatred and fear that swept the Jewish and Palestinian populations in the wake of the kidnapping and murder of three young Israeli teenagers in the Etzion Bloc and the revenge murder of a Palestinian youth in Shuafat, followed by Israeli mass arrests of Hamas operatives in the West Bank, and the arrest of three Jewish extremists in the Jerusalem region. If the Palestinians, on the other hand, are able to change direction and reject the ways of Hamas as uncompromising haters of Israel's very existence, they would strengthen the hand of the many Israelis who continue to dream and strive for peace. Hamas responded by unilaterally opening fire and shooting hundreds of missiles at Israeli population centers. When faced with a struggle with a hate-fueled terrorist organization like Hamas, which has no compunction in breaking even humanitarian ceasefire agreements (they broke five or six), and which uses its own civilian population for cover, it is understandable that Israeli nerves might be frayed.
