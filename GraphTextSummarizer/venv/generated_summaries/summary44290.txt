Smaller engines generally generate less power and use less fuel, larger engines make more and use more, so don't buy more engine than you need. If one or two of the tires are spinning faster than they should be, indicating a loss of traction, the TCS system can cut engine power or engine torque going to the tires and apply brakes individually until the tires are all rotating at the same speed again. RSC uses computers and sensors to analyze vehicle speed, steering wheel angle and body angle. DOHC engines are more complex than single-overhead-cam engines (SOHC) and overhead-valve engines (OHV) but generally make more power and torque at higher rpm levels because they let the engine breathe better. ESC/ESP reduces engine power and/or applies one of the front or rear brakes to get the vehicle back into its intended path of travel.
