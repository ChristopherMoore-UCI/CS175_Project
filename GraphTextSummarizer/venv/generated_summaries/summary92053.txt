The 27-year-old, also the 2005 winner in Florida, could not repeat her heroic effort against Ana Ivanovic as she was beaten 6-3 6-3 by eighth seed Victoria Azarenka on Wednesday. Roddick's title defense ended with a second-round defeat by 67th-ranked Uruguayan Pablo Cuevas last week. " Clijsters, who briefly reclaimed the No. 1 ranking from Caroline Wozniacki after reaching the final in Paris in February, could now lose second place after failing to reach the semifinals for the second successive event. Azarenka, who has a 2-6 losing record against the Russian, won the 2009 title in Miami but was beaten by Clijsters in Florida in the fourth round last year. The world No. 2 lost to Anderson in the second round in Miami three years ago, but progressed in one hour and 48 minutes to give himself a chance of a second title in Florida -- having won in 2007 and finished runner-up to Andy Murray in 2009.
