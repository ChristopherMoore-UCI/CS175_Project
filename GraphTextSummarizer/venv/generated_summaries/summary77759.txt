Forecasters project between 2 and 4 inches of snow across the greater New York City area, with heavier amounts of snow expected over eastern sections of Long Island. The National Weather Service issued winter storm warnings, watches and advisories for portions of New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts and Vermont for Friday as well as Kentucky, Tennessee and North Carolina. "It gives us the ability to check on the location and progress of our snow plows," Bloomberg told reporters, saying that the devices will be added to some trucks in New York's Brooklyn and Queens boroughs where heavy snowfall last month left many residents snowbound. Southwest expanded the option for passengers flying in and out of not just New York and Pennsylvania airports but also to Washington Dulles and Baltimore. Mayor Michael Bloomberg said New York has already instituted a series of changes in the aftermath of the Christmas weekend storm.
