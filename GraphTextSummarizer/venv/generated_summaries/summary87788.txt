Then they proceeded to St. Louis, said St. Louis County Police spokesman Brian Schellman. According to tweets from St. Louis Police Chief Sam Dotson, protesters threw rocks at police and tried to storm a QuikTrip store early Sunday. Demonstrations focused on the encounter between Brown and Police Officer Darren Wilson, who authorities said shot Brown after he attacked him and tried to take his gun. -- Hundreds of demonstrators marched 12 miles Saturday from Ferguson, Missouri, to a downtown St. Louis plaza near its iconic Arch to deliver a message: They want the police officer who killed Michael Brown to be charged with a crime. A large group of protesters marched the West Florissant corridor -- the scene of looting and vandalism after Brown's death -- to police headquarters.
