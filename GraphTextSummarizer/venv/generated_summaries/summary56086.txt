The placement of restavek children has traditionally been a movement from rural Haiti to urban areas. The study's aim was to answer the question: "What is the scale of the victimization?" What researchers found was that 22 percent of children surveyed were living away from home, and that 30 percent of households had restavek children. Given the dire economic condition, child trafficking and organized violence has been a problem in Haiti. In many cases, children are placed in homes of relatives, but kinship ties did not guarantee better treatment, according to the study. The recruitment of such children is "intimately linked" with poverty, said the study, which recommended that the government and foreign aid be used in poverty alleviation programs and more widely available education services, especially in rural areas.
