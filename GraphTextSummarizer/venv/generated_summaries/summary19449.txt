Prince Charles' office at Clarence House released its annual review Friday, shedding light on how money is spent on the couple, as well as Princes William and Harry and, of course, the newest addition to the family, Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge. Nine of those employees work for Princes William and Harry, and for Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge. As it happens, 90% of it is his (Prince Charles') own income, so it's not coming from central government coffers. "Prince Charles gives little back to the country yet has a deeply held sense of entitlement when it comes to accessing public funds," Chief Executive Graham Smith said Friday. He received an additional $3.42 million in public funding from Parliament and government departments, a year-on-year increase of 11.8%.
