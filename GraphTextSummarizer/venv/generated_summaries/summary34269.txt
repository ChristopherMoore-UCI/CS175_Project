-- U.S. law enforcement officials believe they may have identified the masked man seen in the ISIS video of the killing of American journalist James Foley, two U.S. officials told CNN. In late August, British Ambassador Peter Westmacott said his country was close to identifying the ISIS militant. That includes voice analysis and analyzing metadata from the video as well as other methods, according to the second U.S. official. The same U.S. official said the United Kingdom has investigative interest because the masked man is believed to be a British citizen who traveled overseas to engage in conflict. Authorities are still trying to determine the identity of the militant speaking in the video of American journalist Steven Sotloff and determine if it is the same person in the Foley video, according to one of the officials.
