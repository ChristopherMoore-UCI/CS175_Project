As it stands, Mr. Powell has no discernible relief," Kellum said. Judge Robert W. Pratt for the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa ruled that Powell can return only to two areas away from the main gate -- where Kellum said Powell's message won't reach anyone. Powell's attorney is Nate Kellum, president of the Center for Religious Expression. The right to speak encompasses a corresponding right to be heard, and Mr. Powell is being deprived of that fundamental right. Powell said the message he received from authorities at the fair was clear: Powell and his preaching were not welcome at the fair or on the sidewalks surrounding the "greatest state fair in our fair state" of Iowa.
