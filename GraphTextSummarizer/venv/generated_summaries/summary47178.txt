"It is deplorable that Qatar, which likes to paint itself internationally as a country that promotes freedom of expression, is indulging in what appears to be such a flagrant abuse of that right," Philip Luther, Amnesty's Middle East and North Africa director, said in a statement on Thursday. " Al-Ajami's poem, which praised Tunisia's revolution as well as other Arab Spring uprisings, was also critical of Qatar's ruler, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani. According to rights group Amnesty International, which also condemned the life sentence, al-Ajami was arrested "following the publication of his 'Jasmine Poem,' which broadly criticized governments across the Gulf region. He called the sentence, which was handed down Thursday, "a miscarriage of justice." A Qatari poet who received a life sentence for a verse of poetry said to be insulting to Qatar's emir will appeal his case, according to his lawyer.
