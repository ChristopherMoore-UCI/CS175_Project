-- A convicted murderer who was pardoned this month in a controversial move by outgoing Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour, has been found in Wyoming, Mississippi Attorney General Jim Hood announced Monday. "He ran the office of the governor as if it was Mississippi in the 1950s," said Hood. Hood has been particularly outspoken, earlier this month calling the pardons "a slap in the face to everyone in law enforcement and (saying) Hood has said officials wanted to serve Ozment with a document telling him to appear in court. Gov. Barbour should be ashamed."
