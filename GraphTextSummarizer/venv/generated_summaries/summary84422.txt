-- House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is not ready to admit that Republicans gave Democrats a thumping in last week's midterm elections. " Republicans have so far expanded their House majority with 10 pick-ups last week, with seven seats still outstanding. Pelosi was one of the few Democratic leaders holding out hope for her party ahead of the midterms, saying they "will do OK" and predicting Democrats would retake control as soon as 2016. "There was no wave of approval for the Republicans. "I do not believe what happened the other night is a wave," the California Democrat told Politico in a story published Wednesday.
