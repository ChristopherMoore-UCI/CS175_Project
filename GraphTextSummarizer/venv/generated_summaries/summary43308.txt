These two findings led authors to conclude that women who are 40 and older should have two embryos transferred per IVF cycle, while younger women should have only one embryo transferred, and no patients should have more than three embryos transferred at one time. You really want to adjust the number of embryos ... to not only maximize the chance of achieving a pregnancy but to counter that with a desire to reduce multiple births." Conversely, according to the 2009 embryo transfer guidelines published by SART, a 37-year-old woman could receive three embryos if she had already experienced failed IVF attempts or had poor quality embryos. The study excluded treatment cycles that transferred frozen embryos. The study found that in women 40 and older, transferring more than one embryo resulted in a higher rate of live births.
