-- Manchester City football player Kolo Toure has expressed his relief after receiving only a six-month suspension for using a banned drug. "This has been a difficult period for me, and I am sad to have missed the team's triumph of securing Champions League football for Manchester City and also the FA Cup victory at Wembley," Toure told the English club's website after Thursday's ruling. " Toure faced a possible two-year ban after admitting to using water tablets given to him by his wife, but several factors meant he escaped the maximum penalty. " Toure, who will be target-tested for drug use for the next two years, was provisionally suspended on March 2. The defender had to watch from the sidelines as City qualified for Europe's premier club competition for the first time, finishing third in Premier League.
