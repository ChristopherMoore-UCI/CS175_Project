-- Criminal suspects claimed embattled Toronto Mayor Rob Ford tried to buy a damaging video -- months before a tape was publicized showing him smoking crack -- according to court documents released Wednesday. Toronto mayor's rant caught on video Authorities say that phone intercepts from early on April 20, for instance, indicate one woman telling a man "that Rob Ford is at the residence." But earlier this year, allegations surfaced in two media outlets that Ford had been recorded last winter using crack cocaine. The next week, on November 5, Ford admitted that he'd "smoked crack cocaine ... probably in one of my drunken stupors, probably approximately about a year ago." "(This other man) says that the Mayor of the City Rob Ford was smoking his rocks today," police said of another phone conversation from shortly before 6 a.m. that April morning.
