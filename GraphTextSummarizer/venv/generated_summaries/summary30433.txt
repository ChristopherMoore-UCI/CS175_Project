"Over-the-counter access will greatly reduce the systemic barriers, like poverty, immigration status and language, that currently prevent Latinas from regularly accessing birth control and results in higher rates of unintended pregnancy," the National Latina Institute for Reproductive Health said in a statement. In the future, women may be able to buy birth control pills alongside ibuprofen and cough drops if the recommendation of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists is adopted. Although the Affordable Care Act requires coverage of birth control prescriptions, insurance companies may not cover over-the-counter medications. These studies would have to prove to the FDA that the right people will choose to take the medication -- meaning otherwise healthy women who want to avoid pregnancy -- rather than the people who shouldn't purchase it -- meaning those at high risk of blood clots or stroke. Still, Grossman said, consumers could see birth control medications sold over the counter in less than five years.
