-- Heavy fighting continued Tuesday in Yopougon between forces loyal to President Alassane Ouattara and militiamen loyal to former President Laurent Gbagbo even as he was said to have accepted his loss of power. The military operation was launched Monday by pro-Ouattara forces to crush the last pocket of resistance remaining after the militias turned down a call from Ouattara to disarm or face force. The new violence erupted after a delegation of mediators led by former U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan completed a two-day visit to Ivory Coast intended to encourage reconciliation and healing. Their visit followed post-election violence that claimed the lives of hundreds of people and led nearly a million others to flee the city of Abidjan, according to aid groups. "He seems to have accepted that Ouattara is the new president," Annan said.
