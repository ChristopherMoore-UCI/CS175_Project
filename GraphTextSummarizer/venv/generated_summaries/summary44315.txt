Tibet's leader, the Dalai Lama, fled for India in 1959 after a failed uprising, and many ethnic Tibetans followed him. In a separate incident, a 23-year-old woman died after setting herself on fire in Rebkong county (Tongren county in Chinese), which is in the Qinghai Province, said exile Tibetan government spokesman Penpa Tsering in Dharamsala, India. Beijing rejects accusations of oppression of Tibetans, saying that under its rule, living standards have greatly improved for the Tibetan people. -- Four Tibetans set themselves on fire Wednesday to protest Chinese rule ahead, hours before a key gathering of Communist Party's leaders in Beijing. After a decade in power, Chinese President Hu Jintao is expected to hand over the party's top job to Vice President Xi Jinping.
