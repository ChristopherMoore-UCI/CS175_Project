Monday's reported launch of the monkey -- who was kept in a "completely sealed" capsule that produces oxygen and absorbs carbon dioxide, with his vital signs recorded throughout the flight -- is part of a larger effort to someday send humans into space, said Iranian Space Agency Director Hamid Fazeli. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland told reporters Monday that while she saw pictures of "the poor little monkey," the United States doesn't "have any way to confirm this (happened), one way or another." "But our concerns with Iran's development of space launch vehicle technologies are obviously well-known: Any space launch vehicle capable of placing an object in orbit is directly relevant to the development of long-range ballistic missiles," she told reporters. "Sending (the monkey into space) and retrieving it was the first step for sending humans into space," Defense Minister Ahmad Vahidi said, according to the semi-official Fars News Agency. Many more creatures soared into space in the years to come, until Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin orbited Earth in April 1961. One of the 24 founding members of the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space in 1959, Iran sent its first satellite into space in 2009.
