Attorney General Eric Holder has been a vocal proponent for tougher laws regarding hate crimes. The bill would allow the Justice Department to provide assistance to state and local authorities in the prosecution of hate crimes while also expanding federal protection against hate crimes to cover disability, gender and sexual orientation. "Hate crimes victimize not only individuals but entire communities," Holder said. "Perpetrators of hate crimes seek to deny the humanity that we all share, regardless of the color of our skin, the God to whom we pray or the person who we choose to love. " Republicans on the Judiciary Committee disputed Holder's assertion that there has been a noticeable increase in the number of hate crimes.
