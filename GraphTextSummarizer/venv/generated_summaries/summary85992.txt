-- Seeking to blunt a sharp backlash to recent privacy policy changes, Google has offered to share "the real story" about a system that compiles information about users based on their activity on all of Google's sites and products. When logged in, users can edit or turn off their search histories, switch Gmail chat to "off the record," use "incognito mode" on the Google Chrome browser or employ other of Google's privacy tools. Users don't have to be logged in to use many of Google's products, including search and YouTube. "The fact that you can't opt-out of shared search data, and that Google will know more about you than your wife? The announcement gave some privacy advocates cause for alarm, even though Google says the information is assembled to enhance user experience, such as better targeting ads that will be of interest to its customers.
