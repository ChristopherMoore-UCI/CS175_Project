The bystander, shopkeeper Horia Cretan, climbed four floors up a fire escape to try to help the boy before firefighters arrived. Firefighters are heroes," Cretan said. After pulling child to safety, firefighter Jimmy Senk went back into burning building in case another was inside. But when firefighter Senk and his fellow battle blazers arrived on the scene, they sprung into action. In video that's been aired repeatedly on local, national, and international TV, Senk is seen leaning out the window and handing the boy to Cretan.
