-- U.S. President Barack Obama is expected on Monday to meet with the Shanghai mayor and hold a town hall-style meeting with "future Chinese leaders" before heading to Beijing to meet his host, Chinese President Hu Jintao. At local markets, Chinese government officials banned a popular Obama shirt over fears that it would offend their guest. The final stop of his Asia trek is Seoul, where Obama will meet with South Korean President Lee Myung-bak and deliver a speech to American troops at Osan Air Base. Obama's half-brother Mark Obama Ndesandjo lives in Shenzhen in southern China. Obama is on an eight-day journey that has also taken him to Japan and Singapore, where he attended the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations economic forum.
