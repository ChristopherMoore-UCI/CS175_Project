Netanyahu called U.S. opposition to immediate U.N. recognition of Palestinian statehood a "badge of honor. -- Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas will submit a letter to the United Nations Security Council Friday requesting formal U.N. recognition of Palestinian statehood, according to a top Palestinian official. Obama resisted calls for formal U.N. recognition of an independent Palestinian state, however, asserting that "peace will not come through statements and resolutions at the U.N." Obama has been trying to mend political fences with wary backers of Israel at home while avoiding the diplomatic fallout that would accompany a U.S. veto of a Security Council measure endorsing recognition of a Palestinian state. Abbas met Wednesday with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who promised that the request will be taken "very seriously," Dr. Nabeel Shaath told reporters on hand for the 66th session of the U.N. General Assembly -- a session dominated concerns over the intractable Israeli-Palestinian Ban said it will "not take long" to get Security Council consideration, Shaath said. " Obama told Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan in talks on Tuesday that the Palestinian effort would not advance a "shared goal" of resolving the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict, according to Liz Sherwood-Randall, a top U.S. National Security Council aide.
