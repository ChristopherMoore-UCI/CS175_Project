But on Wednesday, Brancheau, 40, died at the Orlando, Florida, park after a killer whale named Tilikum -- a whale she trained and cared for -- grabbed her ponytail and dragged her underwater in front of stunned onlookers. Brancheau had worked at SeaWorld for 17 years, according to a SeaWorld spokeswoman Leigh Andrus. "We work with them day in and out, teaching them basic things as well as the more complicated moves that you see." SeaWorld has halted killer whale shows in all of its parks -- in Orlando; San Antonio, Texas; and San Diego, California -- until it can evaluate its safety protocols to provide the safest environment for its trainers. From the time she visited SeaWorld as a 9-year-old, Dawn Brancheau was hooked. Pishkur said Brancheau always talked about working with animals one day, and when she returned to Merrillville in 2007 for her 20th high school reunion, he remembers her being very attached to her whales.
