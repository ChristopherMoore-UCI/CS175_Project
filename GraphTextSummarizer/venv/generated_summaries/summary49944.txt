Under the proposed alternative system, electoral votes would get divvied up by congressional districts won. Currently, only Nebraska and Maine use a district-based plan for allocating electoral votes. Under the Electoral College system, each state is worth a certain number of electoral votes based on population. It cited a similar push for change after the 2000 election, when Democratic Vice President Al Gore won the national popular vote but lost the electoral vote, and therefore the decision, to Republican George W. Bush. States have the power to decide how their electoral votes get allocated, the National Conference of State Legislatures noted on its website.
