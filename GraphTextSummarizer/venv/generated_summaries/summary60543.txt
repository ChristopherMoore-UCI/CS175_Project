Home favorite Ernie Els, fellow three-time major winner Padraig Harrington of Ireland and reigning British Open champion Darren Clarke of Northern Ireland are eight shots off the blistering pace being set by Grace. He was paired with first round leader Nicolas Colsaerts of Belgium, who crashed to a 76 to fall six shots off the pace. Grace only received an invitation to the 35-strong champions-only field by winning last week's Joburg Open and has seized his opportunity in fine style. Meanwhile, Colombia's Camilo Villegas and David Toms of the United Stages led after the first round of the PGA Tour's $5.6 million Humana Challenge in California. Former U.S. president Bill Clinton, who is set to play with Australian veteran Greg Norman Saturday in the revised pro-am format, was among the watching crowd Thursday.
