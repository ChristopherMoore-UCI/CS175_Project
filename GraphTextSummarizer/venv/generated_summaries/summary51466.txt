The Doughty Street law firm was clearly excited about the news and released a statement that read in part: "The barristers and staff of Doughty Street Chambers offer their best wishes and congratulations to Ms Amal Alamuddin, a member of Chambers, and Mr George Clooney on their engagement to be married." Alamuddin's profile on the site The Legal 500 says she "specialises in international law, human rights, criminal law and extradition." Clooney, who was married from 1989 until 1993 to "No Strings Attached" actress Talia Balsam, has long been outspoken about the fact that he has had no desire to wed again. Some of her clients have included the Royal Court of Bahrain and WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. The blog states: "Amal Alamuddin may make some feel inadequate because she has achieved the seemingly unattainable ideal of contemporary femininity: She is both breathtakingly beautiful and formidably successful.
