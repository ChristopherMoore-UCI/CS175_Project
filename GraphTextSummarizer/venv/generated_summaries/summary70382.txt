-- Singapore businessman Peter Lim has offered to purchase debt-ridden La Liga side Valencia, according to the club's president, Amadeo Salvo. The La Liga club revealed in August that its debts to Bankia, Spain's fourth largest bank, stood at $376 million. The original plan was to close the deal in a week, Salvo suggested, but Bankia has requested a time frame of four to six weeks to consider more offers. Salvo said Mr Lim has proposed that the purchase be completed by the middle of next month to allow the club time to spend money on players before the transfer window closes on January 31. Speaking at a specially convened press conference before Sunday's match with Real Madrid, Salvo said: "Mr Lim has made an official offer to Bankia to buy the club.
