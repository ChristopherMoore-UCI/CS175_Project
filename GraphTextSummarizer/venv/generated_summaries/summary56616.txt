The revival, directed by Anna D. Shapiro, sees Franco portray the smaller, sharper George from the John Steinbeck story, while Chris O'Dowd portrays his oafish companion, Lennie. On Thursday, the 35-year-old actor appeared to take a stand against The New York Times and its theater critic, Ben Brantley, after the paper ran a hesitant review of Franco's Broadway debut in an "Of Mice and Men" revival. Following "Of Mice and Men's" opening night, the actor shared Variety's more favorable review, which credited director Shapiro for "an impeccably mounted production" and praised the ensemble acting as "flawless." "Sadly Ben Brantley and the NYT have embarrassed themselves," Franco said in an Instagram post that has since been removed. In the April 16 piece, Brantley called "Of Mice and Men's" opening night on Wednesday "respectable" and "respectful," but also "generally inert."
