In 2006, while accepting an award from Equality Now (an organization promoting the human rights of women), Joss Whedon ("The Avengers," "Buffy the Vampire Slayer") said he's often asked why he creates such strong women characters. His response: "Why aren't you asking 100 other guys why they don't write strong women characters?" Now, more women are entering the conversation themselves such as Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumolo, who wrote last year's hit  "Bridesmaids" starring an all-female ensemble cast. The sheer increase of strong female characters isn't enough, Magowan said, noting that role models such as "Wreck-It Ralph's" Vanellope (voiced by Sarah Silverman) are often secondary characters. Not only will a record 20 women hold U.S. Senate seats next year, but women voters also greatly influenced the 2012 election, making an impact in swing states such as Ohio. " Despite accounts of inequality, 2012 has been dubbed the year of the woman, and with good reason, given the many strong female characters and women breaking through in the entertainment industry as well as our culture at large.
