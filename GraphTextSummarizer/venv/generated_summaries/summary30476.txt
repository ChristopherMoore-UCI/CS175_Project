The Red Cross The Red Cross of Oklahoma and The Red Cross of St. Louis are already assessing damage and providing emergency care, food and shelters for those affected by this new round of storms. Members have mobilized their canteens throughout the region, providing food, hydration and emotional support to first responders and storm survivors. Already devastated areas of Oklahoma were hit again, and this time the damage spread to neighboring states. Save the Children Save the Children is another organization already hard at work in the Moore, Oklahoma, area and is ready to respond to the now widened scope of damage and people in need. If you are outside of the United States and wish to contribute to the efforts of the Red Cross, please visit its international partner, International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent.
