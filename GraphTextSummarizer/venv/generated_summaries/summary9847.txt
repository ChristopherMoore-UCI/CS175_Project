A covert CIA operative for 16 years, Mahle knows about what she's talking. The book takes a look at Mahle's work as well as the post-Cold War culture and structural issues with the agency. Despite the opportunity for leaving out details about her life, Mahle points out that her whole career was based around figuring out people. From an audience standpoint, it makes no sense and perfect sense all at once. "That's always the intention in Hollywood," says Melissa Boyle Mahle.
