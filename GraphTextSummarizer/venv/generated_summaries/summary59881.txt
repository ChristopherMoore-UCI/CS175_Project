I met the criteria for death with dignity in Oregon, but establishing residency in the state to make use of the law required a monumental number of changes. I probably would have suffered in hospice care for weeks or even months. But even with palliative medication, I could develop potentially morphine-resistant pain and suffer personality changes and verbal, cognitive and motor loss of virtually any kind. The vast majority of families do not have the flexibility, resources and time to make all these changes. I had to find new physicians, establish residency in Portland, search for a new home, obtain a new driver's license, change my voter registration and enlist people to take care of our animals, and my husband, Dan, had to take a leave of absence from his job.
