Almost everyone, from educators to government officials to industry experts, laments the lackluster abilities and performance of our nations' students in science, technology, engineering and math (know as STEM education). It is simply this:  Ask any adult not employed in a STEM area of work: "Don't you wish you studied and appreciated math and science courses earlier in school?" Featuring more than 100 middle school and high school students with their various inventions, the president talked not just about the economic reasons important to our success in STEM education but also our historic — indeed, founding — commitment to it: "[T]he belief that we belong on the cutting edge of innovation, that's an idea as old as America itself. Tap into children's natural curiosity and teach it earlier in school, and recognize subjects like math and science are as important as English. American students score 23rd in math and 31st in science when compared with 65 other top industrial countries.
