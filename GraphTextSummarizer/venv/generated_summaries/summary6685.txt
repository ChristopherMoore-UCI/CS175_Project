The future of challenge of world politics will remain the sorting out the incongruity between formal political structures and actual political identities. Cameron and his colleagues under-estimated the strength of Scottish nationalism until the 11th hour and then, in panic, gave away the middle ground of greater autonomy that the Prime Minister had initially refused to put on the ballot. Today, the fragmenting of the artificial states of the Middle East -- particularly Syria and Iraq -- and the Ukraine emphasize the marriage of national with religious identities as the bedrock of 21st Century political identity in many parts of the world. It is important for the developed world to acknowledge and accommodate nationalist sentiment because as we have seen many other places in the world, when repressed it often explodes in violence. Had the referendum included a middle way calling for greater autonomy for Scotland within the union, it would no doubt have won by a landslide.
