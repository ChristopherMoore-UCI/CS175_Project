" Clijsters' withdrawal is likely to leave Serena Williams as a warm favorite to add to her grand slam tally, but the American was herself forced out of the latest WTA event in Cincinnati through injury, but it is not thought serious. She missed most of the clay court season and then Wimbledon with an ankle injury and was hoping for better luck as she chased a fourth triumph at Flushing Meadows where she won in 2005, 2009 and 2010. The injury will also affect her end of season campaign and she acknowledged that she will need careful rehabilitation. The 28-year-old Belgian suffered the injury at the Rogers Cup tournament in Toronto last week and told the official WTA website that she would not be able to recover in time for the final grand slam of the season which starts on August 29 in New York. Petkovic will face 13th seed Jelena Jankovic, who went through when Shuai Peng withdrew before the start of their match with a hip injury.
