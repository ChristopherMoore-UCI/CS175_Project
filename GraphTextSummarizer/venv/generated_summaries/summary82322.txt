The arrest led Cambridge officials to create a commission made up of national experts that will evaluate police practices and make recommendations to reduce improper procedures. Many Latinos say they know how Harvard University professor Henry Louis Gates felt during a recent arrest because they believe police often racially profile Hispanics, too. The problem is that in the discussions we are having is that officials abuse their authority." Gates was arrested July 16 and accused of disorderly conduct after police responded to a report of a possible burglary at his Cambridge, Massachusetts, home. The charge was later dropped, but the incident sparked a national debate about racial profiling and police procedures. "Professor Gates' case resonates with us because he is a prominent academic at a very prominent institution, but it is a reality that occurs on these streets every day," said Vicente Alba-Panama of the National Congress for Puerto Rican Rights.
