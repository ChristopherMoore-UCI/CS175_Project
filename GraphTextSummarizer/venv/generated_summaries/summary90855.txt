Here is a look at possible responses to Putin's latest move in Ukraine: Military Unless a sudden escalation causes open warfare between Ukraine and Russia, forget about any kind of U.S. or allied military response. It's happened before -- Afghanistan in 1979, Georgia in 2008 -- and now Russian President Vladimir Putin has essentially seized military control of the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine. Herbst noted on CNN that Russia used the need to protect Russian citizens and interests as a pretext for what he called "blatant aggression" in Ukraine now and previously in Georgia. "Although the Department of Defense finds value in the military-to-military relationship with the Russian Federation we have developed over the past few years to increase transparency, build understanding, and reduce the risk of military miscalculation, we have, in light of recent events in Ukraine, put on hold all military-to-military engagements between the United States and Russia. Obama outlined a similar approach to reporters later Monday, saying that should satisfy Russian concerns of protecting the rights of ethnic Russian residents and Russian citizens in Ukraine.
