Earlier this week the government announced it would retire 30,000 people in a bid to cut 300 million euros in operating costs next year. The march accompanied a one-day strike in the public sector that shut down Athens International Airport, government ministries and schools. Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos believes this will give Greece a primary surplus next year of 3.2 billion euros ($4.2 billion). The school year began on September 12, but the education ministry was embarrassed to admit that it still hadn't printed textbooks. In the meantime, angry high school students staged sit-ins at their schools.
