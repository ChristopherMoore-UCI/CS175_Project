Only slightly less imposing is the pink granite structure that is Seattle Art Museum (1300 First Avenue) and the 48-foot "Hammering Man" that guards its entrance. Originally a museum dedicated to Seattle native Jimi Hendrix, the Experience Music Project now has all kinds of rock memorabilia and loads of interactive exhibitions. There's another totem pole in Pioneer Square Park, carved by the Tlingit natives in 1938, as well as a bust of Chief Sealth of the Duwamish tribe, after whom Seattle is named. More than just an outstanding farmers market, Pike Place is in many ways the beating heart of Seattle. Kids will love the Seattle Aquarium (Pier 59, 1483 Alaskan Way), while adults will want to head straight to Pike Place Market (Pike Street).
