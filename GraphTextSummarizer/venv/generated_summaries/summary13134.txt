On the eve of what was to become the biggest sale ever of a Chinese contemporary painting, Trevor Simon wanted to get the word out about "Execution," a painting he had hidden from everybody. " A junior investment banker in his 20s at the time, Simon would spend $250,000 Hong Kong dollars ($32,200), or two-thirds of his annual salary, on "Execution." Simon had left Hong Kong for "the lion's den," as he put it, in London, where he felt further "executed by the politics and chaos one step below the top rung of the bank." Yue's painting was in keeping with "cynical realism," the term coined by art critic Li Xianting to describe post-Tiananmen artists disillusioned by and critical of Chinese society, Simon said. He put "Execution" in a box, shipped it out of Hong Kong to London.
