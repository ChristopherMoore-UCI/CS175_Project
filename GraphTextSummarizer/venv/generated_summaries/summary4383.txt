On Sunday, the president of Peru's Radio and Television Advisory Council cited Sayas' death as she called on media in the South American country to more closely monitor the contents of their programs. Sayas was the first contestant on "The Value of Truth," which features participants answering tough questions about their personal lives in front of an audience and loved ones. Investigators uncovered evidence of poison in her body and signs that she was strangled, Peruvian Attorney General Jose Pelaez told reporters. "This television program has absolutely nothing to do with it,' said Freddy Sanchez Rojas, Sayas' uncle. There is a concept of information and news that goes against the very people covered within the report," President Rosa Maria Alfaro said.
