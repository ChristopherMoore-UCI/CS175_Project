New companies such as Shapeways enable you to upload 3-D designs or browse among a marketplace of products from other designers, then print the goods for you and ship them to your home. These advancements are making it easy and fun to use 3-D printers to create everyday products, such as home decor, jewelry, toys and even running shoes. It could soon be reality in even the most tech-averse household, and it might just end up saving the craftier among us lots of time and money. Or if you'd like to try a whole new 3-D printing concept in general, sign up to be one of the first to demo the 3Doodler, a pen that lets you draw products into reality. Purchasing new cookie cutters seems silly once you realize you can customize your own online and print them in 15 minutes.
