-- Anna Gordy Gaye, the sister of Motown's founder and ex-wife of late legendary singer Marvin Gaye, has died. She is survived by a son, Marvin Gaye III, and two brothers, including Berry Gordy, who founded the Motown record label. Her 14-year marriage to Gaye ended in divorce, but not before she inspired some of his songs, including "Pride and Joy" and "You're a Wonderful One." She died early Friday surrounded by relatives, her family said in a statement. He was shot by his father with a gun he'd given him for safety.
