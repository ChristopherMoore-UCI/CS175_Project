A Colombian newspaper and radio outlet investigated allegations that the president's has Colombian roots in Cucuta, a town on the border with Venezuela, and found residents who had memories of Maduro as a child there. In the Venezuelan version of the birther movement, its proponents say Maduro was born in neighboring Colombia and is either a Colombian citizen or a dual citizen, either of which would make him ineligible to be president. No birth certificate has been produced for Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. The fact that Maduro's birth record has not been located in either Venezuela or Colombia allows the doubts to persist. The theory that Maduro is not eligible to be president is welcomed by some Venezuelans who see it as a sliver of hope to unseat him.
