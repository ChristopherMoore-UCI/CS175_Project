The officials, representing several major cities and a handful of Arizona communities, told Holder the requirement to check the immigration status of many individuals stopped by officers would divert police resources away from crime-fighting efforts and build mistrust between police and the Latino community. -- Arizona's controversial new immigration law could harm local law enforcement efforts, a delegation of police chiefs from across the country told Attorney General Eric Holder in a closed-door meeting Wednesday. Ramsey, who opposes Arizona's law, said if the measure is upheld by the courts it would be enforced by law enforcement officials, despite any misgivings they might have. Harris, who heads the Arizona Police Chiefs Association, said law enforcement officials have consistently supported the use of more federal resources -- including National Guard troops -- to clamp down on illegal immigration. "The attorney general thought the police chiefs raised important concerns about the impact the Arizona law will have on the ability of law enforcement to keep communities safe," spokesman Matthew Miller said.
