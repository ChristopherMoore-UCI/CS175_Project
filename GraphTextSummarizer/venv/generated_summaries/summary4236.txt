State Department spokesman Patrick Ventrell would not elaborate on what kind of establishment the officials were at, except to say it was "some sort of social spot." Asked Tuesday afternoon whether the shooting had occurred at a strip club, Ventrell told reporters, "I have no information on the site whatsoever." The club's manager said on Tuesday night that the shooting had occurred inside the establishment. The department was not aware of any arrests, Ventrell said, but it is in contact with local authorities. Police and investigators combed the club, in the basement of a mall, but did not speak to reporters outside on Tuesday.
