Fowler, who is a Continental Airlines pilot when he is not flying the Belle, said it's important to remember the high casualties B-17 crews suffered during World War II. Liberty Foundation founder Don Brooks then had it painted as the "Liberty Belle" to honor his father who flew on the original Belle in the 390th Bomb Group during the war. "Our role is to fly this aircraft as a flying museum, to teach younger people the history of WWII," said Ron Gause, a foundation volunteer and part-time pilot of the Belle. The Liberty Belle, a restored World War II-era B-17 like the one Lawing flew in, starts a nationwide tour this weekend in Atlanta. Wendell Lawing, 88, recently flew on a B-17 for the first time since World War II.
