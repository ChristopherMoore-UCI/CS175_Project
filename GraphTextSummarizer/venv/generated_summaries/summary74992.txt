-- Two workers at New York's John F. Kennedy Airport post office were exposed to phosphoric acid Sunday from a package that originated from China, a law enforcement official said. A hazardous response team from the FBI responded to the airport "out of an abundance of caution," said Peter Donald, a spokesman for the FBI in New York. The two workers -- identified by another law enforcement official as Customs and Border Protection employees -- declined medical attention. Donald said the package "was determined to be beauty supplies." Phosphoric acid is a colorless liquid with a syrupy consistency used as an acidifying agent to give colas their flavor.
