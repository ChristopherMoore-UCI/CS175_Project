In a tribute in Time magazine, Sorkin recalls the "mini-AA meetings" he and Hoffman would have on the Paramount lot while on breaks, stretches of time where they could share stories as fathers of young kids and as recovering drug addicts. " And to Aaron Sorkin, another venerated creator whose bond with Hoffman cemented during their work on 2007's "Charlie Wilson's War," Hoffman's death may become someone else's saving grace. "He'll have his well-earned legacy -- his Willy Loman that belongs on the same shelf with Lee J. Cobb's and Dustin Hoffman's, his Jamie Tyrone, his Truman Capote and his Academy Award. The Philip Seymour Hoffman we didn't know "We come together in a spirit of terrible mourning and incredible loss," LAByrinth member and Jesuit priest Father Jim Martin told the crowd gathered in front of the Bank Street Theater. "(Hoffman) didn't die because he was partying too hard or because he was depressed -- he died because he was an addict on a day of the week with a 'y' in it," Sorkin said.
