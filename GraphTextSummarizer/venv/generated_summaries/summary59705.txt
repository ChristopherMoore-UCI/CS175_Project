The initiative was co-founded by leading barrister Cherie Blair, wife of former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, with the aim of strengthening Africa's legal systems to encourage growth and attract investment in the continent. We are not going in to teach Rwandan family law or indeed Rwandan criminal law. For example, when I was talking to the government about it they were saying that actually a big gap in Rwanda is people who are trained legal draftsmen; that's people to actually draft the legislation. Well, of course, we are first of all working with the Rwandan Law School and it is why we are concentrating on this area of commercial law and particularly international law. It may sound silly but it's a very technical skill and if you don't get proper laws drafted in the right way than there can be a lot of confusion.
