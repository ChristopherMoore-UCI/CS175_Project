Earlier in the day, Lon Snowden said on NBC's "Today" that Snowden did the right thing by leaking U.S. intelligence and helping Americans see the truth. "The United States is willing to immediately issue such a passport to Mr. Snowden," Holder wrote. " Lon Snowden expressed his disappointment with the recent House vote that continued funding for the spy program that Edward Snowden exposed.
