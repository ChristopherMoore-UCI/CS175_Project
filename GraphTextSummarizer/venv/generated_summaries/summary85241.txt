Pacquiao, 33, has a 54-3 win-loss record with two draws and plans to pit his World Boxing Organization welterweight crown against undefeated American Timothy Bradley in Las Vegas on June 9. Pacquiao said in a radio interview on Monday he had a dream in which God had told him to hang up his gloves, fueling speculation he may back out of a long-anticipated fight with American Floyd Mayweather. Pacquiao also has an ongoing defamation suit against Mayweather, claiming the American fighter has insinuated that his success is the result of performance-enhancing drugs. He said a Mayweather fight would be up to the Mayweather camp, but that Pacquiao was more than ready to meet him in the ring. "A few years ago the pressure for him to retire was coming from his mother," Pacquiao's business manager Eric Pineda told CNN.
