The European Union Naval Force Somalia is a multinational task force with the mission to escort merchant vessels carrying humanitarian aid of the World Food Programme and vessels of the African Union Mission in Somalia. At least four pirates, using two small boats and rocket-propelled grenades, boarded the MV Orna, a Panama-flagged merchant vessel owned by a United Arab Emirates company. Pirate attacks and subsequent ransoms have become a frequent hazard for sailors off Somalia, which has had no effective central government since 1991. The ship was on its way to Bangladesh from Jebel Ali in the United Arab Emirates. Twenty-five vessels and 601 hostages are now being held by pirates in the region, officials said in a statement.
