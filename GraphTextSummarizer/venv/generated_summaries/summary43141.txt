French counter terrorism police arrested eight people with alleged links to jihadist cells in Lyon and the Paris suburbs Tuesday morning, French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said at a Paris press conference. "The fight against terrorism, is a race against time -- we are fully determined," Cazeneuve said. He plans to travel to Brussels, Belgium, on the same day to persuade the EU Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs to move forward with the EU Passenger Name Record. Cazeneuve also announced that "a new counter-terrorism" decree would go into effect on Wednesday. He said 161 legal investigations into terrorism are currently ongoing, with 547 people implicated in the inquiries.
