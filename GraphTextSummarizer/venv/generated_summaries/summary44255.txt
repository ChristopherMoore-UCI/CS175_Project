The United States -- pressuring its key ally in the fight against al Qaeda and the Taliban to release Davis -- at one point sent Sen. John Kerry to Pakistan to meet with officials there, and members of Congress told Pakistani leaders that billions of dollars in U.S. aid were in jeopardy unless Davis was released. U.S. officials originally said Davis was a diplomat and later revealed that he is a CIA contractor, intensifying the already highly charged situation. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who said "we are very grateful" for the decision of the families that enabled Davis "to leave Pakistan and head home," stressed that the U.S. government didn't pay any compensation to the families and she wouldn't say whether the Pakistanis or a third party did. Raymond Davis -- who has now left Pakistan, according to a U.S. official not authorized to speak for attribution -- had been in jail since January. "The families of the victims ... have pardoned Raymond Davis," said Cameron Munter, the U.S. ambassador to Pakistan.
