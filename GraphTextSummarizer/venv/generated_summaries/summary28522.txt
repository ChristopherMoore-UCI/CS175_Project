While companies like BlackBerry want to ensure their users' privacy, governments increasingly want access for security reasons. While various companies have agreed to offer "back doors" for governments when they're investigating potential security threats, BlackBerry's stock in trade has been privacy. In August, the UAE threatened to block access to e-mail, web browsing and text messages on the popular smartphone if Research In Motion didn't provide government access for security investigations. For consumers, the UAE controversy represents a growing battle between digital companies and governments over data security. BlackBerry messages are encrypted to keep them from being deciphered by anyone who might intercept them.
