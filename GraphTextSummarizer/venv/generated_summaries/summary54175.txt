Hashim Amla's record breaking triple century, with admirable support from captain Graeme Smith and Jacques Kallis, knocked the stuffing out of England as they spent two days in the field while South Africa amassed 637 for two wickets. -- It was first blood to South Africa in their battle for cricket supremacy with No.1 ranked England as the tourists wrapped up an innings and 12 runs rout in the first Test at The Oval Monday. Leg spinner Imran Tahir provided fine back up with 3-63 including the final wicket of James Anderson, trapped leg before wicket to leave the South Africans celebrating and with England to reflect on a rare heavy defeat at home. South Africa will usurp England as the best Test team in the world with victory in the three-match series and took a giant step towards that goal with their decisive victory. England had resumed on the fifth day with four wickets down for 102 runs and still facing a 150 run deficit just to make South Africa bat again.
