Monday was the first time that police were called to the home shared by Michael Nolan and his father Walter Nolan, 86, said Jane Young, chief of the New Hampshire attorney general's criminal bureau. Investigators believe that Michael Nolan, 47, shot and killed police officer Steve Arkell before losing his own life in a fire and explosion that followed. A second officer arrived and entered the residence, where "he noticed that there was a wall that had been sprayed with bullets, and he saw officer Arkell on the floor, on his back," Young said. When Arkell arrived, he met with Walter Nolan in front of the house and was granted permission to enter, Young said. New Hampshire Gov. Maggie Hassan ordered that flags in the state be flown at half-staff in honor of Arkell.
