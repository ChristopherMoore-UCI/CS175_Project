An avalanche in the mountainous Peth Hallan village rolled over the family's house Friday morning, engulfing it in snow, Kashmir Divisional Commissioner Mehboob Iqbal told CNN. And in the village of Gulab Bagh, in north Kashmir, a third avalanche buried a house Friday morning, killing one person and injuring three, he said. -- Six family members were buried alive after an avalanche crashed into their house in a remote village in Indian-administered Kashmir, officials said Friday. A total of 10 people were killed Friday following five days of continuous snowfall in the mountainous region. "We have so far removed to safety over 300 persons from avalanche-prone villages of Waltengo Nar and Gulab Bagh, and lodged them in makeshift rescue centers," the senior police official said.
