But in the wake of the U.S. military raid into Pakistan to kill bin Laden, the criticism has increased from an officer corps furious that U.S. troops invaded Pakistan's territory without the Pakistani military, and especially Kayani, being consulted. The United States is watching closely to the see the ultimate fate of the most powerful man in Pakistan, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, the Pakistani army's chief of staff. Criticism of Kayani inside Pakistan had grown in recent months as he became close to the Obama administration and the Pentagon. " U.S. officials are closely watching a group known as the "11 corps commanders," the senior Pakistani generals hand-picked by Kayani to command. This is the type of scrutiny senior Pakistani generals like Kayani are "not accustomed to facing," the official said.
