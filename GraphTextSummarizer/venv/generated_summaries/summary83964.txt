Nigerian security forces, with support from Britain, had launched an operation Thursday to free British citizen Chris McManus and Italian national Franco Lamolinara, Cameron said. Cameron thanked Nigerian authorities, Jonathan and British authorities for their efforts. Kebbi is on the border with Niger, where al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb has claimed abductions of foreign workers. "It is with great regret that I have to say that both Chris and Franco have lost their lives," Cameron said in a statement. The announcement came shortly after British Prime Minister David Cameron said the Briton and the Italian, who had been held hostage for 10 months in northern Nigeria, died Thursday in a failed rescue attempt.
