The same day our CNN crew pulled up at the gates, we'd had word that another international TV team had been roughed up by Roma men. Those familiar with Roma customs here say having a fair-skinned child is seen as good luck. Among Greek Roma, a blue-eyed, blond child like Maria is a relative rarity. In a written statement it said: ""Such irresponsible reporting can have tremendous effects on the lives of millions of Roma and fuel already widespread violent anti-Roma movements. "Although the Roma are no more inclined to criminal behavior than anybody else, media insistence on mentioning ethnicity in news reports gives credence to the myth that Roma are by nature criminals." DNA tests have now been scheduled before the weekend, police say, to see if they can resolve the mystery of who is Maria and whether she was the victim of child traffickers or simple the daughter of parents trapped by poverty.
