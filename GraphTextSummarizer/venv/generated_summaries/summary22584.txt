The show appealed to fans from a broad range of ages and interests, showcasing martial arts, action, mysticism and comedy. Like many beloved entertainment franchises, fans are dedicated to "Avatar." "We tried to be as careful as we could not to directly base anyone's culture on a [real world] culture because we wanted to borrow ideas," said head "Avatar" series writer Aaron Ehasz. With the close of the TV series, fans began writing "Avatar" fan-fiction with alternate storylines and created role-playing discussion boards online. I hope that fans who watched the show get something out of it.
