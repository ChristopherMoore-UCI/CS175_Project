The aircraft, a 747-400 flying as flight CX879 from San Francisco to Hong Kong, flew into turbulence early Tuesday, six hours before it was due to land at Hong Kong International Airport. -- Two cabin crew and six passengers were hospitalized after a Cathay Pacific flight hit severe turbulence as it passed over Japan yesterday. Turbulence is the most common cause of injuries in flight, though severe turbulence, which can force aircraft to deviate in altitude by up to 100 feet, is rare. The website Airsafe.com claims to have identified six fatalities caused by turbulence. "Regrettably, two cabin crew and a number of passengers were injured in the incident," Cathay Pacific said in a statement.
