-- Storms battering the southern United States put 32 million people from West Virginia to Florida at risk of facing severe weather Tuesday, CNN meteorologist Indra Petersons reported. "She was sitting on her daybed in the trailer and the tree fell directly on top of her," said Dora Police Chief John Duchock. The storms are already blamed for two deaths, the first October tornado fatalities in the United States since 2009, CNN meteorologist Pedram Javaheri reported. Early Monday, a man was killed and three members of his family were injured when storms swept through Little River County in western Arkansas, according Sheriff Gary Gregory, who said the house they were in was leveled. The National Weather Service says there's a chance of severe thunderstorms in parts of eight states, from the Florida Panhandle north to West Virginia.
