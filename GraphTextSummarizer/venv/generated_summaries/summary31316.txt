It can be very expensive to get rid of large amounts of paint." James Doherty, museum information specialist at the Jimmy Carter Library and Museum in Atlanta, was thrilled to be able to donate the museum's leftover paint to such a good cause. He told them, "I want to collect your paint and take it someplace where people don't have access to paint. "I was really excited to hear about Global Paint and the use for the paint in Third World nations because we have such a hard time getting rid of paint, and this kills two birds with one stone. We need that paint, so we can give paint to everybody, to beautify the world, that's my goal. In addition to paint donations, Delgarde also receives monetary donations to help offset cost of shipping the paint.
