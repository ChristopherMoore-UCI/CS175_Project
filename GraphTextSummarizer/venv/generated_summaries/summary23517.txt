Now, what started as four kids in sixth grade has evolved to a schoolwide project with more than 40 students volunteering to become peer advocates so they can help David and other students who are different. That credit belongs to his teachers, school staff and classmates, particularly a group of students who received training in sixth grade on how to prevent bullying and speak out on David's behalf. Because of his differences -- and research showing children tend to single out peers with characteristics like his -- I feared that David could become a poster child for children expected to be the targets of bullying. During his first year of school, I started visiting David's classroom to talk with his classmates about Down syndrome. We live in a small community, where David has known all of his classmates since kindergarten and will eventually graduate high school with most of them.
