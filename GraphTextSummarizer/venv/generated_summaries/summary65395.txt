Authorities discovered the Lost Boy website after Eurojust, the judicial cooperation arm of the European Union, provided U.S. officials with leads from Norwegian and Italian authorities indicating that a man in North Hollywood, California, was communicating with an Italian national about child pornography and how to engage in child sex tourism in Romania, officials said. I'm talking about serious graphic images of boys being sexually exploited." David Michael Fagerness, 44, pleaded guilty Monday in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles to conspiracy to transport child pornography, officials said. "Through unprecedented cooperation with foreign law enforcement partners, we have brought down a global online group whose principal purpose was to victimize children," said U.S. Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer. Authorities found that the Lost Boy bulletin board had 35 adult male members, 15 of whom were U.S. nationals, officials said. Fagerness, whom authorities said was from the Atlanta area, had relocated to the Czech Republic after being convicted of possessing child pornography in a Florida state court in 2005, but the Czech Republic ordered his return to the United States to face the federal charges, officials said.
