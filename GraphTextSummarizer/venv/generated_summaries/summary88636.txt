Andy Coulson was arrested earlier Friday in connection with allegations of phone hacking and corruption in a case that promises to be a growing political liability for Prime Minister David Cameron, whom Coulson had served as press secretary. " Cameron also referred to Rebekah Brooks, the embattled chief executive of News International and former News of the World editor who is said to be a friend of Cameron, saying that he would have accepted her reported offer to resign. The scandal has heightened debate over a proposed takeover of broadcaster BSkyB by News Corp., which owns News International. In addition to owning News of the World, News International owns the Sun, the Times and the Sunday Times in Britain. Miliband joined other members of parliament in expressing concern over the deal, saying it has "significant implications for media ownership in Britain" at a time when public confidence in News Corp. executives is low.
