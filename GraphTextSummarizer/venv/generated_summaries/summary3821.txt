How most of these groups were unceremoniously dropped when they didn't sell boatloads of records, while groups perceived by many to be Nirvana and/or Pearl Jam ripoffs (i.e.: Stone Temple Pilots, Candlebox, Bush) achieved multiplatinum success. But if you want a deeper understanding of where grunge came from, investigate some music by the Melvins (those Nirvana biographers be damned!) But if you want to know how Nirvana and Pearl Jam came to be, these six bands -- whose histories are tightly intertwined -- are a good place to start. The Melvins sonic influence on Nirvana's first album is unmistakable. In some quarters, it seems 1991, which also saw the release of Pearl Jam's multiplatinum debut album "Ten" and Soundgarden's "Badmotorfinger," is being treated as year 0 of grunge, because that's when the music exploded into the mainstream consciousness.
