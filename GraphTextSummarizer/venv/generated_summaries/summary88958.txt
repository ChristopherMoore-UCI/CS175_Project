Crosby was driving at approximately 50 mph when he struck the jogger, California Highway Patrol Spokesman Don Clotworthy said Monday. "Mr. Crosby was cooperative with authorities and he was not impaired or intoxicated in any way," said Clotworthy. Police have said singer-songwriter David Crosby hit a jogger with his car Sunday evening in Santa Ynez, California, near where the Hall of Fame musician lives. He is part of the celebrated rock group Crosby, Stills & Nash, and was also a member of the Byrds. "David Crosby is obviously very upset that he accidentally hit anyone. And, based off of initial reports, he is relieved that the injuries to the gentleman were not life threatening," said Michael Jensen, a Crosby spokesman.
