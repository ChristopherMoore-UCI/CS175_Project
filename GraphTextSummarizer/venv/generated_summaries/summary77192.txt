-- U.S. presidential contender Barack Obama used a speech Thursday in Berlin --  the German city that once symbolized Cold War division --- to warn about the dangers of allowing new walls to come between the United States and its allies. " Obama introduced himself to the Berlin crowd as a proud U.S. citizen and a "fellow citizen of the world." But Oakley said Obama needed to prove to Americans that he could defend U.S. interests abroad. Obama highlighted what he sees as common transatlantic goals while also accepting the differences of the Bush years.
