However, today the country is witnessing a backlash against progress, with a rollback of the civil rights legislation of the 1960s, restrictions on the right to vote, and gun laws that endanger black lives such as that of Trayvon Martin. Evers-Williams served on the NAACP board for 30 years and was awarded the organization's Spingarn medal, served as editor of "The Autobiography of Medgar Evers: A Hero's Life and Legacy Revealed Through His Writings, Letters, and Speeches", and through the establishment of the Medgar and Myrlie Evers Institute, she has kept his legacy alive. Despite the half century separating the death of Medgar Evers and Trayvon Martin, the grieving women-turned-activists have lived and struggled under similar circumstances. Evers-Williams is the widow of Medgar Evers, the iconic civil rights leader who served as the field secretary for the NAACP in Mississippi. People such as Medgar Evers were willing to take the risk of becoming martyrs to break down those arbitrary, oppressive laws.
