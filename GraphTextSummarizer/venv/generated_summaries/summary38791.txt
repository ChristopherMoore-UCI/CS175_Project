The 36-year-old rapper appeared on Kris Jenner's daytime talk show "Kris" on Friday to discuss his relationship with Jenner's daughter, Kim Kardashian, and their new addition, North. According to Jenner, Kanye's been into his girlfriend for a long, long time, and would even use Photoshop to draw himself into the yearly Kardashian-Jenner Christmas card. But if Kanye was smart, he'd hire Jenner as part of his PR team. "To me it's such a blessing, and I feel like it's going to give me the stability that I need to really create and really do God's work in the way I should," Kanye, wearing a "what would Jesus do" bracelet, told Jenner. He did bring plenty of joy to Jenner's show, as she beamed while displaying North's photo for the audience.
