Aspell won last year's Grand National too, making him the first jockey since the 1950s to ride back-to-back winners on different horses. Yet for much of the Grand National -- arguably the world's most famous and certainly the sport's most prestigious jump race -- it looked as if AP McCoy was about to write an ending befitting the career of a man who has dominated jump racing for two decades. It was all set for a fairytale ending for record breaking jockey AP McCoy. 25-1 outsider Many Clouds, who had shown little form going into the race, won by a length and a half, ridden by jockey Leighton Aspell. "It feels wonderful, I asked big questions," Aspell said of Many Clouds, moments after his victory.
