On Friday, amid media reports about Carson's preparations to possibly run for president, Carson and Fox confirmed that his relationship with the cable news channel had been severed. Fox took similar action with two contributors, Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum, in the run-up to the 2012 election. Earlier this week, The Washington Times (which publishes columns by Carson) reported that a flattering documentary about him, titled "A Breath of Fresh Air: A New Prescription for America," is set to air this weekend in local markets across the country. While contributing to Fox programs, he openly flirted with the possibility of a presidential run in 2016. "However, recognizing the possibility, Fox News felt I needed complete independence to fully examine my options," he said.
