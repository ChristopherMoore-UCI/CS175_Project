First, the "X-Men: First Class" star played Sigmund Freud's heir apparent, Carl Jung, in David Cronenberg's witty history of the early years of psychoanalytic theory, "A Dangerous Method," in which Jung embarks on a reckless affair with a masochistic patient played by Keira Knightley. But Andrea Arnold is the first director to cast a black actor in the part -- in fact two black actors, as she also tackles the full scope of the story, from Heathcliff's arrival on the moors as a child to his return as a grown man (played by newcomer James Howson). Winterbottom -- who once relocated "The Mayor of Casterbridge" to the Yukon Gold Rush -- has switched the action to modern-day India, and cast the luminous "Slumdog Millionaire" Freida Pinto as Tess, or rather "Trishna." But he's never given such a commanding and well-rounded performance as he shows us in "Rampart," a second collaboration with "Messenger" director Oren Moverman, a no-holds-barred portrait of a corrupt cop penned by James Ellroy. Harrelson has shown his mettle before of course, in Milos Forman's "The People vs Larry Flynt," when he was nominated for Best Actor; in Oliver Stone's "Natural Born Killers"; as well as in last year's Iraq vet drama "The Messenger" (when he was nominated in the Supporting slot).
