Suleiman Al-Mutawae, acting spokesman for Jeddah police, told Arab News, an English-language daily newspaper in Saudi Arabia, that speaking about promiscuous acts "is a violation of the Shariah regulations on the one hand and against Saudi customs on the other." Saudi authorities closed the office of the Lebanese Broadcasting Corp., or LBC for two reasons, Abdul-Rahman Al-Hazza, spokesman for Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Culture and Information, told CNN: "No valid operating license and a violation of media policy in Saudi Arabia." -- The Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, office of a Lebanese television station was shut down after the station aired an interview with a Saudi man who bragged about his sex life, authorities said. Local media reported Abdul Jawad was arrested a few days after the program aired and has been detained since last week. Al-Hazza said LBC violated the media policy by filming and subsequently airing an episode of its popular show, "A Thick Red Line," featuring Mazen Abdul Jawad, a 32-year-old airline employee and divorced father of four who spoke openly about his sexual escapades, his love of sex and losing his virginity at age 14.
