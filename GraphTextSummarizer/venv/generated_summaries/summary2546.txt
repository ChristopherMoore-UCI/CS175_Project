On November 1, global health charity Movember kicked off its signature event, a monthlong campaign encouraging participants to grow mustaches (or "mo"s) to raise cancer-fighting awareness and funds. "Growing a mustache is a very manly pursuit," Garone said, so the group chose prostate cancer as its primary cause, with men using their mustaches, and faces, as billboards. With a little research, they discovered that prostate cancer was a major health concern for men and decided it could benefit from an open, ongoing conversation. The website has evolved an elaborate internal slang, including terms such as "Mo Mentor" and "Gala PartÃ©," which is what participants call their end-of-the-month celebrations, and it has information on everything from grooming tips to health risks. Research last year showed that participants have, on average, 2,400 Movember-related conversations a month, Garone said.
