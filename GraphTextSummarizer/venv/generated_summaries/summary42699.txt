Inman wrote that automobiles have AC induction motors and bear the Tesla name, despite the fact that no one from Nikola Tesla's family was involved in founding the car company.

So this week Inman turned to a man who has become a household name in his own right: Elon Musk, CEO of SpaceX and Tesla Motors, which is named for the inventor. Musk's Tesla Motors declined to say how much Musk would donate. Using his popular web comic, Inman launched an effort to turn Tesla's former laboratory in Shoreham, New York, into a museum.
