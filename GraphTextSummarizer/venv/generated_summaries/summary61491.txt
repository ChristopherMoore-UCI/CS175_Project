The rapper, whose real name is Marshall Mathers, made a surprise visit to Garmo's house Sunday, spending the time chatting about football and school. According to the paper, Garmo had been diagnosed with bone cancer as a freshman in high school in 2010. "We're really happy we were able to make it happen," Mary Grace McCarter, executive director of The Rainbow Connection, told the Oakland Press, a suburban Detroit newspaper. Garmo was remembered at a candlelight vigil Monday night that hundreds attended. Gage Garmo, 17, got to meet Eminem Sunday evening, fulfilling a wish he had.
