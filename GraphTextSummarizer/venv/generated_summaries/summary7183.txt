It spurred a Syrian official, Hilal al-Hilal, to visit the wounded and offer condolences to loved ones of the dead at the direction of President Bashar al-Assad. "(These) heinous crimes against innocent children reflects the cowardice of the terrorists who have sought to kill science," al-Hilal said, according to the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency. The blasts were timed to coincide with students leaving school, to inflict maximum casualties, that report said. -- Residents of one of Syria's most war-ravaged cities demanded answers Thursday after a pair of devastating explosions killed dozens of children. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a London-based monitoring group, said Thursday that at least 53 were killed in the blasts in Homs' Ekrima neighborhood, adding, "the number of the dead is likely to rise (due) to the serious injuries."
