Screenwriter Lorene Scafaria ("Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist"), making her directing debut, has decided to approach "Armageddon" the same way as Dodge and Penny: nice and easy. And on a road trip, featuring various guest stars (you're up, Derek Luke), Dodge and Penny establish a low-key comic rhythm that grows into something bigger. Unlike his wife and horny buddy (that's you, Patton Oswalt), Dodge doesn't want to go sex-nuts. Steve Carell plays Dodge, an insurance exec whose wife dumps him for a last fling at life. Filmmaker on 'Seeking a Friend's' origins Penny, played by Keira Knightley, hits on the idea of going with this stranger.
