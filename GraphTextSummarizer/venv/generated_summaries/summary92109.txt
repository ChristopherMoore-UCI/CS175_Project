Five years ago, she was living in an orphanage in Lodwar, the largest city in northern Kenya, and she wanted a better education than her circumstances provided. Carole Johnson says Kenya Education for Youth is committed to providing an education to each one, all the way through college graduation. Beryl wants to become a missionary and help children like herself. "What we think really makes a difference is not just putting these children in a private school and seeing them and looking at test grades, but we feel it's extremely important to provide mentors, people in the United States who care for these kids, who are willing to contact them either through e-mail, Facebook, other social media, visit, phone calls. And these children, the two older ones in particular, have never had the benefit of a family, and we would very selfishly like to have them in Georgia schools so they could spend their breaks with us and be part of a family because that's, I think in the end, what matters is to have the love.
