The OSC said all these cases are "part of a troubling pattern of deficient patient care at VA facilities nationwide, and the continued resistance by the VA, and the OMI in most cases, to recognize and address the impact of health and safety of veterans." Referring to the scandal of a secret wait list at the Phoenix VA facility, the OSC found that "the recent revelations in Phoenix are the latest and most serious in the years-long pattern of disclosures from VA whistleblowers and their struggle to overcome a culture of non-responsiveness. " Since November 2013, CNN has been investigating and publishing reports of wait lists and deaths of veterans across VA hospitals across the country. " As part of its review, the OSC looked at whistleblower allegations at 10 VA hospitals, where it found the VA's review of cases "appears to contradict its own findings." According to the OSC, at a VA hospital in Jackson, Mississippi, the Office of Medical Inspector substantiated a number of allegations, including "improper credentialing of providers, inadequate review of radiology images, unlawful prescriptions for narcotics, noncompliant pharmacy equipment used to compound chemotherapy drugs, and unsterile medical equipment.
