As CNN presents an encore of Roger Ebert's dramatic story "Life Itself," on Friday at 9 p.m. ET, it may strike you how Oscar-nominated director Steve James sprinkles surprising details about the late movie reviewer's life throughout the film. Ebert's widow Chaz Ebert said the timing was tragic. The 'hired lady' Ebert's longtime friend, writer William Knack, shares this story in the film: "I met Roger one time with a woman that looked like a young Linda Ronstadt ... And that really wounded Roger," said Ebert's ex-producer Thea Flaum in the film. And when Ebert and Gene Siskel launched their TV review show in the 1970s, most people know they didn't get along at first.
