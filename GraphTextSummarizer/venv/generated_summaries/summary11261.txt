Boeing resumed in-house testing of the jet on December 23, and the FAA certification tests began Monday, said Boeing spokeswoman Lori Gunter. Boeing suspended test flights after the fire during a flight near Laredo, Texas, in November. Once the plane meets FAA approval, Boeing can begin filling orders for nearly 900 jets from around the world. Boeing resumed testing Monday of its 787 Dreamliner in an effort to receive certification from the Federal Aviation Administration, a company spokeswoman said. Boeing halted tests after the November 9 incident.
