flauntR-- flauntR is a suite that includes the ability to edit images, add effects, add text, and print the results on everything from mugs to posters. Instead of being at the mercy of a darkroom-shackled photo lackey to improve upon it, you've got more tools than ever to take it upon yourself to edit, store, organize, and share your images with the world. Photoshop Express-- Adobe's Photoshop was really the first image editor of its kind to herald in the age of digital photography, though it was designed for professionals and its endless options could be daunting (and bank- breakingly expensive) for the layman. As you can see, there are plenty of options for photo editing, storing, and sharing out there. PiZap invites developers to check out its API for more personalization options (which is usually a good thing).
