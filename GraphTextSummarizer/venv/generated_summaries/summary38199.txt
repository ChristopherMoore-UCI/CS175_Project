Nearly 750 flights were affected, with 46 flight diversions, according to Gina Marie Lindsey, executive director of Los Angeles World Airports. On Friday morning, at about 9:20 a.m. PT (12:20 p.m. ET) a gunman opened fire at a Transportation Security Administration checkpoint. Many travelers took the delays in stride. The impact of Friday's shooting at Los Angeles International Airport is still being felt by the nation's air travelers. The Federal Aviation Administration announced it ordered a first-tier ground stop that ended at 3 p.m. PT (6 p.m. ET).
