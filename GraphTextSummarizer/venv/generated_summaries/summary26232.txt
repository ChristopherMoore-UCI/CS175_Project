The department of legal affairs said the convictions "will serve as a deterrent for prospective Somali pirates who would otherwise have thought that they would have come into Seychelles waters with impunity. " "There are 29 other suspected and accused Somali pirates who are still awaiting trial in Seychelles or transfer from the Republic of Seychelles to Somalia," the statement said. " On December 5 and 6, the pirates -- who were in two small boats -- attacked the Seychelles coast guard vessel Topaz with automatic weapons. The Seychelles are a group of more than 110 islands located off the east coast of Africa in the western Indian Ocean. -- Eleven Somalis convicted of piracy-related crimes are heading to prison in the island nation of Seychelles, the archipelago's department of legal affairs said in a press release.
