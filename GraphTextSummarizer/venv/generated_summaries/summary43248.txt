According to the plan, the tower could rise as high as London's tallest tower, The Shard, or New York's Chrysler Building. Right now, buildings have a big distinction between street level and the space inside the building," Valcarce said. "We tried to design a city rather than a high rise building," SURE Architecture's global director and chief architect Kam Fai Tai told CNN. The award-winning proposal "Endless City" drawn up by Beijing based firm SURE Architecture could see a tower of up to 300 meters being built in London. Designed to replicate a DNA structure, designers hope the tower will "increase exchanges, communications and interactions" and offer views across London.
