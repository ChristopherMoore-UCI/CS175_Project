Laura Bush and Cindy McCain speak at a shortened first day of the Republican National Convention Monday. McCain was the presidential nominating speaker in 1996 for Sen. Robert Dole. Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin is the second woman to serve on a major party ticket -- in 1984 Democratic vice presidential nominee Geraldine Ferraro was the first woman to serve on a major party ticket. -- The Republican National Convention is kicking off in full force Tuesday in the Twin Cities -- the first time the GOP has held a presidential convention there since 1892. To prepare the Xcel center for the GOP convention, workers removed 3,000 seats and installed more than 25 miles of cable Sen. Barack Obama gave his first speech as the Democrats' presumptive 2008 presidential nominee at the Xcel Center on June 3.
