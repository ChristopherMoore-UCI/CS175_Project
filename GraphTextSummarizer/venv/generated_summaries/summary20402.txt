But on April 20, a day before her husband was scheduled to come home from a three-week stint on the offshore drilling rig Deepwater Horizon, Sara Stone found herself waiting to hear whether he was dead or alive. Transocean workers have told investigators that rig managers and a BP executive argued over plans to finish up the well, which was several weeks behind schedule. But he's filed suit against his employer, BP, Halliburton and other companies working on the doomed rig, alleging negligence. Back in Houston, Sara Stone took the first flight to New Orleans, Louisiana. BP, which owns the well; Transocean, which owned the rig; and oilfield services contractor Halliburton, which performed the cementing on the well, all blame each other for the disaster.
