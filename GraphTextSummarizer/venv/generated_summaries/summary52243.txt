Julien's Auctions backed away from selling the bed in which Jackson received the fatal dose of the propofol after a personal request from his mother, Katherine Jackson, Nolan said. " It sat in the kitchen where, according to testimony in the trial of Murray, Jackson would eat lunch each day with Prince, Paris and Blanket Jackson. Some of the furnishings were made infamous by crime scene photos shown in this year's trial of Michael Jackson's doctor, Conrad Murray, who was sentenced last month to four years in the Los Angeles County jail for involuntary manslaughter in Jackson's death. The auction house's re-creation of the bedroom where Jackson died -- euphemistically called "the medicine room" by the company -- features a bed-sized memorial covered with love notes from Jackson fans instead of the death bed. The notes and posters brought to the auction house by Jackson fans and placed on the "medicine room" memorial will be sent to Jackson's mother and children, he said.
