Judge Conley questioned that contention, saying, "The current system already handles efficiently the very low percentage of women seeking abortions with serious complications." CNN reached out to Walker's office for response and is awaiting a response. The law, signed by Gov. Scott Walker on Friday, bans doctors from performing abortions if they don't have admitting privileges to hospitals within 30 minutes of their practice. Opponents of the Wisconsin legislation allege that restrictions in the law would force the closing of several abortion clinics, and that the law is simply a way to make access to abortions more difficult. The group alleges the admitting privilege requirement is unconstitutional and treats doctors who perform abortions differently from doctors who perform other types of medical procedures. He added that the U.S. Supreme Court precedent places the burden upon states to show such laws are "reasonably directed to the preservation of maternal health."
