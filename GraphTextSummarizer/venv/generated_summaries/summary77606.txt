-- Violent clashes raged between tribes in southeastern Kenya on Tuesday, a day after at least 38 people were killed in the southeast of the country, the Red Cross said. Samuel Kilele, the police commissioner of the coast, said hundreds of police were in the area, but rugged terrain and poor infrastructure made it hard to get there. The Pokomo are largely settled farmers, and the Orma are traditionally pastoralists, tending cattle and goat herds. Attackers in the Tana Delta region have set homes on fire, forcing people to flee, according to the Kenya Red Cross. There has been long-running tension between the two groups over grazing rights and water sources, but it boiled over last month when the Pokomo attacked an Orma village after an apparent land dispute.
