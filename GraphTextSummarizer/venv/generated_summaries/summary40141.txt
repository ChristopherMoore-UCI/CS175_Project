-- British police arrested two men following a trespassing and burglary incident at Buckingham Palace this week, authorities said Saturday. Concerns escalated after a Daily Mirror reporter got a job at Buckingham Palace as a servant before U.S. President George W. Bush stayed there during a state visit in November 2003. The incident has prompted a review of security at Buckingham Palace, the best known of Queen Elizabeth II's palaces. However, in 2004, a fathers' rights campaigner dressed as Batman evaded security to stage a protest on a Buckingham Palace balcony. No members of the royal family were at the London residence during the incident, police said.
