Chartis is a division of the larger American International Group Inc. and insures US Airways. The wings, included in the sale, have been separated from the body of the aircraft and the bid site for the aircraft lists "severe water damage throughout the airframe" and "impact damage to underside of aircraft." -- Passengers of US Airways Flight 1549 could soon have a unique souvenir from their harrowing flight that ended in New York's Hudson River -- although it would be quite a large one. The auction, managed by Dan Akers of Chartis Insurance, is set to end on March 27 at 4:30 p.m. ET and is open to the public. Marie Ali, a spokeswoman for Chartis, told CNN the plane is being auctioned "as salvage" but declined to provide further details about the auction.
