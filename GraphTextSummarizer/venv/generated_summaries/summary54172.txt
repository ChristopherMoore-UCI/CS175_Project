After all the laws, stats and warnings, they're learning that peers and parents are among the most powerful influences on whether teens drink alcohol. For all the improvement, the CDC estimated that high school teens still drank alcohol and drove 2.4 million times every month in 2011. Later this month, during MADD's annual high school Red Ribbon Week, the group will distribute a new guide for teens, written with guidance from Melissa and other young people. It reminds students that the majority of teens don't drink, and even fewer binge drink; that teens react differently to alcohol than adults; that there could be major legal consequences to drinking. "If you stick with me for four years," McCarthy told the crowd during Mariah's eulogy, "don't use alcohol, don't use illicit drugs but give back to your community, work with your parents and talk to your parents, I'll be there with a bunch of other people to give you money."
