The U.S women's soccer team won the 1999 World Cup, grabbing the attention of girls and women throughout the United States When Title Nine -- the U.S law that banned   discrimination based on sex in education and other activities for schools that received federal funding -- became law in 1972, women's participation in sports exploded. This soccer mom believes every time the U.S. women's soccer team competes in high-profile competitions like the World Cup, it exposes more girls and young women to the game. Venessa Starcher -- mom, soccer coach and former soccer player -- loves the sport intimately. The Disney sports complex director says he continues to see soccer grow at single digits growth, as do other sports. This game and the tournament are an outgrowth of an American trend -- the number of children playing soccer in the United States has grown dramatically, especially among young girls who idolized the U.S. women's soccer teams competing in the World Cup.
