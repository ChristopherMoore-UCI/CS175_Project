An avalanche swept away Chuwang Nima Sherpa on 7,129-meter-high (23,389-foot-high) Mount Baruntse on Saturday afternoon, while he was fixing ropes for climbers at 7,045 meters (23,113 feet), said Jiban Ghimire of Sherpa Shangri-La Treks and Expeditions. The two had planned an alpine-style climb, without any support staff and fixed ropes or stops till the summit, Ghimire said. "Chuwang Nima was fixing ropes for another expedition in the mountain, because they asked for help, when the avalanche struck," Ghimire said. He was in Denali National Park in Alaska for technical training and rescue operations during the summer, according to Ghimire. Apa Sherpa -- a 50-year-old Nepali -- holds the record for summiting Everest, with 20 climbs.
