Real provided explanations for each of the 51 cases, stating that the majority of players were exempt from regulations for various different reasons. "We are absolutely calm about how Real Madrid has proceeded." Madrid, who sit top of the Spanish La Liga, completed the signing last week of 16-year-old Norway international Martin Odegaard from Norwegian club Stromsgodset. Under-age players can move to a club in a different country if their parents move there for non-footballing reasons, if they are from another nation within the European Union or European Economic Area and aged between 16 and 18, or if they live within 100km of the club. Barcelona has already been hit with a transfer ban after breaching regulations when signing young players, but rival "Real Madrid defends the protection and the correct and healthy development of minors via its strict adherence, without exceptions, to the Regulations on the Status and Transfer of Players, and is in complete agreement with such investigations being carried out to this end," the statement read.
