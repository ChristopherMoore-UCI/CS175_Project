The band has also lost other members, including Ron "Pigpen" McKernan, a singer, organist and harmonica player who died in 1973, and keyboardist Keith Godchaux, who died in 1980. The four original surviving members -- Mickey Hart, Bill Kreutzmann, Phil Lesh and Bob Weir -- will take part, along with Phish's Trey Anastasio and longtime Dead pal Bruce Hornsby. The band, commonly known as "the Dead," formed in San Francisco in 1965, part of that city's growing rock 'n' roll counterculture scene along with Jefferson Airplane, Big Brother and the Holding Company and the Charlatans. Its songs include "Ripple," "Uncle John's Band," "Truckin'," "Box of Rain" and "Touch of Grey." "It is with respect and gratitude that we reconvene the Dead one last time to celebrate -- not merely the band's legacy, but also the community that we've been playing to, and with, for 50 years," Lesh said in the news release.
