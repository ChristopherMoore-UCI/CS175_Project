-- President Obama huddled with the Joint Chiefs of Staff and other top military advisers at the White House on Friday as the administration continued its sweeping review of U.S. strategy in Afghanistan. Abdullah and others have charged that massive fraud occurred in the first round of voting on August 20. The White House strategy review is being conducted against a backdrop of rising U.S. casualties in Afghanistan and increased Taliban violence. On Friday, a source close to the Afghan leadership told CNN that President Hamid Karzai's runoff opponent, Abdullah Abdullah, would withdraw from the race. "It's a chance to consult with uniformed military leadership as a part of his [Afghanistan-Pakistan] review."
