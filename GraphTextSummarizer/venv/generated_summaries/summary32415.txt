Stewart died on February 29, 2012, according to health department spokesman Ed Barham. -- The Arkansas Department of Health says it has begun contacting about 100 patients -- ranging in age from 14 to 22 -- who were treated by Dr. William Jarrod Stewart at six dental clinics around the state between November 20, 2011, and February 20, 2012. Stewart had a substance abuse problem and completed a lengthy rehabilitation program in 2010, said Bill Trice, an attorney for the Arkansas Board of Dental Examiners. In March, Oklahoma dentist Dr. W. Scott Harrington surrendered his license after that state's health investigators said patients may have been exposed to HIV and hepatitis at his suburban Tulsa clinic. He said he could not confirm what infectious diseases may be involved, and it is not clear whether Stewart had any diseases.
