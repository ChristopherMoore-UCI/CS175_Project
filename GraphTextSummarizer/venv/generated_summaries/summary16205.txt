The tests will be conducted at four airports: Chicago's O'Hare, Denver International, Portland International in Oregon, and Orlando International. Passengers may be required to remove shoes and may still undergo a pat-down if anomalies persist. The TSA said the new procedures will allow officers to better focus on passengers who may be more likely to pose a risk to transportation while expediting the screening process. At the selected checkpoints, passengers 75 and older will be allowed to leave their shoes and light outerwear on. TSA spokesman Greg Soule said the agency is trying to "move away from the one-size-fits-all approach" to security screening.
