Troupes and their adaptations of "Bardolatry," as George Bernard Shaw coined it, come and go, riffing endlessly on Shakespeare's tragedies and comedies, always searching for ways to breathe new life into the iambic pentameter of 500 years ago. The performers use live music, choreography, improvisation, audience interaction, and no small measure of humor and farce to create an evening of engagement and laughter. The Troubadour Theater Company has melded "Two Gentlemen of Verona" with song and dance performed to music by the band Chicago and has rendered an energetic, comedic romp entitled "Two Gentlemen of Chicago." The Troubadour Theater Company's "Two Gentlemen of Chicago" runs through April 22 at the Falcon Theatre in Burbank, California. Later, both men fight over Sylvia by serenading her as "You're the Inspiration," a popular Chicago ballad.
