I was talking about a movement, a political strategy that involves DREAMers demanding what they see as their "rights" and, in the process, succumbing to a radicalism that is counterproductive and threatens to torpedo immigration reform for millions of others. And, when writing about the intersection of immigration and politics, I have had no trouble saying that the GOP brand is toxic to Latinos because the party has chosen to "pander to racists and nativists. You need a plan, and a demand is not a plan; -- Focus on deeds not words, and admit that neither political party has been courageous or honest on immigration. As most DREAMers would agree, those numbers are nothing to be proud of, especially since they appear to be driven by politics.) Above all, always try to be better people who strive for fairness, listen to different points of view, and take responsibility for your words and deeds.
