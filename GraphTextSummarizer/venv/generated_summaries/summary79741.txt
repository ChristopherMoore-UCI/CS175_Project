Xu, who passed away at a hospital on Sunday, became one of the highest-profile figures in China's military to be caught up in President Xi Jinping's war on corruption last year, when the government launched an investigation into him on the back of bribery allegations. In Chinese President Xi Jinping's annual New Year speech, he reiterated China's "zero-tolerance" stance towards corruption, vowing to keep "waving high the sword against corruption" and "fastening the cage of regulations. He took down former domestic security czar Zhou Yongkang, likely soon to become the most senior Chinese official ever to face corruption charges, and Ling Jihua, a top aide to ex-President Hu Jintao. " 2014 saw Xi take down two top officials in China's fight against corruption, in addition to Xu. Formerly a vice-chairman of China's Central Military Commission, the body which runs the two-million strong PLA, Xu was also expelled from the Chinese Communist Party and had his rank of general revoked, according to a statement from the state-run Xinhua news agency.
