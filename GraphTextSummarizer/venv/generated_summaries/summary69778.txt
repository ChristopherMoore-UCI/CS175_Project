Lawyers for Tsarnaev said they wanted to take photographs of their client and his injuries over time to provide evidence of "his evolving mental and physical state" while in federal custody. In an order on Friday, Magistrate Judge Marianne Bowler said Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's request "fails to establish that future photographs are subject to the attorney client privilege. " Tsarnaev, 19, is hospitalized at a federal prison facility northwest of Boston after being captured and charged in connection with the April 15 bombing attack near the marathon finish line that killed three and injured more than 260 others. But Bowler rejected the request, citing prison security. But the judge did say Bureau of Prison staff could take any photos in the presence of counsel, but that the government should get copies.
