" Alonso admits he wants to have children of his own one day, but for now he is focused on trying to win more titles with arguably the most famous Formula One team in the world, the iconic "rosso corsa" of Ferrari. With his family's support, Alonso flourished -- becoming a megastar who last year was rated 19th in Forbes' top-earning athletes list on $30 million, and is considered F1's most marketable driver. Felipe Massa, the man Raikkonen replaced, said last year he thought the two world champions would "collide" but Alonso has welcomed the Finn. " Despite not tallying a single point in 2001, Alonso caught the eye and soon moved to Renault, where in 2005 at the age of 24 he became F1's youngest world champion -- a record since beaten by Lewis Hamilton and reigning titleholder Sebastian Vettel. "When you're world champion, there are many memories from the past, 20 years in different motorsports," says Alonso.
