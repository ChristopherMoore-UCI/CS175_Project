-- Japan recovered from having a player sent off to snatch a last-gasp 3-2 win over Asian Cup hosts Qatar in Doha and reach the semifinals on Friday. Qatar took the lead in the 12th minute when Uruguay-born striker Sebastian Soria beat the offside trap, cut inside past defender Inoha and fired past goalkeeper Eiji Kawashima. Japan, the second-highest ranked team at the 16-team tournament behind fellow 2010 World Cup qualifiers Australia, leveled in the 28th minute through Kagawa. " Qatar, ranked 105th in the world, had reached the knockout stage for just the second time in seven appearances and looked capable of going one better than 2000's last-eight showing when substitute Fabio Cesar made it 2-1 straight after Maya Yoshida's 62nd-minute dismissal. Masahiko Inoha's late goal ended Qatar's hopes of qualifying for the last four of the competition for the first time, and maintained Japan's dream of earning a record fourth title.
