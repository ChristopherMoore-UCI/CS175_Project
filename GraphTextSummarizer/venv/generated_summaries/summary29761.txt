He and the Chobe board want river traffic restricted to electric boats, with the exception of fishing boats and local ferries, within three years. Kasane is probably the only airport in Africa to have its own parking bay for electric vehicles -- a new addition, with the lodge intending to use electric Land Rovers for ferrying guests. Antony English, a Freedom Won co-owner, says electric vehicles are well suited to game viewing, and "just so kind to our environment." The lodge is rolling out both electric game drive vehicles -- retrofitted Land Rovers -- and electric boats, for game-viewing cruises along the Chobe River. As in most other national parks, vehicles aren't allowed off the tracks at Chobe, in order to protect the natural environment.
