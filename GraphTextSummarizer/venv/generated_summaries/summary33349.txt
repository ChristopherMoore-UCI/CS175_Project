At a toll road booth in northern Spain on Friday, Spanish police swooped in to inspect a trailer truck and seized what they said was material destined for Iran's nuclear program, an Interior Ministry statement said. The traffic stop at the toll booth resulted, the ministry said, from an investigation that began in Spain last March aiming to restrict the flow of materials and technology of so-called "dual use" items, which can be used for nuclear weapons programs. Police also seized mounting accessories, export documents to Iran, bank statements and computer information, it said.
