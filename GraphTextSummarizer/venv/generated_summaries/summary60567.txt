The most popular gifts for families in North Korea were Choco Pies, a chocolate-covered treat, along with medicine and medical supplies like pain killers, according to YTN, a CNN affiliate in South Korea. They were greeted with a newly-made stone near their North Korean facilities that read: "Long Live General Kim Jong Un, The Sun of Military First Korea." After the Korean governments reached an agreement to hold reunions, less than a day later, North Korea said it may back out if South Korea holds its annual military drills with the United States. Families torn apart for more than 60 years -- separated by the Korean War -- began to reunite at a mountain resort in North Korea Thursday. Jang, a North Korean conscript during the Korean War, was taken prisoner by UN forces in South Korea.
