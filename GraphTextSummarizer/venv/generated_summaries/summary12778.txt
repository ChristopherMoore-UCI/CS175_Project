The constant scrutiny has become par for the course for Woods who says its just the nature of 21st century media landscape. Like the bespectacled character from 90s sitcom, "Family Matters," Woods freely admits to having a "nerdy side" but his attraction to Olympic skiing champion Vonn, who also described him as "funny" and "a great guy" in a recent interview, has far more to do with mutual passions. Last month, golf journalist Brandel Chamblee awarded Woods a grade "F" for his 2013 labors, noting provocatively that he had been "a little cavalier with the rules" -- a reference to four rules violations this year including the controversial two-shot penalty at Augusta. The pair, who went public with their relationship in March, also share an understanding of the physical demands of top athletes, although Woods concedes golf isn't exactly littered with glorious physical specimens. While tied for the lead, Woods' third shot to Augusta's par-five 15th hit the flagstick before ricocheting back into the water.
