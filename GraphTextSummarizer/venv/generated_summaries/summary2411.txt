"Voice actors have always been quite popular in Japan, but American culture is now becoming more aware of the artistic contribution of voice actors because of the swell in popularity of video games and animated films," he said. " Welker and Cullen make their living as voice actors and it's not easy to forget, as the pair of them often break into voices like John Wayne, Peter Lorre and Jabberjaw, one of Welker's favorites. It seems that as we see a convergence of film, animation and video games, American audiences will become more and more aware of the importance of voice acting." Patrick Seitz has a slightly different perspective. " But he certainly agrees with Cullen and Welker that online fandom for voice actors has been a game changer. They're finding they can take a chance with talent and accomplish the same thing." Welker also noted that the Internet has made a big difference, and made it easier for fans to follow particular voice actors.
