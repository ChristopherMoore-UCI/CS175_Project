As we think about how robots will begin helping us in all different aspects of our lives over the next decade, we believe that design innovation in robotics will be at least as important as tech innovation in finally making robots available to a majority of people in the world. And we think that it won't be until robots are truly accessible -- 14-year-olds hacking on Wi-Fi-connected, computer-vision-capable robots in their garages on the weekends -- that innovation in robotics will really take off in earnest. Drones could tend to gardens and farms while people control telepresence robots on the other side of the world via heads-up displays like Google Glass. Basically, the cloud will make it possible to build cheaper robots that learn new things over time. Also, crowdfunding websites like Kickstarter are making it possible for companies to test the traction of new robots and secure initial orders before choosing to scale production.
