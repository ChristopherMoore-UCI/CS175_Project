Either way, an Airbus proposal for in-flight virtual reality sensory isolation headgear that controls sights, sounds and even smells experienced by travelers is likely to turn heads -- although if the heads are stuck in helmets, there might not be much room for turning. It's either a genius idea for reducing the miseries of long-haul air travel -- or an extreme method of distracting passengers from arguments about leg room. While the eyes of their passengers are helmeted in virtual reality, cabin crew can return to actual reality and relax the mandatory smiles. It remains to be seen whether sensory isolation can genuinely improve the in-flight experience, but the innovation must surely be a gift to airline staff. "During aircraft flights, certain passengers have periods when they are bored either during a wait phase preceding take off or following landing or during a cruise phase," the patent application says.
