Logistically it is a massive project -- the complexity of getting kit and people all over the world to match up with my various stages, and often in remote countries has been challenging, to say the least. If something breaks I have to deal with it, whereas on land life can get quite complicated at times, because of borders, needing to find food and shelter, people etc. I wanted to spend more time at sea and I wanted to experience the people and green parts of our globe too. The sudden change from biking solo for months on end to kayaking with my camerawoman for the first time in months was exhausting for mind and body. I also undertook some bike journeys and made my first big crossing by kayak.
