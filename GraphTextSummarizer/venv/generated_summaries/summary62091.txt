The 25-year-old gave Villarreal a mountain to climb in the second leg with another stunning header from a corner in the final minute, sealing Porto's 13th successive victory in all competitions. Benfica, a distant second in the league by 19 points and beaten 3-1 by Porto in the domestic cup last week, made a strong start against Braga as Oscar Cardozo had an 11th-minute effort ruled out for offside. Colombia striker Falcao extended his competition-leading tally to 15 this season, matching German legend Jurgen Klinsmann's record total in Europe's second-tier competition, while Fredy Guarin scored the other goal. Porto, who won the tournament in 2003 when it was still known as the UEFA Cup, will face either Benfica or Braga in next month's final in Dublin if they successfully negotiate the trip to El Madrigal. The punishment stems from incidents during both legs of the Europa League last-16 tie against Dutch side PSV Eindhoven, with Rangers fans accused of "discriminatory behavior" -- or sectarian chants by the club's predominantly Catholic support.
