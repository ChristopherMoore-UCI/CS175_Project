The researchers say that cardiovascular fitness is one of the most important factors for good health, not just in childhood but in adulthood as well. "If a young person is generally unfit now, then they are more likely to develop conditions like heart disease later in life," said lead study author Grant Tomkinson in a statement. In other words, today, kids are 15% less fit than their parents were, and in the mile run, kids are about a minute and a half slower than children were 30 years ago. Today's kids are less fit than their parents were at the same age, according to new research presented at the American Heart Association's Scientific Sessions, and that could mean health problems later on. They found that over the 46 years, the cardiovascular endurance -- measured by the times it took to run the various distances -- among kids declined significantly.
