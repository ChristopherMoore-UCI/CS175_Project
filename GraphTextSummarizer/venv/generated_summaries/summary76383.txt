"It appears he won't be able to walk in the future," said Hasan's civilian attorney, retired Army Col. John Galligan. Authorities say Hasan, a U.S. Army psychiatrist, opened fire at a military processing center at Fort Hood on November 5, killing 13 people. Prompted by reports of former classmates, however, Army investigators would like to speak with people who have had contact with Hasan over the years and who may have information about his activities and behavior, said Maj. Galligan said he spent an hour Thursday with Hasan at Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas, where he is being treated. An employee of the Defense Department's Criminal Investigative Services, assigned to the Joint Terrorism Task Force, ultimately decided to drop the investigation after reviewing the intercepted communications and Hasan's personnel files.
