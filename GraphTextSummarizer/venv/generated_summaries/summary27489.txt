While the details are still under negotiation, the shape of the potential deal involves Greece missing its target of maximum debt of 120 per cent of gross domestic product by 2020 -- a benchmark of "debt sustainability" the IMF regards as sacrosanct. The sharper trajectory of reducing Greece's ballooning debt levels would come through a combination of cutting interest rates on existing bilateral loans, extending the debt maturities, launching a debt buyback scheme and the ECB forgoing any profits on its holdings of Greek debt. This compromise aims to reconcile the public spat between eurozone ministers -- who want the 120 per cent target pushed back to 2022 so that official creditors need not suffer losses on any Greek debt -- and the IMF, which is refusing to release bailout loans unless Athens is servicing manageable debts by 2020. But additional debt relief measures would ensure that by 2022 Greece's debt would fall to less than 110 per cent of GDP. The IMF has urged European official creditors -- the eurozone rescue funds and the European Central Bank -- to take losses in one form or another on their officials loans or bond holdings to help reduce Greek debt.
