RIM throttled service to help address the outage, which spread over the next few days to Europe, the Middle East, India, Africa, Latin America and North America. At least a dozen apps, which would cost about $100 on the BlackBerry App World site, will be made available in the next few weeks, according to a statement released Monday by BlackBerry maker Research In Motion. BlackBerry customers slammed by last week's global outage are being offered free apps, not cash, as payback for their troubles. By comparison, after Sony's PlayStation Network went down this spring, the company offered players free games, a weekend of free video rentals and a free month of PlayStation Plus, a premium subscription service offering exclusive titles, discounts and other perks. The free apps include: * SIMS 3 * Bejeweled * N.O.V.A. * Texas Hold'em Poker 2 * Bubble Bash 2 * Photo Editor Ultimate - Ice Cold Apps * DriveSafe.ly Pro * Drive Safe.ly Enterprise *
