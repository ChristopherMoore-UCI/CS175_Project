In a nutshell, the plan in NASA's hands calls for catching an asteroid with a robotic spacecraft and towing it back toward Earth, where it would then be placed in a stable orbit around the moon," read a statement from the office of Florida Sen. Bill Nelson. NASA's plan is similar to one suggested last year by experts at the California Institute of Technology, said Nelson, who is chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Science and Space. NASA's plan would bump that date up by four years to 2021, according to Nelson's office. The proposal may have gotten an unexpected boost in February when an asteroid exploded over Russia, injuring more than 1,000 people, causing millions of dollars in damage and sparking fresh concerns about the severity of space threats.
