Obama's speech comes in a week when the White House has focused on Middle East issues. In the wake of the Arab Spring protests across the Middle East and North Africa, President Barack Obama will pledge U.S. economic assistance to Egypt and Tunisia on Thursday in a speech highlighting his administration's revised policies toward the changing region. The highly anticipated address at the State Department will touch on all the Middle East-North Africa flash points -- the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, Libya, Syria, Iran and the recent killing of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden -- with a focus on Obama's plan for how the United States can help the region develop through political and economic reforms, according to administration officials. "At this point, whatever President Obama will address will really be irrelevant to what the situation is now because we're really building democracy from the bottom up," Ibrahim said, adding that "America is not the model of democracy that we are striving for." Obama will announce several programs intended to increase U.S. and international investment, create jobs and spur economic growth in the two countries, the officials said.
