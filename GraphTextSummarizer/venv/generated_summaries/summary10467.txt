-- The trial of Olympic sprinter Oscar Pistorius, charged with murder in the death of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, will begin in March 2014, his attorney Kenny Oldwage told CNN on Sunday. The first phase will take place in March, but the entire trial could take place at various times across a year or more due to potential motions and postponements along the way. Pistorius is charged with premeditated murder over the February shooting death. Steenkamp's uncle: I forgive Oscar Pistorious He says he mistook her for a home invader.
