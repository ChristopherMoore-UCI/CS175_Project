-- Dropbox, the popular cloud-storage service, is investigating whether a security breach is to blame for a recent wave of spam e-mail sent to users. "While we haven't had any reports of unauthorized activity on Dropbox accounts, we've taken a number of precautionary steps and continue to work around the clock to make sure your information is safe," the post says. On Monday, users of the forums had begun complaining about receiving a flood of spam in their e-mail. But in the forum post, Dropbox said the outage "was incidental and not caused by any external factor or third party." Many users also had wondered whether an hour-long outage Tuesday was related to the problem.
