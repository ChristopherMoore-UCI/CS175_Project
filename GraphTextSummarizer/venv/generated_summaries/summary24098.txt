The optimism once held by many Americans has been "beaten out" of them amid a lagging economy, threat of terrorism and two ongoing wars, according to a professor at Emory University. "All of those things ... have made people start to be much more doubtful than they used to be," says Patrick Allitt, a British citizen who teaches American history. Allitt: It's certainly true there are far more media than there used to be ... that devote a lot of time to people who are dissatisfied. All of those things, collectively, have made people start to be much more doubtful than they used to be. So in that sense, you can take an optimistic view, even of pessimism -- that sooner or later, the sheer attention to it is going to cause people to recover. Allitt: To me, coming from Britain, one thing that is so inspiring about the United States is people really believe in human equality and they really take it seriously and they try to make it a reality.
