Hong Kong listings have totalled $3.2bn this year, according to Dealogic, compared with $35bn for the whole of 2011. Plans last year by Manchester United to list in Singapore were put on ice shortly after the football club notified the exchange of its intent to seek a listing, due to poor market conditions. The high-end jeweller is the third company in the past week to pull a Hong Kong IPO, after China -Nonferrous Mining Corp, a copper producer, and China Yongda Automobiles Services, a car dealer, also scrapped deals. While deals are falling apart left, right and centre, the failure of Graff to complete its large, high-profile IPO is a big blow to the Hong Kong market, according to dealmakers. Other groups "premarketing" IPOs in Hong Kong at the moment include Inner Mongolia Yitai Coal, Chinalco Mining Corp International and Huadian Fuxin Energy Corp. Dealmakers says some of these deals are likely to be withdrawn or postponed unless markets recover substantially.
