The operation sent more than 6,000 troops to the four border states to repair secondary border fence, construct nearly 1,000 metal barriers and fly Border Patrol agents by helicopter to intercept illegal immigrants. Additionally, Customs and Border Patrol will move more aircraft to the Tucson sector of the border, where an increase in human smuggling and illegal border crossings have been occurring, Federal officials said Monday. -- U.S. National Guard forces will begin deploying along the U.S. border with Mexico beginning in August and will be fully trained and deployed by the end of the month, government officials announced Monday. Some 1,200 Army and Air National Guard troops will be in place for a year to assist the Border Patrol in monitoring and capturing illegal immigrants crossing the border into the United States. The Guard troops will not be involved in law enforcement activities such as arrests of illegal immigrants, but will assist the Border Patrol in looking for the illegal border crossers and smugglers as well as in intelligence gathering.
