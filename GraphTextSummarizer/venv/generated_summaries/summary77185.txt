Giroud's wonder goal deep in injury time gave Arsenal some hope but the full time whistle came soon enough, and with it a chorus of boos from the home crowd. Manchester United secured a vital 2-1 victory against Arsenal, their first on the road in the English Premier League this season under coach Louis Van Gaal. "I think it is a very important victory," Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney told Sky Sports after the match. Yet it was Arsenal that started the game much brighter with Jack Wilshere in midfield and former United Striker Danny Welbeck carving out a number of chances. Whilst Manchester United remain in transition, having had three coaches in three seasons, Arsenal have also been playing far from their potential.
