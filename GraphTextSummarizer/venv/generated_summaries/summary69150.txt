-- Talk about a "Transformer." Mark Wahlberg, who shows off rippling muscles in 2014's "Transformers: Age of Extinction," is losing as much weight as he can for a remake of "The Gambler." "The Gambler," which also stars John Goodman, Jessica Lange and Michael K. Williams, is due to arrive in 2015. Obviously, in order to drop that much weight while filming, Wahlberg's had to commit to a different diet -- one that he admittedly struggled with. "Anytime I smell food, I get crazy," he told "Extra's" Maria Menounos. "I'm trying to get as thin as a possibly can," Wahlberg said.
