And Dortmund needed extra time to see off second-tier 1860 Munich 2-0 in the German Cup on Tuesday despite fielding a starting lineup that included Robert Lewandowski, Marco Reus and Henrik Mkhitaryan. Neymar scored his first league goal and set up Messi as Barcelona defeated Champions League side Real Sociedad 4-1 to maintain its perfect record in Spain's La Liga through six matches. Messi could have had a hat-trick within 40 minutes but he hit the crossbar from close range -- holding midfielder Sergio Busquets scored from outside the box seconds later for only his fifth league goal in five years -- and failed to connect cleanly after Barcelona cut open the Sociedad defense. Substitute Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored from the penalty spot -- Dominik Stahl fouled Reus and was sent off -- before fellow summer signing Mkhitaryan made it 2-0 to book Dortmund's spot in the last 16. Messi particularly likes playing against Sociedad, too, netting every time he has faced them at the Camp Nou since Sociedad earned promotion in 2010.
