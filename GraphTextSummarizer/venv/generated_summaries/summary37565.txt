It capsized during a heavy storm Sunday night, said Lt. Sattawat Srirattanapong with the Phuket City police. Phuket and the Similan Islands are famous for their diving spots, attracting international tourists each year from November to May. A Thai naval helicopter spotted the body floating face down about 12 nautical miles from Phuket's Promthep cape, and a Thai navy patrol retrieved the floating corpse. The tourist boat, the Choke Somboon 19, was taking passengers from the Similan Islands to Phuket -- an area popular with tourists from around the world. Survivors of the ferry sinking disembark the Thai police boat that rescued them.
