" Morales said he traveled to the summit of leftist Latin American leaders in Venezuela although he "had information that there would be an attempt." The plot involved Irish and Croatian nationals as well as Bolivians, Vice President Alvaro Garcia Linera said at a separate news conference in La Paz. "They're trying to scare those who think differently." Santa Cruz, an opposition stronghold, is about 340 miles (550 kilometers) east-southeast of La Paz, the Bolivian capital.
