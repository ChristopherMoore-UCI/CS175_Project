Kenya's National Disaster Operation Centre tweeted that the siege comes on the heels of a border dispute between the Turkana and Pokot peoples. The attack was centered in the village of Lorokon in Turkana County, which borders Uganda to the west, South Sudan to the north and a sliver of Ethiopia to the northeast. "(Authorities) are combating the bandits in Turkana, but there is heavy resistance," the agency tweeted Saturday evening. Efforts were also under way to work with leaders in both West Pokot and Turkana "to resolve the border dispute in Lorokon," the national agency said. The Disaster Operation Centre followed up about two hours later by noting Kenya's Ministry of the Interior is coordinating the response, working in conjunction with local police officers and reservists.
