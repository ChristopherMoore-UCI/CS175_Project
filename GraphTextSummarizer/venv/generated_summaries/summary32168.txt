The Andy Warhol classic painting "Double Elvis (Ferus Type)" sold Wednesday at Sotheby's in New York for more than $37 million, the auction house said. Art dealers say the stratospheric rise in art prices is being propelled by wealthy investors from abroad. The painting brings together two iconic figures in American culture, said Catharina Manchanda, curator of modern and contemporary art at the Seattle Art Museum, which has a "Double Elvis" on display. As for Warhol, who famously said, "Making money is art and working is art, and good business is the best art," the prices his works are commanding would have been thrilling, Manchanda said. Alas, Warhol died in 1987 after undergoing routine gallbladder surgery at what was then known as New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, three blocks south of Sotheby's on New York's Upper East Side.
