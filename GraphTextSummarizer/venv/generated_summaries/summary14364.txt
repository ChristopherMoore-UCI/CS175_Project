While tales abound of models going on crash diets and Master Cleanses and publicists surviving on coffee, cigarettes and air kisses, for many like McCotry, it's a balancing act of limiting calorie intake while meeting basic nutritional needs. "Perception is reality in this industry, and unfortunately, you have to look the look to get the clients," said public relations specialist Keisha McCotry, who began her Fashion Week diet in July. McCotry posted a picture of her #NYFW diet dinner on August 16: a bowl of broccoli. As Fashion Week kicks off, McCotry said, other priorities are consuming her attention, like piecing together outfits that will help her get into shows she hasn't been invited to. If she gets hungry, she snacks on fruit slices or downs water and takes a daily multivitamin with extra iron.
