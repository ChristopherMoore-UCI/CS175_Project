-- Recovery efforts on Alaska's Mount McKinley were suspended Sunday because of environmental hazards following an avalanche thought to have killed four Japanese climbers, the National Park Service said. The section where the avalanche took place is roughly 11,800 feet above sea level, park spokeswoman Maureen McLaughlin said Saturday. On Saturday, a 10-person crew including rangers, volunteer patrol members, a dog handler and a rescue dog investigated the debris zone left by the avalanche. The avalanche on the western side of the mountain, America's highest peak, was first thought to have occurred on Thursday, the parks service said Sunday. "During the search, NPS mountaineering ranger Tucker Chenoweth descended into the same crevasse that the survivor Hitoshi Ogi had fallen into during the avalanche," the parks service said.
