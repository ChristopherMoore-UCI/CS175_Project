"Skepticism about black intelligence and suspicion about black humanity have gone hand in hand throughout the history of this country in feeding the perception that black people don't quite measure up," he said. Lemon also asked Trump about his recent use of the term "the blacks" to refer to black people. "This is part of a long-standing, white conservative narrative that people of color are getting things they don't deserve because of affirmative action or racial handouts," Wise told Lemon after Trump's interview. But when Lemon questioned Trump Sunday night about race stereotypes, he insisted, "I am a wonderful person as far as you would be concerned as to race. And I think everybody that knows me knows that." Trump said repeatedly that people who know him "would laugh" at the suggestion that he is racist.
