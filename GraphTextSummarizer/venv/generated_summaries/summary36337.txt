The teachers union argued the school district was unyielding on the issues of class size, teacher pay and how teachers are transferred between schools. McMinimee argued that if the strike continued indefinitely the protest would harm students, particularly children with disabilities, low-income pupils who rely on meals provided at schools and seniors applying to college next year. After the ruling, District Superintendent Art Jarvis said he expected teachers to return to work while the union and school district continued stalled contract negotiations. Attorneys for the school district argued that since teachers are state employees they do not have the right to strike. Rich Wood, the spokesman for the Tacoma teachers union, said teachers voted Thursday to continue their strike despite a judge's Wednesday order.
