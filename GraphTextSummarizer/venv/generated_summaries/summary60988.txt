Read this: Taking African colors to America's Deep South Fenix Couture This Nigerian-Canadian design label reminds me a lot of the Jewel By Lisa label. In African fashion today, names like Lanre Da-Silva Ajayi, Thula Sindi, Deola Segoe, Ozwald Boateng and more are praised in the hallways of fashion houses. Whenever I think of the Ghanaian Love April design label, I think of sultry and feminine designs with a hint of African detail. We have long moved on from the idea of African design being simply Africa centered. The design label introduced an edgy and risquÃ© collection that wasn't typical of Nigerian designers and has not been seen elsewhere in this year's batch of collections.
