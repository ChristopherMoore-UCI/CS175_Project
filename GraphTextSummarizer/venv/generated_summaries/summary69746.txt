The FBI has information that Rafael Morales was a U.S. citizen from La Mesa, New Mexico, and others may be as well, said Special Agent Andrea Simmons of the El Paso, Texas, FBI office. The men, kidnapped Friday, included the groom, Rafael Morales; his brother, Jaime Morales; and their uncle, Guadalupe Morales, municipal police spokesman Jacinto Seguro said. The bodies of four men kidnapped from a wedding in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, have been found in the bed of a pickup truck in the city, municipal police said Tuesday. The FBI offered assistance this weekend to local and federal police in Mexico, Simmons said, but neither has requested anything so far. According to a report released in April by the Mexican government, Chihuahua is the Mexican state hardest hit by drug violence, with 6,757 people killed since the end of 2006.
