The wait times persist despite (or more likely because of) the fact that VA doctors see fewer than half as many patients as doctors in the private sector. The agency's own audit found that 70% of VA medical facilities were using improper scheduling practices to hide long wait times by falsifying data. The point of the Deming demonstration was to illustrate that a systems problem couldn't be solved with new people, new slogans and new speeches. The VA's Office of Inspector General is investigating at least 70 facilities nationwide for allegations that administrators altered appointment data or used secret waiting lists to make patient wait times appear shorter. Deming used to carry around a bin full of red beads and white beads mixed together.
