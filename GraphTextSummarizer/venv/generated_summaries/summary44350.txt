Lutfi befriended Spears in spring 2007, when she "was very distraught over numerous situations, child custody battle, divorce, career problems and drug problems," Lutfi testified. Lutfi said he is the co-manager of Courtney Love, the widow of musician Kurt Cobain, and a consultant for his mother's chain of gas stations. Contrary to implications that he gave Spears drugs, Lutfi testified that he insisted as a condition of his employment with her that she stay clean and sober. Lutfi is suing for millions in defamation damages and for money he said he's owed for being Spears' personal manager, a job he said he lost when a court appointed her father as her conservator four years ago. Former manager Sam Lutfi claims Britney Spears' parents defamed, libeled and cheated him out of millions in a battle for control of the pop star and her career.
