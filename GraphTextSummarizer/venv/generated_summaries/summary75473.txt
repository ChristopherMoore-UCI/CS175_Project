Dorushka said an estimated 40% of gun sales occur at gun shows, flea markets and backyard sales, where unlicensed gun dealers are not required to perform background checks on prospective purchasers. -- Twelve survivors of the shooting that gravely wounded former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and killed six others met Wednesday with Attorney General Eric Holder to seek his support for stricter enforcement of gun sale checks and tighter requirements on gun sales. Loughner pleaded guilty in a deal with federal prosecutors to 19 counts of murder and attempted murder. The group of survivors from the Tucson, Arizona, shooting is working with New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and others with Mayors Against Illegal Guns to combat gun violence. The Arizona contingent hopes to get President Obama and Gov. Mitt Romney to present plans for ending gun violence.
