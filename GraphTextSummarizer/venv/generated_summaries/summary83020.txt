-- Dressed in a wet suit, air tanks strapped to his back, poised to head overboard is an image of Jacques Cousteau most people would recognize. He was almost like a little child, but he was the most creative and imaginative person I've ever met," says Susan Schiefelbein, a close collaborator with Cousteau for more than two decades who also helped him write his autobiography. Cousteau's endless curiosity led him to explore ever more remote, ever deeper waters. But he needed something to help withstand high water pressures and capable of maneuvering silently like a diver without disturbing the aquatic life around it. But less known was that Cousteau was an inventive genius.
