In front of 80,203 fans, a record for a women's soccer match at the Games, the U.S. won a fourth Olympic gold in five tournaments thanks to a goal in each half from midfielder Carli Lloyd. France dominated large parts of the match, but Canada secured a first medal in this event when midfielder Diana Matheson capitalized on some loose defending to win the match in injury time. Canada, beaten 4-3 by the U.S. in a dramatic semifinal, clinched the bronze medal earlier on Thursday by beating France 1-0 in Coventry. The U.S. got off to a perfect start when Lloyd met striker Alex Morgan's cross with a brave header after eight minutes. The Japanese, guaranteed a historic first women's football medal after beating France in the semifinals, were angered when a penalty wasn't given for a Tobin Heath handball midway through the first half.
