" Reports in the British media have suggested Beckham's former United teammate Ryan Giggs has been selected as one of Pearce's three over-age players, along with Liverpool's Craig Bellamy and Micah Richards of Manchester City. The former Manchester United and Real Madrid player was on a provisional 35-man list for the British squad, but Beckham insists he is still looking forward to the Olympics, which start next month, despite the snub. His omission provoked surprise on social-networking site Twitter as well as criticism for Pearce, with former Premier League midfielder Robbie Savage, who played with Beckham in United's youth team, labeling the GB coach as "clueless." " Team GB has been drawn in Group A of the tournament, alongside Senegal, two-time champions Uruguay and United Arab Emirates. Beckham was part of Sebastian Coe's team which convinced the International Olympic Committee to grant London the right to host the Games for a third time in 2005.
