"Society will be best served to allow (Warner) to continue his good works," U.S. District Judge Charles Kocoras said at a sentencing hearing Tuesday, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office in Chicago. A judge sentenced Warner to two years' probation Tuesday, ordering him to perform 500 hours of community service at three Chicago high schools and pay a $100,000 fine. Ty Warner, the billionaire creator of Beanie Babies plush toys, won't serve prison time for hiding millions of dollars in secret Swiss bank accounts to evade taxes. Warner had pleaded guilty to tax evasion and already paid a $53 million civil penalty and about $27 million in back taxes, prosecutors said. When he pleaded guilty, Warner admitted that he had maintained Swiss bank accounts with an unreported gross income of more than $24 million.
