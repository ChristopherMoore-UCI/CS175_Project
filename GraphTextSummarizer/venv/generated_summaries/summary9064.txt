-- MotoGP world champion Jorge Lorenzo will be kept under observation in hospital after flying off his bike in a 200-kilometers an hour crash during a wet practice session at Assen Thursday. "However, as this was a significant accident, we have to take into account that there could also be head, thoracic or abdominal injuries. " Lorenzo had moved to within seven points of world championship leader Dani Pedrosa following his recent victories. According to race organizers, Lorenzo will be flown to Barcelona for surgery late Saturday or early Sunday. "It would also be a prudent move to observe him over 12 hours to make sure he can be treated by the appropriate parties when he arrives in Barcelona tomorrow (Friday).
