"The District Attorney will be examining the case to determine if the use of the choke hold was necessary to subdue and arrest Garner, or was an excessive use of force resulting in death," CNN legal analyst Paul Callan said. "Police officers don't start their days expecting or wanting something like this to occur in the performance of their duties," PBA president Patrick Lynch said in a statement. He said the move "effectively pre-judges this case and denies the officer the very benefit of a doubt that has long been part of the social contract that allows police officers to face the risks of this difficult and complex job." The cause of Garner's death was "compression of neck (choke hold), compression of chest and prone positioning during physical restraint by police," said Julie Bolcer, a spokeswoman for the medical examiner's office. A terrible tragedy that no family should have to experience," de Blasio said after the death, calling the video of the incident "very troubling." Garner, a grandfather with six children, had a lengthy criminal history, including more than 30 arrests, and had been previously arrested for selling untaxed cigarettes in May, according to police.
