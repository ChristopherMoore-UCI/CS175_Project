Parliament approved several new bills, including a measure keeping elections to a single round, another cutting in half the number of lawmakers, and one that redraws voting districts. Zoltan Kovacs, state secretary for government communications, said the government is trying to resolve a problem spawned by the previous Socialist government. The people were taken into custody for blocking entrances and exits to the Parliament building and violating "personal freedom." Opposition members were protesting votes by Parliament on several contentious bills and wanted more debate about them before the vote. Orban is accused of tightening his grip on power by redrawing election boundaries, installing loyal judges in the country's courts and curbing media freedom.
