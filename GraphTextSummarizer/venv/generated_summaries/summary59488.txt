Lopez has previous arrests for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, theft, assault causing bodily injury and possession of marijuana, they said. "No criminal act is more disturbing than committing violence against a child, especially when the injuries inflicted are fatal," said Geoffrey Shank, an acting assistant director of the U.S. Marshals Service. -- A man suspected of killing a 1-year-old child in Texas last year is among the U.S. Marshals' most wanted fugitives, the service announced Friday. Lopez contacted Jeremy's aunt on November 23, claiming that the boy wasn't breathing, and dropped him off at her house, according to a statement released by the U.S. Marshals Service. The U.S. Marshals Service is offering a $25,000 reward for any information that leads directly to Lopez's arrest.
