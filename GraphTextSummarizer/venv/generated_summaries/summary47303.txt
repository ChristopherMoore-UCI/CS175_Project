But I understand that the family does have some options, and I expect they will make a decision soon." Asked if he opposed burying Tsarnaev in Massachusetts, Patrick said, "I don't have a comment about that or a point of view." Watch: Imam doesn't want body either On Sunday, Tsarnaev's uncle Ruslan Tsarni was the only relative at Stefan's funeral home. On Monday afternoon at a media event, Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick stressed that the fate of Tsarnaev's body rests with his family. Some might ask why there hasn't been a move to bury Tsarnaev at sea, the way Osama bin Laden was buried. He said his organization, the Main South Alliance for Public Safety, is trying to raise up to $5,000 to have Tsarnaev's body shipped overseas.
