Shooting claims young lives "The majority of those who died today were children -- beautiful little kids between the ages of 5 and 10 years old," the president said. Wiping away tears and choking up, President Barack Obama mourned the "beautiful little kids" slain Friday in a shooting massacre at a Connecticut school and called for preventing similar tragedies "regardless of the politics." Obama's statement focused mostly on the personal horror and grief that he and the nation felt at the news of another mass shooting in America, this time targeting young victims. It was a rare emotional display by Obama, known more for stoicism in such situations, and he referred to other recent U.S. mass shootings in calling for a national response. Obama treads carefully on assault weapons ban "We're going to have to come together and take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this, regardless of the politics," the president said.
