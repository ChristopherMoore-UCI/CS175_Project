Test cricket matches, the longest form of the game and lasting five days, also started on Boxing Day between New Zealand and Sri Lanka in Christchurch and South Africa and the West Indies in Port Elizabeth. The tradition of starting Test matches in Australia on Boxing Day dates back to 1974, when arch-rival England was the tourist. -- The sudden responsibility of leadership is resting well on Steve Smith's shoulders and it needed a captain's knock from him to lift Australia to a respectable 259 for five wickets after day one of the Boxing Day Test in Melbourne. Smith only took over from injured regular Australia skipper Michael Clarke for the second Test in Brisbane, which the home side won in four days to take a 2-0 lead in the best of four match series. Shaun Marsh (32) and debutant Joe Burns (13) both made starts but were unable to capitalize, leaving Smith, with good support from Haddin, to take Australia to the close in a respectable position.
