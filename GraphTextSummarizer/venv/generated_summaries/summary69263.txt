After a few days, our phone service was restored -- it had gone out with the power; this was decades before wireless technology and cell phones -- and my mother began calling her friends and cousins. And across the city, the power was out, overhead lines brought down by ice, trees and boughs. This is the storm that forecasters feared: trees laden with ice bringing a city of 6 million to its knees for a week. I remember it like it was yesterday: See 1973 footage of the storm from WAGA on YouTube We lost power almost immediately -- and with it the heat. When dawn broke, we could see the culprit -- and the damage: Pines in the park across the street stood naked like telephone poles, stripped of their branches under the weight of ice.
