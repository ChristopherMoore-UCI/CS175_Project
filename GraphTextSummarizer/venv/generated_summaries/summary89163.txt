City, hoping to reach for the European Champions League for the first time next season, are four points ahead of fifth-placed Tottenham -- but Roberto Mancini's team have played one more game than the team who pipped them to the final qualifying position last season. In the day's other match, sixth-placed Liverpool kept their hopes of playing European football next season alive with victory by the same score away to 10-man Sunderland. With Liverpool having been knocked out of the Europa League on Thursday, the win gave Kenny Dalglish's team hope of catching Tottenham to secure a berth for next season. A 78th-minute header from January signing Luiz and a fine solo effort by Ramires in time added on meant the London club moved into third place above City, a point clear having played one less match. -- Late goals from Brazilian duo David Luiz and Ramires gave Chelsea a 2-0 home win over Manchester City in the English Premier League on Sunday.
