The infamy of a No. 1 ranking in the news media eventually motivated China to focus more attention on cleaning up Linfen, but unfortunately, the scene of overwhelming pollution is still rampant in many parts of the country. Back in New York City, the coal mines of Shanxi Province feel worlds away, but as oil now gushes ceaselessly into our own backyard, we should pay even more attention to Linfen if we don't want it to be a glimpse into our own future. See the rest of Toxic Linfen at VBS.TV Before the trip, I had researched thousands of images of the pollution that plagues Linfen and Shanxi province, but to see it in person is, quite simply, devastating. Within weeks, we assembled a film crew and went off to the landlocked province in northern China to find out more. At the top of that list is the city of Linfen, a coal-mining and manufacturing hub in the heart of Shanxi Province.
