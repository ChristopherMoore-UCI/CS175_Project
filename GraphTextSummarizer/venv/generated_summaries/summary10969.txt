While the U.S. team played for bragging rights and to boost the sport's profile in their home country, Japanese players were hoping to give their citizens something to smile about after this spring's massive earthquake and tsunami. "We lost to a great team, we really did," U.S. goalkeeper Hope Solo told ESPN, which broadcast the game. "They are the biggest surprise in the tournament," U.S. defender Ali Krieger said of her opponents, prior to Sunday's match. In that same round, the U.S. team needed last-minute heroics to beat Brazil and advance. Steve Sklar, one of tens of thousands of Americans who watched Sunday's game, said the U.S. team succeeded in getting many of his countrymen excited about the sport.
