" Gaughan's attorneys filed another sexual abuse lawsuit on February 14 on behalf of a Philadelphia man who claims two priests at two separate schools sexually abused him, said attorney Dan Monahan. -- A new sexual abuse lawsuit was filed Monday against the Archdiocese of Philadelphia, Cardinal Anthony Bevilacqua, Cardinal Justin Rigali and other archdiocese staffers on behalf of a Delaware man who grew up in Philadelphia "Both of these cases clearly demonstrate the nefarious ways that the hierarchy of the Archdiocese of Philadelphia utilized to not only intimidate survivors through their so called "Victim's Assistance" program, but also how they actively engaged in a coverup of known sex abusers who were permitted to continue victimizing untold numbers of other children," Monahan said. Phil Gaughan claims the Reverend John E. Gillespie sexually abused him from 1994 to 1997 while attending Our Lady of Calvary parish in Philadelphia, according to the civil complaint. This year's grand jury report is the second priest sexual abuse grand jury report in Philadelphia, and the first time that a Catholic church leader has been charged criminally for an alleged cover-up.
