"We're excited to begin CBS' next chapter after midnight and introduce James' wide range of performance talents and fearless creative instincts to American television viewers," CBS Entertainment Chairman Nina Tassler said in a statement. Corden plays the Baker in the film, which also stars Johnny Depp, Meryl Streep, Emily Blunt and Anna Kendrick. CBS has yet to announce a final episode for "The Late Show with David Letterman," though Letterman has said he'll be stepping down sometime in 2015. But they'll get more of a glimpse of the talented Brit when "Into the Woods," the movie version of the Stephen Sondheim musical, opens Christmas Day. Stephen Colbert will take the reins from Letterman.
