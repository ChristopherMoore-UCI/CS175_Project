As the talk turned to 2016 and the looming parade of Republican presidential contenders set to march through Iowa, Branstad brushed off criticism that the caucuses favor uncompromising social conservatives over more moderate Republicans. The secret weapon that could save Iowa Democrats? Branstad was talking about his whiskers while giving me a private tour of the picturesque Iowa state capital for the latest episode of "Hambycast," showing off the knick-knacks and ceremonial gifts that decorate his hideaway office, normally off-limits to reporters. -- Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad, favored to win re-election and a historic sixth term in November, credits his famous facial hair for his political success.

There's a sizable pool of mainstream Republicans here waiting to be courted, and in a crowded presidential field, a candidate can win the state with a plurality — and without unified support from social conservatives.
