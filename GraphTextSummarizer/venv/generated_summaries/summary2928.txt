Authorities tried to pull the man out, but when that didn't work, they asked passengers to step out of the wagons and help push the six-car train in an effort to widen the gap, according to CNN affiliate Seven Network. The commuter was examined by medics, but was not hurt, Seven Network said. A man in Perth, Australia, somehow slipped and got his leg stuck in the narrow space between a commuter train and the platform Wednesday. Fellow passenger Nicolas Taylor told PerthNow the man seemed a little embarrassed, "because right where he fell was the 'mind the gap' writing." About 50 commuters lined up along the side of the train, and after two collective pushes, the man was able to free his left leg.
