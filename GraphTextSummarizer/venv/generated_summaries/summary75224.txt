Before there was "American Idol," there was the "Bennifer" era, when Lopez engaged in a very public relationship with Ben Affleck. She's viewing "Idol" as a way to jump-start her film and TV career, Levine said. But, according to insiders, Lopez needs "American Idol" just as much as it needs her. iReport: Will you watch Lopez on "Idol?" After leaving the hit TV show in 1993, Lopez finally found a place in the music industry with her debut album, "On the 6," in 1999. She's since headlined romantic comedies like "The Wedding Planner," "Shall We Dance," "Monster-in-Law" and her most recent flick "The Back-up Plan," which Levine jokes made about $12 at the box office.
