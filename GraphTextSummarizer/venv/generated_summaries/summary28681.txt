Liu will house the incredibly rare item, known in collectors' circles as the "holy grail" of Chinese ceramics,  in his private Long  Museum in Shanghai. Chinese money, Chinese art Liu is one of China's ultra-wealthy with an estimated net worth of $900 million, a former taxi driver who made his fortune in finance. Growing economic power from China, especially from super-rich Chinese collectors like Liu has contributed to Hong Kong's transformation into one of the world's auction hubs, and inflated prices around the globe. The sale does raise questions about the value of art in today's market, especially coming hot on the heels of the news that cleaners in a luxury Hong Kong hotel accidentally threw out a painting valued at almost HK$29 million ($3.7 million). "I think we're in a one-way elevator upwards in terms of prices for Chinese art," says Chow.
