-- If the attorney general of Mississippi had had his way, Michelle Byrom would have been executed Thursday for allegedly hiring someone to kill her husband, Edward Byrom Sr. This week the Mississippi Supreme Court denied the state attorney general's motion to set Thursday as an execution date for Ms. Byrom. When the defense took the unusual step of asking the judge, instead of the jury, to pass sentence, Judge Gardner chose death. Driven by conscience, Lott had told the judge what Junior had voluntarily revealed to him, but the judge did not disclose this to the jury and went so far as to instruct Lott not to share the information with the defense. The big question now is whether the Mississippi Supreme Court will grant Byrom's request for a hearing to consider the newly revealed evidence, including Lott's affidavit stating that he told the trial judge about Junior's confession.
