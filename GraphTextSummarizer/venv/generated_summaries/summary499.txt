" Celebrity news website TMZ previously quoted an unidentified law enforcement source saying Lohan and her assistant, Gavin Doyle, were suspects in the burglary. He stopped the car as she was leaving and found Lohan in a BMW with Doyle, Payan and a juvenile. Doyle acknowledged to the detective that he, Lohan and Payan had been at Magid's house twice in the early morning of the day the items were reported missing. The people burglarized are Sam Magid, a wealthy investor who the investigation report said "had a longstanding relationship" with Lohan, and a woman who was staying in his Hollywood Hills home. The story becomes another chapter in more than six years of brushes with the law for Lohan, who is attempting a career comeback after stints in rehab, jail and home confinement.
