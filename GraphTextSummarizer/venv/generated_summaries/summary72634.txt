Four years ago, a California atheist, Michael Newdow, objected and went to federal court to prevent Chief Justice John Roberts from prompting the president-elect to repeat the "so help me God phrase." Newdow, along with several non-religious groups, argued the words violate the constitutional ban on government "endorsement" of religion. Those four words are not legally or constitutionally required, unlike other federal oaths that invoke them as standard procedure. At his request, President Barack Obama is ending his inaugural oath with: "So help me God." Opinion: Presidents should not swear in on a Bible Obama took the official oath on Sunday at the White House with his left hand on the family Bible of his wife, Michelle. At Monday's ceremonial swearing-in at the Capitol, he will use Bibles from Lincoln and Martin Luther King Jr. Obama took the oath with the same Lincoln Bible in 2009 when he made history as the first African-American president.
