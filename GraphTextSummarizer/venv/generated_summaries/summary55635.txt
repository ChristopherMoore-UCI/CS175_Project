Furthermore, both of their runs contained holiday weekends in the first two frames, which make weekend-to-weekend drops difficult to compare. "Breaking Dawn's" $10,330 per theater average was the second-highest in the Top 10, and when all is said and done, it should finish its run in the $300 million range. After a disappointing opening last weekend, "Happy Feet Two" needed a miraculous hold to save its box office prospects -- but that didn't really happen. The well-reviewed $98 million production scored an "A--" CinemaScore grade, and while its subject matter should help it hold well throughout December, "Arthur" will need to post some very small declines to make up for its low $3,762 per theater average and maintain its location count. While those results sound alarmingly low, the silver lining here is that "Hugo" is only playing in 1,277 locations -- the smaller run yielded a strong $8,888 per theater average over three days.
