The reconciliation measure, also known as the "fixes" bill, makes changes in the broader health care overhaul measure that Obama enacted Tuesday. The Senate had to vote again on health care after Republicans forced two minor provisions involving student loan funding to be stripped from the bill. Reid, who spent months persuading fellow senators to vote "yes" on President Obama's top domestic priority, made the same mistake December 24 when voting on the original health care bill. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid mistakenly called out "no" Thursday when asked for his vote on the health care reconciliation bill, setting the chamber howling with laughter. His office said Reid made the gaffe because he was so focused on getting health care passed.
