Here are a few misconceptions to explode on Super Bowl Sunday (and all other days of the year): Smart women are never domestic violence victims Domestic violence occurs in all communities and all countries. Many of the 15 million children who witness family violence every year pay the abuse forward; boys who are exposed to violence in their homes are more likely to abuse their own partners and children later in life. With the recent controversy over Baltimore Ravens' running back Ray Rice, and San Francisco's Ray McDonald alleged sexual assault of a woman, the NFL badly needs some good PR when it comes to violence against women. Actor and singer Harry Belafonte said it best: "Men, who created violence against women, are the ones who should end violence against women. The major risk factor: being young and female; women 18-24 are three times as likely to be abuse victims, and one in four women will be physically abused by an intimate partner at some point in her life -- regardless of her IQ or diploma.
