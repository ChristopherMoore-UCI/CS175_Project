America's Cup sailboats can reach 35 knots, or 40 mph, in winds of almost half that amount, at 18 knots or 21 mph. "Well, I think you can look at many sports -- you can look at a NASCAR team, a Formula One team, you can look at a polo team -- you can spend that amount of money on a lot of different teams," said regatta director Murray. "There's no denying that the hundreds of millions being spent are bringing a new excitement to the sport and perhaps some new fans as the final series of the Cup is about to get underway," Murray added. Entry requires a specially designed sailboat, called the AC72, the shorthand for the 72-foot-long America's Cup catamarans. The four boats vying for the Cup -- the smallest fleet in history -- mirror such wealth.
