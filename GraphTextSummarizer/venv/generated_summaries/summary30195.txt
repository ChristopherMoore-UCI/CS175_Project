" His admission prompted fans to express their concern for the actor, who's lately stayed busy with appearances on TV shows like "Fringe" and "The Big Bang Theory," plus popping up at the movies in "Star Trek Into Darkness." "Just taped my comments for Star Trek Fest to be aired on EPIX Feb. 16th. The "Star Trek" actor recently revealed on Twitter that he's been diagnosed with COPD, or chronic lung disease. (The COPD stands for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.) Love my life, family, friends and followers," he tweeted.
