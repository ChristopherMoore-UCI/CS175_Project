CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank said this communication confirmed what U.S. intelligence officials had been saying for some time: "This trial has presented Awlaki not only as the charismatic driving force behind al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula but also a key operational figure in the group, a guy who is orchestrating plots against the West." "I pray that Allah may grant us a breakthrough through you ... can you please specify your role in the airline industry, how much access do you have to airports, what information do you have on the limitations and cracks in present airport security systems? Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab, a 23-year-old Nigerian man, had trained with AQAP in Yemen before attempting to detonate explosives sewn into his underpants, according to U.S. officials. A key part of the prosecution case was a series of heavily encrypted messages between al-Awlaki and Karim, in which al-Awlaki pressed for information about Karim's job and his knowledge of airport security. Al-Awlaki is thought to be hiding out in Yemen, and was recently described by U.S. President Barack Obama's counterterror chief, Michael Leiter, as posing a bigger threat to the U.S. homeland than Osama bin Laden.
