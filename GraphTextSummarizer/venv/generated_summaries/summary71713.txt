" Messi will be joined by big-name Brazilian signing Neymar for the new campaign, while Martino appeared to rule out the departure of midfielder Cesc Fabregas, who is the subject of a bid from English Premier League champions Manchester United. "If the club has signaled its refusal twice, then I signal it a third time - and  so he (Fabregas) will be staying here," Club vice-president Josep Maria Bartomeu, who flanked Martino with president Sandro Rosell, also chipped in. Martino is the fourth Argentine to take the helm at Barcelona after Roque Olsen, Helenio Herrera and Cesar Luis Menotti. Gerardo Martino was unveiled as Barcelona's new manager Friday -- promising not to change their attacking style of play but introducing "new ideas" to help the Catalan giants dominate European club football. The 50-year-old Martino has replaced Tito Vilanova, who stood down last week to undergo further treatment for throat cancer.
