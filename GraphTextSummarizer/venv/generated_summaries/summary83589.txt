Asked by committee member Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Oregon, about the possibility of a cyber-terrorism attack on the nation's power-grid system, Blair said that "a couple of years ago, (it would have been) a piece of cake. Regarding Iran's nuclear-development capabilities, Blair said that nation "is clearly developing all the components of nuclear material." In his first appearance before Congress in his new post, Blair addressed topics ranging from cyber-terrorism to al Qaeda. Extremist Muslim groups still pose the biggest threat for terrorist attacks, but there has been "notable progress" in turning Muslim opinion against such groups, including al Qaeda, he said. "Because of the pressure we and our allies have put on al Qaeda's core leadership in Pakistan and the continued decline of al Qaeda's most prominent regional affiliate in Iraq, al Qaeda today is less capable and effective than it was a year ago," he added.
