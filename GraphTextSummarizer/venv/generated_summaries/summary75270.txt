-- The number of people missing after flash floods swept cars off roads in the eastern Australian city of Toowoomba rose to more than 70 on Monday, with eight people confirmed dead, police in the state of Queensland reported. "A lot of places are in high alert and we still expect a good deal of rain, so we are still not out of the woods yet," Queensland police spokesman Ben Tracy said. The latest flooding hit Toowoomba, about 125 kilometers (80 miles) west of the state capital Brisbane and considerably south of other areas hit by recent floods. The Queensland Police Service confirmed that 72 people are now missing in the areas of Toowoomba and Lockyer Creek, and Chantelle Rule-Murphy, spokesperson for Emergency Management Queensland, said eight people have now been confirmed dead. Since November 30, the seasonal flooding in Queensland has caused rivers to spill over their banks and reach record levels.
