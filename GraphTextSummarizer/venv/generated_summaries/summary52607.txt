Welshman Jamie Donaldson and Bubba Watson tied for second, while Woods re-aggravated his back injury as he limped home with a six-over 78 to leave him tied for 25th. Dressed in the trademark red of the previous record holder Tiger Woods, Reed carded a level par 72 at Doral to total four-under 284. Other big names as well as Woods also struggled and former number one Rory McIlroy, who challenged at halfway, finished with a 74 to leave himself on the five over mark. But as Donaldson and former Masters winner Watson began to make up ground, Reed started to struggle, bogeying the 15th to give his rivals hope. World number two Adam Scott also finished tied 25th at five over, having gone into the $9 million event with hopes of leap frogging Woods.
