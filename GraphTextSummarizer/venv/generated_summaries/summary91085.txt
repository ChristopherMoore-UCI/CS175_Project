" Phillips was the first witness in the trial of James Arthur Ray, who faces reckless manslaughter charges stemming from his "Spiritual Warrior" retreat outside Sedona, Arizona. Ray, 53, had conducted his Spiritual Warrior Retreat for six years at a cost of about $10,000 to participants. -- Several participants in a 2009 "sweat lodge" ritual that left three people dead were collapsing and "having issues" in the superheated environment, a survivor testified Thursday in an Arizona self-help guru's manslaughter trial. But prosecutors maintain Ray psychologically pressured participants to remain in the lodge even when they weren't feeling well, contributing to their deaths. The sweat lodge hosted a purification ritual for participants modeled on Native American customs.
