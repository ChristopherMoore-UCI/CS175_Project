In short order, freed miner Victor Antonio Segovia dispatches with some of the myths swirling around the 33 men rescued from the depths of the earth this week: He has no plans to write a book about what he endured in the San Jose mine, he isn't going to sue anyone for the collapse, and he intends to go back to working in the area's mines. As the party gets under way, though, clapping and joyous chants of "Chi Chi Chi, Le Le Le, los mineros de Chile," can be heard from outside the house. All day Friday in the hardscrabble mining town of Paipote, Segovia's family and neighbors ready the Segovia family home for his arrival from the nearby hospital. The Segovia family was particularly hard hit by the collapse. Segovia appeared understandably worn from his ordeal and the crush of media attention.
