As it did in Wednesday's letter, airline management has blamed the problems on pilots for filing what it claims are frivolous maintenance reports. Then, on Wednesday, executive Denise Lynn wrote a letter to union leaders voicing concern about what she called "mounting evidence that certain pilots are engaging in an unlawful, concerted effort to damage the company." -- An American Airlines executive's threats to discipline pilots over delays and file legal action against its pilots union may poison already heated contract negotiations, a union spokesman said Thursday. The pilots union denies that there is an increase from historical norms in the number of pilots calling in sick. Pilots have already overwhelmingly rejected a tentative agreement that was more beneficial to its members than the rules imposed by the airline.
