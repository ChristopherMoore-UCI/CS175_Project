Massoud Akko, a Kurdish journalist and human rights defender based in Norway, told CNN there are two forms of stateless Kurds -- the majority, around 220,000, are called "foreigners" and they are the ones that the decree addresses. Many Kurds have been stateless, and Human Rights Watch said they have faced obstacles, such as getting work and state services. "In 1962, an exceptional census stripped some 120,000 Syrian Kurds -- 20 percent of the Syrian Kurdish population -- of their Syrian citizenship. " Human Rights Watch, which notes that the Kurds are the largest non-Arab ethnic minority in Syria, estimated the Kurdish population to be 1.7 million, about 10 percent of Syria's population. However, three major Kurdish parties have called for protests Friday in Qamishli, Aleppo and other Syrian cities.
