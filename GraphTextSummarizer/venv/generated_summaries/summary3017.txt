An American doctor who volunteered in Sierra Leone and was exposed to Ebola will be admitted to the Clinical Center of the National Institutes of Health in coming days, the NIH said in a statement. The assistant showed symptoms of Ebola 10 days ago, officials said, but Dahn last had contact with him 13 days ago. The ministry reopened on Friday, but Dr. Bernice T. Dahn entered a quarantine period, her deputy, Tolbert Nyenswah, said. The figures are based on information provided on September 23 by health ministries in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, the countries most impacted by the Ebola outbreak. Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf told world leaders at the United Nations this week that at least 85 of Liberia's more than 1,700 Ebola victims were health care workers.
