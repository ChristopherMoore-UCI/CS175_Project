-- U.S. drone strikes in Yemen on Friday killed six militants, including two senior leaders of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, four local security sources said. The Long War Journal, a website that tracks, reports and analyzes the U.S. fight against terrorists, said the drone strike was the first in Yemen since August 10, when the United States targeted AQAP operatives traveling in Lahj province. The strikes are believed to have been undertaken by the United States, which has been conducting drone strikes in the fight against terrorism. Drone strikes against militants in Yemen intensified a few weeks ago as the U.S. Embassy there and in other Middle Eastern and African countries closed amid terrorism fears. Offensives by the nation's army and drone attacks by the United States have reduced the terror organization's effectiveness in recent years.
