"Since the government introduced the five-day working week, more people have time to explore new hobbies." Indeed, Kim experienced first-hand the untapped national interest in the sport when he founded the Korea Match Cup in 2008. Now, according to Kim, there are seven marinas in South Korea -- up from just three in 2008 -- and another 30 or so in the pipeline. "Korea has all the right ingredients to become a great sailing nation," said Dong Young Kim, Team Korea's founder. Although widely credited with being the true driving force behind Korea's dawning love affair with sailboats, Kim is modest about his ambitions. Team Korea will be known as the "White Tiger Challenge" -- a reference to one of the ancient guardian gods in Korean mythology -- and will compete in San Francisco for the 2013 title alongside 14 other teams, including the staple powerhouses of France, Italy, New Zealand and the U.S. defenders.
