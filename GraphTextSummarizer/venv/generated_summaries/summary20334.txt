The U.S. Army has suspended 55 soldiers from their duties as sexual assault counselors, recruiters and drill instructors after a review turned up violations ranging from alcohol-related offenses to sexual assault and child abuse, an Army official said Friday. The Defense Department has stepped up efforts to hold perpetrators accountable, establishing a special victims unit to handle cases, working to improve tracking of reports and speeding transfers for troops who report a sexual assault by a member of their unit. The soldiers were identified as part of a review of the records of sexual assault counselors and recruiters ordered by U.S. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel after a Pentagon report released in May found that more than 26,000 troops experienced an episode of "unwanted sexual contact" in 2012, a huge jump from the 19,200 figure in a 2010 report. Military officials worry that many victims don't come forward because they are frightened of retaliation. The Army has confirmed it is reviewing the records of 20,000 recruiters, sex assault and drill instructors, and that it is on track to finish the review by October 1.
