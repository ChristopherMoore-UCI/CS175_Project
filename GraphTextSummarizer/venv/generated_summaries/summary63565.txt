The scientists said a single vaccination was shown to prevent breast cancer tumors from forming in mice, and also stymied the growth of existing tumors. If any human testing proves successful, the strategy would be to vaccinate women 40 and over as well as younger women with a heightened risk of breast cancer. "It just struck me as a giant hole in our health care that we don't have preventive vaccines that mimic the childhood vaccination program for adult diseases like breast cancer," said Tuohy. The vaccine contains a protein found in most breast cancers, but not found in healthy women, except during lactation, according to Dr. Vincent Tuohy, the study's principal investigator and an immunologist at the Cleveland Clinic's Lerner Research Institute. -- Scientists at Ohio's Cleveland Clinic are touting a new prototype vaccine to prevent breast cancer as "promising."
