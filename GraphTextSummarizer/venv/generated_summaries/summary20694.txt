Peterson trial to begin in December if judge isn't nixed for 'media whores' jab Peterson -- who in 2011 signed a seven-year contract worth more than $100 million and is considered one of the NFL's best running backs, if not the best -- left the Minnesota Vikings last month after the team deactivated, then activated and deactivated him again after accusations that he whipped his 4-year-old son with a "switch," or slender tree branch. A prosecutor in Texas wants Adrian Peterson arrested and his bond revoked after the NFL star allegedly admitted to smoking marijuana while out on bail on a felony child abuse charge. According to Texas law, people can be convicted of injury to a child if they cause bodily or mental injury "intentionally, knowingly, recklessly or with criminal negligence" or cause such harm by omission. Montgomery County District Attorney Brett Ligon sent a motion to the 9th District Court to set aside the NFL star's bail, saying Peterson told an employee of a company that does drug testing that he "smoked a little weed. One of Peterson's attorneys, Rusty Hardin, said he had no comment on the latest development in the case, which is tentatively scheduled to go to trial on December 1.
