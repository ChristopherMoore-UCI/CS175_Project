In 1989, the Griswold family wasn't so lucky in National Lampoon's "Christmas Vacation," the third movie in a franchise that included 1983's inaugural "Vacation," 1985's "European Vacation" and 1997's "Vegas Vacation. " Directed by Jeremiah Chechik in his feature film debut, "Christmas Vacation" reunited Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo as Clark and Ellen Griswold, Chicago-area parents of two who never seem to get the "vacation" concept quite right. Simply called "Vacation," the upcoming movie will focus on the Griswold's son Rusty, who in the new movie will be an adult taking his own family on a getaway. Ed Helms has signed on to play the grown-up Rusty Griswold with Leslie Mann as his sister, Audrey, and Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo making cameos as the Griswold parents. When "Christmas Vacation" premiered in December 1989, it opened in second place at the box office and went on to gross $71.3 million domestically.
