Wade also posted a picture of himself in a hoodie on his Facebook page and linked to it from Twitter tagged with "#hoodies #stereotypes #trayvonmartin" "I'm a father," Wade told the South Florida Sun Sentinel. -- As I walked the streets of New York the other day, I saw several white youths with hoodies, tattoos and nose rings. While walking into the Howard University Hospital in Washington earlier that day, a few African-Americans rocked various types of hoodies. What the Trayvon Martin shooting should tell us is that the stereotypes that we have of people can have deadly consequences. Trayvon Martin, you know, God bless him, he was an innocent kid, a wonderful kid, a box of Skittles in his hands.
