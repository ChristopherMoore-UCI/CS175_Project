"Listeners will have access to more diverse and pluralistic radio-content, and enjoy better sound quality and new functionality," Widvey said in a news release. Half the country already listens that way, said Culture Minister Thorhild Widvey. Officials say the move will spur innovation because the cost of digital transmission will save some $25 million. Video may have killed the radio star, but in Norway it's digital that's killing FM radio. That doesn't mean that Norwegians will be left with radio silence; they'll merely have to tune in digitally.
