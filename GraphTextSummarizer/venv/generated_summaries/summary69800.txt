G20 needs to change Just as the G20 has evolved in recent years from a gathering of finance ministers to include national leaders, the involvement of non-government organizations in G20 meetings and decision-making is a reflection of the realities of contemporary governing and policy making.

The G20's commitment to pursuing economic growth of two percentage points above current targets over the next five years is welcome.

Consider the key agenda item of driving jobs growth.
