They know of what they speak: There is a long, dark history of Egypt's military rulers brutalizing Muslim Brotherhood leaders. For their part, secularists never accepted the legitimacy of the Morsy government and vowed to prevent political Islam from taking hold. Although the Brotherhood did not lead the events of January 2011 that toppled the Mubarak regime, it quickly capitalized on them to become the political front-runner in post-revolutionary Egypt. The Brotherhood, a popular grass-roots political, social and religious movement, had attracted a huge following with its simple slogan, "Islam is the solution," and its provision of social services. Still, the government barely tolerated the Brotherhood; under longtime President Hosni Mubarak, Brotherhood leaders were regularly arrested in crackdowns.
