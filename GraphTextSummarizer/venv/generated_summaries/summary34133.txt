Ken Ng, head of Hong Kong Kitchee, one of the top local teams, has been working with former Spanish athletes for years to develop local players. As Spain's economy finds new lows, there is one clear winner in the eurozone crisis: Hong Kong football. Despite the city's low ranking, there are some in Hong Kong with a long-term strategy to import players and know-how from the world's best: embattled football-superpower Spain. "I've decided to come to Hong Kong because opportunities in my country aren't very promising," former Spanish La Liga player Lander Panera told CNN. In the meantime, Spanish players like Panera are considering Hong Kong as a permanent home.
