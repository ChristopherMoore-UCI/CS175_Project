Brooks' arrest came two days after her resignation as head of News International, the British subsidiary of Murdoch's global conglomerate News Corp., while Coulson had gone on to become Prime Minister David Cameron's communications director. -- Investigators have found no sign of foul play in the death of a man identified as the whistleblower behind the scandal surrounding media mogul Rupert Murdoch's News International, British police announced Tuesday. His allegations ultimately led to Tuesday's testimony by Murdoch to a House of Commons committee, where he denied ultimate responsibility for illegal phone hacking carried out by his employees. Coulson resigned his Downing Street post in January when police launched a new probe into the hacking allegations. He was one of the few sources who allowed his name to be used when speaking to the Times last year for an investigative report about allegations of phone-hacking by the British tabloid, which was shuttered last weekend as the scandal grew.
