Since North Korean refugees are considered illegal migrants in China, I lived in constant fear that my identity would be revealed and I would be repatriated to a horrible fate back in North Korea. Watch Hyeonseo Lee's TED Talk I can't reveal the details of how I left North Korea, but I can say that during the dark years of the famine when I was a young girl, I went alone to China to live with distant relatives. A huge famine hit North Korea in the mid to late 1990s, and I began to see suffering, hunger and death around me. Someone had accused me of being North Korean, so they tested my Chinese language abilities and asked me tons of questions. The kind stranger symbolized new hope for me and other North Koreans when we needed it the most.
