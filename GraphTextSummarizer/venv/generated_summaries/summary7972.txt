Ars Technica's sources say Apple's about to present new authoring tools described as "GarageBand for e-books," making it easy for everyone to create interactive digital books. A new report from Ars Technica says the company is about to unveil a set of tools to create interactive e-books. The company also plans to expand its platform to distribute these e-books to iPhone and iPad users. Apple, who currently supports the ePub 2 e-book standard (with some additions) is also expected to announce support for the ePub 3 standard for iBooks. This venture is described as the pet project of Steve Jobs, who -- according to Walter Isaacson's biography -- believed the textbook industry is ripe for "digital destruction."
