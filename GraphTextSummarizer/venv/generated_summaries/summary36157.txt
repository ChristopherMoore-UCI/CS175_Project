It was an astonishing turn around after another race set to be dominated by Mercedes with title leader Rosberg battling to hold off teammate Lewis Hamilton for the honors. Rosberg, who started from pole, eventually came under pressure from Hamilton, who had initially lost second place to Vettel. The Red Bull rookie overtook title leader Nico Rosberg in the closing stages of the 70-lap race in Montreal and took the checkered flag under the safety car after Felipe Massa of Williams and Sergio Perez in his Force India crashed while battling for minor places. Hamilton finally passed Rosberg to take second, but then was forced to retire with a rear brake problem. Rosberg, who reclaimed the lead, was unable to hold off the charging Ricciardo, but will be consoled by opening up a potentially decisive 22-point lead in the championship race over Hamilton.
