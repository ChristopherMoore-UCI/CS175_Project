The State Department's official website says after the 9/11 terror attacks on American soil, Syria "began limited cooperation with U.S. counterterrorism efforts." U.S.-based attorneys for Syria had argued "several procedural, constitutional, and jurisdictional defects" in the the trial judge's original ruling upholding a default judgment. The families claimed Syrian officials facilitated the torture and beheadings by providing material support, which federal law says can consist of not only money, weapons and shelter, but also "advice or assistance." The separate estates of the two Americans then brought a lawsuit against Syria, which included the country's president and head of military intelligence. The judges noted the case arose from "gruesome and memorable facts." Olin "Jack" Armstrong and Jack Hensley were working as military contractors in Iraq when they were abducted in 2004. -- A $413 million judgment against Syria, resulting from a terror group's gruesome murder of two Americans, was upheld Friday by a U.S. federal appeals court.
