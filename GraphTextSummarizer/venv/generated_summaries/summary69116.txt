TED.com: Andrew Mwenda takes a new look at Africa Entrepreneurs can create a simple fundraising website including legally compliant investment terms, raise seed capital online, manage their community of supporters, pay investors dividends over time, provide regular updates on their business's progress, and much more. ProFounder is a crowd-funding platform for American entrepreneurs to raise investments from their friends, families and communities. On Kiva, people can lend as little as $25 to specific entrepreneurs and get their money back when the entrepreneur repays. Building on lessons learned at Kiva, I've now turned my attention back home to focus on serving small business here in the U.S. as co-founder and CEO of ProFounder (http://www.profounder.com/). It is my hope that ProFounder can change the way we support small businesses and start-ups in America.
