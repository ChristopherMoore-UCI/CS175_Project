In high-pressure situations, police often experience "contagion shooting," a former Branford, Connecticut, police chief said. Procopio concurred with that comparison: "Considering the chaos and the battlefield conditions -- where a pair of homicidal terrorists were firing shots and throwing bombs at police -- the fact that friendly fire incidents might have occurred detracts nothing -- not one bit -- from the valor exhibited by the police officers and state troopers present that night," the Massachusetts State Police spokesman said. Hours after that FBI news conference, Boston and the rest of the country followed as the suspects allegedly shot and killed a Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer in a failed attempt to seize his gun, carjacked a black Mercedes SUV whose driver cleverly escaped at a gas station, then fled to the Boston suburb of Watertown, where they were confronted by police. Now, almost a month later, two police sources have shed new light on exactly what happened when police confronted the two suspects in Watertown during the early hours of April 19, triggering a gun battle unlike anything recently seen on the streets of an American city. "Things (that) occur in the very dynamic moments of a situation like this ... are not necessarily -- no matter how hard police work -- what they are trained to do," said the former police chief, noting that none of his remarks are intended as criticism of police.
