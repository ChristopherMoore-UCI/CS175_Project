She also recalled hearing Jones' "White Lightning" blaring from the White House gym as "George W. worked out on the treadmill listening to George J." "In American music, George was truly a legend beyond compare," she said. Stars such as Randy Travis, Brad Paisley and Tanya Tucker paid homage to Jones, who died Friday at 81, with music and heartfelt speeches. -- Country music stars and fans alike honored George Jones on Thursday at the Grand Ole Opry House in Nashville. Barbara Mandrell, who sang alongside Jones on her 1981 hit "I Was Country When Country Wasn't Cool," took the stage to say a few words about "the greatest singer of all time in country music." Nobody will ever be able to fill Jones' shoes, she added.
