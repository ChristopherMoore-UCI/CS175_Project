" Borrowing on that idea, Zola started Morningside Village in 2009, an initiative that pairs the elderly in her neighborhood with local volunteers who assist them with their day-to-day needs. "I didn't want to leave my mother in a place where people were ignoring her." Four months later, Zola's mother passed away. "I wanted to establish something to support the aging-in-place community and bring people across generations together," Zola said. Morningside Village is just one initiative of Zola's nonprofit, S.O.S., Support Our Seniors. In addition to companionship, volunteers provide a wide range of assistance tailored to the needs of the elders, including help with home management, grocery shopping and meal preparation as well as accompanying them to doctor's appointments.
