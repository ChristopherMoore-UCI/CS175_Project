Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, sent his stinging letter to Holder Thursday, calling it "inexcusable" for the department not to prosecute criminal behavior by the British banking giant HSBC. The top Republican on the Senate committee that oversees the Justice Department issued a blistering criticism of Attorney General Eric Holder and his department for failing to pursue criminal charges against a giant global bank that admits violating federal laws by laundering money on behalf of Iran, Libya, Sudan and Myanmar. HSBC Chief Executive Stuart Gulliver released a statement Tuesday, saying "we accept responsibility for our past mistakes." "What I have seen from the department is an inexplicable unwillingness to prosecute and convict those responsible for aiding and abetting drug lords and terrorists," Grassley wrote. In a settlement reached Tuesday, HSBC agreed to pay the U.S. government $1.92 billion in a wide-ranging agreement.
