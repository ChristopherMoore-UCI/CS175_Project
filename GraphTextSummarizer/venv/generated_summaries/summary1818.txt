Now the executive director of Veterans Across America, White is working to help the new generation of veterans, mostly from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, find jobs. A 1st Cavalry Platoon leader and acting company commander in Vietnam, White experienced the struggles of war and the challenges of readjusting to civilian life. In 1969, White says, he was spat on by Vietnam War protesters at Travis Air Force Base in California. Veterans are simply guided to online portals, where they submit hundreds of copies of their résumés to jobs found on a list. Steve White knows firsthand just how difficult coming home from war can be.
