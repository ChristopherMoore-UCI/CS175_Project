Record run Elsewhere, defending champion Bayern Munich set a new Champions League record after winning a 10th consecutive game. "There were so many good performances," United manager Moyes told Sky Sports. "Getting 10 wins in a row is very hard and I am proud of my players, the club and everyone involved," Bayern manager Pep Guardiola told reporters. The English champion cruised to a 5-0 away win at Bayer Leverkusen -- despite missing a whole host of players including striker Robin van Persie. City, already through to the next stage, continued its goalscoring streak following the 6-0 Premier League win over Tottenham at the weekend.
