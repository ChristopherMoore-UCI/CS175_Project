He even said his own previous efforts, including sporting events designed to help vets, are important but aren't "transformative enough." Bush announced that his Military Service initiative has launched a multi-faceted, public-private partnership aimed at helping veterans assimilate back into civilian life. "Employers would not hesitate to hire an employee getting treated for a medical condition like diabetes or high blood pressure and they should not hesitate to hire veterans getting treated for post-traumatic stress," he said. " It's "troubling" that 84% of veterans say the public isn't aware of the challenges they face and that 71% of Americans agree, Bush said, citing a survey by the Bush Institute and Syracuse University to be released later this year. In a rare public appearance, President George W. Bush delivered a serious message for the 99%: Step up. Veterans groups praised Bush's effort.
