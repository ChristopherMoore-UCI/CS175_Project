While immigration reform is stalled in Congress, some members are calling on President Barack Obama to take the matter into his own hands, urging him to suspend deportations of undocumented immigrants. In their letter, the members point to executive action in 201,2 when Obama exercised his discretion to suspend deportations of children of undocumented immigrants, known as Deferred Action of Childhood Arrivals. Thirty Democratic members of Congress wrote in a letter that he has the authority to pause deportations of undocumented immigrants, urging "the sensible and moral step of stopping deportations." The lawmakers are the most prominent of a growing chorus calling on Obama to use his executive authority to exercise "prosecutorial discretion" to suspend deportations of undocumented immigrants. Obama said he can't stop deportations of immigrants, but maybe he can "Mr. President, you do have the power to stop what's going on," Rep. Charlie Rangel, D-New York, said at a news conference on Thursday.
