The horrific scene at this southwestern Baghdad mosque is what officials say was the work of a Shiite militia known as the Mehdi Army. -- "There are the bloodstains on the wall, and here it is dried on the floor," Abu Muhanad said as he walked through a torture chamber in a Baghdad mosque where more than two dozen bodies have been found. "They said they were just taking him for a few minutes, for an investigation," said Karima, who only wanted to be identified by her first name, as her eyes filled with tears. " Umm Diab's breath came in shallow gasps as tears flowed from her turquoise-green eyes. The family members at the mosque who spoke to CNN were all Shiite, the same branch of Islam as the Mehdi militia.
