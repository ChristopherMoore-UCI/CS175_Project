Bloomington police are in contact with the Indianapolis Metropolitan police, the agency that recovered the body, but there is not enough information for police to "determine the identity or a basic description of the body," Lt. William Parker said in a statement. In mid-June, police had found possible new clues to Spierer's disappearance -- images of a white pick-up truck caught on a security surveillance video. -- Investigators in the case of a missing Indiana University student hope forensic evidence will help them determine whether a decomposing body found in a creek Monday north of Indianapolis is connected with the disappearance of Lauren Spierer. Parker hopes a pending forensic examination will provide more information, his statement said. Bloomington police have been searching for Spierer, 20, since June 2, when she was last seen leaving a sports bar in Bloomington after a night out with friends.
