The weekend's other new wide release, "The Big Year," debuted way back in ninth place with $3.3 million out of 2,150 theaters. Considering "The Thing" earned a weak "B-" CinemaScore grade and a sad $2,990 per theater average, that total is about the best it can hope for. In limited release, Pedro Almodovar's deeply creepy "The Skin I Live In" got off to a strong start, with $231,000 in six theaters, good for a robust $38,500 per theater average. As evidenced by the film's impressive 64 percent boost on Saturday, it appears that "Real Steel" is playing as an outright family affair, and that sort of appeal will help it achieve small drops in the coming weeks. "Dolphin Tale" spent one last weekend in the Top 5, sliding 31 percent to $6.3 million.
