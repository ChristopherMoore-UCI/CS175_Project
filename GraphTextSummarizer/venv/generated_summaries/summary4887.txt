Renewed attacks But since mid-May, M23 forces have carried out repeated attacks on government troop positions "in an apparent attempt to advance on Goma and Sake," another nearby city, the U.N. mission says. The rebels have used "indiscriminate and indirect fire, including by heavy weapons, resulting in civilian casualties" and attacks on U.N. installations, the peacekeepers say. -- Rebels in an unstable part of the Democratic Republic of Congo have until Thursday afternoon to hand in their weapons to U.N. peacekeepers or risk being disarmed by force. Sitting on the shore of Lake Kivu, the city has been at the center of clashes in the region over the past year between the M23 rebel group and Congolese government troops that have displaced more than 100,000 people, according to the U.N. The rebels occupied Goma for more than a week in November before withdrawing amid pressure from regional leaders and the African Union. At least 800,000 people in Rwanda were killed in the 1994 genocide, one of the worst mass slaughters in the post-World War II era.
