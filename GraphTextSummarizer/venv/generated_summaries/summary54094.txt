Murray was bidding to extend his unbeaten streak to 19 matches, but was beaten 4-6 7-6 6-4 by sixth seed Berdych, who will be joining him at the ATP Tour Finals in London later this month. The tournament lost another big attraction in quarterfinal action Friday as second seed Andy Murray crashed out to Czech Tomas Berdych. "Sadly I have to inform you that I have withdrawn from the tournament," he said on his official website on Friday, raising doubts that he will be fit to play in the season-ending ATP World Tour Finals in London this month. Tsonga will play John Isner of the United States for a place in the final after he upset fourth seed David Ferrer of Spain 6-3 3-6 6-3 in the final quarterfinal of an eventful day in the French capital. Berdych leveled with superb play in the second set tiebreak and a crucial break in the ninth game of the decider left him to serve out for victory and his third win in four matches with Scot Murray.
