Oslo's most visited site is Vigeland Park that houses more than 200 huge, some say Rodin-esque, sculptures by celebrated Norwegian artist Gustav Vigeland. Other free museums and attractions include the Nasjonalgalleriet with one of the original series of Edvard Munch's The Scream; the Astrup Fearnley museum for modern art with its own Damien Hirst; and the botanical gardens. To reward a day's cost cutting, and for the best sunset in town, try a seafood platter at restaurant, Solsiden (SÃ¸ndre Akershus Kai 34, phone 23-33-36-30). You get a Norwegian prawn buffet as part of the deal and two-hour trip around the city's islands and lakes. The restaurant opens onto a pier looking over the Aker Brygge complex, a former shipyard area and now a hub for restaurants and bars.
