Hibbs says that as a country with nuclear power ambitions itself, Saudi Arabia is deeply hostile to Iran having a nuclear program that includes sensitive activities like uranium enrichment. Republican leaders in the U.S. Congress have also said they will try to pass new Iran sanctions, despite Secretary of State John Kerry's warning that the move could "destroy the ability to get an agreement" in Geneva. Iran has always insisted it only wants to use nuclear power for peaceful purposes. Iran also wants the world to acknowledge its right to enrich uranium under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). Iran believes that it has the right to enrich uranium as a signatory to the NPT, but Hibbs says no such right is enshrined in the treaty.
