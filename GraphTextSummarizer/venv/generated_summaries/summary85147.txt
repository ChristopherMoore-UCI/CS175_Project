Barcelona knocked out PSG in the quarterfinals last season but the French side have been in ominous form in recent weeks and turned the screw on hosts Leverkusen from the third minute. Like Manchester City, Leverkusen were also reduced to ten men as defender Emic Spahic, who had conceded the penalty earlier, was sent off in the 59th minute. After a lacklustre first half, Barca took the lead through a Lionel Messi penalty earned after City's Martin Demichelis had been shown the red card for a professional foul. " On Wednesday, the next two matches of a staggered Last 16 phase take place when Arsenal host defending champions Bayern Munich and Atletico Madrid travel to seven-time winners AC Milan. "Tonight, we re-found our collective power, as if it was at the beginning of the season," PSG coach Laurent Blanc told French TV station Canal Plus.
