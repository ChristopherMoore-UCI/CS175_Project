Our socially toxic culture promotes paranoia, desensitization to violence, almost unlimited access to lethal weapons, opportunities to practice mass murder via realistic "point and shoot" video games and games that justify violence as a legitimate form of vengeance in pursuit of an individual's or group's idea of justice. Thinking twice about violent video games They can be found in pervasive and intense playing of video games, the hands-on virtual violence that desensitizes young people to proxy killing. We start by recognizing that many young Americans (and other young people around the world) develop and carry with them a kind of moral damage, which I have come to call "the war zone mentality." As someone who listens to killers as an expert psychological witness in murder cases, I have spent much of the last 20 years trying to understand how and why young men kill, maim and attack others. The boys and young men can be socially isolated because their damage makes peers and the community turn away from them, and that only compounds their problems.
