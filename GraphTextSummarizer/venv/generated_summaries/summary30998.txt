In recent months, several Web companies have launched sites devoted to the idea of undermining or killing Internet Explorer 6. "We're about to hit a breaking point where innovation will be stifled if Web sites must continue to cater to this browser," he wrote in a post titled, "IE 6 Must Die for the Web to Move On." The "IE 6 No More" site provides Web developers with a piece of code -- an online hurdle, essentially -- they can install to encourage Internet users to download a new browser before coming back to the site. They also blame IE 6 for giving webmasters a collective headache, because they have to write special "hacks" into Web code to accommodate an outmoded browser. Developers are already working with a new Web language -- called HTML 5 -- that is expected to make Web sites able to display flashier video, save documents to computers more easily and act more like traditional computer applications.
