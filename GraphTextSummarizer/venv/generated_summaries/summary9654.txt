-- With fans still reeling from last Sunday's Red Wedding episode, "The Rains of Castamere," the third season of "Game of Thrones" comes to a close this weekend, and no one is waiting with more bated breath for that than Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, who plays Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer on the HBO program. He was surprised to see more people were disgusted in season one that Jaime Lannister "was having sex with his own sister than that he pushed a kid out a window." " Coster-Waldau, who recently appeared in the Tom Cruise film "Oblivion" and is shooting "The Other Woman," a romantic comedy with Cameron Diaz and Leslie Mann, finds the most interesting aspect of watching "Game of Thrones" is being able to reassess the constantly shifting scales of morality in a world where no one character is completely a hero or a villain (save for perhaps Joffrey?). "One of my favorite scenes with Brienne (played by Gwendoline Christie) was last season, when we come across three girls hanging," Coster-Waldau recalled. If Ned Stark's beheading in season one and the Red Wedding in season three taught us anything, Coster-Waldau said, it should be to look at the chain of consequences of each character's actions.
