Kultala, a Democrat running to oust Kansas Republican Rep. Kevin Yoder, released an ad on Thursday that featured a handful of seemingly naked people urging viewers to support the Democrat in November's election. The ad then features the seemingly naked volunteers citing different aspects of Yoder's record, including that "Yoder lines the pockets of his millionaire donors with big tax cuts. The (faux) nudity in the ad -- titled "Naked Truth" -- was a knock on Yoder, who in 2011 skinny dipped in the Sea of Galilee in Israel, a decision for which he was reprimanded by House Republicans in 2012. "Awhile back, Congressman Yoder made news by skinny dipping on the job," Kultala says in the ad. According to Becklund, "It was a pretty easy sell to all of our volunteers," even though the ad -- which comes with a "high five figure (cost) behind it" -- will be seen on cable and broadcast in the Kansas City market starting Friday.
