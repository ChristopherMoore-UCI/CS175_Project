So when the New Mexico native went to a gas station to purchase his weekly Powerball ticket, on one particular Saturday in December, he sprung for a scratch-off ticket, too. Playing the lottery has always been something fun to do for retiree John Wines. Wines called the New Mexico Lottery Commission, which confirmed the ticket was a misprint. But when he took the ticket to the store where he bought it, the store clerk put the ticket in a scanner that said Wines wasn't a winner after all. But it only thanked him for calling to attention the misprint and offered him $100 in lottery bucks.
