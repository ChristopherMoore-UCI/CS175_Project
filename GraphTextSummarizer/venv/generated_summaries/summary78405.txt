The incident occurred after the New Jersey-bound bus departed Queens, New York -- loaded with 65 teenagers -- and had just crossed the George Washington Bridge. The bus is touted online as "the largest custom made party bus in the country," according to Designer Transportation, which released a statement expressing sympathy for the teen's family. Coleman said the teen had suffered severe head trauma, but would not comment further. Fernandez was brought to Hackensack Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead, said hospital spokeswoman Nancy Radwin. Daniel Fernandez, a 16-year-old resident of Sayreville, died Friday evening on his way to a sweet 16 party, according to Port Authority spokesman Steve Coleman.
