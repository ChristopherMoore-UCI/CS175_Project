"It is again a new start for people to move Thailand forward and to solve various problems of people and their families efficiently under democratic means," Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva said in a national address Monday. Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej approved the prime minister's request to dissolve the lower chamber of that country's Parliament on Monday, setting the stage for new elections, a government spokesman said. Parliamentary elections will be held July 3, acting government spokesman Panitan Wattanayakorn said. "The problem rooted from political conflict is another problem  which is still severe," Abhisit said in his recorded address Monday. Abhisit resisted street demonstrations a year ago demanding that he step down, with clashes between his supporters and those of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra sometimes turning violent.
