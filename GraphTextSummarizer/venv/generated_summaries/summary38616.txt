The jurors cited by the Jackson motion used the words "stunned," "upset" and "shocked" when they were told they had to stop deliberations after a majority agreed that the answer was "no" to the second question on the verdict form: "Was Dr. Conrad Murray unfit or incompetent to perform the work for which he was hired?" One juror called the question "a trap that prevented us from deliberating on the real issues of the case." "After sitting through almost six months of the trial in this case, I believed that Mrs. Jackson had proven her case against AEG LIve," another juror said. Jackson died from an overdose of the surgical anesthetic propofol on June 25, 2009, which Dr. Conrad Murray told police he used to treat the pop icon's insomnia as he prepared for a tour produced by AEG Live. Jackson death trial jurors: 'Stunned,' 'cheated' by verdict process Conrad Murray completes jail time for killing Michael Jackson Los Angeles County Judge Yvette Palazuelos issued a tentative ruling saying that she did not err in her decisions on the verdict form or with the dismissal of the negligence claim. Lawyers for mother Katherine Jackson argued that the verdict form used by the jury was faulty and that the judge erred by refusing to let them pursue a negligence claim independent of the hiring case.
