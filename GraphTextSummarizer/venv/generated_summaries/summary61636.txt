"Some repayment is commonplace after presidential campaign audits and the repayment ordered here is relatively small," said Biden spokeswoman Elizabeth Alexander. In a report released Friday, the FEC said a mandatory audit showed the campaign had accepted contributions above the legal limit, failed to adequately pay for rides on a private jet, and issued several checks that had never been cashed. Biden dropped his bid for president in January 2008 after a fifth place finish in the Iowa caucuses. "Stale dated checks are where someone contributes over the allowed max and campaign sends back refund of overage, but the check is never cashed," said a senior administration official in the vice president's office. According to the FEC, if the campaign has issued checks that the payees have not cashed within a reasonable time frame, the campaign must reimburse the Treasury for the amount of the outstanding checks.
