No civil rights charges will be brought against George Zimmerman in the February 2012 shooting death of Trayvon Martin, the U.S. Justice Department announced Tuesday, citing what it said was insufficient evidence. " Justice Department prosecutors and officials from the FBI met with Martin's family on Tuesday to inform them of the decision, the department said. "Though a comprehensive investigation found that the high standard for a federal hate crime prosecution cannot be met under the circumstances here, this young man's premature death necessitates that we continue the dialogue and be unafraid of confronting the issues and tensions his passing brought to the surface," Attorney General Eric Holder said in a news release. Civil rights leaders, as well as Martin's relatives, took to the streets contending that the teen -- who'd gone out to get a drink and Skittles from a Sanford, Florida, convenience store only to run into Zimmerman on his way back -- might still be alive today if not for the color of his skin. Still, the bar was always high to charge Zimmerman under federal hate crime laws, as it is for anyone.
