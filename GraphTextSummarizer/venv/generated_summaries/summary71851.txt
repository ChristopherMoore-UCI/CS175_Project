But in real life, with a real Don Draper, I could only do so much. What makes Don Draper so drool-worthy on screen does not translate in real life. That's why I'll give my attention to Don Draper once a week, from the comfort of my couch, but never again in real life. Betty Draper may not know Don's secrets, but they do share a bond he doesn't have with other people. That's why I (and I think lots of other women) mostly love -- and sometimes hate -- Don Draper.
