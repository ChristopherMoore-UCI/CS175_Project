Mike Greer claimed the $128.6 million prize on Friday, on behalf of a group of southeastern Michigan residents that he dubbed "Team Victory Club." Uptown Book Store, an adult novelty store a few miles north of Detroit that also rents pornographic videos, will get $50,000 from lottery officials for selling the winning ticket. At a press conference in Lansing, Michigan, Greer wouldn't answer questions as to who purchased the ticket at Uptown Book Store in Highland Park, or why they were at the store in the first place. Friday's dual announcement marked the largest single-day payout since the Michigan Lottery began 38 years ago, and the first time that a single state lottery has had Powerball and Mega Millions winners so close together, according to the Michigan Lottery. He opted for the annuity plan, spreading out his winnings over 26 years, according to CNN affiliate WILX.
