Eight of the climbers who died on Mount Tomuraushi were in a group organized by a tourist company, according to Yuji Kikuchi, a spokesman for Hokkaido police. -- Ten climbers have died on two mountains in northern Japan, police said Friday. The area has experienced heavy rain and gusty winds in the past two weeks due to a persistent area of low pressure, CNN's meteorologist Jennifer Delgado said. Another 10 people survived on both mountains in Hokkaido, according to Kikuchi. One more climber died on Mount Biei, Kikuchi said.
