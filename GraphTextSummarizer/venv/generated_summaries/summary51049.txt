The English Premier League sack race has been as busy as ever this season, but Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho has signaled his long-term commitment to the club in an industry that has been criticized for its short term outlook. With the likes of Frank Lampard and John Terry, who were in their prime during Mourinho's first spell in charge at Chelsea, growing ever older, the Portuguese has been handed the task of forging a new side based around the talents of younger players like Oscar and Eden Hazard. Mourinho first arrived at Stamford Bridge in 2004 and went on to guide Chelsea to the English Premier League title -- the club's first for 50 years -- as well as the FA Cup, the Community Shield, two League Cups and a further league title. After departing from Chelsea in 2007, Mourinho went on to manage Inter Milan where more success followed, including the Treble of the Champions League, Serie A and Coppa Italia in 2010. "There were clubs in other countries where it would have been easy for me to go to and find an easy job."
