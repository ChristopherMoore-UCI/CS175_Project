The 41-year-old Frenchwoman had been booked into the Penobscot County jail for interfering with a flight crew late Tuesday, about 12 hours after US Airways Flight 787 was diverted to Bangor, but Delahanty said prosecutors decided against charges after the FBI questioned crew members and flight attendants into Wednesday morning. Lucie Zeeko Merigot is being turned over to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency after a court appearance Wednesday in Bangor, U.S. Attorney Thomas Delahanty announced. The crew told passengers the flight was landing in Bangor because of uncharacteristically strong headwinds that required the plane to take on more fuel, Kobayashi and other passengers said. A woman blamed for a security scare aboard a U.S.-bound jetliner will be sent back to France and won't face criminal charges, federal prosecutors in Maine said Wednesday. Mystery object in the air investigated after pilot report "The continuing investigation revealed that the plane and its crew and passengers were never actually in danger at any time," the statement said.
