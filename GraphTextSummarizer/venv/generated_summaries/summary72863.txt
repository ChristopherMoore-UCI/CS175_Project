Longtime Duke fan Julian King says there are several reasons Cameron is a different place these days. Since there was no beating them on the court, Duke fans turned to making fun of them, King said. A betting man would probably wager that Section 17 will be full on Saturday when Duke is host to Maryland, which fancies itself one of Duke's rivals (Duke fans feel a little differently). Duke has 1,000 spots for undergrads but has sold up to 400 of those seats to other Duke fans this year. King -- who grew up in Durham, has seen hundreds of games in Cameron and runs the message board forum Duke Basketball Report -- points a finger at a tech-rich culture, a student body more focused on academics, conference expansion and the team's "ridiculous success."
