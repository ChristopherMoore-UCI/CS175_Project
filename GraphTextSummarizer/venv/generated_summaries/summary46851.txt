Another group of fine young Dutch players have made their tournament debuts in Brazil as the old stagers like Van Persie, Robben, Dirk Kuyt and Sneijder have possibly played their last World Cup. Should Brazil's great South American rivals triumph, this World Cup could quite possibly top the famous Maracanzo of 1950 in the annals of Brazilian sporting disasters. Van Persie stepped up and blasted the ball high beyond Julio Cesar in the Brazil goal. This was certainly the case for Brazil Saturday as the World Cup hosts suffered further embarrassment after the Netherlands triumphed 3-0 in the third place playoff match in Brasilia. It's a result that will doubtless further fuel the debate as to how the world's most successful football nation overhauls the structure of its game after a calamitous end to its first home World Cup in 64 years.
