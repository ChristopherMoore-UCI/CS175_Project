" Sunday's loss leaves City eight points behind arch rivals Manchester United, dealing a potentially fatal blow to their Premier League title hopes. -- Mario Balotelli's career at Manchester City is hanging in the balance after manager Roberto Mancini gave the clearest indication yet that he is willing to sell the troubled striker. " It is the latest controversy for the forward who crashed his Bentley in Manchester city center last week. But with six games left for City this season and hopes of a first English title in 44 years all but dead in the water, Mancini's own position at the club will also be under scrutiny. Mancini admitted his patience was wearing thin with the 21-year-old Italian who was sent off for the third time this season in Man City's 1-0 defeat at Arsenal on Sunday.
