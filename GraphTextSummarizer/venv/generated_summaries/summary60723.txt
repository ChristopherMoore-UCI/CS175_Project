The peacekeeping force is charged with protecting key government and strategic installations in Mogadishu, including the port, airport and presidential palace. African Union forces have been battling an al Qaeda-linked Islamist militia in Somalia called Al-Shaabab. The United States is concerned that Somalia's weak government could fall to the Islamist insurgency, as it did in 2006 before Ethiopian forces ousted the militants from power in early 2007. Members of Islamist militia Al-Shaabab patrol Bakara Market in Mogadishu, Somalia, earlier this month. The United States is supporting the Somali government's fight against the insurgents, including providing weapons to government forces.
