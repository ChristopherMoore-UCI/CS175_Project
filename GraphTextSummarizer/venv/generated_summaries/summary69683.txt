Facebook, Instagram and many other apps already include features that let people "check-in" to locations, but those location features are different because you decide if and when to share each specific location. Facebook is introducing a mobile feature called Nearby Friends that taps into that steady stream of location information so friends can track each other in real time. Nearby Friends will be available on Facebook's iOS and Android apps, but will only work for select locations at first. When turned on, Nearby Friends shows a list of approved Facebook friends who also use the feature and shows their approximate location. It also collects location information even when the Facebook app is closed.
