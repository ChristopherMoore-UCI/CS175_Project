In addition to the contempt of court argument, Smith-Monahan was also asking the court to issue a restraining order against the station, an order that would keep the station from broadcasting the interview with Cornell, according to court documents. In that interview, he refuses to tell Macke how or when he first came in contact with ISIS, but he did give the reporter details on a plot to kill President Barack Obama, members of Congress, as well as an attack on the Israeli Embassy in Washington. The judge also stated in court that while Cornell has the right to remain silent, he also has the right to freedom of speech. " Cornell told Macke that he used "encrypted messaging" to communicate with ISIS members. Last week, Cornell made a collect call to CNN affiliate WXIX, said news director Kevin Roach.
