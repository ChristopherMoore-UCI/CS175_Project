Sarasota Police have identified the victims as James M. Cooper, 25, and James Thomas Kouzaris, 24, both from England. Sarasota Police Chief Mikel Hollaway said officials are trying to determine why the men were there. The neighborhood where the British men were found is a housing project in north Sarasota called Newtown, Hollaway said. "On behalf of the city of Sarasota, we want to express our condolences for the families of the two victims who were obviously on holiday from the United Kingdom," Sarasota Mayor Kelly Kirschner said. -- A 16-year-old boy has been arrested in the murder of two British men, found shot dead at 3 a.m. Saturday in Sarasota, Florida, police say.
