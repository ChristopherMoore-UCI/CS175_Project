An empty Highway Trust Fund would affect the entire country, but certain states and projects could be hit especially hard. If Congress does not replenish the Highway Trust Fund quickly, ongoing projects will grind to a halt and new projects will be pushed back indefinitely. The beleaguered Highway Trust Fund, which provides money for American roads, bridges and highways, is expected to go broke soon. However, without action from lawmakers in Washington, many projects could be delayed indefinitely and construction workers will be sidelined. Without the trust fund's capital, more than $2 billion worth of construction projects would be at risk.
