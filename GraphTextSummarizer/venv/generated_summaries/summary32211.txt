The school will be named after Aitazaz Hassan Bangash, the 14-year-old boy who authorities say saved an untold number of fellow students by sacrificing himself at the building's main gate, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province's chief minister said during a provincial assembly session. The ninth-grader was on his way to school January 6 in the province's Hangu district when the bomber, dressed in a school uniform, asked him where the school was, the teen's cousin Musadiq Ali Bangash said. -- The northern Pakistani school where a teenage boy died while tackling a suicide bomber last week will be renamed in his honor, a top provincial official announced Monday. On Friday, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif nominated Aitazaz for the Sitara-e-Shujaat -- the country's top civil award for bravery. The same honor was given to Malala Yousafzai, a Pakistani schoolgirl who survived being shot in the head in 2012 by the Taliban for her efforts to promote education for boys and girls.
