Correa has said Ecuador will begin oil development next year if the government cannot secure the funds by then. Correa wants wealthy nations to pay Ecuador $350 million a year in exchange for leaving an estimated 1 billion barrels of oil under the ground in the pristine Yasuni rain forest. But critics wonder if the politically unstable Ecuador, which relies on oil for nearly half of its export revenues, can keep this promise to the international community or whether authorities are trying to have their cake and eat it, too. The $350 million would constitute about half the annual revenues Ecuador thinks it could make from extracting oil from the field, partly located inside the 2.4 million-acre (982,000-hectare) The proposal's detractors say Ecuador cannot ensure the park's sanctity given political turmoil that has at times halted oil operations and has made Correa the eighth president in 10 years.
