" Welcome to Lai Lai Dance Hall, arguably the only entertainment venue for older gay men in Shanghai, if not the whole of China.

Min Min hosts a drag show in Shanghai while not manning a ballroom dance hall for older gay men. "In the future we might," Min responded when asked if he and other Lai Lai regulars would join the Gay Games -- the gay answer to the Olympics -- next to be held in 2010 in Cologne, Germany. Realizing he was gay at an early age, Zhang -- like many gay men in China -- married a woman because of family and social pressure.
