The real reason women Saudi Arabia forbids women from driving is that the law regards them as children for life. We ought to be pressuring the leaders of Dubai, and other Gulf States, all the time, and not just when foreign women are victims. And the real victims are not Western women, who can come and go at will, but the millions of powerless women who live in those countries. The incident should be a wake-up call for any woman, and any man who cares about women, working in or doing business with the petro-cash soaked Gulf States. Western women work in the notoriously misogynistic Gulf States, mostly in PR for governments and doing business with multinationals.
