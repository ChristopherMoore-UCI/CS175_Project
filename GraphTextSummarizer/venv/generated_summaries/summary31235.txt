Report: Yanukovych implicated in killings In Ukraine, a newly released report said the killings of protesters in the Ukrainian capital during anti-government demonstrations in February took place under the order of ousted President Viktor Yanukovych. Russia recalled its ambassador to NATO for consultations Thursday, two days after NATO member countries suspended cooperation with Russia over the Ukraine crisis, Russian state media reported. At their meeting, NATO foreign ministers decided the alliance would draw up plans for reinforcing NATO's defenses following Moscow's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region -- which the West deems illegal. Around 100 people are now known to have died in Ukraine since the unrest began in November following Yanukovych's last-minute U-turn over a deal with the European Union in favor of closer ties with Russia. Gen. Philip Breedlove, NATO's supreme allied commander Europe, also said that with 40,000 troops massed near the border, Russia has all the components necessary to move on Ukraine.
