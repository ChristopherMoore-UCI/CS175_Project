-- Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg plans to undergo a "precautionary" course of chemotherapy following her surgery last month for pancreatic cancer, the Supreme Court announced Tuesday. Ginsburg also said her former colleague, retired Justice Sandra Day O'Connor -- herself a cancer survivor -- had offered her some good advice. Ginsburg's post-op recovery has gone well, and doctors and the family are cautiously optimistic, court sources said. President Obama greets Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on her arrival for his February 24 address to Congress. Almost 35,000 Americans are estimated to have died from pancreatic cancer in 2008, making it the fourth leading cause of cancer death overall, according to the American Cancer Society.
