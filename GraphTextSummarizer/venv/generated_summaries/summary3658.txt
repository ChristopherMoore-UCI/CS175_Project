Former NFL player wants his brain studied after his death Obama said professional players "are grown men," well-paid and informed about the risks. -- President Barack Obama blamed the fiscal cliff standoff in Congress for the contraction in the U.S. economy at the end of 2012 and weighed in on the safety of football in a pre-Super Bowl interview Sunday. During the roughly eight-minute live session with CBS host Scott Pelley, Obama said new concerns about long-term brain damage in football players "means the game is probably going to evolve a little bit." "For those of us who like to see a big hit and enjoy the rock 'em, sock 'em elements of the game, we're probably going to be occasionally frustrated," the president said. Obama spoke less than two hours before the San Francisco 49ers and the Baltimore Ravens played for the NFL title in New Orleans in the most-watched event in U.S. sports. Another lawsuit was filed in January by the family of former linebacker Junior Seau, who argued his suicide in May was the result of a brain disease caused by violent hits he endured playing the game.
