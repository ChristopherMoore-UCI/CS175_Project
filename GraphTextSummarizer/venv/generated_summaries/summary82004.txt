"These are people who have ALS, like Stephen Hawking, or they have a brainstem stroke, or a high spinal-cord injury," Williams explained. Hundreds of thousands of people suffer from locked-in syndrome, Williams estimated. That's because using the brain to post Twitter messages is potentially much more than an academic exercise or a party trick -- it could help paralyzed people communicate. In the end, it wasn't quite "tomorrow," Williams said, but Wilson had written the software to link existing technology with Twitter "within a couple of days" of starting on the project in March. He sent Williams his first "tweet" -- or message -- from the brain-computer interface on March 31.
