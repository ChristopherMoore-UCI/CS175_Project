Mayweather: 'Lin hype is based on race not talent' Stereotypes of Asians have been a staple of American popular culture since the 19th century, from newspaper cartoons of menacing, bucktoothed Chinese to film characters like the evil Dr. Fu Manchu and the bowing, pidgin-speaking Charlie Chan. Ex-ESPN writer says slur was 'honest mistake' Phil Yu, of the popular blog Angry Asian Man, wrote about this "Jeremy Lin Effect." " American culture tells us, in short, that Lin shouldn't exist. The spectacular rise of Jeremy Lin, the first Asian-American to achieve basketball stardom, has been utterly thrilling to witness. After Lin's 38-point performance against the Los Angeles Lakers on February 10, Fox Sports columnist Jason Whitlock tweeted an offensive joke about Lin that played off stereotypes of Asians' lack of masculinity.
