More than 40,000 U.S. troops are stationed in Japan, most of them on Okinawa, which accounts for less than 1 percent of Japan's total area. The U.S. military in Japan also said it formed a sexual assault prevention task force after the allegation arose. The allegation also led to tight restrictions for American troops and their families at the U.S. base on Okinawa. -- Japanese authorities on Friday released an American Marine accused of raping a teenager in Okinawa after the girl dropped the allegations, the U.S. military said. The restrictions remained in place Friday despite Hadnott's release from Japanese custody, the U.S. military said.
