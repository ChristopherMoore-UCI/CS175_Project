According to Congressional Quarterly's annual review of votes in Congress, 2011 set a record for both the number of partisan votes (votes where a majority of one party votes against the majority of another party) and the intensity of the partisanship (the frequency that members vote with their party) in the House of Representatives. "Right now we're seeing an increase in polarization," said Vanderbilt political science professor John Geer. But Geer also believes there is a danger when partisanship reaches this kind of extreme level. Fraunfelder is incensed over the gridlock in Washington and blames partisan rancor for failure of Congress to compromise on issues ranging from jobs to the national debt. She told CNN Radio that she likes President Obama, but is disheartened by negative ads on both sides, causing her to consider staying home on November 6.
