"Those costumes can get very hot, and the Grand Parade lasts for seven or eight hours." Traditionally, the parades have an element of satire, with Carnival floats and costumed marchers making a colorful comment on current affairs. "Limassol Carnival makes us forget our problems for a while, have fun and laugh with our hearts," says Limassol-born photographer Marios Vrioni. During the second week -- Tyrini, or "Cheese Week" -- local tavernas and delis compete to offer free samples of cheesy treats such as bourekia, deep-fried pastries filled with spiced and sweetened anari cheese. "I've been going to the Limassol Carnival for the past three years," says Limassol resident Penelope Hearns, who runs the Cyprus Expat website. It's a signal that Limassol Carnival, the liveliest, most colorful event of the year on the island, is around the corner.
