-- Forty years ago this week golf legend Gary Player scored one of his most memorable victories at the British Open and now he is willing Tiger Woods to do the same in the 2104 edition at Hoylake as the American battles back from injury and loss of form. South African Player was the last player to lead outright for all four rounds of the oldest major when he won at Royal Lytham and St Anne's in 1974, adding to an earlier triumph at that year's Masters at Augusta. That 'it' the South African legend believes is reserved for the true superstars of golf: "In my humble opinion you have to win six majors to be classed as a superstar," added Player. Player believes golf is the poorer for Woods not being at the top of the leaderboard. "Rory is a wonderful player, an unbelievable talent," said Player, who is also an admirer of current world No. 1 Adam Scott of Australia and fellow South Africans Louis Oosthuizen and Charl Schwartzel, saying the latter has the "most fantastic golf swing."
