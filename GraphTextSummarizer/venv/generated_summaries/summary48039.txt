-- As the world reels from its deadliest Ebola outbreak, health experts are fast-tracking tests for various vaccines, and hope to have millions of experimental doses by next year. The push for vaccines came as new cases of Ebola were confirmed in New York and Mali, the latter the first case in that nation. "If the vaccines are determined to be safe, tens of thousands of doses could be used in West African trials beginning in January of next year," the WHO said. In addition to drug development, there's a scramble to develop vaccines, with scores of companies working on experimental doses, the World Health Organization said this week. There is currently no cure or vaccine for Ebola, which continues to spread in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.
