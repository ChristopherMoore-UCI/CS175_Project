Martinez's father, Richard Martinez, has publicly called for stricter gun control laws. Together we can and will build a safer world for all our children." The firearms shop Shooters Paradise of Oxnard sold Rodger a gun just before the killings, manager Kevin White said. Rodger had an Isla Vista address and wasn't acting strangely when he bought the gun, White said. White, an alum of UCSB, said he spoke briefly with Rodger about Isla Vista. "My heart breaks for you because I know just a little about the long road ahead of you," he wrote, encouraging Richard Martinez to continue being an advocate for gun safety regulations.
