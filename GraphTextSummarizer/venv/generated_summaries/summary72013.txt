Everything Nisman argues is false, Fernandez says -- the spies were spies, Argentina didn't ask Interpol to withdraw the Red Notices, trade between Argentina and Iran has actually decreased, and so on. "The criminal complaint by prosecutor Nisman was never in itself the true plot against the government," Fernandez wrote. "Nobody, I mean, wanted more for Mr. Nisman to live and to answer questions, than the President of Argentina and myself," Timerman said. Nisman was not a hack with an agenda against the President, but a naive investigator who was used by others who fed him false information, Fernandez said. According to Nisman's report, representatives on Fernandez's behalf held both secret and public meetings where it was agreed that the trade deal could be reached if the Red Notices were withdrawn.
