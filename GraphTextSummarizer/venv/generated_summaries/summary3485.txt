Stonewall, a UK-based gay, lesbian and bisexual charity, has teamed up with Irish bookmaker Paddy Power to promote a campaign which is asking football players across the country to wear rainbow colored laces. "It's pretty sad that some of the powers-that-be deem this not enough notice when it's a simple case of players choosing whether or not they'd like to wear a pair of rainbow laces. "As an initiative with a strong focus on education, we feel it is incongruous to run a campaign aiming to change football culture whilst using language which reinforces the very stereotypes and caricatures that, in the long term, ensure that homophobia persists. -- It was supposed to provide the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, but the latest effort to fight homophobia in football is in danger of fading into monochrome. While several top clubs such as Manchester United and Tottenham have also refused to take part in wearing the rainbow laces, Stonewall is adamant the campaign has been hugely successful in drawing attention to homophobia in football.
