-- Six women who climbed one of Europe's tallest buildings Thursday in an effort to rally against Shell's Arctic drilling plan have been arrested, according to London's Metropolitan Police. If responsibly developed, Arctic energy resources can help offset supply constraints and maintain energy security for consumers throughout the world." Regarding the protest, the oil giant said it respects the freedom of expression. The women from the environmental group Greenpeace said they dodged security guards around The Shard and, once on top, they planned "to hang a huge work of art that captures the beauty" of the Arctic. "Shell is leading the oil companies' drive into the Arctic, investing billions in its Alaskan and Russian drilling programs," it said. "We only ask that they do so with their safety and the safety of others, including Shell personnel and customers in mind," Shell said.
