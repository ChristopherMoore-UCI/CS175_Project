Under the leadership of Maj. Gen. Terry Allen, the "Timberwolves" fought through Holland, Belgium, and into Germany, seeing unbelievable carnage. I went in his place to the 56th Timberwolves reunion in Atlanta August 28 to September 3, 2001. His emotions were still raw as we sat together on the back porch of my home in suburban Atlanta. Later, Dad explained to me that his strong emotions went back nearly 15 years when he was an officer on Gen. William Woodward's staff during the 104th Infantry Division's assault on Nazi Germany. (The unit's final reunion will be September 1 in Chicago.)
