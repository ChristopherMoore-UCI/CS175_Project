The federal government allocated $10.6 million to install new chamber miter gates, according to Waterways Council Inc., which describes itself as an organization "advocating a modern and well-maintained national system of ports and inland waterways. Watch traffic backed up on Ohio River Â» A lock is a section of a waterway, such as a river, that is closed off with gates. All traffic on the river was stopped in both directions at about 9 a.m. ET, Corps spokesman Todd Hornback said. "The risk is very high that a failure of the lock gates will occur, forcing traffic through the auxiliary lock for an extended period, causing huge delays and costs to the towing industry," the council said in the report last year. A public policy organization, in a February 2008 report, graded the locks' performance as a D, "based primarily upon risk of failure due to unreliability of miter gates."
