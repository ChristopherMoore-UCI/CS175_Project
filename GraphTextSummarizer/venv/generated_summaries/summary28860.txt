It's a search-meets-social networking website that looks more like Pinterest than Facebook, and has until now been open only to invited Microsoft employees and college students. After a long period of closed beta testing, Microsoft made the beta version of its social network, Socl, available to everyone on Tuesday. They can then start sharing content (e.g. photos, videos, links), and comment on other members' posts. As more people join, the site should become more usable, but the question is: With all the social networks and content-sharing sites around, will Socl ever reach critical mass? The sign-up process is effortless -- users simply connect their account with Socl.
