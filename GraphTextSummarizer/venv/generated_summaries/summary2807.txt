"The FBI is pleased with Mexico's efforts to bring to justice a leader from one of the most violent criminal enterprises in our history," said San Diego FBI Special Agent in Charge Daphne Hearn. Benjamin Arellano-Felix and Francisco Javier Arellano-Felix were convicted on drug trafficking, money laundering and racketeering charges. Eduardo Arellano-Felix, 55, faces charges of narcotics trafficking, racketeering and money laundering. "The extradition of Eduardo Arellano-Felix today marks the end of a 20-year DEA investigation into this vicious drug cartel," said William Sherman, the Drug Enforcement Agency's acting special agent in charge in San Diego. "The spirit of cooperation between our two countries is a powerful force in disrupting the criminal activities of these groups that instill fear and threaten the safety of our citizens in the border regions of the United States." Arellano-Felix is scheduled to make his first court appearance in San Diego on September 4.
