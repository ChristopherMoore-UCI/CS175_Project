"Real Housewives of D.C." star Michaele Salahi left her husband last week to join Journey guitarist Neal Schon on tour, which Tareq Salahi said "caused me to suffer great harm, humiliation, and embarrassment. The reality show personality traveled last Tuesday to Memphis, Tennessee, where Journey was performing, to be with Schon, a representative with Scoop Marketing confirmed to CNN Wednesday. But what really hurts about his wife's "adulterous friendship" is that she "has flaunted the same throughout the community, the nation and indeed the world, and thus caused me to suffer great harm, humiliation, and embarrassment," his court filing said. The Salahis' split became public last Wednesday when Tareq Salahi told reporters that he thought his wife had been kidnapped when she disappeared on Tuesday. Tareq Salahi is "greatly hurt and disturbed" by wife's "adulterous affair" with a rock musician and he wants a divorce, according to court documents.
