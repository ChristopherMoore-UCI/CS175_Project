But back to the trending BuzzFeed collection of worst things for lefties. Actually, to be completely fair, there's probably better evidence suggesting that, disproportionately, lefties are far more destined for greatness. Understandably, then, lefties have a bit of a complex. The collection was cleverly put together by BuzzFeed editor Katie Notopoulos and featured simple things that, at least to us righties, aren't normally such a big deal. So, as we're here celebrating the very first National Right Handed Pride Day, take a moment to look a lefty in the eyes and offer a few words of encouragement.
