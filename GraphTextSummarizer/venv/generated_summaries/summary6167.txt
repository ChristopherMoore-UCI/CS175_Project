-- After months of psychological torment by guards loyal to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, when a commotion arose outside the door of his solitary confinement cell in Tripoli's most notorious prison, Matthew VanDyke was sure he was going to be executed. VanDyke joined up with one small group walking through the Abu Salim neighborhood of Tripoli, not knowing that they were in one of the last areas still controlled by Gadhafi loyalists. Reached by phone in a safe house in Tripoli, VanDyke, 32, described a harrowing 30 hours that took him from Abu Salim prison to the safe house under the protection of anti-Gadhafi rebels. Sharon VanDyke said her son was unaware that al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden had been killed by U.S. commandos in May. She and Fischer, 28, expect VanDyke, who first went to Libya in 2008, to complete a book about the people he has met and places he has seen in Mauritania, Iraq, Turkey, Afghanistan, Egypt and other countries. Early Wednesday in Tripoli, he said, he heard prisoners yelling and shouting and banging, not unlike the sounds he had heard as guards rousted out other prisoners during his six months of solitary confinement.
