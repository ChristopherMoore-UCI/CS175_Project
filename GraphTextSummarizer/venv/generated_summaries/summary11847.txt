Many Cambodian AIDS patients and their families have been relocated to this community outside Tuol Sambo. But what sets the families apart at Tuol Sambo is that they have AIDS. "They think that when they go there (to Tuol Sambo), they can own the land, they can own a house and they can make some business or something like that." He also said he did not believe there was discrimination in the area, "but there is some feeling when they (people) learn that someone has been living with HIV/AIDS." Van Thy said her new home has brought many challenges and a recent blood test showed that her CD4 count -- a marker of decreased immune function that is often used to demonstrate how well anti-HIV drugs are working, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -- had gone down. Back at Tuol Sambo, people think of the future and how they will make ends meet. Teng Kunthy, secretary-general of the Cambodian government's National AIDS Authority, said the Tuol Sambo group's worries were about the housing, not their health care, since he said they still had good access to treatment, including home-based care, medicine and the help of charities.
