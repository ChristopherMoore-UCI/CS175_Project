Ukraine President Viktor Yushchenko has labeled Georhiy Gongadze's killing the country's most important case. The Gongadze killing is the country's most important criminal case, President Viktor Yushchenko said in a statement on his Web site. Three former police officers were convicted last year of killing Gongadze and given jail sentences of 12 to 13 years, the Committee to Protect Journalists said at the time. But Myroslava Gongadze, the slain journalist's widow, noted Kravchenko had two bullets in his head. Pukach had been on the run for years before he was seized Tuesday in a joint operation by the Security Service and the prosecutor general's office, Yushchenko said.
