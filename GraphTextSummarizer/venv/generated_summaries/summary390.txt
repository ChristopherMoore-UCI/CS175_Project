Staring out over Iceland's Svinafellsjokull glacier, a cruel, frozen landscape of white ice broken by blue crevasses, it's easy to imagine myself in some distant world on the other side of the universe. The tale of flood and salvation used the dramatic basalt scenery of Reynisdrangar and Dyrholaey near the town of Vik -- on the road to Svinafellsjokull -- to stand in for antediluvian Earth. Two Bond movies -- "Die Another Day" and "A View to A Kill" -- had parts filmed here, as did "Tomb Raider." "Noah" Not even "Noah" star Russell Crowe could chew the scenery in Iceland, which is possibly why director Darren Aronofsky filmed his recent biblical epic here. Friction as the massive weight of ice creeps forward over the rocks below causes new crevasses to open up and old ones to close. We're kitted out with crampons and ice axes.
