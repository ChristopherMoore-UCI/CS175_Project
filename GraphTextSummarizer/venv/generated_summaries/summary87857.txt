The Spanish World Cup midfielder will be Barca coach Pep Guardiola's second signing in the current transfer window, following the acquisition of Chile winger Alexis Sanchez from Italian Serie A side Udinese. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has added three new faces to his squad, with Ivory Coast striker Gervinho arriving from Lille and teenagers Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Carl Jenkinson arriving from Southampton and Charlton respectively. Reports in the British press have suggested Fabregas might not be the last high-profile player to leave the Gunners this off-season, with France's Samir Nasri tipped to move to Manchester City. Fabregas plays alongside many of his potential new teammates for Vicente del Bosque's national side and was part of Spain's victorious squads in South Africa last year and at the European Championships in 2008. Fabregas joined Arsenal in 2003, after spending his youth career at Barca's famous La Masia academy, and helped the club beat Manchester United to win the FA Cup in 2005.
