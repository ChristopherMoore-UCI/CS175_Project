Van Persie, 27, was expected to miss the second leg of the last 16 tie after suffering a knee injury while scoring Arsenal's goal in the 2-1 Carling Cup final defeat to Birmingham City. Barcelona coach Josep Guardiola also has his own injury worries ahead of Tuesday's match. "I hope they are all in the team, Van Persie, Samir Nasri, Cesc (Fabregas), because I would like to play the best possible Arsenal. The 40-year-old is expected to be fit enough to stand on the touchline for the contest with Arsenal and Guardiola hopes the London team's top players are fit enough to take part. Wenger also confirmed England midfielder Jack Wilshere will be fit for the tie, which Arsenal lead 2-1 ahead of the second leg at the Nou Camp, but central midfielder Alex Song will miss the match with a knee injury.
