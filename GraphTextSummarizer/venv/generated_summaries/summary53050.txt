In addition to mountain bike excursions, the group provides bike mechanic training and the chance for young people to earn credit toward their own bikes. They all do bike rides and then some of them, as they get more developed like we did, also start their own Earn-a-Bike programs or their own bike thrift shops to support themselves. Trips For Kids has grown well beyond San Francisco. And their experience goes beyond bike trips. They can use it to buy bikes or parts.
