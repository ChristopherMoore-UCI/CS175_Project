For starters, Brock Akil said, she and Akil wanted to give the three sisters at the heart of the story more power. So when the film's director, Salim Akil, who is also her husband, pitched her the opportunity to revive "Sparkle's" tale, Brock Akil admits she was a bit fearful of the wrath she might incur for tweaks made to the story's original characterizations. Screenwriter Mara Brock Akil, who penned the script for the 2012 remake and is also a co-producer, believes "Sparkle" owes its longevity to the heft of its story and the filmmakers' attention to detail. Emma, now a dressmaker, also has the means to "provide a certain life, an aspirational American dream life," Brock Akil said, something Detroit has exemplified. That's one of the core changes that he wanted to make, and if that was the case, then he wanted to have me write it because I'd been writing about women in my work -- our empowerment, our vulnerabilities, our humanity and all those sorts of things, and he thought I'd do a good job with that," Brock Akil said.
