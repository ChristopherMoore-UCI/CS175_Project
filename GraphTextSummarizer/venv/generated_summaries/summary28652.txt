"We are also in close contact with the Russian government on all aspects of the case, and we know that he is being well cared for." Nancy Hansen, the Tennessee woman who put Justin Hansen on the plane in Washington, insisted she did not abandon the child, but was following instructions from a lawyer she found online. Ambassador Beyrle said cases of neglect are rare among the "tens of thousands of adopted Russian children who are living happily and lovingly with their American families." "But even one incident like this is too many, and we will get to the bottom of what went wrong," he said. " When her daughter, Torry Hansen, adopted the boy from a Russian orphanage last year, she asked the doctor there if he had any physical or mental problems, Nancy Hansen said. Nancy Hansen outlined for CNN the process she followed after she decided Justin must go back to Russia. " Justin told Russian officials he was abused by the American family, Astakhov said.
