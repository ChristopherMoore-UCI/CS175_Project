On the other hand, he said, political reconciliation with Taliban leadership would be much more difficult and far off in the future, requiring Pakistan's involvement because many Taliban live there. -- Afghan President Hamid Karzai and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declared the Afghan leader's visit to the United States this week a success, saying on Thursday that it had helped strengthen the partnership between Washington and Kabul at a critical point in the war against Taliban and al Qaeda extremists. Earlier in the day, Karzai paid tribute to U.S. military members killed in the nearly nine-year American war in his nation, visiting the grave sites of Afghan war veterans at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia. He further aggravated his most powerful ally when he told tribal leaders that the U.S.-led military alliance would not move against Taliban fighters in Kandahar "until you say we can. Karzai said a recent decision to transfer local detention centers to Afghan government control was a "major point of progress." CNN's Paul Courson and Elise Labott contributed to this report.
