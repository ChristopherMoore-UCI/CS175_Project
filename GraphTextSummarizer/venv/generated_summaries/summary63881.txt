A plan by British mining giant Vedanta Resources to dig in the mineral-rich eastern state of Orissa has stalled. The multi-billion project has come under scrutiny as advocacy groups, such as Survival International and Amnesty International, likened the Dongria Kondh tribe to the Na'vi from James Cameron's film. Earlier this month, the government put a "stop work" order on another major venture in Orissa -- a $12-billion steel plant proposed by South Korea's POSCO. Analysts say these recent moves could signify a change in the Indian government's approach toward the broader issue of tribal rights versus development. The ongoing dispute between the Dongria Kondh tribe and Vedanta Resources highlights a broader standoff between industry and local residents.
