-- A ship laden with toxic substances is due to arrive in northeast England for recycling Sunday, ending an odyssey that has seen it turned away from at least three other countries. The British ship recycling company that will scrap it had to apply for special permission from the country's Environment Agency and Health and Safety Executive. Greenpeace is not opposing the transfer of the ship to England, but press reports suggest local activists are displeased. Greenpeace activists boarded the ship off the coast of Egypt in 2006 to prevent it being sent to India to be scrapped. Able chairman and chief executive Peter Stephenson said the contract was "crucially important... at a time when there are so many economic problems facing the world -- and especially a region such as the north-east of England.
