NTC fighters fanned out across the city in search of Gadhafi associates. The NTC forces took the airport and the citadel, said Col. Ahmed Bani, the NTC's military spokesman, Monday. Many top officials of the old regime are thought to have passed through the city on their way to Niger but it would be tougher for them to do so now because the city is surrounded by NTC fighters. A CNN crew accompanying National Transitional Council fighters witnessed people cheering for the new ruling forces. Dr. Mohamad Altaib of Sabha central hospital reported some rebel fighters died from Gadhafi loyalist sniper fire there.
