Reaction to Hudson family tragedy The tragedy is a sad turn for the 27-year-old actress and singer, who first earned national notice for her performances on "American Idol" in 2004 and won an Oscar for best supporting actress for 2006's "Dreamgirls." Hudson's singing career began in her church choir in the South Side Chicago neighborhood of Englewood when she was a child. Julia Kate Hudson, who sang at Pleasant Gift Missionary Baptist Church, where Hudson got her start, died in 1998. Hudson's mother, Darnell Donerson, and brother, Jason Hudson, were found shot to death Friday in their Chicago home. 'Idol' friend speaks out about Hudson case In the end, Hudson didn't even come close to making "Idol's" final two, being voted off midway in the show's run. Hudson was unfamiliar with "Dreamgirls" when she auditioned, but she allegedly beat out almost 800 other women for the role -- including her former "Idol" rival, Fantasia Barrino, who had been the third-season winner.
