Heavy downpours in North Korea may have washed the land mines ashore, the South Korean state-run Yonhap news agency reported, citing the South Korean Army. State media reported Saturday that South Korean investigators had found eight land mines made by North Korea near the border between the two countries. The military is searching all streams that connect with North Korea, Yonhap said, and has issued warnings to people in the area after investigators found "scores" of the mines, designed to go off when opened. According to Yonhap, military officials said the mines may have drifted away from North Korea. A fisherman on Jumun Island alerted authorities after stumbling upon a landmine in a wooden box, Yonhap said, citing a spokesman for South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff.
