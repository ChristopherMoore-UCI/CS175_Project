Along with enhanced military cooperation, Panetta emphasized diplomacy that includes "open and free commerce, and open access by all to their shared domains of sea and air" -- a current point of friction in the South China Sea between China and regional nations. "I reject that view entirely," Panetta said, calling the U.S. shift "fully compatible with the development and growth of China. Indeed, increased U.S. involvement in this region will benefit China." Panetta said the United States will work to improve communication with China to build trust between the two nations. As part of a "rebalancing" with Asia, the United States will enhance its military cooperation with China and boost its allies' capabilities in the region, Panetta said Saturday.
