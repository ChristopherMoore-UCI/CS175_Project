PC gaming, Web streaming and smartphone and tablet games have all sapped the popularity of the venerable living-room console. Last year, Sony bought Gakai, a cloud-based gaming company that let PC gamers stream top games via broadband. Unnamed sources say the tech will be used to let players play older PS3 games on the new console as well as new ones. For all the extracurricular bells and whistles this system will boast, gamers still want to play great games that you can't experience anywhere else. "Sony needs to show its next system is ready for the future, and this includes some crossover play with smartphones, digital distribution, cloud storage to help minimize the need for physical media and a free-to-play ecosystem that can bring in new gamers," he said.
