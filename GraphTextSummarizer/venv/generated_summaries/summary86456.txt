Babbitt's statement concerned an incident that took place on February 16 involving the controller's young son, who is heard in a recording -- posted on liveatc.net -- clearing a Jet Blue flight for takeoff and later speaking to an apparent Air Mexico flight. The FAA said all unofficial visits to air traffic control operational areas, such as towers and radar rooms, will be suspended during its investigation into the incident. During the recording, the child also speaks to an apparent Air Mexico flight. FAA spokeswoman Laura Brown later said the incident took place about 7:30 p.m. February 16. The incidents occurred on succeeding days last month at New York's John F. Kennedy Airport, the Federal Aviation Administration said Wednesday.
