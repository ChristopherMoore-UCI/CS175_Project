I've always wondered if that summer vacation was part of my grandfather's plan to make sure that my father would not be trapped in socialist Cuba. So when Cuban exiles hear of normalizing relations, they worry that it's Cuba's privileged class that will benefit the most at the expense of ordinary Cubans. These are the kinds of things Cuban exile families think about when they think of Cuba. For more than 50 years, Cuba's story has surprised and saddened many exiles and their families, and we can't help but fear history will repeat itself. The children of Cuban exiles, like me, all dream of walking the streets of Cuba with our parents and grandparents to finally feel that rhythmic beat of our Cuban soul that still sits in our hearts.
