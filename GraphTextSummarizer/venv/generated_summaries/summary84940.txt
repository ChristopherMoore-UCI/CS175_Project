-- Scotland and Manchester United midfielder Darren Fletcher is taking an extended break from soccer due to illness. Mexican striker Javier Hernandez, Brazilian trio Fabio, Rafael and Anderson, England midfielder Tom Cleverly and strikers Dimitar Berbatov and Michael Owen are all on the casualty list, as is Serbian defender and United captain Nemanja Vidic, who is likely to be out for the rest of the season. Fletcher, who has won four Premier League titles and one European Champions League crown with United, has been battling the condition for a year. His last game was against Basel when United dropped out of the Champions League group stage for the first time since 2005 and the club confirmed in a statement on their official website that several absences from playing in the past year have been due to his illness. News of Fletcher's absence drew an immediate response from his fellow players, including Manchester United and England defender Rio Ferdinand who said on Twitter: "We are going to miss 2 big players in Fletcher + Vidic, I hope they both come back fitter + stronger than ever.
