Coke arrived at White Plains-Westchester County Airport outside New York City around 7 p.m. Armed Drug Enforcement Administration agents and U.S. marshals escorted him to a waiting SUV. According to a superseding indictment filed in Manhattan federal court, Coke has led a criminal organization known as the "Shower Posse" since the early 1990s, with members in the United States, Jamaica and other countries. Coke was extradited Thursday, two days after he was taken into custody in Jamaica and several hours after he had waived his right to an extradition hearing there. "At Coke's direction and under his protection, members of his criminal organization sold marijuana and crack cocaine in the New York area and elsewhere, and sent the narcotics proceeds back to Coke and his co-conspirators," the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York said in a news release. The judge greeted him with "Good afternoon, Mr. Coke," to which the seemingly calm Coke didn't respond.
