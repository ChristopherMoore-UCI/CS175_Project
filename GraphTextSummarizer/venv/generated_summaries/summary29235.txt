(Mashable)  -- "Angry Birds," one of the most successful mobile games in history, is taking its bird-slinging game mechanics to a new platform: the traditional game console. Rovio, the company behind the popular iPhone and Android game franchise, says that it is working on a version of the game for the Xbox 360, Wii and PlayStation 3. As for the premise of the game, Vesterbacka told the BBC that, "the pigs will be a lot more active than just being slingshotted at by birds." The new game isn't a sequel to the original though, but is instead a completely new game featuring the angry birds and the evil pigs. Vesterbacka also revealed a second piece of news: the company is actively working on "Angry Birds 2."
