-- Real Madrid and Barcelona remain on course to face each other in the final of the Spanish Cup after both claimed semifinal first leg victories on Wednesday. Two goals from Brazilian Alexandre Pato earned victory for the visitors, and ensured Milan striker Antonio Cassano made a winning return to Genoa, less than a month after being effectively sacked by Sampdoria after falling out with the club's president. Milan were joined in the last four by holders and city rivals Inter Milan, who beat Napoli 5-4 on penalties, after 90 minutes and extra time went by without either side scoring a goal. However, there were shocks in the two other matches on Wednesday with second division Energie Cottbus and Duisburg putting out Bundesliga sides Hoffenheim and Kaiserslautern. Karim Benzema scored the only goal of a tempestuous match to give Real Madrid a narrow 1-0 victory at holders Sevilla in the first leg of their semifinal.
