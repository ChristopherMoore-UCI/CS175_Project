In addition to the two men shot dead, a lone body has been found inside the charred ruins of the Modesto, California, apartment building, Modesto police Officer Chris Adams told CNN on Friday. The fire ignited after authorities threw flash grenades and tear gas into the apartment to try to flush the shooter out, Stanislaus County Sheriff Adam Christianson told reporters. -- A locksmith hired to help in the process of evicting a California tenant was shot dead, along with the sheriff's deputy serving the eviction notice, police said Friday. The incident actually began Thursday morning, when Stanislaus County Sheriff's Department Robert Paris, 53, tried to serve an eviction notice at an apartment when a gunman opened fire. But he did say that police are no longer looking for any suspects in the case.
