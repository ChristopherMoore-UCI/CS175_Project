Obama is popular across many parts of the country, especially in western Kenya where many of his relatives live. Video from across the country showed Kenyans dancing and swilling Senator Keg Lager, which has picked up the nickname "Obama Beer" in honor of the junior senator from Illinois. "Obama is a (good) man," said an older man with gray hair, carrying twisted wrought iron on his shoulder. Obama's father died in a car accident in Nairobi in 1982. Barack Obama speaks to residents of Africa's largest slum, Kibera, Kenya, in  August 2006.
