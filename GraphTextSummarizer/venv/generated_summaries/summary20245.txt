Relatives and friends of the family have alleged that Elisa Baker physically abused Zahra and said she was reported to state social services officials. This time, as many as 70 searchers were backed by dogs and a backhoe that was used to clear piles of wood and mulch, Burke County Sheriff John McDevitt said. Authorities spent a third day combing an area about 20 miles north of Zahra Clare Baker's home in Hickory, North Carolina. The searches near Morganton started Tuesday as investigators focused on a lot where Zahra's father, Adam Baker, frequently worked hauling loads of wood and brush to be mulched. But Deal said Thursday that another witness had come forward to say they had seen Zahra in mid- to late September.
