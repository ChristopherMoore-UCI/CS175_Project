put out a press release ominously stating, "A world shortage of pork and bacon next year is now unavoidable. **faints like a vanilla sister**" Love also once told me in an interview how she hoped Gov. Chris Christie would join the Republican primaries because "fat presidents would get everything done before lunch. The report sort of suggested that European drought conditions were the cause of the upcoming pork shortage -- that unfavorable weather had ruined the corn and soybean crop. People laughed at me when I transferred all my 401(k) money into bacon savings, but who's the man now, dog? When did we decide that we would boldly shun and forget these images and thus no longer encourage the paparazzi to invade the privacy of foreign royalty?
