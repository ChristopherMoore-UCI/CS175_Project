" Lest fans worry that season four will be nothing but death, Harington confirmed that the HBO series will still have "plenty of sex." "He's a bit in the wars, old Jon Snow," Harington said. According to Harington, there will be "more deaths this season than any other! ... After that nasty bird attack and run-in with wildling Ygritte, the character's face "is not OK," Harington told Access Hollywood.
