President H.E. Saliva Kiir Mayardit has said he will not support armed opposition forces fighting against the government of Sudan, the South Sudan government website said. The attack follows other bombardments by the Sudan Armed Forces on November 8 near the border that increase the potential for confrontation between Sudan and South Sudan, it said. Kiir said Sudan was threatening the sovereignty of South Sudan "through military invasion." Liberation army members have clashed with the military of South Sudan, which separated from Sudan and became independent in July. The Southern Kordofan, Blue Nile State and Nuba Mountain regions straddle Sudan and South Sudan's geographical and political lines.
