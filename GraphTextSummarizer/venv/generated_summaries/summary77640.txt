Photos: 2011 Essence Music Festival: Kanye West, Usher, Mary J. Blige, George Clinton and More If Blige's set was packaged as faith and forgiveness, then Saturday night's headliner, Kanye West, was essentially id decked out in a sporty white blazer. But before I go any further in the show, I wanna thank you for coming out and still supporting me." Friday night headliner Usher and Charlie Wilson (Friday's penultimate performer) had an unofficial generational game of one-upmanship. Wilson smiled, preened and pranced as the audience swayed from side to side. After back-to-back stomach clutching renditions of "Not Gon' Cry" and "I'm Going Down" at the Essence Music Festival in New Orleans Sunday night, Mary J. Blige pulled off an Oprah-worthy seminar on affirmation with "Just Fine" to close out the three-day fest, which celebrates black music and African-American culture. But, much like Blige noted, the crowd wanted nostalgia and Usher offered it in heaps with a three-song Michael Jackson medley.
