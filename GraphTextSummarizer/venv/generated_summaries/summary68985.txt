The five were being held by Iraqi security forces Sunday at a jail inside the heavily protected Green Zone, the Iraqi official said. In a CNN exclusive, video shows U.S. contractors taken into custody by Iraqi authorities. Four of the five detained contractors work for North Carolina-based Corporate Training Unlimited -- a security firm headed by Donald Feeney, who, along with his son, Donald Feeney III, has been detained, according to another son, John Feeney. CTU was founded by the elder Feeney, a former member of the elite anti-terrorist unit, the Delta Force, sources with knowledge of the case told CNN Sunday. The four CTU detainees were identified by multiple sources as: Donald Feeney and Donald Feeney III; Micah Milligan; and Mark Bridges.
