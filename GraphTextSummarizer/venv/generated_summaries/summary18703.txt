Fifteen others were wounded in the blast in the heart of Mogadishu, senior Somali police Officer Farhah Aden said. "I heard a loud sound of an explosion from the gate of the building and went outside, where I saw dead bodies lying on chairs they were sitting down in, using the Internet." Intelligence reports at the time indicated the group was planning new attacks after the death of Ahmed Godane. The Al-Shabaab terror group has claimed responsibility for the attack, according to the spokesman for the group, Sheikh Abdiaziz Abu Musab. -- A car packed with explosives blew up outside a popular restaurant in Somalia's capital Sunday evening, killing at least 10 people, police said.
