Other teams high up there on God's fantasy sports team include the Boston Celtics with 17 NBA championships, the Pittsburgh Steelers with six Super Bowl wins and the Detroit Red Wings with 11 Stanley Cup titles. Opinion: I hate, hate Super Bowl parties Even the Cubs crosstown rivals, the Chicago White Sox, won a World Series in 2005. If God influences which teams win championships, it's clear that God likes certain teams more than others. Of course, if God is helping teams win, how do you explain the success of teams with names like the New Jersey Devils or Duke Blue Devils? That means about 80 million Americans believe that God will help one of the teams in this Sunday's Super Bowl.
