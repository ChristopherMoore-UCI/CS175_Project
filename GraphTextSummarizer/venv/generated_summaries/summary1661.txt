Before the 1960s, progressive legislation in the House was constantly stonewalled by coalition of Southern Democrats and conservative Republicans -- a bloc that it took a civil rights revolution to undo. But would we rather the House do exactly as the president tells it to and not follow its conscience on the vital subjects of health care and finance? The American way has the potential for divided government built into it, precisely because its founders wanted to protect against the growth of the state and to keep it in check by making it hard to pursue utopian manifestoes through to their glorious end. Passing lots of laws and spending lots of money ought to be a difficult, complex business. The vast majority of those shutdowns happened when the Democrats controlled the House.
