Malala Yousafzai, the Pakistani schoolgirl who survived an attack by the Taliban, on Monday appealed to Boko Haram militants in Nigeria to lay down their weapons and "stop misusing the name of Islam." She survived and a year later launched the nonprofit Malala Fund, aimed at empowering girls through education. Malala is visiting Nigeria in support of an estimated 276 girls kidnapped by Boko Haram from their school in Chibok in northeastern Nigeria on April 14. She  added that Jonathan had said he would meet the parents of kidnapped girls and provide support to those who had escaped Boko Haram. Malala later gave a speech to mark Malala Day to an audience that included advocates from the #BringBackOurGirls campaign and some of the schoolgirls who had escaped Boko Haram.
