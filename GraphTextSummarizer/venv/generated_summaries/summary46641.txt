Landrieu spent more than $3,200 in taxpayer money to fly 400 miles round trip from New Orleans to Lake Charles, Louisiana, where she attended a $40-per person fundraising lunch with hundreds of women, according to Senate records and Landrieu campaign information. Asked Wednesday about the trip, Landrieu's Senate spokesman, Matthew Lehner, said in a statement: "Sen. Landrieu was invited to an official evening event in Shreveport. Sen. Mary Landrieu will reimburse the Senate more than $5,700 for a charter flight she paid for with taxpayer money after CNN questioned the expense. Landrieu's campaign spokesman, Fabien Levy, said in a statement Monday that the charter company mistakenly billed Landrieu's Senate office instead of her re-election campaign. In this case, Landrieu's Senate office picked up the whole cost of the trip.
