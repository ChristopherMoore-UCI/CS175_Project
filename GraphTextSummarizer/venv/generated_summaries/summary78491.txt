Duck boat crew members told investigators that they made radio calls to the tug boat Caribbean Sea that were not answered prior to the collision, the National Transportation Safety Board said earlier this month. The U.S. Coast Guard on Saturday released recordings of radio communications after this month's collision between a tour boat and a barge in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Around 2:36 p.m., the bow of the barge hit the small tour boat, causing it to sink, investigators said. People who operated several vessels in the area have told federal investigators that they heard the tour boat's radio calls. The Caribbean Sea was pushing the barge that collided with the tour boat, causing it to sink in 55 feet of water, the report said.
