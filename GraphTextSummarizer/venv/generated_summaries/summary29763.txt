But hearing the talk of U.S. security plans in the run-up to the Games in Russia next month, visitors may think they are entering a war zone. They also will be under the watchful eye of U.S. security officials who will attend events with them, according to State Department officials. That's in addition to U.S. precautions on Russian soil, where FBI agents are now arriving in Sochi to work with their Russian counterparts, according to Rep. Michael McCaul, chairman of the U.S. House Homeland Security Committee. It cited media reports about the hunt in Sochi by Russian authorities for "black widows," wives of dead insurgents who act as suicide bombers, even as it said the U.S. government has not corroborated the reports. It is unclear whether a military evacuation would entail U.S. forces entering Russian territory, but Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel has publicly hinted that there is a plan of some sort.
