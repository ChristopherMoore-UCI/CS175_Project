"Boston Police and Suffolk prosecutors are seeking assistance from tattoo artists who may have inked Aaron Hernandez in the aftermath of the 2012 homicides of Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado," the Suffolk County district attorney said in a statement. Suffolk County District Attorney Daniel Conley has said de Abreu and Furtado were "ambushed and executed" while driving home along Shawmut Avenue in Boston's South End early on July 16, 2012. A grand jury indicted Hernandez last week in the 2012 shooting deaths of Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado, and he is to be arraigned on the new charges on May 28. Conley said that Hernandez was driving an SUV that pulled up alongside de Abreu and Furtado's car near a nightclub and that the former football star fired a .38-caliber revolver at them. The latter four counts reflect shots fired at three people, one of whom was wounded, inside the car that de Abreu and Furtado were in, Conley said.
