This time around, the Army is looking for a family of camouflage patterns that can be used across the globe -- one for the desert, another for a wilderness/jungle environment, and a third transitional variant for "places in the middle," Cole says. Cole says that, after extensive testing, his office should be able to present Army leadership with a recommendation by September 2012. " Industry bids for the Army uniform project have been submitted and will be put to the test against current Defense Department camouflage patterns such as those already used by the Marines and the Navy. The Army purchase, however, isn't about the latest design in camo fashion, but rather the color coordination and specific pattern placement manufactured by advanced science. A different brand of camouflage called "MultiCam" ranked at the top in the testing, pushing the Army to quickly outfit soldiers with the new uniform pattern.
