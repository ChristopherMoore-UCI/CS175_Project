In a December 5 letter to the Newtown Board of Police Commissioners, Police Chief Michael Kehoe said he was withdrawing an earlier "request and recommendation" that Officer Thomas Bean be fired. Other Newtown police officers were diagnosed with PTSD, but Bean was the only one unable to return to work, union officials said. Bean recently told CNN that he broke down in tears after Sandy Hook Elementary School was cleared. "The town agreed with the union that no one would suffer financially from this, but they lied because they are hell-bent on ruining my life through financial burdens, not allowing me the right to work elsewhere and the continuous retraumatization of myself and my family," Bean said. Six months after the mass shooting, the officer -- who responded to the tragedy on his day off -- was placed on long-term disability, according to Bean and his union.
