Interior Minister Carlos Romero characterized the operation, which took place Sunday, as a major blow against drug trafficking. That's the awesome scenario described by Bolivian authorities who say they seized more than $1 million this week after a white bag was tossed from an airplane in Santa Cruz. Three people were "captured," and authorities also seized weapons and vehicles, the Interior Ministry said. Bolivia is one of the world's largest producers of coca, the raw ingredient in cocaine. Anti-drug police first noticed a person signaling a plane, the Interior Ministry said in a statement.
