-- Vibe magazine founder Quincy Jones may attempt to buy back the now-shuttered hip-hop magazine, according to a published report. "I'm trying to buy my magazine back now," Jones told EbonyJet.com on Tuesday, according to an article posted on the Web site. Quincy Jones speaks onstage at the Apollo Theater 75th Anniversary Gala in June. Additional details were not available in the report, and Arnold Robinson, a spokesman for Jones, told CNN he had no comment. Its chief executive officer, Steve Aaron, said the magazine has a debt of "several millions of dollars" and also faced a declining market and decreased advertising revenue.
