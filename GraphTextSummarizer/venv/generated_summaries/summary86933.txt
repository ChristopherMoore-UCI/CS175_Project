-- Nearly $200 million in federal funding will be awarded to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey for repairs after Superstorm Sandy, according to a statement Sunday from U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer's office. Schumer and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, both New York Democrats, announced that the Department of Transportation is providing $195.7 million in funds for infrastructure repairs needed after the storm damaged the region's rail systems and infrastructure, according to the statement. The PATH rail system suffered damage from the millions of gallons of saltwater that flooded the tunnels between New York and New Jersey, the statement says. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey is critical to the region's trade and transportation network. It includes America's busiest airport system, marine terminals and ports, the PATH rail transit system, six tunnels and bridges between New York and New Jersey, the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Manhattan and the World Trace Center, according to its website.
