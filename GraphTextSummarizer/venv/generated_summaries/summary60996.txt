The future of space travel will depend on our ability to make rockets that can be used more than once, says SpaceX CEO Elon Musk. Currently, SpaceX -- which both works alongside NASA and counts the agency among its clients -- launches from Cape Canaveral in Florida and Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, which are both government sites. Historic launch of private rocket heralds new era "Elon may be the planet's most exciting entrepreneur," said SXSW Interactive director Hugh Forrest. He said a reusable rocket could make space launches 100 times cheaper.
