Reigning Formula One world champion Lewis Hamilton was the fastest man on the tracks during the second last day of pre-season testing at the Circuit de Catalunya near Barcelona Saturday. Mercedes were by far and away the dominant force in F1 last year and there was little indication Saturday that this will not be the case in 2015. Williams were the closest challengers, as they had been on Friday, with Felipe Massa finding his best time of the testing season. "The day stopped a little too early for us," said McLaren racing director Eric Boullier. The Mercedes driver notched up the best lap of the day after changing from the slower medium compound to soft tires.
