"[More than 400] cooling centers will continue to remain open Friday," said New York Emergency management spokeswoman Judith Kane. Severe heat and humidity stretched from Vermont to North Carolina on Thursday with temperatures reaching the mid- to upper 90s, the National Weather Service said. More than 700 sprinklers were available in parks across New York City, said Parks Department spokeswoman Vickie Karp. A heat wave continued to blanket the U.S. Northeast with scorching temperatures on the first day of summer, as residents across the region sought to keep cool amid national heat advisories. In the past decade, heat has been the second-leading cause for weather-related fatalities, the service said.
