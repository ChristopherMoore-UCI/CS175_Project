Mistake 3: Moms assume they don't have enough milk Solution: Rethink your baby's nursing behavior Many times, new moms think if baby won't stop nursing, he must not be getting enough milk, so they give him formula. Other women quit nursing when they go back to work, and others stop because family members encourage them to give bottles instead of breast milk. Mistake 5: Moms panic when milk doesn't gush out Solution: Realize that at the very beginning, you're not going to see a lot of milk Through her work at the Booby Brigade, Clowes found some moms were expecting torrents of milk from the very beginning, and when they didn't get it, they'd give baby a bottle. The bagged breast milk filling Erika Clowes' freezer is evidence of how nursing dominates a new mom's life. The study didn't track the reasons the women quit nursing, but experts including Los Angeles, California, lactation consultant Corky Harvey said many women have a hard time nursing and don't know where to turn for help.
