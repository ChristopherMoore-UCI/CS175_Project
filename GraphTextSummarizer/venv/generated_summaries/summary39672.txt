Read more: Pistorius judge warns of 'trial by media' This begs the question: considering a litany of state missteps and the wild public speculation triggered at the bail proceedings, can Pistorius get a fair trial? He has given interviews to the media vociferously claiming Pistorius' guilt and affirming that he will be called at trial to testify for the state. The state's bungles have only served to fuel the determination of Pistorius naysayers: if he is acquitted of murder it will not be put down to the fact that he was telling the truth, but because the state dropped the ball. To this segment of society Pistorius is already guilty of murder -- irrespective of what the evidence ends up revealing.
