-- Tens of thousands of Pakistanis ended their sit-in in central Islamabad late Thursday night after their leader, Muslim cleric Tahir ul Qadri, convinced Pakistan's government to dissolve the National Assembly and set new elections. Second, Qadri's Pakistan Awami Tehreek party will be able to propose two potential candidates for the caretaker prime minister post. The crowds that had paralyzed downtown Islamabad since Sunday began to disperse after Qadri's declaration of victory. Growing fury over widespread corruption brought the government district to a standstill this week and jolted Pakistan's already volatile political scene ahead of national elections due later this year. Qadri's suggestion about judiciary and military involvement in Pakistan's future has raised concerns in the country, where military leaders have repeatedly seized power and ruled for long periods of time.
