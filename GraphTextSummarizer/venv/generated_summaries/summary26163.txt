As for amusement park rides, Memmer has "upped his game" and recently spent a family vacation at Walt Disney World's theme parks in Orlando where he was able to comfortably get on any ride he wanted with his children. Memmer said he kept his plan simple: eating less and consuming fewer calories. Although many soups contain a high amount of sodium, Memmer says "this does not weigh on his mind and a recent check with the doctor showed a clean bill of health. A stranger in line agreed to sit with his son, but at that moment, Memmer knew it was finally time to lose weight. Memmer changed his mind-set about food, too.
