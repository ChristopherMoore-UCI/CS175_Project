Abduction garnered a lackluster "B-" rating from CinemaScore moviegoers, though women under the age of 18 were more generous with an "A-" grade. The Warner Bros. film joined "Soul Surfer" and "The Help" to become the year's third release to score an "A+" from CinemaScore audiences. Both critics and moviegoers were fans -- the PG-13 film received some of the strongest reviews of the year and earned an "A" rating from CinemaScore participants. "Moneyball" will now try to follow in the box-office footsteps of last year's "The Social Network," which debuted to a similar $22.4 million en route to a domestic total of $97 million. The two films even cost around the same amount to produce: $50 million for "Moneyball" and $40 million for "Social Network."
