Meanwhile, nearly 400 Red Cross volunteers from across the country were to arrive in the San Diego area Wednesday, said Red Cross worker John Degnan, who came in from Massachusetts. The cost of homes destroyed by the wildfires is likely to top $1 billion in San Diego County alone, an emergency official said.
