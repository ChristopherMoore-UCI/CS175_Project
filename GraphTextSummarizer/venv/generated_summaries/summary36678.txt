Then there was the hope that if the government stood ready to help the banks with enough money -- and enough was a lot -- confidence would be restored, and with the restoration of confidence, asset prices would increase and lending would be restored. General Motors and GE both got into the finance business, and both showed that banks had no monopoly on bad risk management. Some of what they had left over they used to buy other banks -- to pursue strategic goals for which they could not have found private finance. At "just" 25 to 1 leverage, a 4 percent fall in the price of assets wipes out a bank's net worth -- and we have seen far more precipitous falls in asset prices. Putting another $20 billion in a bank with $2 trillion of assets will be wiped out with just a 1 percent fall in asset prices.
