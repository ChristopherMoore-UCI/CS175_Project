-- Twelve firefighters from Ladder Company 3 who lost their lives trying to save people at the North Tower of the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, were honored Wednesday in a ceremony at the 9/11 Memorial and Museum. Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Fire Department of New York Commissioner Salvatore J. Cassano, firefighters, family members and friends watched as the company's truck, covered in a white sheet, returned permanently to the site where the Trade Center towers once stood. "We will never forget the heroism of the hundreds of firefighters and other first responders who rushed into those burning towers on September 11," Bloomberg said in a statement. The 60,000-pound truck had been maintained by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey in a climate-controlled room, according to a press release from the 9/11 Memorial Museum. " "All the memories come back, all the emotions," Robert Sweeney, chief of operations for the fire department, told CNN Wednesday.
