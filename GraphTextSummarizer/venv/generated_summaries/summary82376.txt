"The DMK party has institutionalized corruption in Tamil Nadu for years and their defeat clearly shows voters will no longer tolerate corruption," said political analyst P. Nilotpal of the Center for Indian Political Research and Analysis. Analysts say the good showing for Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's coalition is a much-needed boost for the government, battered by a series of corruption scandals, rising inflation, and low investor confidence in Asia's third largest economy. "But now people are awakened, they are saying no to politicians or political families who have dominated for so many decades." Analysts say these election results are crucial as the coalition will be in a better position to act on long-awaited reforms such as a new legislation on land acquisition. The man at the center of the scandal, A. Raja, is a DMK member and former telecoms minister. He was arrested last month for his alleged involvement in the selling of telecom licenses at rock-bottom prices.
