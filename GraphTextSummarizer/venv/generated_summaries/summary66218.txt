Modern technology may offer a hiding place to voyeurs, but it can also give a voice to human decency. So the camera has created a new kind of crowd in the course of our long history of public beheadings. If the history of beheadings tells us anything, it is that there will always be people who want to see. When the footage of James Foley's murder circulated via social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook in August 2014, a Syrian activist named Hend Amry asked people not to share it and initiated the hashtag #ISISmediablackout. For centuries, public executions had been intended to terrify by example, when for many they were little more than light entertainment.
