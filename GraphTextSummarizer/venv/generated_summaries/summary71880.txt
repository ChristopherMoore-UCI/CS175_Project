After all, six months in, a press release was sent out entitled: "President Obama Announces Benefits for Gay Partners of Federal Employees." Gay leaders implored Obama to lend support before a close vote on gay rights in Maine. Benefits for gay federal employees are much closer to those of their heterosexual colleagues, if they are posted abroad. But until he seemed to have no choice, he remained extraordinarily quiet on gay issues, even though he continues to collect millions of dollars in donations from gay activists. It also turned out that federal employees cannot sign up their partners -- even their legally married ones -- for benefits as basic as health insurance.
