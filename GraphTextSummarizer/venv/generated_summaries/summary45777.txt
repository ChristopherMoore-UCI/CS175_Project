Civil service pension rules are applied to all federal employees to calculate compensation, postal service spokesman Gerald McKiernan said. Gallagher said effective compensation was necessary for effective managers. Richard Syron, former Freddie Mac CEO, had a compensation package of $3.4 million and reportedly took home much more in cash, stocks and other compensation before he was fired in September, according to Forbes magazine. The calculation is based on salary and years of service, he said. And the amount is far below that given to CEOs in the private sector, even though compensation and benefit packages for postal service officers are required by law to be comparable to those given to private-sector employees doing similar work, the board of governors says.
