So for charities hoping for a share of Sundance swag -- and celebrities warming to the idea of giving up their free goods -- there may be more hope for next year. For the 10 days of the Sundance Film Festival, Utah's Park City is transformed into Swag City. With so much gifting going on, it's not uncommon on the streets of Park City to see celebrities (or, more often, their assistants) toting armfuls of goods. But in the end, only a small percentage of the swag handed out at Sundance is likely to wind up benefiting charities, whether it's New York Cares or the Jon Bon Jovi Soul Foundation. "I always feel very guilty." January Jones, who stars with Isaacs in the Sundance movie "Sweetwater," said she won't take swag as a matter of principle.
