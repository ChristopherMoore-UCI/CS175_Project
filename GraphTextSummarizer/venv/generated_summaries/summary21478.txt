Gen. James "Spider" Marks, a CNN military analyst, described Fort Lee as a "very active" one, with soldiers "routinely coming and going to get various types of training." The incident began at about 8:45 a.m. ET at Fort Lee when the soldier apparently brandished a weapon and then barricaded herself in an office at the Army Combined Arms Support Command headquarters building, according to a statement from the post. Fort Lee is located near Petersburg, about 30 miles south of Richmond. The statement said that Fort Lee Police responded within two minutes and quickly established contact with her. About Fort Lee
