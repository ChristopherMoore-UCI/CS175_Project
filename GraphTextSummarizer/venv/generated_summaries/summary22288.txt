-- Nico Rosberg has claimed a surprise pole position for Sunday's Bahrain Grand Prix, but qualifying positions were once again almost a secondary consideration in a race already overshadowed by ongoing protests in the Gulf kingdom. Several media outlets reported that human rights protesters clashed with Bahrain's security forces into the early hours of Saturday morning. The race was canceled in 2011 after violent protests by factions of the majority Shiite population against Bahrain's Sunni rulers. "Bahrain upholds the right to peaceful protest. "When I got told the gap to P1, it was clear that even with a perfect lap he was unbeatable today, but nevertheless I'm very happy," said the Red Bull star, who won last year's race from pole at the Sakhir circuit.
