"Thus far, we've seen about a 40 percent view-through rate and since we only pay when potential customers actually watch a video, we have more control over our budget," said Lee Topar, director of online marketing for GoPro, in a statement to Google's Inside AdWords blog. YouTube has officially launched its new TrueView ad format, allowing site visitors to avoid watching ads they're not interested in. As we reported back in June, YouTube had been experimenting with the button -- allowing users to stop ads from playing -- for awhile. Meanwhile, YouTube says it's working on providing more choice and control in advertising to its users. Users will now be able to look for a countdown button that will let them skip an ad after it plays for five seconds.
