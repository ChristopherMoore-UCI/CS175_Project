A CNN/ORC poll out this week showed Christie in fourth place in the GOP field, taking 8 percent support and coming in behind former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, neurosurgeon Ben Carson and former GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who took first. The legislative panel investigating the George Washington Bridge scandal was unable to determine whether New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie knew about the lane closures ahead of time, but the panel will continue to push for more answers, the co-chairman of the panel told CNN. Two central figures in the lane closures were not accessible to legislative investigators: David Wildstein, Christie's appointee at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey who orchestrated the closures, and Christie's former deputy chief of staff, Bridget Kelly, who wrote an email declaring it was "Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee." "The Committee has finally acknowledged what we reported nine months ago -- namely, that there is not a shred of evidence Governor Christie knew anything about the GWB lane realignment beforehand or that any current member of his staff was involved in that decision," Mastro said in a written statement. New Jersey State Assemblyman John Wisniewski, a Democrat, confirmed to CNN in a text message Thursday an earlier Wall Street Journal piece previewing the panel's report resulting from its months-long investigation into the lane closures.
