-- Rafael Nadal had a scary moment Sunday when he slumped over in pain during a news conference following his third-round match at the U.S. Open in New York. That's why (it) was so painful." Nadal won the third-round match against David Nalbandian in straight sets. The 25-year-old Spaniard -- the No. 2 in the world -- leaned his head back in the middle of the news conference, breathing heavily and grimacing in pain before slumping in his chair and lowering himself to the ground. Nadal attributed the pain to leg cramps after playing in hot, humid weather, according to the tournament's website. He next faces Gilles Muller in fourth-round play.
