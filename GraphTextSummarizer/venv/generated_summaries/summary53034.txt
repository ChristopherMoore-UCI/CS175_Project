" Abu Masouh told Egyptian news outlets that Louis, the pastor of Boston's Free Pentecostal Church of God, had been allowed to call his wife, who had been on the same bus. Gen. Ahmed Bakr, the head of security in Egypt's northern Sinai Peninsula, says Bedouin sheikhs who are acting as mediators have confirmed the hostages "are unharmed and well fed." Another son, Jean Louis, told CNN earlier Sunday that the captive Americans were part of a group that was on its way to Israel. -- Egyptian authorities said Sunday they are preparing for a new round of negotiations with the man who has kidnapped two Americans and an Egyptian tour guide to demand his uncle's release from an Alexandria jail. He wants Egyptian police to free his uncle, whom Bakr said had been caught in Alexandria with a half-ton of drugs.
