Barrett, who arrived in federal court in Houston wearing an orange jail jumpsuit and leg shackles, faces up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine, if convicted. Barrett then laughed and said 'knockout,' as he ran to his vehicle and fled." "The complaint alleges Barrett made several videos, one in which he identifies himself and another in which he makes a racial slur. In other videos on his phone that police confiscated, Barrett used the N-word and said that African-Americans "haven't fully experienced the blessing of evolution," according to the criminal complaint. Parnham told CNN earlier that he could not say whether his client carried out the attack, but, "mental health issues definitely played a part in anything that occurred." Barrett "is very sorry for this person," Parnham said, adding that he and his client haven't had much opportunity to discuss the facts of the case.
