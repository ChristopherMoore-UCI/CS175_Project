-- North Korean and South Korean officials held their first government-level talks in years on Sunday, South Korean media reported. South Korea reacted quickly and positively to the offer, noting that it had been "continuously" seeking talks on Kaesong since the North shut it down. In April, Kim Jong Un's regime began blocking South Koreans from entering the manufacturing complex, which sits on the North's side of the heavily fortified border and houses the operations of more than 120 South Korean companies. The North expressed appreciation for the South's response Friday, and said "working contact" between the two governments is necessary before ministerial talks. The shuttered Kaesong complex is one of the main casualties of the recent threats and provocative moves by North Korea.
