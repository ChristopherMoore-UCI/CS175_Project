A Los Angeles County probation officer determined that Brown, the ex-husband of Whitney Houston, was eligible to serve his time at home if he wore an electronic monitor bracelet, Los Angeles County Sheriff's spokesman Steve Whitmore said. "He is presently home with family," his lawyer, Christopher Brown, said Thursday. Brown, who has been touring with his R&B group, New Edition, released "Masterpiece," his first solo album in 14 years, last June. Brown can take the bracelet, which he is paying for, off his leg after eight days, the same amount of time he would have otherwise spent behind bars, Whitmore said. The singer pleaded no contest to a drunken driving offense, driving with a suspended license and violating his probation from another drunken driving conviction last year.
