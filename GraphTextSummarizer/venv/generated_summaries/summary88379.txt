PricewaterhouseCoopers estimates that new medicines for hepatitis C will increase health care costs by just half a percent in 2014 and will level off after 2016 as patients are cured. Now, it is giving us the same opportunity against hepatitis C -- and many more diseases.e need to move forward, and let the harrowing experience of HIV/AIDS patients inform our continued war against diseases like hepatitis C. As a result of market dynamics and generic drug usage, the cost of medicines overall has grown more slowly in recent years than other health care costs, and makes up just 10% to 12% of total health care spending. Although critics say the price of a promising new hepatitis C drug raises the cost of insurance, research from Milliman in 2009 projected that, without a cure for hepatitis C, annual U.S. medical costs associated with the disease will nearly triple over 20 years -- from $30 billion to $85 billion -- indicating that curing the disease can help reduce future medical costs. Opinion: We all pay for $1,000 a pill drug And recent projections show that the cost of curing hepatitis C patients will be far less than some have claimed.
