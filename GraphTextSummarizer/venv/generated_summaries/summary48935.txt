-- The estranged wife of actor Stephen Collins said Wednesday she isn't trying to extort any money from her husband as they go through a contentious divorce and the former "7th Heaven" star is the subject of child molestation allegations. There are specific laws in child sexual abuse cases in New York that do allow for an extension of the statute of limitations in certain cases, but this particular allegation against Collins can't be prosecuted, the official added. Bizarre end to Tuesday Collins is alive and well, the Los Angeles police said late Tuesday night after rumors circulated on social media that he had shot himself. Los Angeles police said they received information two years ago regarding allegations of criminal behavior. The gist of it is this: A relative of Collins' first wife went to police in November 2012 and told them she was sexually assaulted by Collins when she was 14 years old while inside his New York apartment, a senior law enforcement official told CNN on Tuesday evening.
