The whole country was praying their star striker would be fit for selection, so much so that Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos even visited Falcao in hospital, but sadly it wasn't to be. Simply put, United signing Falcao is like buying a really nice sweater but forgetting to put on your trousers. Monaco did qualify for the Champions League, even if Falcao missed most of last season through injury. Last week it paid Real Madrid nearly $100m to sign Angel di Maria, a forward-thinking addition to a squad that already included the likes of Robin van Persie, Wayne Rooney and Juan Mata. Now Falcao junior has a similar mission to help United qualify for Europe's top competition.
