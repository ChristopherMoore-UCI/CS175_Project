-- Once a haven for painters seduced by its rich colors, Marrakech is back on track to become a world-leading destination for photographers thanks to the arrival of a major new museum. "Marrakech inspires photographers, it is abuzz with Moroccan and worldwide creativity, and for all these reasons we thought is was useful to open it in this city," he told CNN. In addition to Marrakech's countless attractions, weather is one of the main reasons tourists visit the Red City -- and it's definitely a plus for photographers. It's easy to get close to people in the main square, Jemaa el Fna, but photographers shouldn't be surprised if they get asked for money in exchange of their masterpiece -- this mostly applies to snake charmers and monkey trainers. Recently it hosted an opening, at the Gallery David Bloch, by prestigious photographer Steve McCurry.
