Durbin's assessment came as former President Clinton made a rare visit to Capitol Hill to discuss the health care issue with Senate Democrats. They'd also limit total out-of-pocket expenses and prevent insurance companies from denying coverage for pre-existing conditions. On Tuesday, police arrested six demonstrators in Lieberman's Capitol Hill office after a group protesting his views on health care legislation refused to leave. The group is upset that Lieberman refuses to support the public option, which they believe would reduce the number of people without health care insurance. A group calling itself the Mobilization for Health Care for All littered the floor and hallway with symbolic "money" and said that campaign donations to Lieberman by the insurance industry have affected his judgment of health care legislation.
