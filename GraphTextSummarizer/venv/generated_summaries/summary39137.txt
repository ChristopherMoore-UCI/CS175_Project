Many private plans were unable to come in under traditional Medicare, and only in certain markets in the country. Most significantly, though, this whole plan rests on the same rationale as Medicare Advantage did (it lets Medicare beneficiaries get their coverage through private insurance companies) when President George W. Bush first proposed it. The only way states would be able to provide insurance to Medicaid recipients on way less money would be if they reduced the benefits or the number of beneficiaries. Ironically, for all the talk about the concerns over the deficit, their plan also may not reduce Medicare spending as much as the Affordable Care Act does in the next decade. Moreover, traditional Medicare will be one of the choices.
