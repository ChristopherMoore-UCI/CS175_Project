Ringo Starr, the only other surviving former Beatle, was there, as was iconic U.S. television host Barbara Walters, who reportedly played a role in introducing McCartney and Shevell, an American trucking heiress. She was married once before, to lawyer Bruce Blakeman, who is active in Republican and Jewish circles in New York state. She is an executive at her father's company, New England Motor Freight, and a 10-year member of New York's Metropolitan Transportation Authority. -- Fans and friends of Paul McCartney gathered in central London Sunday to watch the ex-Beatle walk down the aisle for the third time, as he married girlfriend Nancy Shevell. McCartney and Shevell got engaged in May, a McCartney representative told CNN at the time.
