" George Smith, 26, went overboard from the Royal Caribbean ship Brilliance of the Seas on July 5, 2005, at 4:30 a.m., according to Smith family attorney Michael Jones. "As part of these efforts, Royal Caribbean assembled over 6,000 pages of documents covering its investigation of the disappearance of Mr. Smith and made all this information available to the FBI. Jones said the family had been seeking the transfer of jurisdiction from the FBI's Connecticut office to the agency's New York bureau for almost two years, after a video surfaced that showed at least three Russian-American passengers on the same cruise joking about George's death. "The tide is turning, I think, now," Maureen Smith, the mother of George Smith, told CNN on Tuesday. The attorney said he became aware of the video when lawyers for the cruise line turned over information and video after the Smith family reached a settlement with Royal Caribbean.
