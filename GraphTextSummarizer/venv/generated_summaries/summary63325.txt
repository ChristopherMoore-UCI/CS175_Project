Previously, Mac software could be found on vendors' websites or in stores (in cardboard boxes, no less; how quaint). Scott Forstall, Apple's vice president for iPhone software, said last year that the company's iPad would spark "a whole new gold rush for app developers," a prediction that must now apply to the Mac store as well. Mac users have appeared eager to spend money on apps, even for software that was previously available on the Web and in brick-and-mortar stores. Apple spokeswoman Jacqueline Roy also listed Evernote among the top five "must-have" apps, which is determined by consistent top performers in downloads and ratings. Mac owners like the store because it makes software easier to find, manages what's been downloaded, makes it easy to move apps between computers and provides alerts when a new version is available.
