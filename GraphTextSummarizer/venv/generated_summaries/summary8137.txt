Josh got interested in relief and development work during his second year at school and has already spent one summer abroad in Japan, where he worked with Japan Railways. It is one of the most impoverished areas of South Africa, but is also surrounded by a massive dam, game preserves and two majestic mountain ranges. Josh will be working on a new sports complex in Jozini, a facility that will double as an educational facility for local youths. There probably won't be much free time for squash and the martial arts that Josh normally enjoys, but it's certain new talents will emerge over the next year during Josh's time abroad. He loves to travel and perhaps it's his wanderlust that's motivated him to take the next year off and travel to Jozini, South Africa.
