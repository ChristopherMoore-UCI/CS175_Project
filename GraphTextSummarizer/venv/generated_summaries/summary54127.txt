However, the hotly debated question number 9 on the census only serves to prove that even after making history by electing our first African and white-American president, our society has only managed to place a "post-racial" Band-Aid over the subject of race in the United States. With a growing number of Latinos becoming vested in discovering their ancestral roots -- a Tejana friend of mine from Austin, Texas, recently learned she belongs to a Central Asian group that reputedly descends from Genghis Khan -- the subject of race within our community will enable us to self-identify in ways our parents' generation could only dream of. My mother's mother's mother's direct maternal line is L3d, a subgroup of African descent, (we found matches in Guinea-Bissau). This is what I know for sure: Ethnically, I am a New York City born woman of Dominican parentage. But racially, through the science of DNA testing and tracing my family's own migration story, I've begun to receive confirmation of what I've always believed to be true not only for myself but many of the 47 million-plus Latino-Americans across the country: the subject of race in our community is kaleidoscopic, more complicated than what the census 2010 checkboxes offer.
