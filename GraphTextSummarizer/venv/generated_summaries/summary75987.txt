CNN will be at the event, live blogging the iPad unveilings and any surprises that Apple might still have in store starting at 10 a.m. Pacific Time. The images, which were later removed, were for the latest version of Apple's "iPad User Guide" for iOS 8. Apple is expected to announce new Macs and discuss the latest Apple Pay and OS X Yosemite release dates. The physical designs of the new tablets appear to be largely unchanged from existing iPad models, and the iPad Air 2 is getting a burst photography mode. Screen shots showing images and details for the iPad Air 2 and iPad Mini 3 appeared in iBooks on Wednesday.
