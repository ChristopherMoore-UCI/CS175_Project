Two to 4 million people have purchased health care discount cards like the one Murray bought, according to the Consumer Health Alliance, a trade group representing companies that sell the cards. On its Web site, Consumer Health Alliance has set up a consumer guide for shopping for a discount health care program. Her daughter, Meredith, desperately needed to see a doctor after suffering a brain injury in a car accident, but health insurance companies wouldn't sell her a policy because of her pre-existing condition. "Discount health care programs aren't the answer to this country's health care crisis, but for people without any access to insurance, saving money with these programs is better than nothing." "Medical discount cards are spreading like kudzu," said Jim Quiggle, a spokesman for the Coalition Against Insurance Fraud.
