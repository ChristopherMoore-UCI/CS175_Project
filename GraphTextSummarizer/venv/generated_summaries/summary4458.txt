We go to clothing stores blindly hoping to find things we like, and we cross paths with thousands of people, knowing nothing about them. Many of the first television programs consisted of people reading radio scripts. It's a new type of spatial web: one that gives us real-time data about the people, places and things physically around us. More recently, improvements in battery life and location technology have given rise to services like Uber and Lyft, which let you request a ride and track your driver as a moving dot on a map, coming to pick you up. With improved battery life and storage technology, we'll be able to capture our entire lives on video (or some equivalent) and recall the past at any time.
