Let's be honest." Trinidad James is the rapper whose hit song, "All Gold Everything," is heard playing in the background as the house mother of the University of Oklahoma Sigma Alpha Epsilon house -- known as Mom B. -- was caught on a Vine video repeating the n-word seven times on camera. Things got testy on "CNN Tonight" when conservative commentator Ben Ferguson charged that rappers like Trinidad James are profiting off the n-word. The panel also included CNN commentator Marc Lamont Hill. "I'm making money off of doing music and being creative, sir," James responded. "I think you know that we should probably get rid of the n-word, but in reality, I think many rappers are afraid they will lose out on money and sales and street cred if they don't stop using the word."
