Magnotta appeared at his initial court appearance Tuesday via video link for security reasons but appeared in person for Thursday afternoon's hearing, said Jean Pascal Boucher, a spokesman for the Quebec prosecutor's office. Prosecutors asked Judge Jean-Pierre Boyer to bar the publication of details of medication Magnotta was taking, however. He was thought to have boarded a bus to Berlin on June 1 while police were searching for him in Paris, Berlin prosecutors have said. Luka Rocco Magnotta faces first-degree murder and other charges in the death and dismemberment of Jun Lin, a 33-year-old Concordia University student from China. Authorities accuse Magnotta of dismembering Lin and mailing his hand and foot to Canadian politicians.
