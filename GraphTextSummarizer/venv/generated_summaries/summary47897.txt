Previously, scientists have used data from past Mars missions to speculate about channels on the planet, and whether water could have flowed in them. The 2,000-pound super-rover, which made its now-legendary landing on Mars on August 6, has come across stones in conglomerate rock suggesting that water must have flowed there in the past. Scientists used data from Curiosity and the orbiters at Mars to enhance their understanding of the area. What we've done on Mars, and what's next Scientists believe the water and sediment flowed down the crater into an alluvial fan -- a geological formation created by material that water transports. The water flowing in these rock formations was probably somewhere between ankle and hip deep, said Curiosity science co-investigator William Dietrich of the University of California, Berkeley.
