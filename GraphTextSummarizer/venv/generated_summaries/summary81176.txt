"All we can do is make sure such a tragedy does not happen again." The September 2010 explosion destroyed 38 homes and left a 72-foot by 26-foot crater in the middle of a neighborhood in San Bruno, near San Francisco International Airport. -- California regulators recommended a record $2.25 billion fine for the state's largest utility Monday in the gas pipeline explosion that killed eight people in a San Francisco suburb. NTSB Chairman Deborah Hersman said the probe yielded "troubling revelations about a company that exploited weaknesses in a lax system of oversight, and government agencies that placed a blind trust in operators to the detriment of public safety." "It was not a question of if this pipeline would burst," she said. In addition, PG&E would be subjected to audits to make sure it's not shifting money from other operations "that affect safety." "There is no amount of money that will bring back the eight people who tragically lost their lives in the pipeline blast or heal the lasting wounds to the people of San Bruno," Hagan said in a statement announcing the decision.
