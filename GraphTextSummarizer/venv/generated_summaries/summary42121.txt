Erhardt -- who had completed internships with a number of other banks -- was staying in a ground-floor flat at Claredale House, a four-storey building known as "Banker's block" due to its reputation for housing interns in the summer months. While no direct link has been made, the death of the German business student has put the spotlight on grueling hours suffered by interns looking to impress bosses and competing with each other. Katerina Rudiger, head of skills and policy campaign at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, told CNN employers try to make internships a positive experience for young people. Cass Business School professor Andre Spicer told CNN interns are expected to work long hours to show their commitment to prospective employers, rather than being productive. Dillon Khan, author of the The Intern, told CNN increased media scrutiny on internships, particularly in the UK, is forcing companies to be more careful when employing young people.
