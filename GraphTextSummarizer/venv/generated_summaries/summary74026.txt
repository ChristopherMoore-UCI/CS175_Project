The indictments come within days of a new U.S.-Iraq Status of Forces Agreement, which pointedly specifies that U.S. civilian contractors will no longer be immune from Iraqi prosecution for crimes committed in that country. It could be made public by Justice Department officials Monday. But when the investigation was turned over to the Justice Department to examine possible criminal activity, FBI agents discovered that some guards believed they were immune from prosecution and therefore refused to be interviewed again, complicating the FBI investigation. Sources have said that charges under consideration included murder and assault. "We strongly disagree with the Department of Justice's decision to bring charges against Dustin Heard," attorney David Schertler said in a statement.
