"This is a totally new step for Saudi Arabia," Saudi journalist Essam Al Ghalib told CNN. In what appears to be a first for male-dominated Saudi Arabia, Jabarti has been appointed editor of a major newspaper, the English-language Saudi Gazette. The Saudi Gazette has a circulation of about 47,000, Al Maeena told Al Arabiya News in September. Reporters Without Borders recently said Saudi Arabia ranks near the bottom of countries around the world in press freedom. "I've had the goal almost as long of wanting to see a Saudi woman enter the male-dominated bastion of editors-in chief," Al Maeena wrote.
