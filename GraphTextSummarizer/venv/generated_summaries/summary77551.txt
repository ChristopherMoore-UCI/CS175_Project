In an additional nod to her caucus's conservatives, Pelosi and House Majority Whip Steny Hoyer sent a letter to Senate leaders "throwing down the gauntlet" to insist that a pay-as-you-go system be followed, which would require new federal spending to be offset with budget cuts or tax increases, a Democratic aide said. "Budgets are supposed to be about tough decisions, and there are no tough decisions in this budget," said House Minority Leader John Boehner of Ohio. Major health care reform is likely to pass this year because the special process, known as budget reconciliation, won't allow Republicans to filibuster the legislation, as was widely expected. "Any amount of savings is obviously welcome," Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, said at the time. Fiscally conservative House Democrats, known as Blue Dogs, also negotiated with Democratic leaders to cut $10 billion from the president's $540 billion request for non-defense discretionary spending.
