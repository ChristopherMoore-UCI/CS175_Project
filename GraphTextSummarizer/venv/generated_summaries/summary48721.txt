That's right, hydrangea lovers -- it's no accident that Keith Carradine wins Madonna's heart with a bunch of daisies instead of your favorite flower in the "Material Girl" video. but she prefers different types of flowers." Madonna "absolutely loathes hydrangeas," she said after she was given a huge purple one at the Venice Film Festival -- apparently not realizing her microphone was live. A video of the remark has gone viral online, with more than 1 million views on YouTube already, and it's apparently not winning her new fans -- it's getting nearly twice as many "dislikes" as "likes." She smiled thinly and thanked the fan who gave her the flower as she was promoting her movie "W.E." in Italy this week.
