"We've gotten into a configuration now on the space station where we have a lot of stuff and we don't have a lot of space to put it in," said Royce Renfrew, lead space station flight director for the mission. Discovery flew the first female shuttle pilot, the first African-American spacewalker and the first sitting member of Congress to go to space. Mission managers will meet Friday at 5 a.m. ET to re-evaluate weather conditions, NASA said. The latest launch attempt had been set for Thursday afternoon. -- Bad weather forced NASA to delay the launch of Space Shuttle Discovery by at least a day Thursday.
