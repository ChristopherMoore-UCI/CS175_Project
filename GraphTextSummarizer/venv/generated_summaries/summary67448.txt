Tamir's mother, Samaria Rice, has said she didn't allow her son to play with toy guns, and one of his friends gave the air gun to him. Within two seconds of exiting the car, Officer Timothy Loehmann shot Tamir, and the boy died the next day, police say. Cleveland cop who shot Rice slammed for 'immaturity' in past job Rice was pointing a pellet gun at people outside the recreation center before he was shot, police say. The death of Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old boy who was shot last month by a Cleveland police officer who authorities say mistook the child's air gun for a real firearm, has been ruled a homicide, the Cuyahoga County Medical Examiner's Office said Friday. The cause of death was a "gunshot wound of the torso with injuries of major vessel, intestines and pelvis," according to paperwork provided by Christopher Harris in the medical examiner's communications office.
