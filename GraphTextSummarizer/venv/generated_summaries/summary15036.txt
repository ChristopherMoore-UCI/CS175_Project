If you can proudly assert your love of country in a speech addressing the legacy of what he called, "America's original sin" -- slavery -- you really love this country. True love of country was in the air; and tears were in my eyes. But it got me to thinking: How do you show love of country? But love of country demands more than mere flag-waving. At the same time, when you see other countries that are doing something better than we are; when you ride a highway in a Third World country that is smoother than your local interstate; when you see a successful European pre-K program, it makes you want to work to improve on those things at home.
