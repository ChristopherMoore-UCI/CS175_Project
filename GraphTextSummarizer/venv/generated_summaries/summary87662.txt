Al Fayed has previously said that Diana was pregnant with Dodi's child at the time of the crash, although British and French police investigations into the crash have discounted this. Al Fayed claimed Paul was sober and that French investigators botched the tests, though he did not give evidence to support the claim. Al Fayed, owner of London's famed Harrods department store, began his testimony by reading a statement saying Diana told him in July 1997, the month before the crash, that she feared for her life. Al Fayed said the car belonged to paparazzo James Andanson, who did own a white Fiat Uno. "Diana suffered for 20 years from this Dracula family," Al Fayed said Monday.
