Ravi was sentenced to serve 30 days in jail, three years of probation and must complete 300 hours of community service aimed at assisting victims of bias crimes. The state's decision to appeal the sentence automatically stayed it, according to Ravi's attorney Steven Altman. -- Dharun Ravi, the former Rutgers University student convicted of bias intimidation by use of a hidden webcam, is expected to appear in court on Wednesday, one day after he apologized for his behavior and said he plans to submit to his impending jail sentence. "I accept responsibility for and regret my thoughtless, insensitive, immature, stupid and childish choices that I made on September 19, 2010, and September 21, 2010," Ravi said in a written statement on Tuesday. Middlesex County Prosecutor Bruce J. Kaplan has said Ravi's crimes warranted "more than a 30-day jail term" and called Superior Judge Glenn Berman's sentence "insufficient under the sentencing laws of this state, the facts that were determined by a jury and long-standing appellate precedent."
