The 22-year-old has not been charged with any crime, but Franklin County Prosecutor Ron O'Brien said Cordle is a suspect in the deadly crash and a grand jury will be asked to indict him for aggravated vehicular homicide. He's upset that people are calling his act of confession 'courageous' rather than focusing on the real issue: drinking and driving kills innocent people. The video was posted on a website called "because I said I would," which provides a forum for people to make promises to others. Cordle's face is blurred as he begins to tell his story about being out with friend, drinking heavily and losing control the night of June 22. The founder of the website, Alex Sheen, said Cordle reached out to him via Facebook.
