It was Dillon's life story and not his music that moved Grammy Award winning music producer Jim Tullio to invite Dillon to his Chicago studio to record the songs he wrote in prison. "In Bill Dillon's case, there was much evidence that pointed away from him having committed this crime," says Seth Miller of the Innocence Project of Florida, the group that helped secure Dillon's release. Tullio says he quickly realized that Dillon's life story might attract an audience, but his voice would turn them into fans. Dillon, like almost all the Innocence Project of Florida's 13 DNA cases, doesn't qualify for the money. At the time of his release, Dillon's time behind bars was longer than any other person exonerated in the United States, according to the Innocence Project.
