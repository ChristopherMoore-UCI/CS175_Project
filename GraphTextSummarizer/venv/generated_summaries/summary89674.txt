Most media outlets chose not to cover the event, which began with 20 minutes of announcements concerning other church matters, ANSA reported. A devout Catholic, Chirri told ANSA she tries to keep her faith separate from her work covering the Vatican, but Monday's announcement made her cry because she was upset. A reporter for ANSA, Italy's state-run news agency, Chirri was among a few reporters at what appeared to be a routine papal announcement Monday. "I told myself 'you misunderstood.'" The pope's Latin is "very easy to understand," Chirri said, but it wasn't until the announcement was repeated that the reporter filed an urgent bulletin for ANSA, which was subsequently picked up by the rest of the world. While Catholic services today are celebrated in local languages, Latin remains the official language of the Roman Catholic church.
