-- Some chose coffee, others started the day with a Irish stout, but all were in full cheer Wednesday morning as fans watched the United States team score a last-minutes goal to defeat Algeria 1-0 in World Cup competition. In open-early-morning bars, cheering evolved into pandemonium, and chants of "Landon Donovan" filled the room. But in the 91st minute, Landon Donovan knocked in a deflected ball. Fans watched the overhead screens nervously, fearing that once again the U.S. would disappoint in the World Cup. As soon as as Donovan scored, he hiked his prices from $5 to $15.
