The governing conundrum is outlined perfectly in The New York Times Upshot analysis: In order to keep their House majority, congressional Republicans don't need Hispanic votes. There's one logic that rules midterm elections--in which GOP candidates have political reasons to rail against immigration reform. And one of the biggest is whether Republicans—after more than four years out of the White House—have learned how tough it is to run the country from the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue. But if the GOP actually wants to win a presidential election, author Nate Cohn writes, "the Republicans will need a substantial number of Hispanic votes." Right now, too many voters see the GOP as just the party of stopping stuff, not inventing stuff.
