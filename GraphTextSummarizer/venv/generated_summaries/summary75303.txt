Indeed, Dr. Brigitte Widemann was calling to say that after five months of waiting, Smith's 12-year-old daughter McKenna had been accepted into a clinical trial at NIH headquarters in Bethesda, Maryland. McKenna is one of about 200 new patients, including some 30 children, who come every week to the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, to begin clinical trials. NIH doctors think it might be able to prevent benign tumors like McKenna's from growing, or at least shrink the tumors and slow down their growth. These patients are being told they will have to wait until the government starts up again to start their trials, according to NIH spokesman John Burklow. "This NIH trial is her last hope," Smith said.
