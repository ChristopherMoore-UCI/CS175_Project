The decision was announced in a message Tuesday from university President Kenneth Ruscio following discussions of concerns raised by black students about the campus environment. The original flags will be placed on rotating display at Lee Chapel Museum in a more "appropriate location" where the stories behind them can be properly told, wrote Ruscio. Ruscio also said that the regimental flags are going to be removed from Lee Chapel. In April, Ruscio said questions raised by law students were legitimate. -- Washington and Lee University cited slavery's "regrettable" role in the Virginia school's history and announced that it will remove Confederate battle flags from a chapel that serves as a major meeting place.
