Dacre Stoker has worked with Bram Stoker scholars to annotate "The Lost Journal," which also offers quirky bits of folklore from Ireland, Stoker's homeland, and insight into the inspiration for his other work. " Though Stoker died before his Count Dracula became internationally famous when Bela Lugosi played him as a suave nobleman in the 1930s film, Dacre Stoker thinks the author would be flattered by how his character has stayed relevant over the years. It's kind of incredible, but Noel was rather blasÃ© about it," laughed Dacre Stoker, Dobbs' cousin and a professor in South Carolina who has written a book about Bram Stoker. "People don't think of Bram Stoker as being romantic, but there are some very romantic, sweet moments here," Dacre Stoker said. There are funny "memos" that Stoker wrote to himself, which Dacre Stoker believes were witticisms that the author may have wanted to use at a party or a pub to seem interesting.
