"I want there to be in my country social security, better education and better medical services," said another New York Dominican voter, Johnny Hinojosa. Medina and former Dominican Republic President Hipolito Mejia were in a close race heading into election day. -- Preliminary results for Sunday's presidential election in the Dominican Republic gave former lawmaker Danilo Medina an early lead. Since the end of Mejia's term in 2004, the presidency has been held by Leonel Fernandez, of the centrist Dominican Liberation Party, the same party that Medina belongs to. The boisterous campaigns stretched from the island to New York, where there is a large population of Dominicans.
