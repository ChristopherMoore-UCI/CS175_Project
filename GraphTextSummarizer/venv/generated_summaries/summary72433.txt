" Keane has since stepped into the world of football management, with limited success, but Beckham is adamant he will not be following what is a well-trodden path for many former footballers. -- David Beckham stressed his desire to launch a new Major League Soccer franchise on Wednesday, as the former England captain revealed his passion about becoming a future club owner. "I'm not going to sit here and be negative about a man who gave me a chance to play for my boyhood team, who I always dreamed of playing for," said Beckham, who won six Premier League titles and one Uefa Champions League under Ferguson. Major League Soccer currently has 19 teams, and a 20th club -- New York City FC -- is set to launch in 2015. Images of his final game form part of Beckham's new book, one that takes a pictorial journey through his two decades in the game - even if a whole new chapter looks set to be needed soon.
