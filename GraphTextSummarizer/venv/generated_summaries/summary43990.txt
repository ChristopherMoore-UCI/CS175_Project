Finding 'new normal' after school shooting Days after the attack, prosecutor David Joyce said Lane admitted taking a .22-caliber gun and a knife into school that morning and firing 10 rounds, choosing his victims randomly. Lane sat quietly during Friday's brief proceedings, answering a few questions from Geauga County Judge Forrest Burt. "Justice for them would be to see Mr. Lane detained for an extended period of time. Burt ordered Lane to a juvenile detention center until June 18, when he will be transferred to the Geauga County Jail. " Lane was indicted on six charges: three counts of aggravated murder, two counts of attempted aggravated murder and felonious assault.
