-- Actress Eva Mendes volunteers regularly with The Art of Elysium, an organization that enables actors, artists and musicians to share their talents with children who are battling serious medical conditions. Brown: Moving onto CNN Heroes, you were a presenter at "CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute" last year. Mendes recently sat down to talk to CNN producer Quinn Brown about CNN Heroes and her philanthropy. Quinn Brown: What inspired you to get involved with The Art of Elysium? Eva Mendes: I'm a sucker for kids, and I also know the importance of art and what it can do to someone's life. So what I choose to do with that light is shine it on other things that are important, not just what I'm wearing.
