As well as six team titles, Gerevich also won individual gold in London in 1948, improving on his bronze in 1936, and he completed the full set of medals by claiming silver in Helsinki in 1952. Undeterred, Gerevich challenged the entire Hungarian team and beat them all -- going on to collect the seventh gold medal of his illustrious career. Gerevich remains the only competitor to win the same Olympic event six times, and he is the only person to win gold medals at six editions of the Games. The 1956 Games in Melbourne took place against the backdrop of the Hungarian uprising against Communist rule and its subsequent brutal suppression by the Soviet Union. Despite the distraction -- there was confusion over whether the Hungarian team should compete under the communist flag or the flag of Imre Nagy's short-lived government -- Gerevich once again led his team to victory, although by now he had slipped to fifth in the individual event.
