He was shot by officers Friday and was in critical condition at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center Sunday. So Ciancia was eventually shot multiple times in the chest by airport police officers. Perhaps 45 minutes after Ciancia left for the airport, officers arrived at his apartment, said Rep. Michael McCaul, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee. A note found on Ciancia indicated he wanted to kill TSA employees to "instill fear into their traitorous minds," FBI Special Agent in Charge David Bowdich said. Cummings, in turn, called Los Angeles police and asked them to check on Ciancia.
