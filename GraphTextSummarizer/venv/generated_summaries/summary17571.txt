Such results suggest there may be some higher processing of information going on, and that areas of the brain important for processing complex stimuli are still functioning, said Dr. Keith L. Black, chairman and professor in the department of neurosurgery at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, who is not involved in Sharon's care. The brain response for a family member's voice was in "the correct location" for when a cognitively normal person hears familiar people speaking, said Dr. Ilan Shelef, head of Medical Imaging at Soroka University Medical Center, who was involved in the fMRI tests but is not Sharon's attending physician. There is a continuum between brain death and normal awareness that patients such as Sharon fall into, Black said. Sharon, 84, also showed distinct brain activity patterns when his family members spoke to him, compared to when their voices were distorted so they were no longer familiar and sounded like gibberish. Doctors say they have observed "significant brain activity" in former Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon.
