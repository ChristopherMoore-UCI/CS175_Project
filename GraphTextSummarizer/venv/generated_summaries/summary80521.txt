He signed artists such as Snoop Doggy Dogg (since then known as Snoop Dogg and Snoop Lion) and Tupac Shakur, raising the profile of West Coast rap in the process. Knight's signing of controversial rapper Tupac Shakur in the mid-'90s further increased the profiles of both Knight and his company in the hip-hop game. After being questioned by detectives, Knight was booked and later transferred to the Twin Towers Correctional Facility in downtown Los Angeles, according to jail records. But with his imposing physique and reputation for not being averse to violence, Knight also found himself at the center of a feud between East Coast and West Coast rappers. That prison time -- along with Shakur's death, feuds between Knight and a number of rappers and desertions by Dr. Dre, Snoop and others -- contributed to the label's bankruptcy in 2006.
