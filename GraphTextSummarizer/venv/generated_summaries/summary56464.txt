-- A few days ago, controversy erupted when news broke that Google and other online advertising companies bypassed privacy protections in order to track users of Apple's Safari web browser and iOS mobile devices. Jonathan Mayer, the researcher who described how these cookies exploited the Safari bug, concluded his disclosure by calling privacy protections a "cat and mouse game" or "arms race" with advertising companies. I choose to use Gmail, but that doesn't mean I expect Google to undo other privacy choices I've made in order to make social sharing more convenient. Google and other advertising networks chose to circumvent built-in privacy technologies that were designed to prevent the very thing they were trying to do. Google knows too much about you Google stopped using the offending technique after it was reported, although Microsoft is now reporting that Google is using a similar technique to bypass protections in Internet Explorer 9.
