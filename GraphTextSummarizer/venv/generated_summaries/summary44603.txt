Though the Atlantic-Pacific subway station is the first in New York for which naming rights have been sold, across the country, there have been several cases of public transportation systems using naming rights to increase revenue. " Renaming the Atlantic-Pacific Station is tied to the construction of Barclays Center, the new sports arena for the National Basketball Association's New Jersey Nets. One straphanger said, "A London Bank shouldn't be the name of this train station; it's something that belongs to the public domain." Another said, "It's just everywhere we go, everything we do, it's just branding, branding, branding. In an effort to bridge the authority's $1 billion deficit, the transit giant that oversees the operation of the city's subways, buses and rail lines wants to follow the Barclays example with stations throughout the system. Barclays is paying developer Forest City Ratner $300 million for naming rights to this arena.
