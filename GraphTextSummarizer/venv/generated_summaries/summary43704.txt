McNutt said 90% of air freight from Asia to Europe and North America flies over Alaska air space, and hundreds of flights -- including more than 20,000 passengers -- fly through Anchorage's air space daily. But the volcanic activity could heighten and affect air travel, said Steve McNutt, a scientist at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. The volcano, also known as Mount Cleveland, is on the Aleutian Islands, southwest of mainland Alaska. -- Officials are monitoring a remote Alaska volcano that could launch an ash cloud, potentially threatening intercontinental flights. Last year, volcanic ash spewing from Iceland's Grimsvotn volcano forced the cancellation of hundreds of flights across Europe.
