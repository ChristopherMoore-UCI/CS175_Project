Former first lady Barbara Bush had heart surgery Wednesday in Houston, Texas. Jean Becker, chief of staff for former President George H.W. Bush, said that Barbara Bush, 83, was "fine" following the surgery. " Wednesday's surgery was not related to surgery she had in November for a perforated ulcer. "We, of course, naively wanted to keep it quiet -- Mrs. Bush did," Becker said Wednesday night.
