At 36 years old, Christina was diagnosed with breast cancer. Days after her diagnosis, Christina says she reached out to family and friends, including Melissa Etheridge, a Grammy winner and breast cancer survivor. "I am a 36-year-old person with breast cancer, and not many people know that that happens to women my age or women in their 20s," she says. Christina says she will fight for women to have access to MRIs and genetic testing, which many insurance companies won't pay for. As the daughter of a breast cancer survivor, Christina says she's been vigilant about getting regular mammograms since she was 30 years old.
