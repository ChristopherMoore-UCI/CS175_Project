The e-mail was sent to thousands of prospective students who had applied for early admission to New York's Fordham University, said Bob Howe, senior director of communications for Fordham. However, 2,500 of those newly accepted-to-Fordham students received congratulations in a financial aid related e-mail, which usually comes after a proper acceptance letter, Fordham University said in a statement. The inaccurate e-mail was mistakenly sent by a member of Student Aid Services, a third-party company that serves as an undergraduate admission consultant to Fordham, said Mary Fallon, a Communications Consultant for Student Aid Services. -- More than two-thousand college-bound students applying to Fordham University received an e-mail Wednesday night informing them they had been accepted to the school, when in fact their status was still unresolved Fordham sent a correction e-mail later Wednesday evening and all applicants were able to check their admission status online by midday Thursday, according to the statement.
