A coast guard spokesman later said the two -- who included the ship's second officer -- were in "reasonable condition" after the helicopter had carried them to the military base. "Today at roughly 16:45 GMT (11:45 a.m. ET), a decision was made by the coast guard to call off the search and rescue mission for the five remaining missing sailors in the Irish Sea," press officer Jo Groenenberg told CNN. The coast guard dispatched two helicopters, including one from RAF Valley base, where Prince William is a search-and-rescue pilot. A Ministry of Defence spokesman earlier confirmed to CNN that Prince William was the co-pilot of the helicopter that plucked the two rescued sailors from a life raft. After a daylong search in rough seas, the British coast guard ended the effort to find the five missing men as darkness fell, according to a coast guard press officer.
