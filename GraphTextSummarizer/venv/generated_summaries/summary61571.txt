And there are few people who are likely to attract more attention than the youngest of the three, 36-year-old Amal Alamuddin, who recently became Mrs. George Clooney after marrying the Hollywood star in Venice. Since the excavation began in August, hundreds of tourists and local day-trippers have flocked to Amphipolis hoping to catch a glimpse of the site, while local media are filled with lengthy reports of the archaeologists progress. The government is warning against unfounded reports but at the same time continues fueling public interest, with almost daily reports from Amphipolis on state broadcaster Nerit. Responding to a question by a Greek reporter, he said, "I think you have a very good case to make about your artifacts." Alamuddin has been involved in the issue since 2011, yet her high-profile visit, her first public viewing since her marriage with Clooney, is expected to further raise international interest in Greece's antiquity. An imposing ancient floor mosaic depicting a man driving a chariot drawn by horses and led by the Greek messenger god Hermes is the latest in a series of remarkable finds archaeologists have unearthed in the largest ancient tomb found in Greece, at Amphipolis in the country's north.
