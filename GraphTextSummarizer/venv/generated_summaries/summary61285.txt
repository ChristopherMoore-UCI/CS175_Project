Cuban officials have accused him of distributing illegal satellite equipment to dissidents to help them connect to the internet. -- For years, small groups of Cuban dissidents have taken their demands to the streets, calling for political freedom as they get pushed around and shouted down by swarms of government supporters. As a result, the government has said it cannot offer internet access to the broader population, lacking the money to create the necessary infrastructure to support it. Cuba currently accesses the internet via expensive satellite connections. Recent figures show an estimated 1.6 million people there are internet users, out of a population of 11.2 million.
