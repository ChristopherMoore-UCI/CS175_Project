The last time a new glassfrog was found in Costa Rica was back in 1973, according to the Costa Rican Amphibian Research Center. A newly discovered species of glassfrog looks an awful lot like the famous Muppet. "Costa Rica is known to have 14 glassfrogs inhabiting its tiny national territory!" But the name's not nearly so catchy as its famous counterpart:  Hyalinobatrachium dianae, or Diane's bare-hearted glassfrog. Scientists found the species on the Caribbean slopes of Costa Rica.
