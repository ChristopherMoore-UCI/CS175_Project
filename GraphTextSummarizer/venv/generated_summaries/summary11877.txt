Getting the threat of jail time behind her could be important for Lohan's acting career, considering she's been cast in the "Gotti" movie, which is set for production in October. Lohan was just weeks away from being free from supervised probation stemming from two drunk driving convictions in 2007 when she was charged with felony grand theft. She checked into the Betty Ford Clinic only after another judge ordered her to jail for a month after finding she violated probation with a failed drug test. Los Angeles Deputy District Attorney Danette Meyers was insisting she go to jail at least for several months. But Sautner could have the final word, insisting on a minimum amount of jail time for Lohan, he said.
