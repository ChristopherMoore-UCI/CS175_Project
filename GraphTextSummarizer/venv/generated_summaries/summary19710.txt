" Graphic e-mails read at trial Court records show that Valle got the addresses of his alleged targets by sending them a police charity card that he claimed would "get (them) out of a minor traffic violation" if they are pulled over by police. -- New York police officer Gilberto Valle conspired to kidnap women, who prosecutors argued he planned to rape, torture, cook and eat, a federal jury decided Tuesday. Valle, a six year NYPD veteran, planned to kidnap three women during the week of February 20, 2012, prosecutors said, pointing to some of the e-mails and chats. He communicated online with three co-conspirators, including a man identified as "Moody Blues" or "Chris Collins" or "meatmarketman," who Valle met on the Dark Fetish Network, prosecutors said. The database, which Valle was trained to use and had access to as a cop, helped him research potential victims, prosecutors said.
