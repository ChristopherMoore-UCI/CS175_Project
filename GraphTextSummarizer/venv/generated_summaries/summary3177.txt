"It was a privilege for us to witness a young, carefree racer blossom into a true champion and a devoted family man," said one of Wheldon's managers, Mickey Ryan. Drivers Brian Herta, Tony Kanaan and Dario Franchitti -- Wheldon's former teammates -- recalled messing Wheldon's locker up on purpose once and then waiting for him before a run, as he could not come out and drive unless the locker was straightened. It also had additional safety features, testament to Wheldon's commitment to improving the sport and increasing safety for drivers, he said. Featured on stage beside the speakers Sunday was a car Bernard said Wheldon had been testing. Wheldon's family was in attendance.
