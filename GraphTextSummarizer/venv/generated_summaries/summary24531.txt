London's Daily Mail scored an interview with the son of suspect Ariel Castro, plus exclusive photos of Castro in the frame house where women were held. "He spoke with us because he wanted to have his story represented." Anthony Castro told the Mail in the interview that his father padlocked the doors leading to the basement, attic and garage where Amanda Berry and two other women were allegedly kept, never allowing his family inside. Since the British tabloids are known for paying for information, how did the Mail obtain from Anthony Castro what hordes of American journalists could not? Arias was soon slotted into the Amanda Knox/Casey Anthony category of attractive white women in trouble. "We did not pay him either for the interview or for the photos," Daily Mail reporter Michael Zennie told me.
