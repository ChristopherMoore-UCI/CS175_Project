"There are spies among our revolutionaries who send our coordinates to the snipers and Gadhafi loyalists firing from inside Bani Walid, and the proof is that their attacks have been precisely targeted," said Emad Ziglam, a field commander of the Tripoli rebels fighting outside Bani Walid. Meanwhile, battles are still raging in Sirte and Bani Walid; NATO estimates that 200,000 of Libya's 6 million people are still under threat from Gadhafi's supporters. Ousted Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi is believed to be hiding out near the western town of Ghadamis under the protection of Tuareg fighters, an interim government military spokesman told CNN Tuesday. Near Bani Walid's front line, senior National Transitional Council field commander Daou Al-Salhine Al Jadak was killed Tuesday, said Abdulla Kenshill, a spokesman in Bani Walid. Tuareg tribesmen have helped Gadhafi loyalists escape Libya across the expanses of the Sahel.
