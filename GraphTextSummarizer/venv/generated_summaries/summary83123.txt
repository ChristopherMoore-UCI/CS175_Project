Shinseki says 'situation can be fixed,' but not by him Earlier Friday, Shinseki announced steps to address the VA shortcomings, including removing senior leaders in the Phoenix VA medical system, eliminating performance awards for VA leaders in 2014 and wait times as a metric for evaluations and accelerating care to veterans. Shinseki's resignation concluded a firestorm of criticism and growing calls for him to step down following revelations of sometimes deadly delays for veterans waiting for care at VA hospitals, allegations exposed by CNN in a series of exclusive reports. "But as Ric Shinseki himself indicated, there is a need for a change in culture within the VHA, and perhaps the VHA as a whole -- or the VA as a whole that makes sure that bad news gets surfaced quickly so that things can be fixed." Read Obama's statement Breaking open the scandal Secret VA waits lists alleged in Phoenix Problems in the VA system date back decades, but CNN's reporting of long waits at VA hospitals brought the issue into national focus at the end of 2013. "The VA administrators got way too focused on having good numbers and they forgot the most important mandate, the reason we all work at the VA -- to take care of veterans, to save their lives and give them good medical care," Dr. Sam Foote said. There also have been calls for a criminal investigation into fraudulent record-keeping to cover up delays at VA hospitals.
