RFA also produces bags with bigger batteries for about $40 more. " "Powerbag sources the highest quality cells and parts for the batteries," a Ful spokesman wrote in a reply to my worried e-mail. There are several other travel bags on the market that have batteries inside, including ones that can be charged by sunlight using solar panels on the exterior. On several instances during my tests, the bag proved useful on long trips or when traveling to conferences where I'm constantly making calls or doing e-mail. The Powerbag is able to charge an iPad, which is nice because many alarm clocks tailored to iPods and iPhones cannot.
