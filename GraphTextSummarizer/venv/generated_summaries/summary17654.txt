Katherine Jackson, who sat through four days of disturbing testimony in the trial of the doctor charged in her son's death, agreed with the Michael Jackson estate and Cirque du Soleil just this past week to attend the opening performance this weekend, according to a source close to the Jackson family. -- Michael Jackson's mother and his three children will be immersed in the pop icon's music, dance and imagery as they attend the premiere of Cirque du Soleil's "Michael Jackson: The Immortal World Tour" in Montreal, Canada, Sunday. With several of Michael Jackson's brothers and sisters also traveling to the Wales concert, most of the Jackson family's eight seats in Dr. Conrad Murray's trial will likely go empty until next week. The agreement is a sign Katherine Jackson and the men who now control her son's estate as executors have reached an understanding that should ease the tensions that erupted in probate court soon after Michael Jackson's death in 2009, the source said. The trip, which includes Prince, Paris and Blanket Jackson, will not end until October 9 when they return to Los Angeles following the Michael Forever Tribute show in Cardiff, Wales, next Saturday, the source said.
