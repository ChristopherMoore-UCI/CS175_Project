WikiLeaks, which publishes secret documents, downplayed the defector's role in the organization, saying he was "a spokesperson for WikiLeaks in Germany at various times." -- WikiLeaks editor Julian Assange went from being "imaginative, energetic (and) brilliant" to a "paranoid, power-hungry, megalomaniac," a former colleague charges in a new book out Thursday. Assange also has "a very free and easy relationship with the truth," Daniel Domscheit-Berg claims in the book, "Inside WikiLeaks. Last September, Domscheit-Berg left WikiLeaks, citing shortcomings and clashes with Assange. " Domscheit-Berg also says he took about 3,000-3,500 documents when he left WikiLeaks, claiming it would be "irresponsible" to leave them with Assange.
