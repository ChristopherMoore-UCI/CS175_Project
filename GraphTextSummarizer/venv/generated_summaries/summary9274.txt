The trade, of course, would end if we could figure out how to curb the demand for pangolin in Vietnam and China, the two main consumer countries for pangolin products. The good folks at Education for Nature Vietnam, based in Hanoi, are trying to do just that -- and they will produce a pangolin-focused public service announcement to air on television in Vietnam if they can raise $5,000 for the effort. A portion of the book's proceeds go the Carnivore and Pangolin Conservation Program at Cuc Phuong National Park in Vietnam, which rescues pangolins and prepares them for release back into the wild. In Vietnam, it wasn't hard at all for me to find pangolin scales and meat for sale. Help change their minds by donating to these CNN-vetted groups that are working to help stop the pangolin trade and are funding research to learn more about these secretive animals.
