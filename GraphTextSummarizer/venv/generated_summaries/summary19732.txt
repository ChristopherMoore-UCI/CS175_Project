But what stands out to me most about it today is that what made it possible is that we had in iReport -- both at CNN and in the community at large -- an extraordinarily caring, dedicated and kind group of people who'd learned over the years how to work together to make something much bigger than any of them could do on their own. -- Once upon a time, in a dark corner of CNN's Atlanta headquarters, there was a messy pile of VHS tapes covered in remnants of packing tape. It's certainly the heart of the Open Story approach CNN has used to bring iReporters and CNNers together on stories such as this year's earthquake in Japan and flooding along the Mississippi River. And that's inviting people in to be part of stories that matter. And at CNN, we'd learned to invite people into our process in real-time, in a spirit of collaboration and exchange and work that needed doing.
