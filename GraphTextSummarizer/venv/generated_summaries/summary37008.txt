In Caracas, supporters of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez gathered around the presidential palace to listen to him speak on what is known there as "National Democracy Day." " Marches were also planned in various cities around the world to declare that "the current Venezuelan regime is a dictatorship both legally and politically," according to organizer Un Mundo Sin Mordaza. "Every day, there will be more democracy in Venezuela -- this democracy that gives more power to the people," Chavez said, as reported by the state-run AVN news agency. January 23 marks the anniversary of the overthrow of former Venezuelan dictator Gen. Marcos Perez Jimenez. Opponents of Chavez have sharply criticized last month's decision by Venezuela's lame-duck National Assembly granting him the power to pass laws by decree for 18 months.
