-- Sen. Rand Paul returns to New Hampshire next week, making his third visit to the first-in-the-nation primary state as he prepares for a possible presidential run in 2016. The next morning Paul plans to attend a New Hampshire GOP breakfast with Sen. Kelly Ayotte, a fellow first-term senator. He previously went there in May 2013 for an event with Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus. The Kentucky Republican will appear at a Manchester event on September 11 that's hosted by Generation Opportunity, a libertarian-minded advocacy group for millennials. The senator's upcoming trip was first reported by Politico.
