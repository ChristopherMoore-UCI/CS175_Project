" Israeli airstrikes continued pounding targets in Hamas-ruled Gaza Sunday, killing at least 225 and injuring 400, in what Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak said was a response to escalating rocket attacks against southern Israel. Hamdan also denied accusations that Hamas had provoked Israel attacks by violating the cease-fire with rocket attacks. Israeli military officials accused Hamas militants of firing more than 65 rockets into southern Israel on Wednesday, and the Israeli air force said it killed a Hamas militant whom it accused of helping launch the rockets against Israel. An Israeli woman was killed Saturday when a rocket fired from Gaza hit a house in Netivot in southern Israel, about six miles east of Gaza, Israeli police spokesman Mickey Rosenfeld said. -- A Palestinian envoy called on the United Nations to condemn the deadly violence in Gaza as Israeli airstrikes on Hamas militants entered a second day Sunday.
