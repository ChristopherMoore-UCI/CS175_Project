-- Italian champions AC Milan climbed to the top of Serie A for the first time this season on Friday with a 2-0 win over 10-man Genoa that was delayed for 10 minutes due to supporters fighting outside the stadium. In-form Swiss striker Eren Derdiyok headed his sixth goal this season in the 10th minute, while Sidney Sam lobbed goalkeeper Tom Starke with 11 minutes to play to keep Leverkusen unbeaten in five matches in all competitions -- and 10th-placed Hoffenheim winless in as many matches. Meanwhile, Bayer Leverkusen moved up to sixth place in Germany's Bundesliga with a 2-0 win at home to Hoffenheim on Friday. If that match ends in a draw, third-placed Bayern Munich can return to the top with a draw or better at home to Werder Bremen. Third-placed Udinese could join Milan on 27 points with victory away to the Rossoneri's city rivals Internazionale on Saturday.
