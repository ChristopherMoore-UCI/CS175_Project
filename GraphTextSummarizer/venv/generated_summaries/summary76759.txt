Two senators involved in security issues - Republican Susan Collins of Maine and independent Joe Lieberman of Connecticut - also praised Pistole as a sound choice. " Attorney General Eric Holder and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano immediately endorsed Pistole, calling him uniquely qualified for the job that involves counter-terrorism efforts. Napolitano's statement said that if confirmed by the Senate, Pistole would oversee the Homeland Security Department's "ongoing efforts to secure the nation's aviation networks, railroads, ports and mass transit systems, security operations for 450 federalized airports throughout the nation, and the Federal Air Marshal Service." At that time, the head of the 25,000-member Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, Jon Adler, said the TSA "cannot continue to operate on autopilot." Adler said his organization fully supports Pistole's nomination. Deputy Director Pistole possesses the necessary skill set to lead TSA forward from a position of strength."
