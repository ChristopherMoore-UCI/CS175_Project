-- FIFA have permitted England's soccer players to wear a poppy symbol to honor the country's war dead during Saturday's international friendly with Spain after interventions from the British Prime Minister David Cameron and Prince William. The FA welcomes FIFA's decision and thanks them for agreeing to this." FIFA had initially stood firm on their ban, stating it was applied globally to prevent shirts being used to commemorate national events or to convey political messages. FIFA had initially forbidden the England national team from wearing the symbol on their shirts as it bans political, religious or commercial messages on team strips. But after Clarence House released a statement in which they said Prince William was "dismayed" by the decision, and David Cameron told Britain's parliament the ban was "outrageous" FIFA relented. I hope Fifa will reconsider." Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, wrote to FIFA in his role as president of the FA and asked for "an exception in this special circumstance."
