Sarsak is protesting Israel's controversial policy of "illegal combatant" -- also known as administrative detention -- which allows Israeli authorities to detain Palestinians indefinitely. Anat Litvin, the director of prisoners and detainees for Physicians for Human Rights-Israel, told CNN that "Sarsak is the longest Palestinian on hunger strike, and we are afraid that the medical center of the Israeli prison service is not the right place for him to be, because they are not able to give him the proper treatment, especially if something happens in his condition while on hunger strike. Entering the 80th day of a hunger strike Wednesday, former Palestinian national football player Mahmoud Sarsak said he will continue until he is released from the Israeli prison where he has been held without charge since July 2009. A month ago, most of the 1,650 Palestinian prisoners on a hunger strike against administrative detention ended their protest after an Egyptian-mediated agreement between Israeli and Palestinian authorities to improve prison conditions. The report also alleges torture and ill treatment during interrogations of Palestinian prisoners, especially those held under administrative detention.
