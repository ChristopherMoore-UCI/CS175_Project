The 39-year-old Wong is the richest person in mainland China, worth an estimated $6.3 billion, according to the 2008 China Rich List, which is compiled by the Hurun Institute. Trading in a Chinese electrical appliances company was halted Monday after reports that its chairman -- the richest man in mainland China -- is under investigation on charges of stock market manipulation, the company said. The Beijing News reported that Wong is under police investigation for stock market manipulation, according to the state-run China Daily newspaper. Police declined to comment on the report, China Daily said. It also said it "has not received any notice or legal documents in connection with the allegations from any regulatory, governmental or judicial authority in the People's Republic of China."
