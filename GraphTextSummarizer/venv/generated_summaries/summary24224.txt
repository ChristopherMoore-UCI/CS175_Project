The device has a sensor which learns the rider's individual style, and also anticipates aspects of the ride ahead, including road conditions and carbon monoxide levels. To combat the problem, a physics student from Brighton University, in England, invented Blaze, a front-mounted lamp that projects a green laser image five meters in front of a bicycle to let other road users know it is coming. According to Hollywood's many depictions of the future, we should all be making our travels via flying car or hover board. As a mode of transportation, bikes are about as environmentally friendly as it gets. The "Jedi bike" floats with the help of ducted fans, and is fairly low-altitude (soaring up to a maximum 15 feet -- 4.6 meters).
