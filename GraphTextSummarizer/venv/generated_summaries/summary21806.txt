-- Air carriers are watching the situation at Japan's Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant closely, making contingency plans and routing adjustments to keep operations running smoothly and protect passengers and crew from radiation risks. Mayer and Shankland said government security officials routinely scan U.S. airliners for radiation as part of normal operations. Representatives from the Allied Pilots Association, the union that represents American Airlines pilots, said its members, flight attendant union members and others are working closely with American Airlines management to make contingency plans should the situation at the reactors deteriorate. Since Sunday, the airline has been scanning aircraft returning from Japan for radiation. On Wednesday afternoon, U.S. Customs and Border Protection said it was monitoring the situation in Japan carefully.
