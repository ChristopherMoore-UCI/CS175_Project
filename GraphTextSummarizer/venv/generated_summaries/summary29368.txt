A federal judge on Wednesday denied a request to push back the trial of alleged Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who'd requested a delay after last week's terrorist attacks in France. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was later charged with 30 federal counts, including using and conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction resulting in death and malicious destruction of property by means of an explosive device resulting in death. A dramatic manhunt ensued that culminated four days later with the death of suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, and the capture hours later of his brother Dzhokhar, who's now 21. " "It will take time for Boston-area residents ... to come to a reasoned evaluation of what, if anything, the events in Paris signify about the surviving alleged perpetrator of the Boston Marathon bombing," Tsarnaev's defense team argued. "This measure would allow some time for the extraordinary prejudice flowing from these events -- and the comparison of those events to those at issue in this case -- to diminish," the lawyers wrote, noting how media outlets such as CNN, USA Today and the Boston Herald tied these attacks to the Boston Marathon bombings.
