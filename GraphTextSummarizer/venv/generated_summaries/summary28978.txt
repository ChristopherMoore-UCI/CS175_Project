Ticketmaster's practice of stacking "convenience fees" onto purchases inflated ticket prices and drew fan resentment. Ticketmaster, which has long dominated ticket sales, is reportedly in merger talks with Live Nation, the world's largest concert promoter, which just recently began selling its own tickets. "They're locking up a whole lot of the revenue streams for live music, and that is really the most consistent and profitable part of the music business right now." Ticketmaster, long a target of fan and artist criticism, drew Springsteen's ire this week when it routed some of his fans trying to buy tickets to his show in New Jersey to a "secondary site" where they were charged far more than face value. Ticketmaster pioneered online ticket sales, a modern convenience that did away with long lines at the box office. Tickets on that site -- which Ticketmaster owns -- cost between $200 and $5,000, while face value starts at $54.
