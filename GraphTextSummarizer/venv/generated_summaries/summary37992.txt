Political activist wants K2 banned "Synthetic drugs and herbal drug products like Spice and K2 are not made in a controlled environment and thus you are playing Russian roulette when it comes to these types of products," said Dawn Dearden, a spokeswoman for the DEA, which first began receiving reports about abuse of the substance last year. Sold in various flavors in 3-gram bags, the product consists of herbs that are sprayed with synthetic substances that mimic THC, the high-causing natural chemical found in marijuana. She says the agency is in "the preliminary stages of determining whether or not some or all of (synthetic substances) need to be controlled." Around the center, Lopez said his employees have begun referring to the substance as "Scary Spice." Earlier this month, Kansas became the first state to ban synthetic marijuana.
