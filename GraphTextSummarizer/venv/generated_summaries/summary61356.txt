"So on paper, you see increasing demand from China for natural resources, but this is displacing demand from other countries -- from South Korea and Japan to China." But one China economics watcher says the world "shouldn't be too worried" and that demand for food -- and for natural resources from oil to iron ore -- may eventually see decreased demand. Soybeans: Stuff of oil, tofu and animal feed "On a per capita basis, China has half the arable land and a third to a quarter of the water than the global average," says Merritt Cluff of the Food and Agriculture Organization in Rome. Pork: '470 million pigs in China' Besides soybeans, China is the world's biggest consumer of pork products eating "more pig products than the rest of the world combined," says Cluff. While China is estimated to have raised 470 million pigs in 2012, a number that increased about 1.5% each year over the last decade according to FAO, that has not been enough to keep up with demand.
