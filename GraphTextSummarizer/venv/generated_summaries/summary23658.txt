Even when Fidel Castro underwent intestinal surgery in 2006 and Raúl Castro became Cuba's acting president, Raúl didn't make a public appearance for two weeks, until after photos assured the country that Fidel was alive. Still, in many ways, Raúl Castro is seen as more of a hard-liner than Fidel Castro. "No one will ever again have as much authority as Fidel Castro has had, because of who he is, because he made a true revolution," 76-year-old Raúl Castro said. Always together Fidel and Raúl Castro planned the Cuban revolution together. Raúl Castro has a reputation for ruthlessness but pushed for a move toward more capitalism in Cuba.
