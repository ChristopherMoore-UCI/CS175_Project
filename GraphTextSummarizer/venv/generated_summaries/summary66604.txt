Fear of judgment and discrimination force people diagnosed with HIV or AIDS to live in isolation. For me, my therapist showed me why mental health care was as important in treating HIV as a knowledgeable, supportive medical doctor. The new foundation is dedicated to providing access to mental and other health services for American women with HIV while respecting their need for privacy. I had little background in dealing with mental illness, HIV and even less experience in how to get help. For women like me -- heterosexual, vibrant, who may have contracted HIV through their male partner -- there needs to be more resources available to help us deal with the mental landmines that this situation creates.
