I try to help women and girls in Congo go to school, visit the doctor and earn money so they can take care of themselves and their families. Just as men here have the power to make life very difficult for girls and women, they also have the power to support the girls and women around them. Much of the time, men don't even listen to what women and girls have to say about how the family money is spent. To help women and girls, I spend much of my time speaking with and educating men. But you should not take rights away from girls or women.
