After separate meetings with Thein Sein and Suu Kyi in Myanmar on Friday, Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain said sanctions on the country should be suspended, rather than lifted entirely, to encourage further progress in democracy and human rights. -- Australia said Monday that it was relaxing sanctions on Myanmar, responding to the Southeast Asian country's political reforms by significantly reducing the number of government officials and lawmakers subject to travel restrictions. The number of people in Myanmar subject to financial sanctions and travel restrictions by Australia will drop to about 130 from 392, the Australian statement said. Carr and the trade minister, Craig Emerson, highlighted the recent release of hundreds of political prisoners, the pursuit of peace deals with ethnic groups and improved laws on freedom of expression, labor rights and political participation. The announcement by Australia follows moves by a number of Western countries to reward recent efforts by the Myanmar president, Thein Sein, and his government to bring about change in the country, including holding by-elections earlier this month in which opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi's party won dozens of seats.
