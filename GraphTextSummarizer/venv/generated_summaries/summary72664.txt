South Africa beat Kenya 2-0 thanks to first-half goals from Davide Somma and Steven Pienaar, while Morocco defeated Niger 3-0 and Nigeria edged Sierra Leone 2-1. The Real Madrid striker netted the only goal from close range nine minutes into the second half of the rematch of the 1998 World Cup final at the same venue -- which France won 3-0. The duo have matched each other almost goal for goal this season in La Liga, and Messi has the upper hand with Barcelona seven points clear and resounding 5-0 victors in the opening "Clasico" clash between the two clubs. Veteran striker Miroslav Klose opened the scoring in the 16th minute after fine build-up play by Mesut Ozil and Thomas Muller, beating recalled former captain Gianluigi Buffon in goal. And the two-time world player of the year was involved in Argentina's 14th-minute opener as he cut in from the right in trademark fashion to set up Real winger Di Maria.
