-- Real Madrid midfielder Kaka is facing a spell of up to four months on the sidelines after undergoing knee surgery, the Spanish club have confirmed. Real Madrid begin their quest to deny Barcelona a third straight Spanish title away to Mallorca on August 29. He joined Real Madrid from Italian giants AC Milan in June 2009 for a then world record fee of $88 million but only made 22 appearances as his new club finished second to champions Barcelona. The player is expected to miss three to four months." Cristiano Ronaldo scored the winner as Real Madrid beat Mexican side Club America 3-2 on their warm up tour of the U.S. and afterwards Mourinho told reporters the club could cope in Kaka's absence. Kaka had a disappointing World Cup with his country, as they were knocked out in the quarterfinal by Netherlands, and was troubled by a groin injury during the tournament in South Africa.
