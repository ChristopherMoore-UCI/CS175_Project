How Real Madrid won They made a brave fist of it, Real goalkeeper Diego Lopez having to produce fine saves from Michael Carrick, Robin van Persie and Nemanja Vidic Wayne Rooney, surprisingly left out of the United starting line up, also hooked a chance over, but at the other end fellow substitute Kaka rattled the home woodwork. Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson charged down from his touchline seat to protest and as Nani eventually parted the field he was given a consolation pat by Real manager Jose Mourinho. -- Cristiano Ronaldo scored the winner as Real Madrid beat 10-man Manchester United 2-1 Tuesday to reach the quarterfinals of the Champions League 3-2 on aggregate after a pulsating match which turned on the controversial dismissal of Nani just before the hour mark. Ferguson refused to attend the post-game press conference, because he had been left "very distraught" by Nani's dismissal, according to his assistant Mike Phelan. Ronaldo had received a warm welcome from home fans on his return to Old Trafford, while Ferguson sprang a surprise with the omission of Rooney, giving starts to 39-year-old Ryan Giggs, playing his 1,000th game for club and country, Nani and Danny Welbeck.
