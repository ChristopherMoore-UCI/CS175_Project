-- The disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 has propelled Mitchell Casado into the realm of aviation analyst celebrity -- and no one is more uncomfortable with that than Casado. His parents helped him get his private pilot's license, but a commercial license proved much more expensive because it required flight school and significant flying time. At school he'd get in trouble for reading flying magazines tucked inside his textbooks. What's unique about the place is it's open to the public, so if you've ever fantasized about taking off from Los Angeles International or landing at Toronto Pearson, or even just doing touch-and-gos at Paris' Charles de Gaulle, Casado is the guy you want in the left seat. Today, in addition to his multi-engine license, he has earned his seaplane rating, flown cargo routes and flown as a "bush pilot" in Canada and elsewhere.
