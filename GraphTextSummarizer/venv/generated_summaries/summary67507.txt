The paper reported that, writing in a class yearbook aged 10, Emwazi told of his love for pop group S Club 7, The Simpsons, the shoot-'em-up computer game Duke Nukem and -- like so many other British children -- listed his favourite food as chips. Londoner Matt Seton wrote on Twitter that he went to school with Emwazi: "He was a 12 year old kid ... Asim Qureshi, research director of CAGE, insists that the Mohammed Emwazi he knew was "very kind, extremely gentle, [a] humble individual, who didn't have any self-importance about himself. The world knows him better as "Jihadi John," the man whose masked face and British accented-taunts have featured in a series of brutal ISIS execution videos. " The man, who was identified only as Mohammed, said the pair's mothers had been "very good friends" until three years ago when rumors began to circulate about Emwazi's terror links.
