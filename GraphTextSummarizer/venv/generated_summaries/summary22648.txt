-- A New Orleans police officer who was fired after the 2005 beating of an unarmed man on Bourbon Street was ordered reinstated to his job by an appeals court "He does not have the moral character to be police officer, and have the power and the force to have a gun and a Taser." , the court clerk told CNN on Thursday. Robert Evangelist was acquitted of charges related to the beating in 2007 but lost his job as a police officer. His attorney, Stephen Bruno, told the newspaper Wednesday he was surprised by the appeals court ruling.
