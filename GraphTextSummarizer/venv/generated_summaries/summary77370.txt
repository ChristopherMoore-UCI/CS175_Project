A key component of the transition so far has seen Heineken move away from its traditional focus on bars and restaurants as primary points of sale. -- As European consumers shift their drinking habits away from bars and into their homes, industry giants such as Heineken are looking at ways to adapt. Heineken recorded sales 3% higher at Carrefour stores than at any other outlet in the last year. Beer sales in bars and restaurants - traditionally the primary outlets for the Dutch brewer's products - have fallen sharply across the continent in recent years. As a result, Heineken recorded a 4.6% drop in sales in 2010, down to â‚¬7.89 billion ($11.3 billion).
