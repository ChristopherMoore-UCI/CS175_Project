-- The legendary New York restaurant Tavern on the Green will close its doors after serving a last supper and hosting a New Year's party. Attorney Barry LePatner, who represents Poll, said the new revitalized restaurant will become a popular destination for tourists and New Yorkers alike. The iconic spot on the western edge of Central Park will undergo major renovations under a new operator and may even retain its famous name, but to many patrons, this is indisputably the end of an era. The LeRoy family was forced to file for bankruptcy in 2009 after losing a bidding war for to another proprietor, Dean Poll, who also owns the Boathouse Restaurant in Central Park. The restaurant almost died in 1974 when the operator  shuttered the "rustic little money-losing pub," as New York Times food writer Eric Asimov later described it.
