The three-day trial in a New York City court included tearful testimony from Baldwin, who denied he had a romantic relationship with Sabourin as she claimed. -- A Canadian woman who said actor Alec Baldwin promised her "omelets every morning" for the rest of her life after a sexual encounter was found guilty Thursday of stalking and harassing the "30 Rock" star. The judge also issued a protection order prohibiting the stalker from contacting Baldwin and his wife, Hilaria Baldwin, in any way for five years. A judge sentenced Genevieve Sabourin, 41, to 210 days in jail for the five counts, as well as for violating a protection order and for a contempt of court ruling issued after her repeated outbursts in court. Hilaria Baldwin, who was then engaged to him, told the doorman that Sabourin was a stalker and that she would call police, the building doorman testified.
