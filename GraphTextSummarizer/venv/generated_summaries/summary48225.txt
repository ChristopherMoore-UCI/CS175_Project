-- Myanmar's Supreme Court rejected Friday an appeal by pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi to overturn her house arrest. The Nobel Peace Prize laureate's house arrest was extended by 18 months last August after an incident in which uninvited American John Yettaw stayed at her lakeside home. Suu Kyi, 64, has one final avenue for appeal to a special court in Myanmar's new capital, Naypidaw. She has been imprisoned or under house arrest for much of the past two decades, since her party the National League for Democracy won a landslide election victory in 1990. Myanmar's ruling military junta accused Suu Kyi of breaching the terms of her house arrest.
