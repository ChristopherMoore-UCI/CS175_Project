On a recent afternoon in Toronto, Queen's Roger Taylor was checking out rehearsals for Queen Extravaganza -- a 25-date tribute tour with a lineup hand-selected by him and his bandmate, guitarist Brian May -- when singer Marc Martel belted out a few notes from "Bohemian Rhapsody," stopping the 62-year-old drummer in his tracks. In typical Queen fashion, the Extravaganza will also be quite the visual spectacle: Taylor and May have hired designer Mark Fisher, who worked on Pink Floyd's The Wall concerts and every Rolling Stones show since 1989, to work on the tour. Taylor and May will also play five Queen shows in Europe later this year with singer Adam Lambert on lead vocals. Lambert, who performed with Taylor and May on the 2009 "American Idol" finale, has long been on the duo's radar. According to Taylor, Queen will perform in Moscow, Ukraine and London.
