Since its launch, Twitter has played a role in a wide range of headline-making events, from the Egyptian revolution to Charlie Sheen's battle with CBS. Since Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey posted it on March 21, 2006, Twitter has registered nearly 200 million users who now post more than a billion tweets every week. It's also become a business tool, with many major companies now using accounts to advertise deals and encourage word-of-mouth marketing. Twitter says it set a record of 6,939 tweets per second immediately after the 9.0-magnitude quake struck on March 11, and 177 million tweets went out as the day wore on. Last month, the Wall Street Journal reported that suitors were valuing it at $8 to $10 billion.
