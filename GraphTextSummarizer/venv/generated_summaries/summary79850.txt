When Putin said there's a "fine line" between the opposition and a "Fifth Column" -- in other words, traitors to Russia -- reporters twice followed up with pointed questions, including a demand that he name those members of the "Fifth Column." Instead, he blamed Russia's economic woes on "external" factors, asserting that economic sanctions account for just "25 to 30%" of Russia's economic problems. Putin's first challenge was to assure his fellow citizens that Russia can overcome what he called an "unfavorable scenario" and he promised that would happen -- in two years, maybe less. When a BBC reporter asked him about a "new" Cold War, Putin leaned forward like an athlete, insisting that that Russia is simply defending its own interests. There was no real mea culpa for Russia's economic predicament.
