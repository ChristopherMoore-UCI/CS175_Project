Justice launched a probe that found in December 2011 that the Seattle police department had engaged in a "pattern or practice" of excessive force. -- The Justice Department and Seattle announced a settlement Friday over long-simmering allegations of excessive force by police officers. A series of allegations by minority groups that police were quick to resort to force in several instances prompted the Justice Department to launch an investigation. During bumpy negotiating sessions in which officials say Seattle officeholders argued over the agreement, the Justice Department set a July 31 deadline for a settlement, saying if they did not agree the federal government would sue the city. The Justice Department Civil Rights Division still has 15 other "pattern or practice" investigations of police departments pending.
