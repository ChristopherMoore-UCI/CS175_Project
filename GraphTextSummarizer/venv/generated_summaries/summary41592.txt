The researchers at MIT's Senseable City Lab are looking at other ways drones could be used in everyday life. "MIT campus is quite complex, it has a lot of buildings, and sometimes people do get lost," said Carlo Ratti, director of the institute's Senseable City Lab, which created the futuristic device. SkyCall is part of a bigger program at Senseable City Lab, exploring how people could use new technology in urban environments. "Drones have had quite bad press because of the military implications," explained Ratti. Indeed, it's hoped that in the future, SkyCall could be developed into everything from city guides for tourists, to rescue robots for survivors of disaster sites.
