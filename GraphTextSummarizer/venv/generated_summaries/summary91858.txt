(Of course, you'll also be able to stream coverage of the show's big coronation party in NYC -- there will be interviews with all this season's queens -- on LogoTV.com, from 8 to 10:15 p.m. ET tonight, too.) Which is why we here at EW enlisted the drag legend for a quick chat last Friday afternoon to discuss all things about tonight's "Reunited" special and season 4. Based on what happened at last week's taping, the episode that airs tonight should be a doozy of an hour that will delve into the drama around Willam's surprising early exit from the season; award one queen the Miss Congeniality award (you might be able to guess who, but I'm not telling you...); and, of course, finally crown Chad Michaels, Sharon Needles, or Phi Phi O'Hara as America's Next Drag Superstar. Read on for Ru's thoughts on the controversial decision to tape three endings to tonight's episode; why season 4 was stands out from the previous three; the appeal of fallen queen Latrice Royale; what's going on with "All Stars: RuPaul's Drag Race"; and much, much more. EW: With "All Stars," regular "Drag Race," and "Drag U," you're taking over Logo.
