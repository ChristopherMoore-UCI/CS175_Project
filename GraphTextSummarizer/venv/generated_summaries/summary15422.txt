The man was identified as Stuart Haverty, 23, of Chicago, and an autopsy Monday concluded that the cause of his death was multiple injuries from a fall, the spokeswoman said. -- The death of a man who fell from an upper deck Sunday during a home game of the Chicago Bears has been ruled an "accident" by the Cook County Medical Examiner's office, a spokeswoman said Monday. Last week, a 2-year-old boy fell to his death from a luxury suite at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, California. The incident happened around 5 p.m. Sunday while the Bears were playing the Philadelphia Eagles, said Veejay Zala of the Chicago Police Department. The boy fell at the conclusion of a National Basketball Association game and later died at the hospital.
