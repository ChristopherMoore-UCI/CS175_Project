Prince Harry tore up the royal tour rule book on his recent visit to the Caribbean, according to veteran royal photographer Arthur Edwards. The entire royal press pack had agreed that the main event of the day would be Harry meeting sprinter Usain Bolt, the fastest man in the world. The source tells me: "Prince Harry and Prince William are a double act for the rest of their lives. According to a friend who trained with Harry, he even has a nickname which goes back to his time at the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst: Harry Potter. After racing Bolt, Harry set off to meet Portia Simpson-Miller, the staunchly-republican prime minister of Jamaica.
