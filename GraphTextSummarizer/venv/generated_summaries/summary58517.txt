Since the modern nation state's founding in 1932, Thailand has been served by a constitutional monarchy and is the only country in Southeast Asia to avoid coming under European colonial rule. The democratic elections in mid-2011 saw Vejjajiva defeated at the polls and Yingluck Shinawatra -- sister of the deposed Thaksin Shinawatra -- elected as the country's first female prime minister. Large scale protests against Vejjajiva's government led by supporters of the political pressure group the United Front for Democracy Against Dictatorship (UFDD), commonly known as "the red shirts", lead to large scale protests in 2009 and 2010. -- Thailand is a constitutional monarchy situated in the heart of Southeast Asia. In spite of these threats and the country's volatile political life, Thailand has remained one of the strongest performing economies in Southeast Asia.
