The British effectively invented concentration camps here at the turn of the 19th century, and the Boers, the victims then, would mandate that native Africans were nothing but second-class citizens. Sharlto Copley plays a bureaucrat forced into action in "District 9," a film about extraterrestrials. Blomkamp indulges in grisly, blackly comic satire worthy of Paul "Starship Troopers" Verhoeven as our man Wikus (Sharito Copley) casually demonstrates the art of aborting alien offspring with the aid of a flamethrower, all for the edification of the viewers back home. The South African-born Blomkamp learned his trade in Canada, and found a mentor in New Zealand. Presented in the now-familiar fake-doc style -- at least until Blomkamp gets bored with its limitations when the action heats up -- "District 9" is an edgy little B movie with an injection of impressive big-money special effects courtesy of "Lord of the Rings" director-producer Peter Jackson.
