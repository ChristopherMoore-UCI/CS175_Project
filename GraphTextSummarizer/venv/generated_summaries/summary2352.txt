-- How did two convicted murderers allegedly get their hands on forged documents that granted them early release from a Florida prison? State prisons are also strengthening their review of prisoner releases, he said. But the escape has prompted a review of law libraries in state prisons as well as inmate use of computers and processing equipment "to make sure we are not giving them too much," Michael Crews, head of the Florida Department of Corrections, told the committee. One of 2 Florida escapees ordered sent back to Franklin Correctional Institution Nashaddai used a similar technique in 2009 to walk away from the Pinellas County Jail before authorities figured out the scheme and recaptured him a day later, according to prison records. State officials have been investigating the scam for about a year and had warned state prosecutors about the schemes over the summer, authorities have said.
