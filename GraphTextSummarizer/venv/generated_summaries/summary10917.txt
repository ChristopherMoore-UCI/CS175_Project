Boko Haram insurgents have kidnapped 80 people in northern Cameroon, officials said, an attack that comes as troops from neighboring Chad entered Cameroon to join the fight against the terrorist group. Attacks on military installations mark a big shift in Boko Haram operations in Cameroon. Michael Stephen Hoza, U.S. ambassador to Cameroon, also said his country would help train Cameroon soldiers and offer equipment for the fight. " Much of what is imported to Chad comes through the Cameroonian seaport of Douala, and Chad's crude oil is transported through a pipeline that runs from southern Chad to a floating facility 11 kilometers (almost 7 miles) off the Cameroon coast. The Chadian soldiers "are coming in with dozens of tanks, armored vehicles and other military equipment," Cameroon defense ministry spokesman Col. Didier Badjeck said.
