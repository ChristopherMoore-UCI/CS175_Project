Demonstrators were marching from Speakers Corner in Hyde Park to Trafalgar Square, where there were planned speeches from Labour politician Tony Benn, former London Mayor Ken Livingstone, two members of Parliament and others. Afghanistan is at the top of the agenda for Saturday's meeting of NATO leaders in Lisbon, Portugal, where they agreed with the Afghan government to leave international forces there for many years after a planned military transition in 2014. A large protest was happening Saturday in London against the war in Afghanistan, with organizers saying thousands from around the country would take part. "Any development that has happened hasn't been for the Afghan people," said protester Chaz Singh. "There's a real upswell of support, and there's something coming," he told CNN about the anti-war sentiment he sees in Britain.
