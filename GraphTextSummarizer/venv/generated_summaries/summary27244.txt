But found the government "has not finalized guidelines for using watch list records within (key segments of) the private sector. " The GAO report said government agencies had encountered individuals who were on the watch list about 53,000 times since the system was started in December 2003. Wednesday's report comes on the heels of a Justice Department inspector-general's report, which expressed concern about the quality of some of the data in the watch list, but noted continuing improvement in the system. Terrorist Screening Center Director Leonard Boyle expressed particular satisfaction with the recent execution of a multi-agency agreement, which he said "provides a full and fair review of any watch list record that is the cause of an individual's complaint." " Timothy Sparapani, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union, urged Congress to tighten its oversight of the process "before we all become suspects in the eyes of the Terrorist Screening Center." Overall, the GAO -- the investigative arm of Congress -- credited the Terrorist Screening Center, which compiles the government's unified watch list, for making improvements in the system and providing a reliable single coordination point for terrorist screening data.
