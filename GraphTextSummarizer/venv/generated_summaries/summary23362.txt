New powers to bolster older restrictions The Prime Minister said Britain's intelligence agencies and police believed that stronger powers were also needed to manage the risk posed by suspected extremists already in the UK. Cameron said he would introduce legislation giving British authorities new powers that would strengthen their ability to track suspected supporters of ISIS, by providing "enhanced use of exclusion zones" or "relocation powers." British Prime Minister David Cameron called Monday for a new law to give police the temporary power to seize a passport in case a British citizen is suspected of trying to travel to support ISIS. The "root cause" of Britain's terror threat is "Islamist extremism," Cameron said Friday.
