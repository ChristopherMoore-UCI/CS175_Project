After correspondence throughout the journey, she joined Asselin in walking on Wednesday from McLean on the same 13-mile route that Nathaniel Asselin had taken when he ran away from that hospital in early 2010, when his father had combed the twisting streets of Boston trying to figure out where his son had called him from. For 45 days, Denis Asselin walked from Philadelphia to Boston in memory of his son, Nathaniel, who suffered from a severe form of a mental illness called body dysmorphic disorder. A week into the walk, e-mails started coming to Asselin from people affected by body dysmorphic disorder expressing their deep gratitude for his journey. Denis Asselin created his own rite on the Eastern Seaboard in honor of his son who took his own life last year. The condition is associated with symptoms of other mental illnesses such as depression, eating disorders, social phobia, anxiety and suicidal thoughts and behaviors.
