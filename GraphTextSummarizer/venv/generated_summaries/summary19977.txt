"A special friendship with a clan of nomadic Fulani has given Phyllis the opportunity to open additional schools for Fulani children and their parents," the website says. Sortor runs a nongovernmental organization that educates nomadic Fulani children, the police commissioner said. The Free Methodist Church has identified the woman as the Rev. Phyllis Sortor, a missionary based at the Hope Academy compound in Kogi state. According to her biography on the church's website, Sortor is the financial administrator of Hope Academy. Sortor was kidnapped on Monday, Ogunjemilusi said.
