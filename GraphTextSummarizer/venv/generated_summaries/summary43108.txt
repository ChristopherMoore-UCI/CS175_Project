He said new developments in engineered woods -- small wood components that are glued together to make large panels for building -- are a game-changer for construction. " Ultimately, buildings of the future are likely to be a mixture of wooden components and concrete and steel; combining the stability of concrete with the flexibility and speed of wood. "We've calculated that the North American forests grow enough wood for a 20-story wood building every 8-10 minutes." Ultimately, building in wood, Green argues, creates an economic incentive to plant more forests. "The culture of building and the culture of developing buildings is very conservative," he said. Vancouver-based architect Michael Green says the momentum is gaining as new engineered woods allow for greater strength and heights in buildings.
