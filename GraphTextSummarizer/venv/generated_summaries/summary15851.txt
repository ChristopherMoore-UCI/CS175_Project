The problems of very long wait lists for veterans and serious scheduling issues go well beyond Phoenix and exist in many VA facilities, Inspector General Richard Griffin and members of his staff told the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee. -- The Phoenix VA, where dozens of veterans died waiting for care and were placed on secret wait lists, was in total "chaos" with patients needing urgent care and often unable to get it, officials from the VA's Inspector General's Office testified at a Senate hearing Tuesday. In May, following reports of patients dying while waiting for care at the Phoenix VA, VA Secretary Eric Shinseki was forced to step down. McDonald testified to numerous efforts underway across the VA system to decrease wait times and provide veterans faster, needed medical care. " "I said at the time of my confirmation hearing that I will put veterans at the center of everything we do at VA," said McDonald.
