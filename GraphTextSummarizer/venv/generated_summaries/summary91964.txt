A chief focus of Saturday's sweep was Jeremy Sidney, a 33-year-old former convict who at one point "converted to radical Islam," Molins said. The incident was part of a far-reaching, coordinated counterterrorism operation targeting radical Islamists that led to 10 arrests, Paris prosecutor Francois Molins told reporters. Police officers went Saturday morning to an apartment building in Strasbourg, in eastern France, that was home to one of Sidney's two "religious wives," said Molins. "He appeared (to be) a delinquent converted to radical Islam," said Molins, who later added that Sidney never trained to fight abroad. Inside the man's apartment, police found a female companion with a 6-year-old child and a 1-month-old infant, according to Strasbourg prosecutor Patrick Poirret.
