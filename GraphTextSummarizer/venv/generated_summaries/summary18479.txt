This threat came shortly after NATO said it intercepted government forces laying mines in Misrata's harbor, which has been a lifeline for humanitarian aid. You American, French and British come and negotiate with us," Gadhafi said on Libyan state TV. -- Eyewitnesses in the embattled Libyan city of Misrata reported especially intense shelling by Moammar Gadhafi's forces overnight -- the heavy fire picking up at about the same time reports came out that one of the leader's son was killed in a NATO airstrike. Shortly after Gadhafi's speech, a NATO spokeswoman called for actions, not words, in expressing skepticism the Libyan leader could be trusted to follow through on his pledges. These stepped-up, continuous attacks were reported early Sunday, about a full day after Moammar Gadhafi's latest diatribe that called for a negotiated end to NATO airstrikes and included threats to Italy.
