Foundations, which give us funding, have lost money and can't give what they have in the past," said Jim LoBianco, executive director of StreetWise Inc., a Chicago nonprofit that assists men and women who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless. Kinnucan, 37, has made it his mission to collect donated goods in Chicago, sort through them and get them to charities in need. And when a local hotel was replacing 75 ice buckets and 55 coffee makers, Kinnucan parceled them out to various nonprofits in the area. " Kinnucan came up with the idea of Bin Donated when a friend was having a "clean out the closet" event. " Hygiene products, like those provided to StreetWise, make up the majority of Kinnucan's donations.
