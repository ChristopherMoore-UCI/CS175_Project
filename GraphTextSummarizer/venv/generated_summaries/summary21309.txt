-- Through everything in John McGraw's life during the past two decades, there has been one constant: He knows he will be in the infield of Churchill Downs on the first Saturday in May. McGraw, a photographer and CNN iReporter from East Lansing, Michigan, went to his first Kentucky Derby when he was 20, tagging along with some older friends who were really into horses. How the 1% roll at the Kentucky Derby The 2014 event will be McGraw's 20th Kentucky Derby in a row. When you look at old photos of the early 1900s, all the women wore hats, and all the guys wore hats as well. He'll be among upward of 70,000 fans in the infield, which the Derby's official website says is "an experience of acceptable excess and is forgivably risque." In the past few years, he has become passionate about still photography and trains his camera on the Derby's biggest attraction, aside from the horses: the hats.
