-- For years the practice by television companies during the 1960s of erasing videotapes containing original episodes of classic shows has frustrated fans. Tapes of the two BBC shows, "Galaxy 4 part three" starring William Hartnell and "The Underwater Menace part two" with Patrick Troughton, were bought at a school fete by former TV engineer Terry Burnett in the 1980s. The footage was shown at the British Film Institute's annual "Missing Believed Wiped" event at the National Film Theatre in London hosted by actor Mark Gatiss. " Broadcasters started to record TV programs for transmission in the late 1950s, but because videotape was so expensive, they were wiped clean for reuse afterwards. Details of any commercial release for the rediscovered episodes will be announced next year.
