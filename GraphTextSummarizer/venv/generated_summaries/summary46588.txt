The Indira Gandhi Children's Hospital in central Kabul has to run on an operating budget of less than $1,200 a month, said Dr. Noorulhaq Yousufzai, the hospital director. But still, the hospital cannot afford to help the hundreds of children who stream in every day, desperate for care and cures. -- Babies lie side by side in warming beds or sprawled on blankets atop crude wooden tables. And everywhere, parents clutch plastic bags containing bring-your-own medicines and supplies. The toll on the children and parents is clear to any visitor, and the strain hits the hospital staff, too.
