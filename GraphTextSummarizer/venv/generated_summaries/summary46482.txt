"I was here within probably a minute, minute and a half of it being dispatched, and I can tell you it was a chaotic scene," said Columbus Police Chief Stephen Gammill. Three people were in critical condition and one in stable condition after a stabbing incident Wednesday afternoon in Columbus, Ohio, that ended with the suspect being shot by police, Columbus authorities said. The attack began inside a downtown building that houses Miami-Jacobs Career College, said Columbus Police Sgt. The stabbing victims in critical condition underwent surgery at Grant Medical Center, while the one with less serious injuries was taken to Mount Carmel West hospital, officials said. The suspect, who is not being identified by authorities, was shot outside the building by an officer responding to the scene, police said.
