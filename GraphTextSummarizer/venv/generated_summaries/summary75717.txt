-- A polar bear twin born last month at a German zoo has died less than a week after its sibling, zoo officials announced Saturday. It was a year ago this week that Vera gave birth to Flocke, whose cute antics and fluffy fur made him an instant celebrity across Germany. One year ago Vera gave birth to Flocke, pictured here playing in April. Zoo Director Dag Encke said he regretted the deaths. "Vera nursed regularly and the young animal always slept well afterwards, so it seemed certain that it received enough milk," he said.
