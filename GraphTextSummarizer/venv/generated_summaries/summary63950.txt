-- Swiss star Fabian Cancellara rode clear of the leading group to win the Paris Roubaix cycling classic on Sunday and complete a rare double having claimed the Tour of Flanders earlier this spring. Cancellara was winning his fourth major one-day classic with Milan-San Remo in 2006, two at Paris-Roubaix (2006 and 2010) and this year's Tour of Flanders. Last week Cancellara became the first Swiss since Heiri Suter in 1923 to win at Flanders. Norwegian Thor Hushovd beat Spaniard Juan Antonio Flecha for the runners-up spot in a sprint finish, the pair having finally given chase to Cancellara but too little too late. Cancellera crossed the line alone for his second Paris-Roubaix win and only the 10th man to complete the double with Flanders.
