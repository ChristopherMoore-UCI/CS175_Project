Politicians and labor leaders were content to keep the holiday in September, far from the growing popularity of May Day as a commemoration of the "Martyrs of Haymarket Square," a group of union leaders executed -- unjustly, it was later proved -- after Chicago's deadly Haymarket Square Riots in May 1884. They are a sobering reminder of why the nation marks Labor Day. During the economic depression known as the Panic of 1893, workers for the Pullman Car Co., one of the country's largest manufacturers, walked off their jobs when Pullman tried to cut wages, fire workers and evict them from their company-owned homes. The September date was selected to provide a respite for workers and their families midway between July Fourth and Thanksgiving Day. But Labor Day was born in a time when work was no picnic.
