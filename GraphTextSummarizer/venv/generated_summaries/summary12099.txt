Lab results are back in the case of a teenager who died in a police shooting in St. Louis last week, and they show gun residue on the clothing and body of Vonderrit Myers, authorities said Tuesday. The residue was found on Myers' shirt, jeans and hand, according to a release from St. Louis police. Myers was struck by seven or eight bullets, St. Louis Medical Examiner Dr. Michael Graham said last week. Myers was fatally shot Wednesday by a St. Louis officer, who was off-duty but wearing his uniform while moonlighting for a security company. Its presence on his hand could mean that he discharged a firearm, was near a firearm when it went off or that Myers touched something with gun residue on it, police said.
