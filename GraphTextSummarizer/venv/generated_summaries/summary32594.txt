-- Wichita State used its Cinderella slipper on Saturday night to trounce Ohio State early and hold on late to advance to the Final Four of the NCAA men's basketball tournament, where it will be joined by Syracuse. Syracuse's Final Four partner will be either Michigan or Florida, who square off Sunday afternoon at Cowboys Stadium outside Dallas. But the Orange pulled away in the second half, eventually cruising to victory before a crowd at Washington's Verizon Center that included President Barack Obama. Their 20-point advantage with 12 minutes to go dwindled steadily as the contest wore on, with Ohio State pulling within 5 points with just over three minutes to go. But Wichita State was able to stave off the Buckeyes' furious rally, thereby earning the right to play the winner of Sunday's Louisville-Duke showdown at a national semifinal.
