Apple is scheduled to report first quarter earnings on April 23. Hon Hai reported first quarter 2013 revenue of nearly $27 billion, down from $33.4 billion during the same period last year, according to company reports. The parent company of Apple's biggest parts supplier, Taiwan-based Hon Hai Precision Industry, also known as Foxconn, had a 19.2% drop in revenue during the first quarter as iPhone orders slowed down faster than expected. Richard Lai, Editor-in-chief for Engadget China, says that increased competition in the smartphone market suggests an overreliance on Apple behind Foxconn woes. On the other hand, Samsung has been offering better battery life and bigger screens."
