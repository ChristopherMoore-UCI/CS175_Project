-- Syria has until Friday to agree to let Arab League observers into the country to monitor the government's response to civil unrest or else face economic sanctions from its neighbors, a senior Arab League diplomat said Thursday. Syria's government has said it is fighting armed terrorists, and it maintains that the death toll is much lower than international observers and opposition groups say. At least 35 people died Thursday in clashes with security forces, the Local Coordination Committees of Syria (LCC) activist group said. Syria's membership in the 22-country Arab League was suspended this month after President Bashar al-Assad's regime ignored demands to end its crackdown on citizens. On Tuesday, the humanitarian committee of the U.N. General Assembly voted by a large majority to condemn the violence in Syria and express its support for the Arab League initiative.
