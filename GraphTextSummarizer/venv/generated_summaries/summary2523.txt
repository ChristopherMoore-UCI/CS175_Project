The men, identified as Kim Kook Kie and Choi Chun Kil, are accused of committing crimes of "terrorism" and bringing in "large quantities of forged currency," the North Korean source said. North Korea has arrested what it claims are two spies who worked for South Korea's intelligence service, a North Korean official said Thursday on condition of anonymity. CNN cannot confirm the authenticity of the declaration or whether, if Kim made one, it was made under duress. The official said Kim had made a declaration of guilt. " "We don't have any information that members of NIS were arrested in North Korea," an NIS representative said.
