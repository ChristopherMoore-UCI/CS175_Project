I forgo a pricey taxi ride across the city in favor of an infinitely more charming and scenic walk toward Gamla Stan, which is touristy but irresistible once I'm weaving through a knot of cobblestoned streets and storybook 17th-century houses. While wandering the alleys of Gamla Stan, I stumble upon what may be the city's top bargain: a classical music concert ($11) at Storkyrkan, Stockholm's central cathedral (1 Trangsund, Gamla Stan; 46-8/723-3016). From my bench, I can see the silhouette of Gamla Stan, the old section of the city just across the bridge. For lunch, I circle back to busy Slussen square -- Stockholm's answer to Grand Central. I plot my day over a complimentary breakfast of homemade yogurt and knäckebröd (crispy bread) at Hotel Anno 1647 (3 Mariagränd; 46-8/442-1680), housed in a former tobacco and clothing factory in the hip island neighborhood of Södermalm.
