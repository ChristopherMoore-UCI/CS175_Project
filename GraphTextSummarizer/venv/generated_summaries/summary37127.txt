Police called in at mountain gas station Lines were a half-mile long Thursday night at the stations that stayed open, and police were called in to maintain order, iReporter April Brendle said. Several stations in Ocala, Florida, were limiting sales if they still had gas to sell, iReporter Christine Bailey said. That's led to a scramble at gas stations as people try to fill up before the storm hits. A spokeswoman for the company that runs the Kangaroo Express chain says it's imposed a limit at its 1,660 stores because gas supplies are tight. Canadian Ian McIntosh said gas prices jumped 57 cents per gallon overnight in Milton, Ontario.
