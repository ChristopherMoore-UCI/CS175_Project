A successful experiment, Bhaskar said, would bring India closer to the group of nations capable of building intercontinental missiles. The flight of Agni V would be a significant move to demonstrate India's technological competence, said Uday Bhaskar, a strategic expert. "Yet, the first test of Agni V will enhance India's technological profile," he said. Built years earlier, Agni I could travel 700 km, according to Indian defense authorities. The Agni V rocket could be launched between Wednesday and Friday, said Ravi Gupta, the spokesman for the country's Defense Research and Development Organization.
