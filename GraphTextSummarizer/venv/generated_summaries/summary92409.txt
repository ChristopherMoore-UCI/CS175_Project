The impact of climate change particularly in the developing nations has a disproportionate impact on women and girls and solutions that reflect that are crucial. As a start, with less than one month to go to the close of this year's competition, I would urge all female entrepreneurs with sustainability ideas to enter and take up the opportunity that's on offer. To this end, I'm about to launch and participate in a mentoring service for women who need support in achieving their ambitions and would encourage other women in my position around the world to do the same. Women have a strong historical record when it comes to sustainability, from Rachel Carson who wrote "Silent Spring," which many credited with igniting the environmental movement, to Vivienne Westwood who as well as campaigning for sustainability in the fashion industry has tried to make sustainability fashionable. With greater need than ever for green businesses and innovations all around the world, l want to see more women seizing these sorts of opportunities.
