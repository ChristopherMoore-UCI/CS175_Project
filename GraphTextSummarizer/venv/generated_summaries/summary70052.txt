Of course, many blogs trade in feverish rumors about Apple products that later prove unfounded, and there's no proof that such a feature will show up on the next iPhone, expected to be launched this fall. At least one developer found a folder called "BiometricKitUI" containing lines of code that made numerous references to "fingerprint," according to reports by 9to5Mac, Extreme Tech and other blogs. According to several reports, the next version of Apple's mobile operating system suggests future iPhones will have biometric scanners that read fingerprints. But the rumors got a boost when a beta version of iOS 7 was released Monday night to Apple developers. For users of Apple devices, more help might be on the way.
