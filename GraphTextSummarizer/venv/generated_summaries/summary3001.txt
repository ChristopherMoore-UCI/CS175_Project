Although the third-generation iPad surprised many by gaining about half a millimeter of thickness, it looks like Apple could be back to trimming product dimensions by using a new kind of display technology in the next iPhone. "We do believe that the next iPhone display will implement in-cell touch," DisplaySearch's Paul Semenza told Wired via e-mail. Instead of using a display comprising a number of separate layers, Apple could use in-cell touch display technology, according to a Friday report from Digitimes. "Additionally, by reducing the number of layers, you reduce the size and thickness of the device, making it thinner and lighter." If the iPhone has a larger 4- to 4.3-inch display, as some reports expect it to, that extra glass could add a bit of heft to the iPhone's weight. "The advantage of in-cell is that you're streamlining the manufacturing process, so in time you should be able to drive efficiencies and reduce cost," IHS analyst Rhoda Alexander told Wired.
