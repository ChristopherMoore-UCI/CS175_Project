-- MIT economics professor Jonathan Gruber apologized Tuesday for his "glib, thoughtless and sometimes downright insulting comments" about Obamacare and the intelligence of American voters. " Years-old but newly surfaced video show Gruber saying the legislation was drafted amd sold to the public in a way that masked the penalty for not getting health insurance, so that voters wouldn't consider it a tax. House Oversight Chairman Darrell Issa blasted his initial comments as an "insult" to voters, while ranking member Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the committee, slammed Gruber's remarks as "absolutely stupid" and "irresponsible." Calling the plan a "clever" and "basic exploitation of the lack of economic understanding of the American voter," Gruber hailed how the measure passed "because the American people are too stupid to understand the difference. " While Gruber has previously described himself as an "architect" of Obamacare, he sharply denied the label on Tuesday, arguing that his role in the legislation has been inflated in the past.
