The stress of the past week since Scott was fatally shot in the back by a North Charleston police Officer Michael Slager is too much. "The cell phone video shot by a bystander confirmed our initial suspicions." Feidin Santana, who took the video of the shooting, told CNN's Anderson Cooper that he was walking to work when he saw Slager on top of Scott, who was on the ground. "Mr. Scott never tried to fight," Santana said. Meanwhile, police continue to investigate the incident in which Scott ran from his car after a traffic stop then was shot while fleeing from Slager. On Friday afternoon, police met with a man who was in Scott's car when Slager pulled it over for a broken taillight.
