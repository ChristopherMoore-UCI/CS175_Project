Watch "Larry King Live" guest host Jim Moret talk to panel about Letterman case Â» Letterman has had plenty of experience dealing with awkward, and sometimes painful, episodes on television. " A representative for Letterman's company, Worldwide Pants, said, "All the relationships David Letterman was referencing when discussing the matter on the 'Late Show' predated his marriage to Regina" in March. The latest, an alleged extortion attempt involving his sexual dalliances (it's been dubbed "sextortion" by pundits), was handled very much the way Letterman fans might expect: with humor and a bit of storytelling. Ray would refer to herself as "Mrs. David Letterman" and once watched the talk show host and his now-wife Regina Lasko from a hallway in their home as they lay in bed. "Letterman picked up on [that shock] and played on that," said Robert Thompson, a professor and founding director of the Bleier Center for Television and Popular Culture at Syracuse University.
