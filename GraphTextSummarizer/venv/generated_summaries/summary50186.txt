Russia and Georgia fought a five-day war in August over the breakaway Georgian province of South Ossetia, the first time Russia sent troops abroad in anger since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. On Tuesday afternoon, Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili called on Russia to stop "provocative maneuvers" in Georgia, according to Georgia's English-language Prime News. About 500 troops at a military base outside the capital, Tbilisi, were involved in the rebellion, said Interior Ministry spokesman Shota Utiashvili. -- Georgian authorities foiled an attempted army mutiny that they believe was designed to disrupt planned NATO exercises in the former Soviet republic, the country's interior ministry said Tuesday. Georgian troops take part in military exercises in January.
