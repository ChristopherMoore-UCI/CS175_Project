Food prices have declined from their peak earlier in the year, but they are staying high compared to other years, the agency said. The agency said the "rural and urban poor, landless farmers and female-headed households are the worst hit by high food prices. The number of hungry had been increasing over the years before the rise in food prices, with warfare and political instability continuing to be among the factors causing poverty. The hunger report -- titled "The State of Food Insecurity in the World 2008" -- said the world's financial and economic problems could throw more people into poverty. "Prices of major cereals have fallen by over 50 percent from their peaks earlier in 2008 but they remain high compared to previous years," the FAO said.
