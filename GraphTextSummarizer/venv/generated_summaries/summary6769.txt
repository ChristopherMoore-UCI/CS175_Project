-- Thousands took to the streets of Madrid Saturday to protest against a proposed law that would, among other things, impose stiff fines on illegal demonstrations, according to state-run broadcaster TVE. Spain has seen its share of protests since the government imposed austerity measures to comply with European Union demands. "The voice of the people is not illegal," protesters shouted as they were met by 1,250 riot police, TVE reported. Much of the protest was peaceful, but a small group clashed with riot police and seven people were arrested. Under the proposed law, unauthorized demonstrations in front of the Parliament building carry a fine of up to 30,000 euros (about $41,000), but the measure is likely to pass as conservatives hold the majority in the government.
