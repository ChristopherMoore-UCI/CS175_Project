Halep, who was beaten in the final of the French Open by Maria Sharapova, cruised through to the last four with a straight sets win over Germany's Sabine Lisicki. World No.3 Halep -- the highest ranked player remaining in the tournament, won the only meeting between the pair Indian Wells earlier in 2014. Bouchard and Halep will meet on Thursday for the right to play either Lucie Safarova or Petra Kvitova in Saturday's final. Romania's Halep, 22, started slowly, losing the first three games before hitting back to take the first set 6-4. Bouchard, who reached the semifinals of both the Australian and French Opens earlier this year, saw off Kerber to set up a semifinal clash with Romania's Simona Halep.
