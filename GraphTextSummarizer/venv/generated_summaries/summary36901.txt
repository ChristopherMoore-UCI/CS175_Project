A grand jury in January charged Pleasure Ridge Park football coach Jason Stinson in the death of Max Gilpin, 15, who collapsed during a practice in August 2008 and died several days later. Pleasure Ridge Park football coach Jason Stinson has pleaded not guilty to reckless homicide. Witnesses said Stinson had denied the student water on the hot August day, WLKY reported. "Coach is amazing," former player Casey Ford told WLKY earlier this year. The suit claims they were negligent in their actions and that more than 20 minutes passed between the time Gilpin collapsed and the time one of the coaches called paramedics, according to WHAS.
