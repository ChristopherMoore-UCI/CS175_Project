Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan confirmed its deputy chief, Latif Mehsud, was arrested in Afghanistan's Khost province in the border region. The early morning explosion near the entrance of a police command in Nangarhar province wounded eight more people, said provincial spokesman Ahmadzia Abdulazai. The Taliban and their Pakistani Taliban counterpart, Tehrik-e-Taliban, often carry out terrorist attacks in the border region between Afghanistan and Pakistan. This week, a top-level Pakistani Taliban leader was captured by U.S. forces in a military operation, a State Department spokesman said Friday. They boasted that they had killed 10 officers and wounded dozens in the area near the border with Pakistan.
