Slaves are concentrated in South and Southeast Asia, across North and West Africa, and in South America, but virtually every country has slavery, and the U.S. is estimated to have 40,000 hidden slaves. A Free the Slaves partner organization sent in a community organizer who helped the families to stand up to their masters and renounce slavery. One powerful vaccination against slavery is to make sure freed slaves build lives of economic stability. These are real slaves, controlled by violence, paid nothing, unable to walk away, and making fat profits for criminal slaveholders. Meanwhile, freed slaves given opportunities today generate economic growth through a "freedom dividend."
