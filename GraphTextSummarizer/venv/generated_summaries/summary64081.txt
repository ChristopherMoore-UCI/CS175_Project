But, that said, I'm pretty sure a regenerated middle-finger-face-off between Jerry Garcia and Rahm Emanuel would be worthy of its own room at the MOMA next to van Gogh's ear. But, yes, though it might seem crazy, we now know that this is possible, because a German artist named Diemut Strebe has successfully "regrown" Vincent van Gogh's legendary severed ear. Here's how it worked: When Strebe came up with her idea, she originally wanted to procure some DNA from an envelope that it was believed van Gogh had once licked. This modern descendent would be Lieuwe van Gogh, who, it turns out, shares a Y-chromosome and one-sixteenth of Vincent's genome. Vincent van Gogh, you may already be a winner.
