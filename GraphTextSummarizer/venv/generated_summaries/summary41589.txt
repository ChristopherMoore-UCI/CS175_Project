Accused serial strangler Antonio Rodriguez was convicted Thursday of three counts of murder and sentenced to three life terms, according to the office of Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams. "My thoughts and prayers go out to the family and friends of Elaine Goldberg, Nicole Piacentini, and Casey Mahoney," Williams said in a statement. Rodriguez was convicted of killing Casey Mahoney, 27; Elaine Goldberg, 21; and Nicole Piacentini, 35. Common Pleas Court Judge Jeffrey P. Minehart found Rodriguez guilty of three counts of first-degree murder following the non-jury trial that started Monday. " "The city of Philadelphia is a little bit safer tonight now that Antonio Rodriguez will be spending the rest of his life behind bars," Williams said.
