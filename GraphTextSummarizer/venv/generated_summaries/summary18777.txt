The deal was confirmed on Rovers' website Friday as the club's board announced it had sold its 99.9% shareholding to Venky's London Limited, a newly formed company owned by the Rao family of India. They have a range of business interests in India and overseas but their flagship company is Venkateshwara Hatcheries Private Limited. -- Poultry firm Venky's have become the first ever Indian owners of an English Premier League club after they completed a $36 million takeover of Blackburn Rovers. The takeover ends Rovers' long association with previous owner Jack Walker, who died in 2000. We will absolutely respect the Jack Walker legacy and will be actively supporting the organization to ensure that Blackburn Rovers remains one of the best run clubs within the Premier League.
