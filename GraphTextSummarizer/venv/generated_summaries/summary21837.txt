It's little wonder that its vast numbers of returning crippled veterans led to major gains in the technology of prosthetic limbs. In Berlin, the Test Center for Replacement Limbs evaluated prosthetic technologies, such as the Carnes arm. Virtually every device produced today to replace lost body function of soldiers returning from our modern wars -- as well as accident victims, or victims of criminal acts, such as the Boston Marathon bombings -- has its roots in the technological advances that emerged from World War I. While earlier prostheses often tried to replicate body appearance, or to follow the inner structural plan of the original appendage -- its shape, muscles, sinews-- Schlesinger saw no need to do that. While the United States remained the largest producer of artificial limbs worldwide, Germany's prosthetic developments incorporated a particular quest for efficiency.
