" Al-Zawahiri said the United States changed its stance on Syria after similar uprisings led to the ousting of the longtime leaders of Tunisia and Egypt. " "Al Qaeda is already in Yemen, but in Syria, al Qaeda has no stronghold so it would like to gain one," he said. The new head of al Qaeda describes Syria's president as "the leader of criminal gangs, the protector of traitors," and applauds anti-government protesters seeking to topple him, in a video that appeared on extremist websites this week. "Oh free people of Syria and its mujahedeen," the al Qaeda leader said. "After what it saw and the ground shook from the thunder of your rage and after it was devastated by the loss of its two biggest agents in Egypt and Tunisia."
