If you get the flu, don't panic, said Dr. David Zich, internal medicine and emergency medicine physician at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago. The overall number of people being treated in outpatient facilities appears to be going down, said Dr. Thomas Frieden, the CDC's director. The Food and Drug Administration has approved a vaccine from seven manufacturers, according to Dr. Margaret Hamburg, the FDA commissioner, who "collectively produced 145 million doses" of flu vaccine for this season. All but two states are reporting widespread flu activity, according to the CDC. Very young children, senior citizens and people with underlying health conditions should also see their doctor, the CDC's Frieden said.
