As China prepares to usher in the Year of the Sheep, which begins on February 19 based on the lunar calendar, few expect to see President Xi take any meek steps on the global stage in 2015. "It's difficult to find space on containers -- ships are full even in normally slow seasons," said Ben Schwall, an American buyer of lighting equipment based in southern China. During the 2014 Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation gathering in Beijing, Xi met and entertained more than a dozen other leaders from countries that have been called China's friends, enemies and -- more often than not -- "frenemies." Relations have become further strained after Xi came to power -- and recent reports by China's state media on North Korean army deserters killing Chinese civilians in border towns in several armed robberies have created a strong public backlash. "Some of China's nervous neighbors are asking: Shall we call on the U.S. to boost defense cooperation or shall we come to terms with the Chinese?" One neighbor that seems to be seeking a third option is North Korea.
