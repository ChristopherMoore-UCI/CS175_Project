Sutter: The county where no one's gay Among other likely questions that will arise are these: -- Must rabbis, priests and pastors provide religious marriage counseling to same-sex couples? -- Must religious colleges provide married-student housing to same-sex couples? Neither can citizens opposed to same-sex marriage demand that the government refuse recognition to such marriages in order to avoid offending their religious sensibilities. In some instances the rights of same-sex couples will unavoidably trump religious liberty rights -- for example, the much discussed question of visits to spouses in intensive care units. Religious liberty, as the American Jewish Committee told the Supreme Court recently in a friend-of-the-court brief, does not give anyone the right to demand that someone else be deprived of the "right to live the most intimate portions of their lives according to their own deepest convictions." That is one price we all pay for protecting religious liberty.
