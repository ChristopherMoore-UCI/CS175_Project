'An act of war' North Korea said its decision was a direct response to the U.N. Security Council, which passed tougher sanctions against the country after it carried out a nuclear test last month. It's the latest hyperbole coming out of the repressed country after the North reneged Monday on a 60-year-old armistice that had maintained an uneasy peace with South Korea since the Korean War in the 1950s. " The United States followed the U.N.'s sanctions with its own Monday after North Korea scrapped the armistice agreement. For its part, South Korea said it's keeping a close watch and making sure its combined forces with the United States are prepared for moves by the North. Like him, the newspaper said, North Koreans across the country are begging to join the army after the United Nations slapped the country with new sanctions.
