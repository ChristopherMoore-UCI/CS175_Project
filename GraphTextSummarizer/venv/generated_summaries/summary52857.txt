So far KLM is only letting passengers on flights from Amsterdam to New York, San Francisco and Sao Paolo use the service. If you're single and you didn't get the other person's name, how can you search for them on the internet or Facebook?" Scully-Power first thought of the idea last year after meeting his current girlfriend on a flight from Thailand to Sydney. The idea is that when picking an aisle or a window seat you can see if the person next to you has similar interests and the potential for stimulating conversation, or if you'll need extra batteries for your noise-cancelling headphones. Launched this month as part of their online booking service,  "Meet & Seat" allows passengers to link their Facebook or LinkedIn profiles to the seats they choose. Running the rule over fellow airline passengers; it's as common as stowing your bag under the seat in front of you and fastening your seat belt.
