Bhutan became the world's newest democracy on Monday when an election ended more than 100 years of royal rule in the South Asian nation. The refugees claim they were forced to leave Bhutan by security forces, but Bhutan has disputed whether all are truly refugees. More refugees are expected to register after they hear how those in the first group have been integrated into new homes, it said. -- Bhutanese refugees began arriving in the United States on Tuesday, the first wave of what the United Nations describes as one of the world's largest resettlement efforts. Bhutan stripped the minority ethnic Nepalis of their citizenship and forced them into exile in the early 1990s, allegedly in an attempt to ensure a homogenous culture, according to the independent, nongovernmental group Human Rights Watch.
