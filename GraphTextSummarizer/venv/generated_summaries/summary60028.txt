In Washington, one of the hardest-hit areas in the country, rates among African-American women have skyrocketed -- more than 92% of women living with HIV there are black. Keys said she wants all women to know the facts about HIV and its impact on women; to be able to speak openly about the disease with family and friends; to protect themselves and their loved ones; to get tested without shame; and to live rich, healthy lives by getting and staying on treatment. She also teamed up with Greater Than AIDS, a national public information group founded by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Black AIDS Institute, to launch her latest initiative -- a campaign aimed at reaching out specifically to American women. "I feel like this is an incredibly wonderful opportunity that we have to have a real dialogue, woman to woman, mother to mother, sister to sister, brother to sister ... father to daughter, daughter to mother, you know, friend to friend. "When people share these stories, it de-stigmatizes it, it brings it out in to the light and when we do that, we improve the quality of life that all people will have." For its part, Empowered will provide community-based grants of up to $25,000 for programs focused on women.
