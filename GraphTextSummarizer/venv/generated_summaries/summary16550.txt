These efforts have most noticeably targeted Morsy supporters, though authorities have increasingly cracked down on non-Islamist activists who oppose the military-led regime and Morsy. Egypt has been mired in political and social turmoil since massive, peaceful protests in 2011 -- amid the broader Arab Spring movement that targeted many entrenched leaders in the Middle East -- led to the exit of longtime leader Hosni Mubarak. The women had been sentenced Wednesday -- along with seven minors facing juvenile detention -- on charges of gathering, thuggery and weapons possession at a demonstration in support of former President Mohamed Morsy. Morsy took power as Egypt's first popularly elected president in June 2012. The sentence sparked wide criticism of the Interior Ministry and the judiciary's handling of cases involving those detained for  publicly backing Morsy, who has been in custody since being pushed out in July.
