CNN spoke to Olivia Harrison and the documentary's music producer, Giles Martin, son of Beatles producer Sir George Martin. (Sir George, 86, is "great," says Giles, noting that, having hung it up three years ago, "he's enjoying early retirement.") CNN: People often aren't aware of what a great sense of humor George had. As Martin Scorsese's award-winning documentary on Harrison, "George Harrison: Living in the Material World," revealed, he wasn't easily pigeonholed -- and he liked nothing more than to take the piss out of all the cliches. CNN: Olivia, did George usually put in a lot of winks and nudges to you when he wrote songs?
