Van Persie is considered key to Arsenal's hopes of improving on their distant third place finish in the EPL last season behind Manchester City and Manchester United. He has just the 2005 FA Cup win to show for his time with Arsenal since his transfer from Dutch side Feyenoord in 2004. Dutch international striker Robin van Persie has turned down a new contract at Arsenal, signaling his likely departure from the English Premier League side. To this end, van Persie said he had met with Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger and the chief executive Ivan Gazidis at the end of last season to discuss his future and their ambitions for the club. He would be the most notable departure from Arsenal since Spanish star Cesc Fabregas left last summer to join Barcelona.
