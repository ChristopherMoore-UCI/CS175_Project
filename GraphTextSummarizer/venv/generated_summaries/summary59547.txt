Despite reports that seven state government workers held the winning $319 million ticket in the Mega Millions lottery, as of Sunday, no one had come forward to claim the prize, a New York Lottery spokeswoman said. New York Lottery spokeswoman Carolyn Hapeman said she could not confirm that report. It's also the single largest sole jackpot-winning ticket ever for Mega Millions sold in New York, she said. Those holding the winning ticket will be able to collect the prize money Monday morning in the Schenectady, New York, office, Hapeman said. The winning ticket was bought at Coulson's News Central in Albany, New York.
