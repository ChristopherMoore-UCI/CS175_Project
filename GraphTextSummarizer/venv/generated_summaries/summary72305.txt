Videla, who was among the coup leaders who overthrew then-President Isabel Martinez de Peron in March 1976, was previously convicted in 2010 of human rights abuses during his rule and is currently serving a life sentence in prison. During the trial, Videla said children may have been kidnapped, but he said that there was no order or systematic plan. Jorge Rafael Videla, who ruled as a dictator between 1976 to 1981, was sentenced to 50 years in prison. Former dictator sentenced to life Bignone was sentenced in 2009 to 25 years in prison for kidnapping and torturing 56 people. They were the two most high-profile defendants found guilty Thursday of systematically stealing babies from political prisoners and giving them new identities.
