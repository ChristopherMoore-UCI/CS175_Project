The proposed agreement calls for a reduction in the number of U.S. adoption agencies accredited to operate in Russia, Moscow's children's rights commissioner, Pavel Astakhov, has said. The case sparked an international uproar and led to a series of meetings between U.S. and Russian negotiators over a proposed agreement on international adoptions between their two countries. "Independent adoptions" will be abolished, and there will be a new Russian-American agency that will inspect any U.S. family adopting a Russian child, he said. According to the Shelbyville Times-Gazette, the court will rule on whether a petition filed by the adoption agency to be appointed as a temporary guardian for Artyem will be moved to juvenile court. He said some American couples don't see details of a child's medical and psychological condition until a court appearance for final adoption approval.
