" Winter's inspiration for the LFC came about in 2005, when he spent a summer in Tanzania assessing wheelchair technology for a group of wheelchair organizations. "We wanted it to have minimal parts that could break in the field, but if the parts do need servicing, they're made from bike parts and they're easily available. "That is kind of what set the stage for creating the LFC," says Winter, who forms part of the R&D team at GRIT, the socially enterprising design collective that brought the wheelchair to market. Furthermore, Winter recognized that to be of use to the developing world, it had to be built from parts that were easily accessible. The low price point, explains Winter, makes it a sexier sell to the non-profit organizations responsible for delivering these units to emerging markets.
