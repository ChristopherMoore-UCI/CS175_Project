But Femi Kuti is by no means living in his father's shadow and is much more than just the son of Afrobeat legend Fela Kuti. "I just wanted to play good music and be happy playing good music." "He was truthful, he stood his ground, he never compromised, even at the risk of his life, and I think that's really what people admire," Kuti explained.

At 48, Femi has already spent a lifetime in music and grew up playing in his father's band.
