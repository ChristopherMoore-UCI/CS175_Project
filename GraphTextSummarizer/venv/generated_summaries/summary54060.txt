In late January, Martinez nursed an inflamed knee, saying it was likely caused by skating on rough ice, according to an interview with Catholic News Service. In 2010, he began training in the United States with coaches including John Nicks and Ilia Kulik, she said. Ice skating is a costly endeavor with expenses for travel, equipments and coaches. If Martinez hadn't qualified for the Olympics in 2013, he would've had to quit competitive skating because his family couldn't afford it, his mother added. Maria Teresa Martinez, his mother, said her son had full training for two months before arriving in Sochi because of difficulties funding his Olympic aspirations.
