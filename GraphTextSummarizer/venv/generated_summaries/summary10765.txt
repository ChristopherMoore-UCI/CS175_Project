-- Novak Djokovic has beaten Juan Martin Del Potro 6-3 6-2 in Saturday's Cincinnati Masters semi final to continue his fine run of form in the build up to the U.S. Open. The 2009 U.S. Open winner, Del Potro was struggling with a wrist injury throughout the match, having to take pain killers at the end of the first set. Djokovic, who has lost in the final at Cincinnati three times before, always looked comfortable against Del Potro, with the Serbian showing the form that helped him win the U.S. Open in 2011. Del Potro had several opportunities to take the lead, but struggled to make the most of his chances. The semi final in Ohio represented a rematch of the bronze medal match at the London Olympics, which Del Potro won.
