-- Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki on Wednesday warned that he could call for early elections, following a string of political crises since the U.S. withdrawal in the war-torn Middle Eastern nation. "When the other side refuses to sit at the table of dialogue and insists on the policy of provoking successive crises in a way that causes severe damages to the supreme interests of Iraqi people, the prime minister found himself obliged to call for early elections," the statement said. McClellan said U.S. officials "urge Iraqi leaders to move quickly to alleviate current tensions in order to refocus energy on critical state-building challenges." "We will not comment on specific diplomatic exchanges," said U.S. Embassy spokesman Michael McClellan when asked about reports of a meeting. The Iraqi Constitution allows for a prime minister to formally ask the president to dissolve parliament, which -- if approved -- would set in motion a process that could prompt early elections within 60 days.
