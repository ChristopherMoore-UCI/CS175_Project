In rural parts of Malawi, farmers often gather at radio listening clubs to tune in and discuss what they've heard. " Farm Radio Malawi is one of the partner stations of Farm Radio International, a non-profit organization that's been teaming up with African radio broadcasters since the late 1970s. In a country where the vast majority of the population lives off the land, scores of smallholders in rural communities tune in to Farm Radio Malawi to get valuable information and share ideas on how to improve their yields -- from fertilizing techniques and cultivation tips to harvesting practices and weather forecasts. It also researches and writes radio scripts covering issues such as crop production, farm management and community health. "Most of our farmers ... are illiterate," says Rex Chapota, executive director at Farm Radio Malawi.
