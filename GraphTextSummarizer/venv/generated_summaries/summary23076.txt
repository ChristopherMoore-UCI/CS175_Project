Instant Video appears to be aimed less at Netflix and Hulu, and more at attracting new customers to Amazon Prime. Those ramped up benefits might be enough to pull Amazon users over to Amazon Prime. In a letter to customers featured prominently on Amazon.com today, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos touted the new offerings, from March of the Penguins to The Dick Van Dyke Show. What's more, in addition to offering newer content, Netflix also offers a much larger library, with an estimated 20,000 titles available for streaming, quadruple Amazon's offerings. The long-rumored service is offered for no additional cost to members of Amazon Prime, the company's loyalty program, which gives customers all-you-can-eat free two-day shipping for a $79 annual fee, and already boasts millions of members.
