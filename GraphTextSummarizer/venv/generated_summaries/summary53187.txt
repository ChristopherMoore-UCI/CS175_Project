Mosque at center of Egyptian clashes It is important to remember that after Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy's overthrow, governments from the Persian Gulf in a matter of days offered the new Egyptian government 10 times the amount the United States gives each year. A trifecta of forces has contributed to this: The huge costs and damage of our misadventures in the region have left us disinclined to further commit major resources or incur further risks. This is the hard choice for America: Embrace the risks and costs of real engagement or accept those associated with a much more passive role. It was to understand that the trick of leadership is actually getting others to follow, building coalitions, leveraging our power with that of others. This last overall point contains the secret to effective U.S. leverage over Egypt and many countries these days.
