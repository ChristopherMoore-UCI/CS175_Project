Asked at the daily press briefing what makes "The Bold and The Beautiful" producer Colleen Bell qualified to serve as U.S. Ambassador to Hungary, White House spokesman Josh Earnest didn't exactly have an explanation. Just hours before, Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, blasted Bell's nomination on the Senate floor. Bell was confirmed to the position Tuesday by a Democrat-led Senate. Earnest said the reason Bell was nominated for the post was because the President "has complete confidence in her ability to represent the United States in that country." " Earnest also denied that Bell's hand in raising millions of dollars for the President's re-election campaign had anything to do with her appointment.
