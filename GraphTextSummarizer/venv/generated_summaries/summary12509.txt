Current leader Kim Jong Un paid tribute Monday to Kim Il Sung, his grandfather, as well as his late father, Kim Jong Il, by visiting the halls where both men lie in state. -- North Korea has upped the temperature on its neighbors, warning in a new threat that it would not give any advance notice before attacking South Korea. Kerry was speaking at the end of a three-day trip that focused on securing fresh commitments from South Korea, China and Japan to try to persuade Pyongyang to return to the negotiating table and renounce nuclear weapons. Pyongyang on Sunday rejected a different proposal for dialogue, one by South Korea last week regarding the North's suspension of activity at the manufacturing zone that the two countries jointly operate. Those measures, along with joint U.S.-South Korean military exercises in South Korea, prompted an intensification in the North's threats.
