Wednesday's cartoons were published a day after hundreds of Muslims took to Twitter to satirize the U.S. magazine Newsweek's cover story on "Muslim Rage" in which the Somali-born writer and former Muslim Ayaan Hirsi Ali said the recent protests represented mainstream Muslim opinion worldwide. France says it will not authorize protests over anti-Islam film Charlie Hebdo journalist Laurent Leger said the magazine did not intend to provoke anger or violence. The cartoons are provoking outrage among the French Muslim community, while other Muslims have accused the magazine of pandering for attention. The issue hit the stands eight days after a video mocking the Muslim prophet triggered angry protests, including one that led to the death of the U.S. ambassador to Libya. That "grotesque film" is "Innocence of Muslims," a video that sat obscure on the Internet until September 11 when rioters, seizing on it, attacked the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, and killed U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans.
