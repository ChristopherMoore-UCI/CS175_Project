Anyway, I guess men and women are just completely different. And while she does all the shopping -- her very favorite hobby -- you can do far more important things like pass gas and watch fistfights on World Star Hip Hop. It's the ePad Femme -- an 8-inch tablet device designed specifically for women, and already preloaded with special female-friendly apps. And that's a big selling point for the manufacturer, who proudly boasts that, unlike all the other touchscreen devices on the market, this thing is the only one designed "exclusively for women." Sure, they made a few assumptions about what women want, but where they skipped out on any actual science and dignity, they've passed the savings on to you.
