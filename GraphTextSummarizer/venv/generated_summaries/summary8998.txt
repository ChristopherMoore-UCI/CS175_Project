The on-loan Manchester City forward, who made his international return for Togo last week, doubled the lead five minutes before the break when he forced in from close range after Villa defender James Collins failed to cut out Bale's teasing near-post cross. Rafael van der Vaart had netted in five successive games after that before missing the win over Fulham, and the Dutchman's return from a hamstring injury gave Tottenham too much potency for a Villa side which included former Spurs fullback Alan Hutton in right midfield to combat the threat of Gareth Bale. But manager Alex McLeish's ploy failed to pay off as Welsh winger Bale caused constant problems, and it was from his scuffed shot after Villa failed to clear a corner that Adebayor acrobatically hooked home the 13th-minute opener. Redknapp had minor heart surgery three weeks ago, but returned earlier than expected to see his side edge above London rivals Chelsea and Newcastle on goal difference. Santander dropped to the bottom on goal difference below Real Sociedad and Granada, whose match against Mallorca on Sunday was called off when a linesman was hit by an object thrown from the crowd.
