Blair said in an interview last month that he would have removed Saddam even without evidence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. -- Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair's one-time media adviser said a 2002 intelligence document that claimed Iraq could launch weapons of mass destruction within 45 minutes was not "sexed up" to exaggerate the case for war. The former spin doctor testified that his former boss was determined to disarm Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. Alastair Campbell was testifying Tuesday at the Iraq war inquiry, an independent set of hearings looking into the decisions that led up to the 2003 invasion and governed Britain's involvement in the war. The current inquiry has the greatest potential to tell the "full story" of the decisions leading up to war, analyst Glen Rangwala of Cambridge University told CNN in November.
