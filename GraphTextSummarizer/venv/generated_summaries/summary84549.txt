Semenya declined to take part in the scheduled post-race interview, reported South African tabloid Sowetan, and her place was taken by IAAF general secretary Pierre Weiss. "The gender verification test is an extremely complex procedure," said IAAF spokesman Nick Davies -- who revealed the question of Semenya's gender was first raised after her astonishing African Junior Championships displays. Athletics South Africa president Leonard Chuene accused South African media of trying to "destroy" Semenya, according to Sowetan -- which described the runner as "our golden girl." -- South African athletics officials have rallied behind controversial new running star Caster Semenya, who won the women's world 800 meters title just hours after the sport's governing body asked for the 18-year-old's gender to be verified. Semenya's masculine build fueled rumors, but the South Africa team manager said there should be no dispute.
