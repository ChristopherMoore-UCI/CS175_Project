Ireland needs funds to shore up balance sheets after its government pumped billions of euros into Irish banks to keep them afloat, effectively nationalizing most of them. Also if yields (interest rates) on Irish government bonds kept rising, the same would probably happen to bonds issued by countries such as Spain and Portugal -- this weakens the finances of banks in those countries (because their large holdings of Spanish and Portuguese bonds are growing less valuable), which will make them inclined to lend less -- which is damaging for the economy. The European Central Bank is lending money to Irish banks because other banks won't. A run on Irish banks -- mass withdrawals by customers worried their bank will go bust -- would have been bad for the eurozone, as it could have forced the EU and IMF to scramble to provide emergency funds within days, rather than in the more orderly, considered way now being organized. Irish banks, like others around the world, loaned money to people who in some cases couldn't pay it back.
