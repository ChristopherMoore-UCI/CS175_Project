Attenborough is perhaps best known for his work on the 1982 film "Gandhi," which won eight Academy Awards, including best picture and best director. British Prime Minister David Cameron tweeted Sunday: "His acting in 'Brighton Rock' was brilliant, his directing of 'Gandhi' was stunning -- Richard Attenborough was one of the greats of cinema." Attenborough began his career as a classically trained English actor and went on to star in such films as "The Great Escape," "Jurassic Park" and a remake of "Miracle on 34th Street." The family is expected to make a statement Monday, Smith told CNN. Attenborough also appeared as Santa Claus in the 1994 remake of "Miracle on 34th Street."
