With three minutes of the session remaining, and with Lewis Hamilton poised to edge out Jenson Button at the top of the standings, Kovalainen ensured it would be a McLaren one-two rather than a British one-two that led the way ahead of Sunday's race. Sebastian Vettel, looking for a small degree of consolation for the year by finishing second to Button in the championship, was fourth quickest in his Red Bull, 0.284 seconds behind Kovalainen. It was still 31 degrees when the second session began at 5pm local time, but on this occasion the following 90 minutes would be played out under a setting sun for the first time in F1 history, and ultimately floodlights as day shifted into night. But that was no surprise as the 20 drivers grew accustomed to the track, culminating in the Finn ending up quicker than his McLaren team-mate by just 0.197 seconds, with Brawn GP's Button 0.234 seconds down on Kovalainen. Ultimately, it was Finn Kovalainen who led the way with a time of one minute 41.307seconds, over 2.5 seconds quicker than Hamilton's best earlier in the day.
