Most clubs insist their squads train on Christmas Day itself ahead of the traditional Boxing Day (December 26) program, while just two days later the likes of Wayne Rooney and Diego Costa are back in action again ahead of a third match on New Year's Day. You have to go "Down Under" to Australia for a pair of Boxing Day events which are forever etched into the sporting calendar. At the bottom of the table, it's also a critical period and statistics point to the team bottom of the EPL at Christmas being relegated, although last season Sunderland escaped. While their EPL counterparts are straining every sinew, Bundesliga players have their feet up, taking a five-week mid-season break with Bayern Munich 11 points clear at the top and heading for yet another German title. Sports fans in the U.S. are also promised a glut of action, with the National Basketball Association (NBA) hosting a daily program with the exception of Christmas Eve.
