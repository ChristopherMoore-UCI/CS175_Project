"Liza Minnelli has valiantly battled substance abuse over the years and whenever she has needed to seek treatment she has done so," said spokesman Scott Gorenstein. The 68-year-old has struggled with addictions to alcohol and painkillers in the past. Actress Liza Minnelli has entered a rehab facility for her addictions, a spokesman said. Minnelli won an Oscar in 1973 for her performance in "Cabaret." "She is currently making excellent progress at an undisclosed facility."
