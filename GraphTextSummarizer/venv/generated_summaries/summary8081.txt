-- With Google Glass, a new quest to cure death and driverless cars, it can be easy to forget what Google's primary business is: search. The company is continuing to focus heavily on voice search, improving its conversational skills on the Web and in search apps. "We believe that voice will be fundamental to building interactions with future devices that we will see," said Amit Singhal, Google's senior vice president of search. "Even though a lot of thing are different at Google, the core is still the same," she said, citing the company's commitment to improving search, being a global company and thinking big. "Google gives me back an hour of my life every month," said Singhal of Google Instant.
