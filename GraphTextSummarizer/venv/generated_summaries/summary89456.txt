"When the animals come into Kenya there is this big influx of poachers," says Brian Heath, CEO of the Mara Conservancy that manages animal protection in the border regions of the park. They have had plenty of funding in normal years, but this is not a normal year in Kenya. "If the numbers of animals in the migration were to reduce below a certain number then that migration may not be sustained into Kenya," Heath warns. Â» "If we cannot run our operations as normal, then we fear that poachers may invade the park, kill the animals and then at the end of the day we do not have animals. As a result, the Mara Conservancy is running at a massive shortfall and has had to scale back on anti-poaching efforts.
