To help revitalize ballet in the 21st century, New York University is opening the Center for Ballet and the Arts on September 22. I was going to this little ballet school situated above a tavern, and we had live piano music, which is really rare for ballet class at that age. The important question now is: What is the place of ballet in a rapidly changing and high-tech society where people like to watch three-minute YouTube videos or check text messages constantly? You can say things through dance that you could never express in words, and ballet has the ability to touch people on a deep, abstract level. What do you say to people who say ballet is boring?
