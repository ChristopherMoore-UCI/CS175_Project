Several Hungarian advocacy groups are now voicing "dismay" with the regional police department's efforts, saying the campaign blames women, rather than characterizing them as potential victims who should be protected. The combination of the video of partying young women and the statement outraged a coalition of Hungarian women's rights groups, which claims it "completely ignores that sexual violence" happens because of a decision by the attacker, not the victim. In a statement posted alongside the video, police say, "Experience has shown that, in order to prevent such acts (of violence), how women communicate ... plays a huge role. "The mission of the police is to protect and serve the public, rather than blaming the victims, or potential victims, or to pass on the responsibility on them," the groups said. These kind of films evoke misogyny and contempt for women."
