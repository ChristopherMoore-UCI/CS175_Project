And while Gingrich burst to the top of the pack in Iowa after the collapse of Herman Cain's campaign last fall, Iowa GOP insiders don't think he built the kind of political apparatus in the state that could buttress him as he's come under unrelenting fire. The CNN Iowa GOP insiders were surveyed from the evening of December 27 through the morning of December 30. While the 76-year-old congressman has been able to cultivate a devoted following with a blend of libertarian and isolationist appeals, there's a sense among many Iowa GOP insiders that that kind of exotic brew ultimately makes him unacceptable to most Republicans in a primary and most general election voters in the fall. In the CNN Iowa GOP insiders survey, a solid majority of the 64 Republican political pros thought Romney would finish first over Paul. As the candidates dashed around the state making their closing arguments to a volatile caucus electorate, CNN surveyed 64 Iowa GOP insiders -- including state legislators, local elected and party officials, senior advisers to Republican Gov. Terry Branstad, business and conservative interest group leaders, veterans of previous caucus campaigns, and a variety of other party activists -- to assess the shape of the GOP race.
