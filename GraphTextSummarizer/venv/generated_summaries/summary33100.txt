During Thursday morning's hearing, he said he is unemployed and living with his mother in Brooklyn, Judge Kelly Banach said. He was arrested after a friend helped facilitate his surrender in the crowded parking lot of a convenience store in Bethlehem, New York, according to Deputy Police Commissioner Paul Browne. He was previously charged with vehicular manslaughter, but the Brooklyn District Attorney's office dropped that charge, according to defense attorney Scott Brettschneider. He was arrested Wednesday in nearby Bethlehem in connection with the Sunday wreck that killed Nathan and Raizy Glauber, both 21. -- A suspect in a weekend hit-and-run crash that killed a Brooklyn couple and their unborn child pleaded not guilty to criminally negligent homicide and leaving the scene of an accident, his lawyer said.
