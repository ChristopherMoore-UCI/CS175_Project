The bulletin says the the list includes target suggestions ranging from U.S.-based think tanks to military contractors. The FBI said the list was spurred by a June 3 video featuring American-born al Qaeda propagandist Adam Gadahn "in which he encourages acts of individual jihad." The official did not know if all the individuals on the list of possible targets had been briefed by law enforcement or whether they had been given any recommendations to protect their safety. That led other forum members to start suggesting possible targets. The FBI bulletins are intended for use by law enforcement and homeland security officials.
