-- A fisherman who was hospitalized after becoming ill while cleaning up oil in the Gulf of Mexico has filed a temporary restraining order in federal court against oil company BP. He denied accusations from Clint Guidry, president of the Louisiana Shrimpers Association, that BP has been threatening workers who speak out about health concerns. John Wunstell Jr., is asking BP to give the workers masks and not harass workers who publicly voice their health concerns. BP has not supplied workers with masks when they work near the oil and dispersants. According to Guidry from the shrimpers' association, BP told workers they were not allowed to wear masks.
