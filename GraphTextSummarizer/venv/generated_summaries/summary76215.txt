The NASA spacecraft, which is designed to seek out other worlds but hit a snag when parts failed last year, found another planet thanks to some nifty repurposing by the space agency and its partners, NASA confirmed Thursday. "Last summer, the possibility of a scientifically productive mission for Kepler after its reaction wheel failure in its extended mission was not part of the conversation," said Paul Hertz, NASA's astrophysics division director, in a statement. "K2 is uniquely positioned to dramatically refine our understanding of these alien worlds and further define the boundary between rocky worlds like Earth and ice giants like Neptune," said Kepler/K2 project scientist Steve Howell in NASA's press release. But it adds another tidbit to our knowledge of the universe -- something scientists didn't think was possible when a part of the craft broke down last year. The recently found world is named HIP 116454b and has a diameter 2.5 times the size of Earth's, said NASA in a press release.
