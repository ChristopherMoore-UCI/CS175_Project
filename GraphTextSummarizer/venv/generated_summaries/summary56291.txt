The move stems from tensions between the two countries over a June 28 military-led coup in which Honduran President Jose Manuel Zelaya was replaced by congressional leader Roberto Micheletti. Riot police stand in front of marchers supporting ousted Honduran President Manuel Zelaya on Tuesday. The congress named Micheletti provisional president shortly after Zelaya was detained by the military and sent into exile. Micheletti said Zelaya was not overthrown in a coup, but rather removed from power through constitutional means. When Honduran Ambassador Carmen Eleonora Ortez Williams, who had been appointed by Zelaya, did not protest the coup, Argentina took exception.
