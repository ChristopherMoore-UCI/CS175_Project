The discovery came on the same day a Japanese court approved a government plan to restart two reactors at the Sendai nuclear power plant in Kagoshima prefecture, more than four years after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. "There might be terrorism attempts in the future at the Olympics and G7 Summit using drones," Suga said. Police say the drone was equipped with a small camera, smoke flares and a plastic bottle containing small traces of a radioactive material believed to be cesium, a common byproduct of nuclear reactors. A bizarre and alarming discovery is raising concerns in Japan about the potential for terrorism involving drones.
