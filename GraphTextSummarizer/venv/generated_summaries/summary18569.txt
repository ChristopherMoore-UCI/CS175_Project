A hearing in the case was scheduled for Tuesday afternoon in federal court in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. -- Five people, including three police officers, have been indicted on charges related to the beating death of a Latino man in rural Pennsylvania in July 2008, the Justice Department said Tuesday. "The evidence suggests that Mr. Ramirez was targeted, beaten and killed because he was Mexican," Rendell wrote. Shenandoah Police Chief Matthew Nestor and Lt. William Moyer and Officer Jason Hayes are charged with conspiring to obstruct justice in the Ramirez investigation. The indictments come almost six months after a Schuylkill County jury acquitted two teens of aggravated assault and one of murder in the death of Luis Ramirez.
