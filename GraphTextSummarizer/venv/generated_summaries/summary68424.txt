The U.S. Consulate General in Ciudad Juarez issued a warning this year for American citizens in the city and other parts of the state of Chihuahua. Rosa Williams, 35, and her son, Pablo Noe, 19, were among four people who were killed by assailants armed with an AK-47 rifle and 9 mm pistol who opened fire on a blue 2004 Dodge Durango SUV in which they were riding, said Arturo Sandoval, a spokesman for the prosecutor's office in the Mexican state of Chihuahua. Juarez is considered a flash point in Mexico's nearly five-year-long war on organized crime. The attack happened Saturday in front of dozens of witnesses on a busy road in Ciudad Juarez, which is just across the U.S.-Mexico border from El Paso, Texas. -- Two U.S. citizens -- a mother and her son --- have been killed in the violence-plagued Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, authorities said.
