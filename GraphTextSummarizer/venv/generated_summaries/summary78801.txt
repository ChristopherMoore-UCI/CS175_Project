The lawsuit, which also names Mortenson's Central Asia Institute charity, was filed Thursday in a federal court in Montana by attorneys Alexander Blewett III and his son, Anders Blewett, the latter of whom is a Democratic member of that state's legislature. However, in 2009, less than half of that money actually went to building schools in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and $1.7 million went to promote Mortenson's books, according to the institute's board of directors. Alexander Blewett III, a Helena-based attorney, said the intent is to eventually open up the suit to anyone who'd bought a book by Mortenson or donated to the Montana-based charity he heads. " Yet the lawsuit filed this week claim that both Mortenson and his institute "repeatedly fabricated material about his activities and work in Pakistan and Afghanistan ... to induce unsuspecting individuals to purchase his books and donate to CAI. Several weeks earlier, when a critical "60 Minutes" segment came out, Mortenson defended his stories and charity.
