"Andrus was our primary person of interest who was subsequently arrested and booked for the crime," San Francisco Police Department spokeswoman Officer Grace Gatpandan said Monday. "We are very disturbed by the facts of this case and are working with the San Francisco Police Department to secure the evidence necessary to prove this case beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law," the San Francisco District Attorney's Office said last week. After they found body parts inside a suitcase on a San Francisco sidewalk, police called him a suspect and accused him of murder. "The case is under investigation with the cause and manner of death pending," the San Francisco Office of the Chief Medical Examiner said Monday Andrus was arrested last month but never charged. Mark Andrus, 54, died Saturday after admitting himself to a hospital the same day, San Francisco Police said.
