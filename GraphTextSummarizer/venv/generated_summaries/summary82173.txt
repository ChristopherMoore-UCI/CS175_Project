The key to keeping Ukraine unified is to take away support for Russian annexation. Even without sanctions, the deployment of troops to Crimea has already affected the Russian economy. Economic sanctions have little independent usefulness for the pursuit of non-economic goals. On March 3 the Moscow stock market fell more than 10% which, as a Reuters article pointed out, wiped nearly $60 billion off the value of Russian companies -- more than the $51 billion spent on the Winter Olympics in Sochi. We certainly wouldn't let Russia use economic threats to dictate our foreign policy, no matter what the economic cost; why should we expect the Russian leadership to budge?
