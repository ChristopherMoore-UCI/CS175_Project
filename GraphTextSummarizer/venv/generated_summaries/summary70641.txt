Gibraltar, who only became a full UEFA member last year and are not recognized by FIFA, have only one full-time professional in its lineup, Scott Wiseman from third-flight English side Preston. World Cup hero Thomas Muller started the scoring and added a second, while fellow Bayern Munich star Mario Gotze was also on the score sheet before half time. The fourth, and only goal of the half, came on 67 minutes when Lukas Podolski's cross was turned into his own net by visiting defender Yogan Santos. But it put on a battling performance against a near full strength team picked by Germany coach Joachim Low and deployed in an attacking 3-5-2 formation. Romania strengthened its position at the top with a 2-0 home win over Northern Ireland with defender Paul Papp grabbing both its late goals.
