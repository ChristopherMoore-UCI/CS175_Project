As for their top priority on an engaging workspace, Generation Y blends their personal and private life, and they like a workplace to feel residential and like home, says O'Neill, explaining that baby boomers don't expect or want spaces that evoke the emotional connectedness of home. You are seeing more open meeting spaces, lounge furniture near circulation spaces and that type of thing. "Baby boomers like structured, face-to-face meetings," says O'Neill. " Generation X (those born between 1965 and 1978) is a group that grew up with financial and work insecurity and has little in common with Generation Y or baby boomers, believes O'Neill. "We are facing a huge generational shift, as baby boomers (born between 1946 and 1964) leave the workforce, and that means we have to rethink our workspace," says Michael O'Neill, senior director of workplace research for Knoll, Inc.
