If North Korea attacks South Korea, it's effectively an attack on the United States. The message that China is a nation that could strike North Korea at the "back of the head" has been passed down over the years to Kim Jong Un, his grandson. Inheriting his father's position at such a young age -- he's believed to be in his 20s --  many in North Korea may question whether Kim has the clout to lead. Starting from Kim Il Sung, the founder of North Korea, the North Korean regime has never fully trusted China. While North Korea has an estimated 1.2 million soldiers, making it the third largest military behind China and United States, this is only a number.
