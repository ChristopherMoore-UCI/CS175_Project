Will the chemical weapons, or the other possible weapons of mass destruction that inspectors discover, be destroyed in place, or will they be taken out of country for destruction or safeguarding? -- Here's the reality of the situation: A diplomatic solution to Syria's use of chemical weapons will include "boots on the ground." As a starting point, Syria has to declare what chemical weapons it has and where they're located before any inspectors secured by soldiers step onto Syrian soil. Minimally, there has to be a cease-fire in Syria's civil war. Finally, every party involved in Syria's civil war wants al-Assad's chemical stockpile.
