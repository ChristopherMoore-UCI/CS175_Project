Bulgarian Grigor Dimitrov, like Murray and Nishikori hoping to seal a place in the end of season ATP Tour Finals in London, also went out to Frenchman Julien Benneteau in straight sets, beaten 7-5 6-3. In the final match on court Wednesday, Roger Federer narrowly avoided going the same way, taken to a third set tiebreak by Argentina's Leonardo Mayer. But with just two days of rest, he returned to action against countryman Feliciano Lopez Wednesday and was unsurprisingly below par -- losing the match in straight sets 6-3, 7-6 despite a spirited second-set fightback despite his ailment. World No. 1 Novak Djokovic clinched his 50th win of the season Wednesday as he beat rising star Dominic Thiem, 6-3 6-4. Federer once saved seven match points in a match against Scott Draper in 2003 before going on to win and after his latest escape has reached the third round where he will face Roberto Bautista Agut.
