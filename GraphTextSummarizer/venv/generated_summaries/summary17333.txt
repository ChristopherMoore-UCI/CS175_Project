This conventional chauvinism aside, and adopting confessionals with Mark's long-haired priest (William H. Macy) as a comic safety valve, the film is refreshingly frank about the nuts and bolts of physical intercourse, as well as the more complex emotional exchange that is taking place. Lewin suggests she too is touched by the experience; not by the sex itself, but rather the effect it has on Mark, and his ability to put it into words. We've seen films about severely disabled artists before (Daniel Day-Lewis picking up a paintbrush in "My Left Foot," Daniel Auteuil writing his autobiography a blink at a time in "The Diving Bell and the Butterfly") but rarely about their sex lives. Hawkes, known for breakout roles in indie hits "Me and You and Everyone We Know," "Winter's Bone" and "Martha Marcy May Marlene," is terrific here: Writer-director Ben Lewin, a veteran who has worked mostly (but intermittently) in TV, builds on the sexual candor pioneered largely by cable series and Judd Apatow-style comedies over the past decade or so.
