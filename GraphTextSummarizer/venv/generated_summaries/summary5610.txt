Anne Frank, the young Jewish girl who detailed her thoughts and her family's life while hiding in an attic from the Nazis in Amsterdam, can now be seen in rare video that has been posted on the Internet. Anne Frank got a diary as a gift shortly before her family went into hiding from the Nazis. Other videos show the chestnut tree that Anne saw every day from her window and the church bells that rang while she was in hiding. On the V&A YouTube channel, you can see a master hat maker craft a haute-couture hat by hand, from start to finish, for designer Stephen Jones. The only known footage of Frank, who died in a concentration camp weeks before World War II ended, can be seen on a special YouTube channel run by the Anne Frank Museum.
