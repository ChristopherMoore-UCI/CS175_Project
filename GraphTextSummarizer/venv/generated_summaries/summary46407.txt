The incident occurred near the El Tovar hotel in a village on the canyon's South Rim, park spokeswoman Shannan Marcak said. "Upon arriving at the scene, investigators found tire tracks leading to the edge behind the Thunderbird Lodge and received reports of a single occupant in a blue passenger car driving over the edge," the statement said. The Grand Canyon, a world famous landmark, receives close to 5 million visitors yearly, according to the National Park Service Web site. The Arizona park's regional communications center received several reports of a car driving off the edge about 6 a.m. Monday, according to a written statement. Typically, Marcak said, such investigations take at least a few days.
