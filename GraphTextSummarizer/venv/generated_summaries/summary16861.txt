Walking among the game developers, the space festooned with posters, drawings and 3-D renderings, Vu becomes animated talking about new characters, new weapons and new games in the works. Three decades later, Ben started his own company, SkyVu (pronounced sky-voo) Entertainment, and used these stories as his inspiration for a mobile game called "Battle Bears." "The Battle Bears is a sci-fi journey from one end of futuristic America to the other end," Vu said. He received a master's degree in animation at CalArts and worked on the Oscar-nominated animated film "Coraline" before starting SkyVu in the basement of a rented home in suburban Omaha. His older brother, Hoa, joined the Army, rising to the rank of captain before co-founding SkyVu with Ben in 2008. At 37, Vu is an unlikely tech entrepreneur.
