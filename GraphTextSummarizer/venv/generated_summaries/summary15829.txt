In 2013, Pistole announced the TSA would allow small knives and certain other banned items onto aircraft, saying their risk had been mitigated by locked cockpit doors. -- Transportation Security Administration chief John Pistole said Thursday he will resign at the end of the year, ending his run as the longest-serving administrator of the government agency entrusted with keeping terrorists off planes, trains and other means of transport. During his tenure, Pistole became a forceful advocate of "risk-based security" in which the government sought to mitigate risks by taking certain precautions and of the TSA's PreCheck program, which employed that philosophy to reduce checkpoint lines. In a statement Thursday, Pistole thanked TSA employees for their work. On Thursday, some members of Congress and employee groups lined up to give accolades to Pistole.
