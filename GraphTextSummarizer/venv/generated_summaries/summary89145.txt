The International Maritime Organization, which is tasked with the international supervision of passenger ships, has also been under fire in the wake of the disaster. At the congressional hearings in March, he told the Senate committee there were more than a dozen incidents of passenger ships sinking and 99 ships running aground between 1973 and 2011. Carnival, the parent line of Costa, and several other cruise lines now require safety instruction, referred to as muster drills, before leaving port. Rockefeller and other critics of the industry say that cruise lines that are headquartered in the United States but have their ships registered elsewhere are getting a free ride on the backs of U.S. taxpayers, placing demands on federal agencies such as Immigration, Customs and the Coast Guard, which are charged with oversight when those ships enter and leave U.S. ports. Under the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, known as SOLAS, there are many mandated standards for ship operators, but critics -- including U.S. lawmakers -- point to the fact that there are also many codes, guidelines and recommendations that are voluntary.
