A short statement, issued by manager Erik Kritzer on Wednesday, did not say when or where Reynolds entered rehab. "After a recent back surgery, Mr. Reynolds felt like he was going through hell and after a while, realized he was a prisoner of prescription pain pills," Kritzer said. -- Burt Reynolds checked into a drug rehab clinic "to regain control of his life" after becoming addicting to painkillers prescribed following back surgery, his manager said. "Mr. Reynolds hopes his story will help others in a similar situation," Kritzer said. " Reynolds was an Academy Award nominee and Golden Globe winner for his role as a porn producer in the 1997 hit movie "Boogie Nights."
