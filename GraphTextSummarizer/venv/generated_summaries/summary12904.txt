The 25-year-old from Baghdad is one of the city's small band of freerunners, who take every opportunity to practice parkour in a city striving for normality and currently facing a resurgence of deadly violence. From the streets of Paris in the 1990s, where parkour was first popularized, to Zawra park in Iraq's capital, freerunning has become a global phenomenon. " "I love parkour because this sport is the art of movement and freedom and this art has made me know true freedom in this difficult life." In Baghdad, the challenges are even greater than in other cities. The sport evolved from French military training and involves running through urban environments using only the body to overcome obstacles and objects.
