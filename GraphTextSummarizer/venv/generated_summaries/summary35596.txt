Lawyers for Jackson's mother, Katherine; and children, Prince, Paris and Blanket, argue that AEG Live is liable because the company hired and supervised Dr. Conrad Murray, who used a surgical anesthetic in a fatal effort to treat the singer's insomnia as he prepared for the comeback concerts. Jury selection concluded Tuesday afternoon with selection of six alternates to back up the 12 jurors chosen Monday. The trial, which could last three or four months, is expected to include testimony from Prince and Paris Jackson, the singer's two oldest children, and a list of celebrity witnesses. -- Opening statements in the Michael Jackson wrongful death trial will be heard Monday, April 29, with the first testimony soon to follow, the judge announced Tuesday. Michael Jackson's mother and three children are suing AEG Live, claiming the concert promoter was liable in the pop star's June 25, 2009, death.
