Last year he was shot in the abdomen whilst protesting against the rule of then President Ali Abdullah Saleh, who stepped down after hundreds of protestors were killed by his security forces. In 2009 he was handed a lifetime ban for insulting the former president Zine al Abidine Ben Ali. "These Olympics will happen while there will be a new president so it's a better feeling that gives a push to better represent our country," says Khousrof, who would protest every day against the rule of President Saleh until he was shot. In the past, sporting glory produced conflicting emotions; on the one hand immense pride at flying the flag for their people; on the other revulsion that success would be exploited as a victory for the regime. He is just one of hundreds of sportsmen and women who have battled to secure their place at the Olympic Games as revolution and war waged around them during the Arab Spring, toppling dictators from Tunis to Sana'a and giving them hope, for the first time, for a brighter future.
