While South Africa has seen a surge in corporate opportunities for talented businessmen and women, "the economy is just too small to accommodate the kind of jobs they want to do," Remmington told CNN. For example, Lewis-Gayle said, China is investing heavily in Africa, which is creating several opportunities. It isn't just creating and finding opportunities, but funding them as well, that can keep young executives from going home. "This group of people, despite how important they are to the continent, are having the darndest time connecting to opportunities back home," said Okendo Lewis-Gayle. It can be hard for them to commit to returning to the even smaller economies of their home countries, says Krishna Patel, HSBC's CEO for Africa.
