So I always feel when I try to write realistic fiction for adults, that maybe I don't have enough life experience, even though I'm 54. How is writing for children different than writing for adults? But when I write something that has a magic base to it, I put in everything I do know about the infinite varieties and subtleties and ambivalences in adult behavior, but nobody can call me out and say, "You don't even know who human beings are" because I've couched it. Maguire's "Wicked" series puts a spin on the classic "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz" tale, bringing in corruption, political prisoners and war. So the novel's really in some ways about character and taking control of the destiny of your own character.
