Dallas police spokesman Jeff Cotner said Al-Jumaili, who recently immigrated to the U.S., had never seen snow and "just like all of us, a pretty snowfall brings the child out in us." There is "extreme heartache ... and no shortage of sadness for this beautiful young man who had just come to this country 20 days ago," said Alia Salem, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations in the Dallas and Fort Worth area. An Iraqi man watching his first snowfall in his new American hometown was shot and killed by an unknown assailant, according to Dallas police. In black-and-white soundless surveillance video, one person who appears to be carrying a rifle is seen running just ahead of a second person, Dallas police Officer Monica Cordova said. Cotner said police are conducting tests to find out whether more than one rifle was used in the shooting, but he said he could not reveal the make or model of the weapon.
