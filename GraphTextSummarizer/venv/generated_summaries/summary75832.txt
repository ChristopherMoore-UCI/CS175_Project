Large amounts of money held by the Libyan regime in foreign bank accounts were frozen by the council in February and March. The United States will support an effort by several members of the U.N. Security Council to override the United Nations' sanctions committee and allow countries to free up frozen Libyan assets to speedily provide funds for the Libyan opposition's National Transitional Council. The Obama administration has tried for days to get approval from the U.N. sanctions committee to unfreeze $1 billion to $1.5 billion worth of Libyan assets, but South Africa has been blocking that move. The resolution would also lift sanctions from banks and other Libyan entities. Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi funded South Africa's African National Congress -- now the ruling party -- when it was a liberation movement fighting the white apartheid regime.
