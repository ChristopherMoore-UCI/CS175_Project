World No.2 Scott was bidding to match Robert Allenby's 2005 feat of winning the Australian PGA, Australian Masters and Australian Open crowns in the same season, but instead McIlroy took advantage of some late lapses to capture his only title of 2013. But he secured one of three 2014 British Open Championship qualifying spots on offer this week, with the others claimed by compatriots Bryden Macpherson and Rhein Gibson. " U.S. Masters champion Scott looked a heavy favorite to finish the season on a historic high, but was let down by his putter. Scott might have moved two clear of McIlroy but he three putted the 16th and lipped out a birdie effort on the 17th. Still leading by a shot playing the last, Scott's approach went past the flag and a poor chip left him a 40 footer for par, which he missed, leaving the door open for two-time major winner McIlroy.
