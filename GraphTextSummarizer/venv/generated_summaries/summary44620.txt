"I think we have a hint from Italy that they may not seek her extradition," Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz told CNN "New Day Saturday. Would the United States extradite Amanda Knox to Italy, where an Italian court found her guilty Thursday of murdering Briton Meredith Kercher? He added, "I don't see why they wouldn't." Dershowitz told CNN last March that, if an extradition request is made and Knox somehow avoids being sent back, "she remains a prisoner in the United States, because Interpol will put a warrant out for her and, if she travels anywhere outside the United States, she'll be immediately arrested and turned over to Italy." One example of apparent media sympathy, if not support, is a photograph published Saturday in the New York Times showing ABC Anchor Robin Roberts holding the hand of the 26-year-old convicted murderer. Citing privacy and confidentiality concerns, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf declined to say whether Italy has requested that Knox be extradited.
