"There is no doubt that the surgery performed in Pakistan was life-saving," Dr. Dave Rosser, medical director of the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, UK, said Wednesday at a news conference. Malala has made impressive strides and faced her medical treatment with bravery, Rosser said. "It was Malala's final decision," Rosser said. "The bone will be removed from under the skin in her stomach and cleaned up and sterilized and given to Malala," Rosser said. Photos: Malala and the women of Pakistan
