-- As the United Nations was preparing Friday to debate a resolution branding Israeli settlement activity in the West Bank as illegal, Palestinian officials called Obama administration efforts to head off the vote as evidence that American policy is "biased" and "seriously wrong. " "This is a moment of truth because very clearly the Americans so far have placed their strategic alliance with Israel and the legal cover for Israeli violations above their own interests," said veteran Palestinian legislator and PLO executive committee member Hanan Ashrawi. "The Americans have very clearly demonstrated to Palestinians, to Arab public opinion, and to world public opinion that they are biased to the point of destruction," Ashrawi told CNN, echoing an argument made by many Palestinian officials. "The legitimacy and strength of any leadership comes from the people not from American approval or disapproval and the Americans Since the breakdown of American-brokered talks with Israel in September over the issue of settlements, the Palestinian Authority has been pursuing a policy aimed at unilaterally declaring a Palestinian state by September based on borders from 1967 and in recent months has won recognition from a number of South American countries.
