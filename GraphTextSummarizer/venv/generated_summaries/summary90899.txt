Since the club was taken over by Qatari owners last year, PSG have broken the French transfer record to buy Argentine playmaker Javier Pastore for â‚¬43 million, employed Brazilian Leonardo as sports director and brought in Carlo Ancelotti as coach. Second-half goals by Edinson Cavani and Marek Hamsik gave Napoli their first Italian Cup win since 1987 when Diego Maradona led the team in an unprecedented period of success for the club. Montpellier only needed a draw but John Utaka scored twice to give them a 2-1 win at bottom club Auxerre, whose home fans twice held up the game by throwing tennis balls, toilet rolls and flares onto the pitch. With Juve trailing 1-0 and struggling to create chances, the 37-year-old came off to warm applause to be replaced by Simone Pepe, who five minutes later came close to fashioning an equalizer only for his deflected effort to be kept our by the legs of goalkeeper Morgan De Sanctis. Napoli had gone ahead in the 62nd minute when Ezequiel Lavezzi won a penalty after goalkeeper Marco Storari's foul and Cavani converted.
