" An opposition Web site, NoroozNews, said government officials took several activists into custody Monday, including some close advisors to opposition leader and former presidential candidate Mir Hossein Mousavi. Mousavi's Web site reported that his nephew, Seyed Ali Mousavi, was killed in the demonstrations by a shot to the heart. Tehran Police Chief Azizollah Rajabzadeh denied that any protesters were killed by security forces. The toll was the result of clashes that broke out between demonstrators and security forces as large crowds gathered for Ashura, a major religious observance that marks the death of Imam Hussein, grandson of Prophet Mohammed, as a martyr. An Iranian national security official has called for demonstrators to be arrested following deadly weekend anti-government protests in Tehran.
