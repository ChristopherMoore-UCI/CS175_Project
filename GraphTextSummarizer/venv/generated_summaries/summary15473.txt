Last month, the U.S. Senate failed to approve $1.25 billion for the settlement between the U.S. Agriculture Department and black farmers, prompting finger-pointing by members of both parties and outrage among many black farmers. Under a federal judge's terms dating to 1999, qualified farmers could receive $50,000 each to settle claims of racial bias. A 1997 case against the Agriculture Department, Pigford v. Glickman, was settled out of court 11 years ago, but tens of thousands of farmers missed the filing deadline to submit claims. Boyd said black farmers are losing land at a rate three times faster than other agricultural workers. "Suffering is an understatement of what is going on with black farmers," John Boyd said in front of a federal courthouse in lower Manhattan.
