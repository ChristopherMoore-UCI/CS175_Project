-- U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is urging countries in the Persian Gulf region to support Iraq's newly created government as she prepares to head to an international forum on development and the environment. If other countries in the region do not acknowledge Iraq's new "inclusive government," Clinton said, "that would be a great mistake." "What we see is Iraq increasingly asserting itself. Clinton also addressed Lebanon, where members of the powerful Hezbollah movement and its allies resigned from the Cabinet Wednesday, bringing down the government of Prime Minister Saad Hariri. Before her stop in Oman, she made a surprise visit Tuesday to poverty-stricken Yemen, a key al Qaeda battleground and planning center in recent years. And I think when you cross the line from expressing opinions ... into taking action that's violent action, that is a hallmark of extremism -- whether it comes from the right, the left, from al Qaeda, from anarchists, whoever it is -- that is a form of extremism," she said.
