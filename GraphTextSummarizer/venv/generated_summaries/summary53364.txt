One of Hollywood's most bankable stars, Del Toro has made a name for himself playing dark and brooding characters in movies like "21 Grams," "The Usual Suspects," and "Traffic," for which he won an Oscar. Che's life "is what movies are made of," Del Toro told CNN. The decision to make "Che" was an easy one, Benicio Del Toro says. "I have to say it probably is the most difficult movie I've ever made, and I've made a few," Del Toro says of his starring role in director Steven Soderbergh's Spanish-language biopic. Benicio Del Toro stars as Latin American revolutionary Ernesto "Che" Guevara.
