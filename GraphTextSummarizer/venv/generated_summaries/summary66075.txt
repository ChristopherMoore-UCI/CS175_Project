Bosnia and Herzegovina has a stable macro-economic environment that includes a strong convertible currency, low inflation and the most developed banking system in southeastern Europe. We were committed to building a university with a multi-ethnic body of students who will be future leaders in business and government and who have a shared vision of the country's successful integration into Europe. Tributes to Richard Holbrooke, architect of Bosnian peace Bosnia has signed a Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU and is well on its way to NATO membership. The fact that investments in Bosnia and Herzegovina have grown indicates that investors have confidence in Bosnia, even before NATO membership, and these early investors will reap the greatest rewards. It is true that after the war, Bosnia entered into a transitional phase with a corrupt administration and an economic environment that discouraged foreign investment, but many difficulties with post-war corruption are behind us.
