We should focus American power on our core interests, and call on other countries to take responsibility for their own defense. The figure rises by hundreds of dollars when one accounts for homeland security, payments to veterans, and the few billion dollars tucked away in the Department of Energy for the nation's bloated nuclear arsenal. It is working as designed: Other countries do not spend enough to satisfy their defense needs. All told, every American will likely shell out more than $2,700 on spending classified as national defense. American troops will continue to be tasked with policing the world, and American taxpayers will be on the hook to pay for it.
