" The FIA has been eager to encourage motorsport to lead the motor industry in harnessing the potential of electric engines, with innovations such as the KERS system -- which harnesses braking energy to provide an engine boost every lap -- already being adapted to mass production cars. "We see this as a great opportunity to create a new and exciting spectacle mixing racing, clean energy and sustainability, looking to the future," Agag said. "This new competition at the heart of major cities is certain to attract a new audience," Todt told the FIA website. "This spectacular series will offer both entertainment and a new opportunity to share the FIA values and objectives of clean energy, mobility and sustainability with a wider and younger audience as well. -- A new global racing series is launching with hopes of rivaling Formula One, but there is one major difference -- the cars will all have electric engines.
