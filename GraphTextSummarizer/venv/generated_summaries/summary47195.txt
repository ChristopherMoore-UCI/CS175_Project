African Cup of Nations qualifiers involving its national team, Guinea and Liberia have also been relocated by the Confederation of African Football. Guinea international Lass Bangoura pulled out of a key African Cup of Nations match against Ghana Saturday because his club teammates were worried he could contract Ebola. "My teammates were afraid and at the end of practice I spoke with the (Guinea) coach Michel Dussuyer and said there was a problem, because of Ebola. Bangoura has now returned to his club, who are based in the Spanish capital Madrid where earlier this week a nurse became the first person in Europe to contract Ebola outside of West Africa. He was concerned that his withdrawal could lead to problems for his family back home in Guinea.
