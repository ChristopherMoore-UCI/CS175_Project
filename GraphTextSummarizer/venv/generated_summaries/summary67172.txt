-- Karachi, the financial heart of Pakistan, was shut down Wednesday because of political tension that followed various incidents of violence sparked by the arrest of a prominent politician in a crackdown on crime. Speaking to CNN from London, MQM spokesman Muhammad Anwar called the incident "a travesty of justice" and said the Rangers' operation is politically motivated with a bias toward the PPP, former President Asif Ali Zardari's party, which now holds a majority in the provincial government of Sindh, where Karachi is located. There had been a rare show of inter-party unity backing the new government's drive to send Pakistan's paramilitary force, The Pakistan Rangers, into Karachi. Only last week newly elected Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif had visited the country's largest and most populous city to ensure political unity in tackling the scourge of militant-backed crime rings and politically affiliated gangs. Omar Hamid Khan, a spokesman for the interior minister, told CNN that the hostile reaction to the arrest is "temporary" and that there will always be "hiccups" but "the objectivity of the operation will not be lost sight of."
