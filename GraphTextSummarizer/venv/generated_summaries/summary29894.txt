He was not found in the home when the investigators moved in Monday morning, Seattle police spokesman Jeff Kappel told reporters. The night before the shootings, Clemmons had threatened to kill police officers, but witnesses did not report those threats until after the slayings, Troyer said on ABC's "Good Morning America. Clemmons is thought to have slipped away from a home in Seattle's Leschi neighborhood Sunday night, before police surrounded the residence for about 12 hours. He is wanted in what police called the ambush-style killing of four police officers from Lakewood, near Tacoma, about 40 miles south of Seattle. His escape was "an unlucky thing for us, and a lucky thing for him," Troyer said Monday night.
