The pontiff's nephew, Emanuel Horacio Bergoglio, was critically injured in the crash on a highway in Cordoba province, said Carina Ferreyra, a Cordoba provincial police spokeswoman. A car driven by Bergoglio struck a truck about 12:30 a.m., killing his sons -- Jose Bergoglio, 8 months, and Antonio Bergoglio, 2 -- and his wife, Valeria Carmona, 36. Emanuel Bergoglio, 35, was taken to a hospital in Cordoba, where he was in critical condition Tuesday morning, Ferreyra said. " Pope Francis, the former Jorge Mario Bergoglio, served the Roman Catholic Church in Argentina for 43 years, including 15 years as archbishop of Buenos Aires. "The Pope has been informed of the tragic accident that took place in Argentina involving some of his family members," said the spokesman, the Rev. Federico Lombardi.
