Relief groups and state agencies are registering volunteers to help with recovery efforts in storm-damaged areas in the days and weeks to come. There is an immediate appeal for additional help at Red Cross shelters. Become a Red Cross Disaster Volunteer and support future Red Cross disaster response efforts. The organization is preliminarily registering volunteers and will be organizing disaster recovery projects after the storm passes. Red Cross volunteers have been dispatched from across the country to help the East Coast.
