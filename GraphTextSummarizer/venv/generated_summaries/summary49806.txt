Ali, 72, was admitted to an undisclosed hospital on December 20 for what spokesman Bob Gunnell  initially said was a mild case of pneumonia. "After further observation and testing, doctors determined that Ali was suffering from a severe urinary tract infection, not pneumonia as originally diagnosed," Gunnell said Wednesday. Boxing legend Muhammad Ali was released from a hospital Tuesday night after an 18-day stay for treatment of a urinary tract infection, a spokesman said Wednesday. He said Ali was looking forward to celebrating his 73rd birthday on January 17 with his family and friends. Shortly thereafter, he changed his name to Muhammad Ali to reflect his conversion to Islam.
