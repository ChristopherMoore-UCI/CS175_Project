-- North Korea on Wednesday blamed South Korea for driving them "to the brink of war," a day after the North shelled a South Korean island and killed four people. South Korea provoked the shelling of Yeonpyeong Island by holding a military drill off their shared coast in the Yellow Sea, North Korea said. The attack also injured 15 South Korean soldiers and three civilians, South Korea said. While planned well before yesterday's unprovoked artillery attack, it demonstrates the strength of the ROK-U.S. alliance and our commitment to regional stability through deterrence," U.S. Forces Korea said. At the same time, we urge China, which holds a strong influence over North Korea, to make an effort to suppress such action by North Korea." China, which is North Korea's key ally, has responded obliquely to Tuesday's shelling.
