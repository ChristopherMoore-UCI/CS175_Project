Iran started suspending high levels of uranium enrichment Monday as an interim deal struck with six world powers went into effect, state media reported, making way for more talks and fewer sanctions. "The psychological effects of the lifting of sanctions will create a new atmosphere in the country," said Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister Seyed Abbas Araghchi, according to IRNA. All of its voluntary moves will be completed by Monday evening, Iran's nuclear spokesman Behrouz Kamalvandi told state-run news agency IRNA. If all conditions are met, Iran will get sanctions relief totaling about $7 billion, including access to $4.2 billion in frozen assets, during the six months the interim deal is in effect. Iran struck the deal on November 24 in exchange for lighter sanctions.
