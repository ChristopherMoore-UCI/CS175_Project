Several more meetings followed, including one on January 31 when several issues came up, including that "Jackie Robinson West Little League used a falsified boundary map for their 2014 tournament and that Jackie Robinson West Little League officials met with other leagues in District 4 to try to get the territory they wrongfully claimed was theirs for their 2014 tournament." "During our review, it became clear that both Jackie Robinson West officials and (the) District Administrator ... signed documents to make players eligible who should not have been," Keener said. At the time of the Washington visit, local Little League officials were already investigating thanks to a tip from a neighboring district's official and documentation. Reflecting on what he called "a heartbreaking decision," Little League International President Stephen Keener said the Chicago team's players can still be proud of what they accomplished last year. In the World Series final the following day, Jackie Robinson West rallied late but couldn't overcome the eventual champions from South Korea.
