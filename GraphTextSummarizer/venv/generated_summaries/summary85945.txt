Since May 2005, the remains of five women have been found near Seven Bridges Road outside Rocky Mount, North Carolina. Edgecombe County Sheriff James L. Knight is leading the investigation, working with Rocky Mount police and the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation. Jackie Nikelia Thorpe's body was found along Seven Bridges Road in August 2007. Manley said it appears that the women "suffered a similar death," but authorities are not divulging further details, including the cause of the deaths. Rocky Mount Police Chief John Manley Jr. thinks the women's deaths are related.
