The Islamic State terror group is now "a credible alternative to al Qaeda" that is "expanding its presence" with foreign fighters returning from Syria, and possibly Iraq, to their home countries, a U.S. intelligence official said Thursday. According to an assessment, the group has grown in size since the spring and its takeover of Mosul in northern Iraq as more fighters from around the world have mainly traveled to Syria to join its ranks. ISIS has taken advantage of the momentum it gained in Iraq over the past several months, resulting in a large number of new fighters joining up. How ISIS is overshadowing al Qaeda ISIS foreign fighters may be operating somewhat independently of the organization's hierarchy, which the United States believes maintains lines of authority and even succession plans. Because it is seen as "successful" in many areas, including Yemen and Africa where al Qaeda affiliates operate, they have gained support from some jihadists more widely.
