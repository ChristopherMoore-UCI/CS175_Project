The iPhone 5 will be available at Apple stores in the United States, which will open at 8 a.m. Friday. Wednesday morning, Apple's online store said a pre-ordered iPhone 5 would be shipped in three to four weeks. Apple's initial promise to ship pre-ordered phones in a week, the same day they become available at Apple Stores and other retailers, was pushed back just an hour after pre-orders opened up at midnight Thursday. "The previous iPhones went on to sell record number of units and we believe iPhone 5 will likely see a similar result. Apple received more than 2 million pre-orders in the first 24 hours, double the number it got for last year's record-setting iPhone 4S release, the company said.
