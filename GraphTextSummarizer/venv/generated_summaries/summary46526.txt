South Sudan is a landlocked country of more than 11 million people in central Africa, bordering Sudan, Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda, Democratic Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic. U.S. oil companies have no role now in South Sudan due to sanctions against Sudan, which still plays a major role in overall oil production. Kerry also dispatched his special envoy to Sudan and South Sudan, Donald Booth, to the country. Two years later, South Sudan remains one of Africa's most impoverished countries despite containing the majority of known Sudanese oil reserves. A democratic South Sudan could be a regional hedge against the Khartoum regime, which the United States lists as a sponsor of terrorism, and President Omar al-Bashir, who has been indicted on charges of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide.
