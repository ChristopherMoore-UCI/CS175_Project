Scott Brown, the former senator from Massachusetts who moved to New Hampshire to run in a more friendly environment, appears to be in a dead heat with Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a new poll shows. Thirty-eight percent of New Hampshire adults polled approve of the job President Barack Obama is doing, while 60% disapprove. A CNN/ORC International poll out Monday finds Shaheen and Brown tied among likely voters, with both obtaining the support of 48% among 735 voters surveyed. What could be a drag on Shaheen, however, is New Hampshire residents' opinion of the leader of her party. More than half of likely voters -- 54% -- have a favorable view of the first-term incumbent, while Brown's favorability is not as high.
