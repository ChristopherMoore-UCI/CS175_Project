Most of those sent to hospitals had head injuries, said Officer Michael Andonie, a policeman in Eloy, where the prison is located. The "inmate-on-inmate altercation" broke out during lunch Thursday in a part of the Red Rock Correctional Center that houses prisoners from California, the facility said Friday in a news release. Forty-three inmates were involved, and as of Friday all were secluded from the rest of the prison population "pending further investigation and appropriate disciplinary action," according to the statement. As of Friday, one remained in a hospital after suffering a non-life-threatening injury, Red Rock Correctional Center said. The prison is a private facility owned by Corrections Corporation of America, said Andonie.
