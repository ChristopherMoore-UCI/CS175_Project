Everyday I get inquiries from people all over the world including the U.S., Europe, Middle East and China," said Elizabeth Recsy, Orsos Island's head of communications. According to Recsy, the design phase of the island was completed over a month ago and the company is currently in the production preparation phase: "We have several pre-orders and we are starting to build the islands early next year in our facilities in central Europe." But, although it resembles the "Millennium Falcon" from "Star Wars", the "Orsos Island" is unable to reach tropical destinations at lightening speed, as its diminutive diesel engines are equipped for short journeys only. The price tag for all of this is certainly more than you'd expect to pay for a mainland mansion but, at $6.5 million, it falls well below the average cost of the gigayachts and Caribbean islands currently favored by the fabulously wealthy. The island is the passion project of Hungarian-born entrepreneur Gabor Orsos, a former hotelier who wanted to combine the best features of luxury hotels with the flexibility that a superyacht provides.
