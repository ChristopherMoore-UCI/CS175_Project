Another Honda rider, Marco Simoncelli, also passed the Mallorcan to claim third place but was unable to stay on the track as he slid off during lap 10 in his bid to get past fellow Italian Dovizioso. -- Casey Stoner moved to the top of the MotoGP standings after world champion and previous leader Jorge Lorenzo crashed out in treacherously wet conditions during Sunday's British Grand Prix. Stoner's teammate Andrea Dovizioso finished second at Silverstone to consolidate third place on 83 points, 15 behind Yamaha's Lorenzo, while veteran American Colin Edwards defied a broken collarbone to claim third place for his first podium this season. Lorenzo's American teammate Ben Spies also crashed out on lap 14, while Edwards' Monster Yamaha Tech 3 colleague Cal Crutchlow missed his home race after breaking his collarbone on Saturday. But the Italian team had some good news as former world champion Nicky Hayden finished fourth, setting the fastest lap time of the race, while seven-time series winner Valentino Rossi was sixth to move above the injured Dani Pedrosa into fourth overall.
