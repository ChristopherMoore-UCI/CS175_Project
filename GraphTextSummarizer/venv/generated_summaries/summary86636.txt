"Our pilots worked hard to get a mutually favorable deal that allows the company to grow while improving their wages and benefits," said Ben Baldanza, president and CEO of Spirit. Pilots will return to work and Spirit's operations will resume on Friday, the airline said on its website. In effort to make amends with passengers Spirit is offering customers a coupon for $50 off their next flight between June 18 and November 17 and 5,000 free Spirit bonus miles. "We apologize to those customers whose travel was disrupted as a result of the strike and look forward to earning their trust with ultra-low fares, great service and the best pilots in the sky," Baldanza said in a statement.
