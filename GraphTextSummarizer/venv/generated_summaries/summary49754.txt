Laura Buxton, meet Laura Buxton (Technically this isn't a "message in a bottle" story, but it's the same concept -- and the story is simply too good not to mention it.) They both had 3-year-old black Labrador retrievers at home, as well as gray pet rabbits. A ticket to freedom During a 1979 cruise to Hawaii, Dorothy and John Peckham passed the time by writing notes and throwing them overboard inside empty champagne bottles. A few months later, Steve Lieder and Robert Duncan, friends of Josh's, were walking on the banks of White Lake, when they saw something glimmer on the water. He stuffed the note inside the empty extract bottle and threw it into Wisconsin's White Lake.
