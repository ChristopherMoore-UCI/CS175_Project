Ali Erfan, senior advisor to Arab League Secretary General Nabil el-Araby, said Sunday that observer activity in Syria has been suspended, and all observers who were outside Damascus have redeployed to the capital. Monitors representing the 22-nation alliance were in Syria to determine whether President Bashar al-Assad's government is abiding by an agreement with the Arab League to end violence against anti-government protesters. Russia's foreign minister said earlier Sunday he is in favor of boosting the number of observers in Syria, adding that he did not understand why the Arab League suspended its monitoring mission. At least 64 people were killed in Syria on Sunday, according to an opposition activist group, as the Arab League suspended a monitoring mission designed to protect Syrian civilians from government-sponsored violence. "We have been working to unite Kurdish people and converge between different views within the Kurdish movement in Western Kurdistan and Syria," the party said in a statement.
