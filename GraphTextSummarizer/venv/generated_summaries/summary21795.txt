Initiatives in the private sector can help mitigate the costs: Dey Pharma, the manufacturer of EpiPen and EpiPen Jr., has already offered its auto-injector at a 50% reduced rate to schools. Stocking epinephrine at schools will help to ease concerns about using another child's medication for someone who needs it but does not have an EpiPen at school. The School Access to Emergency Epinephrine Act, a bipartisan bill introduced at the end of last year and being considered in committee, encourages states to pass laws introducing incentives for schools to stock epinephrine for all students -- not just those who have a prescription. Food allergies have become a part of American childhood, just like childhood obesity, diabetes and asthma. In our family, we are well-acquainted with epinephrine, administered by an automatic injector and sold under the brand names of Twinject or EpiPen.
