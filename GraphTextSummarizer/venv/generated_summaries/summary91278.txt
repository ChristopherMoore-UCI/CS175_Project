Erra began her career in advertising in 1981, as an intern at Saatchi & Saatchi. Erra is a progressive and, at times, challenging force in French life: A mother to five sons campaigning for greater participation by women, she is on the board of the Elle Foundation, the Committee on the Image of Women in the Media, and Force Femmes, and is president of the Women's Forum for the Economy and Society. Today, she is also managing director of communications group Havas and executive president of its marketing arm Euro RSCG Worldwide. Here she talks to CNN's Leading Women about immigration, the glass ceiling and what's most important in life and in work. Erra founded ad agency BETC Euro RSCG in 1995 with three others.
