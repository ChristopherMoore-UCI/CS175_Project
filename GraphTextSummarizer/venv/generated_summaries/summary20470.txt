-- Hurricane Carlotta bore down on Mexico's southwestern coast Friday evening, prompting residents and tourists alike to brace in the face of potent winds and heavy rains. A hurricane watch -- which means hurricane conditions are possible -- has been issued for coastal areas east of Salina Cruz to Barra de Tonala and west of Acapulco to Tecpan de Galeana. A warning means hurricane conditions are expected as soon as Friday night, according to the center. Hurricane-force winds, which are 74 mph or stronger, on Friday evening extended out about 30 miles from the center of Carlotta. A tropical storm early Friday, Carlotta gained strength over the course of the day and was described as "a rapidly intensifying Category 2 hurricane" in the National Hurricane Center's 2 p.m. (5 p.m. ET) advisory.
