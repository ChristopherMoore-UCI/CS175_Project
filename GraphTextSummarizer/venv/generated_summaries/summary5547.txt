-- Prita Mulyasari has become an "accidental hero" in Indonesia, spawning a social movement among many Indonesians in support of her battle with the country's legal system. On December 4, a court ruled in the hospital's favor and ordered Prita Mulyasari to pay more than US$20,000 in damages -- many times the annual salary of many Indonesians. "It's a sign of reprimand to all the judges and the police that you can't do what you want anymore," explained Prita's lawyer, OC Kaligis. They encouraged the public to send in 100 rupiah coins -- little more than a cent -- to help pay off Prita's fine. When the courts handed down the fine of $20,000 -- a small fortune in Indonesia -- bloggers began "A Coin for Prita" campaign.
