The crash occurred near a normally packed sidewalk next to the TKTS booth at 47th Street and Seventh Avenue, police and fire officials said. By all accounts, the collision of a pair of double-decker tour buses in Manhattan's bustling Time Square could have been worse. "I started praying." Bailey said a GrayLine bus -- with a driver and tour guide -- apparently was unable to stop and struck a light pole or traffic light before hitting a CitySights tour bus packed with passengers. Investigators have clear video showing a bus closest to the sidewalk speeding through the intersection and striking an SUV and another bus that just passed the intersection, according to a law enforcement official who saw the video. After the accident, dozens of tourists stood at what is sometimes called the "Crossroads of the World," taking pictures and video of the crash scene.
