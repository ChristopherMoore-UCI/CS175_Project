France's Bureau of Investigation and Analysis (BEA) said on Thursday that the external casings of both the flight recorders -- which record data and cockpit voices -- were in good condition and that they had started a "drying" process. The Airbus A330's pilots lost contact with air traffic controllers while flying across an area of the Atlantic Ocean known for constant bands of severe turbulence, officials said. " Phil Seymour, chief operating officer of the International Bureau of Aviation, a British aviation consultancy, said: "I remain skeptical about how useful this device (memory unit) will be. Considerable uncertainties still remain regarding the technical feasibility of recovering the bodies," the French Ministry statement said. It would take a couple of days for the units to dry and then approximately a week or two before they could determine if both were still working, the BEA said.
