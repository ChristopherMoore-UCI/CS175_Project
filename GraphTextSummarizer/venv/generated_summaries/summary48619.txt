-- Clark James Gable, 22, the only grandson of legendary actor Clark Gable, was playing with a laser when police arrested him, charging him with a felony this week, his manager told CNN Saturday. Gable is accused of pointing the laser inside the cockpit of a Los Angeles police helicopter flying over Hollywood, authorities said. Davis said the car belonged to and was being driven by Maximillian Anderson, who is a friend of Gable's. Gable, of Canoga Park, California, admitted to authorities that he was pointing the laser recklessly, Davis said. A tactical flight officer noticed a bright green laser light illuminating the cockpit, said Lt. Alex Medel of the Hollywood division.
