To combat the release of these vapors, most gas stations have installed special gas pump nozzles that include the rubber boot to block vapors from escaping. Since 1994, gas stations that did not meet air quality standards have been required to use gas vapor recovery systems. The Obama administration and the Environmental Protection Agency announced Thursday they intend to phase out the rubber boots on gas pump handles now used to capture harmful gasoline vapors while refueling cars. Other areas highlighted in the White House's announcement include allowing states to replace traffic signs that were previously federally regulated, changing railroad regulations related to freight train travel, and changing certain regulatory reporting requirements for hospitals and doctors. When drivers refuel, gas vapors can escape and contribute to smog and harmful air pollution.
