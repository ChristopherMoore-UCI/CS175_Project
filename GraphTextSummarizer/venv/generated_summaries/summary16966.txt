You may recall a vote I held online recently -- asking readers to suggest new names for pangolin P26, who was released into a national park in Vietnam in March. One pangolin I met was named P26 -- and had been seized from the illegal trade and taken to the Carnivore and Pangolin Conservation Program in Vietnam. "Maybe if the voting by CNN readers is complete on deciding P26â€²s new name, I can see if whispering it as we walk through the forest on Thursday night will be successful in coaxing him into view!" One more favor to ask: Maybe the fact that there's a real-life endangered creature named after a video game character means Nintendo and Pokemon will start supporting pangolin conservation? They're traded illegally and by the ton for their scales, which are used in traditional medicine and for their meat, which is a delicacy in Vietnam and China.
