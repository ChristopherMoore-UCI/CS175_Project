Humans of New York This photography site is based on a straightforward premise: capturing photos of everyday New Yorkers. The site combines art history and intriguing mystery using high-resolution images, essays and videos. Look through crime stats, browse photos of the most wanted criminals, and check out a timeline of the department's history, all on a background of amazing photos of the department. It uses real audio clips from the Apollo 11 landing with photos and names indicating who's talking. Luckily, there seems to be an inexhaustible supply of interesting New Yorkers, making the site an addictive time-suck.
