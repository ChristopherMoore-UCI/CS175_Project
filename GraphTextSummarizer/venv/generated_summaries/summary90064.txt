As a co-architect of the federal Cash for Clunkers program with the Center for American Progress and the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy and adviser to various congressional offices on the issue, it is gratifying to see how quickly it has been adopted by the American people. Jack Hidary says the Cash for Clunkers program promotes fuel economy and safety while boosting the economy. Let's remember that lots of the Toyotas and Hondas sold in the program are made by American workers right here in this country. We use that oil mainly for transportation -- cars, SUVs, and other vehicles. So we know that Clunkers programs get the job done.
