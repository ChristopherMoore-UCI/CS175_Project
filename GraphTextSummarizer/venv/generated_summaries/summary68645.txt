The FA has taken over a month to charge Suarez and they are also investigating allegations of racism by Chelsea and England captain John Terry towards a fellow player in a separate incident. Suarez has been accused of aiming racial taunts at Manchester United's French defender Patrice Evra during a match in the English Premier League last month. Suarez's charge comes on the day that FIFA president Sepp Blatter claimed there is not a problem with player-on-player racism within football. A statement on the FA's web site read: "It is alleged that Suarez used abusive and/or insulting words and/or behavior towards Manchester United's Patrice Evra contrary to FA rules," the association said in a statement. London's Metropolitan police have also launched a probe after Terry was accused of racially abusing Queens Park Rangers defender Anton Ferdinand.
