Fire crews arrived before the collapse, but moved to a safe distance when they realized they could not extinguish the blaze, Mayor Jan Broerjes said Friday. It was unclear what caused the fiery collapse in Hoogersmilde Friday. The incident disrupted television, radio and mobile phone networks nearby. The top part of a burning television tower collapsed in the Netherlands, leaving a trail of thick billowing smoke and fiery flames. CNN's Ben Brumfield contributed to this report
