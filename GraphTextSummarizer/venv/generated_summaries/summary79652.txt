Amir Mir -- the targeted news anchor's brother and a journalist himself -- said his brother believed ISI, Pakistan's powerful intelligence agency, had plans to assassinate him. The staffers went missing on Thursday evening, United Nations spokesman Vittorio Cammarota said. -- Police are investigating after two UNICEF staff members went missing in Karachi, Pakistan, a United Nations spokesman said Sunday. The Pakistani military public relations agency ISPR said that "raising allegations against ISI or the head of ISI without any basis is highly regrettable and misleading." The port city of Karachi is Pakistan's financial capital.
