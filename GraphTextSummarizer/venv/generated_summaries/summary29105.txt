-- A Buckingham Palace guard has been pulled off of royal wedding duty this week because of offensive posts on his Facebook page, the British Ministry of Defence told CNN Monday. Reilly, who was pictured on his page wearing the traditional tall black bearskin hat of Buckingham Palace guards, did not immediately respond to CNN attempts to contact him via Facebook. Cameron Reilly, the guard, used an offensive term to describe Pakistanis on his Facebook page, which was taken offline on Monday. British media reported that Reilly called Middleton a "stupid stuck up cow" and used an obscenity to describe her on Facebook. He listed "causing trouble" and "casually breaking the law" among his interests on Facebook.
