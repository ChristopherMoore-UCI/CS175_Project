Gmail is facing multiple privacy lawsuits in the United States and Europe, some accusing the company of illegal wiretapping for scanning the content of e-mails. Data gathered through e-mail scanning can also be used to create user profiles for future ad targeting. Google responded that non-Gmail customers had no expectations of privacy when sending e-mails to people who did use the service. Google's employees aren't personally reading through e-mails for the latest lovers' spat. Google also says the scans are necessary to cut down on malicious e-mails and spam, and for features such as Priority Inbox and the tabbed view that filters e-mails into different categories.
