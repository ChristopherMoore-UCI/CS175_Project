There were no ski masks or stockings pulled over their heads; instead, Matthew Allan McNelly, 23, and Joey Lee Miller, 20, streaked their faces with permanent black marker. Police received a call Friday night that two men with hooded sweatshirts and painted faces had tried to break into a man's home in Carroll, Iowa. Cayler said he's been fielding calls about the case from news media outlets from all over the country -- mostly because of their funny-looking mug shots. "We're very skilled investigators and the black faces gave them right away," Cayler said jokingly. Carroll Police Chief Cayler told CNN the strange disguises made it easier for his officers.
