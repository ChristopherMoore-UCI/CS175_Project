" Coulson's former colleagues pleaded guilty to phone hacking charges before the case came to trial. -- Former tabloid editor and ex-Downing Street communications chief Andy Coulson was sentenced Friday in London to 18 months in prison for phone hacking offenses. It was his reputation as an editor and journalist, which was increased through the stories that were obtained by phone hacking and, even though he resigned, he did so with his reputation intact. The sentence was complicated by the fact that he had already been sent to prison for six months for phone hacking in 2007. He also focused on the impact on the thousands of victims of phone hacking -- who were not just those who put themselves in the public eye.
