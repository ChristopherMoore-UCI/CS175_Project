Sideri has many new goals in life. "Jail was the catapult for me," Sideri said. Sideri spent the next couple of weeks curled up on the floor of a jail cell withdrawing, cold turkey, from his years of heroin abuse. After graduating from high school in 2000, Sideri began abusing Percocet and OxyContin, opium-containing painkillers. Gorman has known Sideri since he was in middle school, and tried to help him in high school.
