A criminal complaint filed in federal court says Valle was in contact with at least two women mentioned in his plans, though FBI spokesman J. Peter Donald told CNN the agency has "no information to believe Mr. Valle harmed anyone at this time. The name of that woman matched a name that investigators found in Valle's alleged files of women on his home computer, the complaint says. He is accused of illegally accessing a national crime database to locate potential targets, scouting some of them at their homes and workplaces and exchanging e-mails and instant messages with alleged co-conspirators about plans to target women, the attorney's office said. " The court documents say Valle also exchanged online messages with an alleged co-conspirator about planning to abduct and cook Victim 1. The women in Valle's alleged database live in the United States and overseas, according to a law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation.
