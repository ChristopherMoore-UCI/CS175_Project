The FDA has said that because raw jalapeño and serrano peppers may be linked to the outbreak, people at risk for developing severe infections -- infants, elderly people and people with compromised immune systems -- should avoid eating them. The FDA hasn't determined whether tomatoes were a source of the outbreak, but it has determined that tomatoes currently in fields and stores are safe, said Dr. David Acheson, the FDA's associate commissioner for food protection, according to The Associated Press. The federal agency lifted its warning about tomatoes but left in place a warning about raw jalapeño and serrano peppers, having previously said those foods also may be linked to the outbreak. Investigators initially thought that certain types of tomatoes were the source of the outbreak, and further investigation also cast suspicions on raw jalapeño and serrano peppers. Food borne illnesses result in more than 300,000 hospitalizations in the United States every year, according to the CDC.
