Tense waiting game for Brisbane residents The 29-year-old Swiss player supports several charities, having launched his own foundation in 2003 to help disadvantaged children. Tennis stars have already contributed to the Queensland disaster fund, with American Andy Roddick donating $10,800 after reaching the final of the tournament in Brisbane last weekend. Australian star Samantha Stosur also made a donation, and Roddick's website reported that the men's and women's ATP and WTA ruling bodies would pledge $10 for every ace serve hit by their players in Brisbane, Sydney this week and the Australian Open. Federer, who is in Melbourne preparing to begin the defense of his Australian Open title next week, set up a similar exhibition following the Haiti earthquakes a year ago. Rising waters in Queensland have left the state's premier warning of "the worst natural disaster in our history" as homes have been flooded and power cut off in the capital city Brisbane.
