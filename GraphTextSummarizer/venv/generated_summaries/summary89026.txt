With his trademark sideburns and 'Mod' fashion sense, Wiggins assumed cult status and became a national hero, but his ongoing rivalry with fellow Team Sky member Chris Froome has since taken on the sort of brooding intrigue which would not have been out of place in a Bronte novel. " Either way, while Froome and his eight teammates begin their quest to bring Team Sky a third straight yellow jersey, Wiggins will likely be training at the Manchester Velodrome ahead of riding the 4km individual and team pursuit at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. Colombian Quintana won the Giro d'Italia earlier this year, but has decided against a tilt at the Tour, leaving two-time winner Alberto Contador as the likely main challenger to Froome. Despite its recent dominance of cycling at the Tour de France and in the Olympics, Britain will only have four competitors in this year's race, but in Froome and sprint king Mark Cavendish (Omega Pharma-Quick Step) it has two jewels in the crown. The entire Team Sky squad will act as "domestiques" or helpers for Froome, sacrificing their own chances to help him claim the yellow jersey in Paris.
