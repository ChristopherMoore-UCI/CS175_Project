"So one day I got so stressed out about it that I literally took a hammer and broke my desktop monitor," he said in an e-mail. "We've been passionate about building the most comfortable, beautiful, and fastest smartphone keyboard ever since we started" says Loannis Verdelis, Fleksy's founder. "Since I was a child I always loved phones, and still love smartphones today ...," he said. Fernandes set it on April 25 in New York.
