Israeli orchestras have held back from performing Wagner's music in the past because of its use in Nazi propaganda during World War II . In 2001 the world renowned conductor Daniel Barenboim angered many Israelis when he played Wagner's music in Israel. Conductor of the orchestra Roberto Paternostro said on Israeli TV it was time to separate Wagner's world view from his music. "I know that in Israel this is not accepted, but many people have told me its time we confront Wagner especially those in the younger generation" the conductor said. -- The Israel Chamber Orchestra performed works of Adolf Hitler's favorite composer Richard Wagner in Germany on Tuesday in the composer's home town of Bayreuth.
