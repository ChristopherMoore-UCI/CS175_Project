Those new procedures include: -- Additional training for communications, White House scheduling and advance staff; -- The official's name was included on a list of people attending a military briefing for President Barack Obama during his surprise visit to Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan last month. No one was disciplined or fired, White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters Wednesday. On presidential trips abroad, a staffer will notify participants in a meeting open to the press that their names and titles will be released to reporters, giving them an opportunity to object; -- On such trips, the White House press lead will clear the names and titles of meeting participants with National Security staff prior to release. -- An investigation into the outing of the CIA's top intelligence official in Afghanistan last month determined the leak was inadvertent.
