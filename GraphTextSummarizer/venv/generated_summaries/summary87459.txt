In February, the government warned airlines about possible shoe bombs, officials told CNN at the time, amid intelligence suggesting tactics tied to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula master bomb-maker Ibrahim al Asiri. The U.S. is considering new security measures at airports due to increased concern that terrorists from al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula are developing explosives designed to avoid detection by current security screening, U.S. officials tell CNN. In recent months, U.S. officials have warned about al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula terrorists attempting to design new explosive devices to avoid detection. A law enforcement source said the U.S. periodically receives information on attempts by those believed to have been trained by al Asiri to develop bombs that could defeat screening systems. Officials tell CNN there is no imminent threat or plot; however, an additional vulnerability has been identified, which the Department of Homeland Security is working to address.
