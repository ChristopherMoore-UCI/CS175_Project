Robert Enke, 32, was captain of the German top-division soccer club Hannover 96 and had played in eight games for his national team. Enke missed Germany's last four matches because of a bacterial infection, but he had recently returned to action with Hannover. " Hundreds of fans and former teammates gathered to lay flowers, light candles and sign a book of condolences outside Hannover 96's Niedersachsen Stadion. " Fellow players said they believed Enke had been suffering depression, Kind said. Theo Zwanziger, president of the German soccer federation, said players "needed time to come to terms with the death of Enke." Enke always said he wanted to play for the national team at the 2010 World Cup, the federation said.
