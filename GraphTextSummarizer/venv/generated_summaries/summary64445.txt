-- Earlier this week, New York police arrested four people suspected of selling heroin to actor Philip Seymour Hoffman, who later died from a heroin overdose. The people who police accuse of selling heroin to Hoffman could not even be charged with felony murder -- that is, a death happening during the course of committing another offense -- because New York's felony murder law only applies to robbery, burglary, rape and similar violent crimes. By all accounts, the people who police believe sold heroin to Hoffman were ordinary drug dealers plying their illicit trade. The police in New York have already made examples out of the dealers suspected of selling heroin to Hoffman. Legally speaking, it was Philip Seymour Hoffman who was responsible for his own death, even if drug dealers sold him the means to that end.
