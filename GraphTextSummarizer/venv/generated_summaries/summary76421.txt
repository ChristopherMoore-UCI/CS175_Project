We also recommend that Congress require data brokers to create a centralized website, among other measures, so that consumers can access their own data and opt out of data collection and retention. We found that data brokers collect billions of pieces of data on nearly every American consumer, often merging online and offline information. I also believe data brokers should be required to take reasonable steps to ensure consumer information is not used for unlawful purposes, such as to illegally discriminate. There's no question that the personal information that data brokers sell to retailers, financial firms, hotels, airlines and other businesses can provide benefits to consumers and our growing digital economy. Data brokers are also making potentially sensitive inferences about consumers -- about their health, financial status, and ethnic backgrounds.
