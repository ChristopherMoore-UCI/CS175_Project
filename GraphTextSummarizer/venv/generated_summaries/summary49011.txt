Kalla had hoped voters would give him some of the credit for Indonesia's economic successes which occurred under his term as vice president. Growth topped 6 percent last year, and Indonesia was the fastest-growing economy in southeast Asia in the first quarter of this year. An average of six exit polls showed the incumbent holding about 60 percent of the vote compared to 27 percent for former President Megawati Sukarnoputri and 12 percent for Yudhoyono's vice president, Yusuf Kalla. -- Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono held a commanding lead in national elections Wednesday, according to the latest exit polls. Indonesia has had impressive economic growth over the past five years, though how much direct credit Yudhoyono can take for that is questionable.
