Though Assange is a household name now, little was known about him before July 25, 2010, when he dominated breaking international headlines when his site WikiLeaks published a trove of classified U.S. documents about the Afghanistan war. When Assange founded WikiLeaks in 2006, the site built a relatively small but steady following among investigative journalists. Even after more than a year and a half of drama involving Assange and WikiLeaks, some still consider Assange a journalist. Despite the ongoing sex crimes case, for which he was temporarily jailed (a detention that "Saturday Night Live" spoofed), Assange insisted that WikiLeaks was still operating. Driven by the conviction of an activist and the curiosity of a journalist, Assange founded WikiLeaks in 2006.
