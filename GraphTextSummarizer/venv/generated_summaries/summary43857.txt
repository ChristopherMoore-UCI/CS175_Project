Researchers have already established that depression increases the risk of heart attacks (and especially fatal ones), so it makes sense that depression would have a similar association with stroke, says Norman Rosenthal, M.D., a clinical professor of psychiatry at the Georgetown University School of Medicine, in Washington, D.C. "Strokes and heart attacks both represent blood vessels becoming blocked and blood being withheld from a vital organ, whether it's the heart or the brain," says Rosenthal, who was not involved in the new study. Depression is a relatively minor risk factor for stroke compared to high blood pressure (hypertension) and other health conditions and behaviors that damage blood vessels, the researchers say. "They're essentially the same disease." Health.com: Careers with high rates of depression Depression could contribute to strokes in many ways, Pan says. Depression increased the risk of ischemic stroke, in which a blood vessel becomes blocked and cannot send blood to the brain. More research is needed to determine whether depression drugs contribute to stroke risk.
