But Super Bowl XLV, scheduled to begin Sunday at 6:30pm ET, is expected to draw thousands of fans to the Texan gridiron in search of warmer weather. -- A rash of inclement weather shut down Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport Tuesday morning, raising questions as to whether Super Bowl fans will face travel problems ahead of Sunday's big game. While not exactly balmy conditions, the warm weather Super Bowl tradition could more abruptly end three years from now. Forecasters say Dallas temperatures will bump up to a high of 61 degrees by game day. "We'll be ready." Both teams and their fans are cold weather clubs, accustomed to the frozen tundra of Lambeau Field in Green Bay, Wisconsin, and Heinz Field in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
