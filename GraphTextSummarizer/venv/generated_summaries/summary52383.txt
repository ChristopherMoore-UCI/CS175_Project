Before he was charged criminally, Leyritz settled a civil lawsuit filed by Veitch's family, saying he did so out "of the goodness of my heart" to help out the victim's two children. " Prosecutors claimed that Leyritz was legally drunk when he sped through a red light and hit Veitch; the defense countered that Veitch didn't have her lights on and that the light was yellow when Leyritz drove through. But they also said that they didn't believe Leyritz ran the red light, and said that Veitch's drinking -- her blood-alcohol level was 0.18, more than twice the legal limit -- and the fact she wasn't wearing a seat belt were critical factors in her death. " Still, Leyritz said that the entire thing will be worth it, if his and Veitch's story might convince someone not to drive after a few drinks. " Leyritz's legal travails aren't over; prosecution and defense attorneys will meet December 1, to settle on a sentencing date on the drunken driving charge.
