Polish President Lech Kaczynski, his wife and many top Polish officials died in the April 2010 crash as they headed to a memorial service to mark the 70th anniversary of a World War II massacre. -- Pilot error was mostly to blame for a plane crash that killed Polish President Lech Kaczynski and nearly 100 others last year, the nation's investigators said Friday. Unclear instructions from Russian air traffic controllers and bad weather at Smolensk airport also played a part, according to the report released Friday in Warsaw. The report also highlights communication issues between the Polish crew and Russian air traffic controllers at Smolensk. In January, a Russian-led investigation concluded that the Polish crew was at fault in the crash.
