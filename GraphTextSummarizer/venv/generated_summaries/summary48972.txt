In the past 10 days, he said, up to 40 U.S. companies have contacted his office, eager to provide Capitol souvenirs and trinkets. Although the center has the goods in hand, Brady said, "I'm not allowing them to sell those products." His Administration Committee oversees operations in the House of Representatives, including the House restaurant, parking facilities and the Capitol Visitors Center. As for the items the Capitol Visitors Center operators got from China, Brady said, "they made the mistake; they can send them back." -- Washington souvenirs worth $100,000 -- including images of the Capitol dome and printings of the U.S. Constitution -- are locked in storage, blocked from sale in the new U.S. Capitol Visitors Center because the items are made in China. A spokesman for the committee said other House gift shops also are under restrictions on items made outside the United States.
