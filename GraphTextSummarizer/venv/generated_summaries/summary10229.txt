Shoppers crowded into a Manhattan Home Depot store to prepare for an anticipated snowstorm streamed into the streets Sunday afternoon after an employee shot a store manager and then himself, according to NYPD spokesman Sgt. The 38-year-old manager, who was shot in an aisle of the store, was transported to Bellevue Hospital where he was later pronounced dead, Ryan said. The shooting happened in a store at 40 West 23rd Street, in the Flatiron section of Manhattan, police said. The shooter, a 31-year-old male worker at the store, was not scheduled to work when he came in, Ryan said. Police recovered a .38-caliber revolver at the scene, Ryan said.
