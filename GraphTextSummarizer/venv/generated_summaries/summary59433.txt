Rice, Butler and other occupants in a Jeep found Anderson in a motel parking lot about 5 a.m. on June 25, 2011, in Jackson and "decided that Anderson would be a good target for an assault because he was African-American and appeared to be intoxicated," authorities said in a statement. Witnesses told authorities this is when Anderson's beating took place, as the teens yelled racial epithets, including "white power." Rice first punched Anderson in the face to knock him to the ground, and then Dedmon punched Anderson in the face several times while he was on the ground, authorities said. Dedmon then "deliberately" ran over Anderson, causing injuries that killed him, authorities said. Authorities allege Dedmon and many of the other teens pummeled Anderson repeatedly as he crumpled to the ground, although this is not visible on the tape.
