-- French actress Julie Gayet is suing the magazine Closer over an article suggesting she is having an affair with French President Francois Hollande, the magazine said Thursday. " Hollande and Trierweiler are expected next month on a state visit to the United States at the invitation of President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle. A statement from his entourage Friday to news agency Agence France-Presse said Hollande "deeply condemns the attacks on the right to privacy which he has a right to like every other citizen. A survey last month by French polling organization Ifop gave Hollande an approval rating of 22%, a rise of 2 percentage points from the previous month, when he hit a record low. Hollande has not confirmed or denied the alleged affair but has threatened legal action.
