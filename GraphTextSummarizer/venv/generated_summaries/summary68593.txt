-- People arrested amid unrest in Syria are being subjected to systematic torture, including electric shocks, beatings and sexual violence, a report by rights group Amnesty International said Wednesday. International leaders should also assist humanitarian agencies, rights groups and non-governmental organizations in helping the survivors of torture and their families, particularly in cases of sexual violence. The government says it is battling "armed terrorist groups" but international leaders and rights groups dispute that. She said the experience for detainees arrested over the past year is similar to that endured under former President Hafez Assad, father of the current leader, Bashar al-Assad. CNN cannot independently confirm reports of casualties or attacks in Syria because the government has severely restricted the access of international journalists.
