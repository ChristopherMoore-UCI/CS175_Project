Liverpool came up just short in the race for the English Premier League title, finishing second to Manchester City, but ensured Champions League football for the first time in four seasons. Costa, who was born in Brazil but was part of Spain's squad at the 2014 World Cup, expressed his delight at joining Chelsea, while he revealed he is looking forward to working under manager Jose Mourinho. "Having played against Chelsea last season [in the European Champions League] I know the high quality of the squad I am joining. He played a pivotal role in the Reds' title challenge last year, netting 31 times in 37 appearances. Costa has long been linked with a move from Atletico Madrid, and the London side announced Tuesday that a deal has been completed.
