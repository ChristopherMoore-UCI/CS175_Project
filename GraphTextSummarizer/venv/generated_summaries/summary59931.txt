The Saturday agreement was made among ousted President Marc Ravalomanana, current President Andry Rajoelina, who took power in March, and former presidents Didier Ratsiraka and Albert Zafy. In a statement Saturday, United Nations chief Ban Ki-moon urged the leaders to set up the unity government as soon as possible this time around, and pledged to support Madagascar through the transition. Under the deal, Rajoelina will serve as president along with two new co-presidents. -- Four current and former leaders of Madagascar have struck a power-sharing deal, ending months of political wrangling that has rocked the island nation off the east coast of Africa, the United Nations said. The international community has not recognized him as president, and the United States condemned the toppling as a coup.
