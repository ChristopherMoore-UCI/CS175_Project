Given the significant support for this proposition, and the fact that most of Britain's Trident submarines are based in Scotland, there may be growing pressure for relocation of these bases in coming years, despite the failure of the pro-independence movement to secure a majority. Taken overall, today's vote will provide reassurance for key UK allies, especially the U.S. and Europe, despite lingering concerns about the future of Britain's military capability. Thus, if Scotland had voted for independence, and didn't take part in any subsequent EU plebiscite, it would have been more likely that -- in a close vote -- that Britain could have left the EU. Numerous world leaders, from U.S. President Barack Obama to Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott, had strongly asserted that it is in the best interests of the global community for the UK to stay together. Some in Washington (along with other allies) will remain apprehensive about the future of the UK Trident nuclear deterrent which is due for potential renewal in coming years.
