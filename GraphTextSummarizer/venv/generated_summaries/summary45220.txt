-- A Chinese-funded railway project in Kenya could transform transport in east Africa, and strengthen cross-border political and economic ties. China's growing influence in Africa China has numerous ongoing projects in Africa, especially in the infrastructure, oil, natural resources, manufacturing and banking sectors. "The railway development will have the following immediate economic benefits: reduce the cost of transportation in the region making it an attractive investment destination and accelerate industrialization through easier and cheaper transport and the establishment of new industries to service the new railway," said Mr. Zhang, a business manager who oversees the Africa projects at China Communications Construction Company (CCCC), parent company of CRBC. "We believe there is a great potential for us to invest in east Africa and (we're) looking forward to further cooperation," Zhang said. Yet, its railway dates back to the colonial era and the 300-mile (483 kilometer) journey from Mombasa to Nairobi currently takes 12 hours for passengers -- freight trains take up to 36.
