Since being added as one of 21 alternatives -- and with the help of regular online proddings by Shatner, urging fans to vote Vulcan -- Spock's home has rocketed up the official online vote tally. None other than Leonard Nimoy, who played Spock in the long-running Star Trek television series and string of movies, endorsed as "logical" the idea of naming one of the moons Vulcan. But for others -- most notably, for legions of Star Trek fans -- it is better known as the home planet of Spock, the ever rational, ever loyal member of the starship Enterprise. Kirk -- or more accurately his human facsimile, William Shatner -- started his effort by urging Trekkies to write the SETI Institute to get Vulcan added as an option. In a 2009 Star Trek film, after all, Vulcan was obliterated by a villain named Nero.
