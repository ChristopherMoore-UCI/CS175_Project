Atlanta, Idaho, is a historic mountain town located about 135 miles northeast of Boise. According to Gene Haught, "The town has been wiped down by fire a couple of times in the 1800s and early in the 1900s. But like its much larger namesake in the South, the Idaho town of Atlanta has risen from the ashes before. The Beaver Creek fire has devoured 106,000 acres in Idaho's Sun Valley, but authorities could have the fire up to 20% contained by Tuesday night, incident commander Beth Lund told reporters. "About 70% of the residents have stayed behind to help," said Gene Haught, Atlanta's fire chief.
