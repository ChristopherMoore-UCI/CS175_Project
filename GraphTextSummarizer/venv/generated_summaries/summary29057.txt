-- A Chinese court on Friday sentenced Lai Changxing, a tycoon who spent more than a decade as a fugitive in Canada, to life in prison for smuggling and bribery, the state-run news agency Xinhua reported. Lai, 53, was sentenced by a court in the southeastern port city of Xiamen in Fujian Province, where the Chinese authorities say he ran a multi-billion dollar smuggling operation in the late 1990s. His company's interests included products as varied as cigarettes, cars, luxury goods and oil. His lawyers had said they feared he may face the death penalty in China like others convicted of profiting from the smuggling operation. Lai evaded the authorities and fled to Canada in 1999.
