It includes making changes to Hilton-owned hotels under a variety of trade names including the Waldorf Astoria, Embassy Suites, Hampton Inn, Doubletree and Homewood Suites. The Americans With Disabilities Act "protects the right of people with disabilities to stay in accessible hotel rooms, and to reserve those hotel rooms through the same convenient systems as everyone else," Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights Thomas Perez said in a statement. Government lawyers had alleged Hilton failed to provide an adequate number of accessible rooms, failed to disperse accessible rooms among the various categories of available accommodations and failed to provide individuals with disabilities the ability to reserve accessible rooms through its reservation system. " "Hilton Worldwide is pleased to take further steps to provide our guests with disabilities the accessibility in accommodations they expect from an industry leader," said Christopher Nassetta, president and CEO of Hilton Worldwide. The allegations also claimed Hilton facilities had failed at times to provide individuals with disabilities the accessible sleeping accommodations that they had reserved.
