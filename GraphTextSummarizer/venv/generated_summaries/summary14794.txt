Sri Lanka won the first Test of the three-match series in Galle when the retiring Muttiah Muralitharan produced a match-winning performance to become the first bowler to reach 800 Test wickets. -- Sachin Tendulkar hit the fifth double century of his career to help India surpass Sri Lanka's huge first innings total as the second Test headed for a draw. Mithun was bowled by Mendis for 41 after taking India past Sri Lanka's total before Ishant Sharma and Pragyan Ohja held firm until the close of play. Tendulkar and Raina quickly took India past the follow-on target of 442 as they put together a partnership of 256 -- the third highest fifth-wicket partnership for India in Tests. Raina was the first to go after lunch when he was caught by Kumar Sangakkara off the bowling of spinner Ajantha Mendis for 120.
