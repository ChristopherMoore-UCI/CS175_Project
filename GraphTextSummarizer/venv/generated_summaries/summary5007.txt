-- As Toyota recalls millions of cars, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reports that an average of 25 percent of U.S. consumers who get recall notices don't follow through and fix their vehicles. The center says vehicle insurers have an incentive and a method to reach car owners who haven't complied fully with recalls. â€¢ Clarence Ditlow with the Center for Auto Safety, a consumer watchdog group, says there is not a process to ensure that auto owners comply with recalls. The CNN Fact Check Desk wondered: Is there a way to ensure compliance with auto recalls? Most vehicle recalls involve free fixes for the consumer.
