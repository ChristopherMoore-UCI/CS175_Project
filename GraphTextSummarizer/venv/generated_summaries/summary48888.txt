They had lost their beloved pup after the fence in their Keansburg, New Jersey, home was mangled during the storm, Chuck James told CNN on Friday. The James family is still displaced from their home after it was destroyed by Sandy. -- When Chuck and Elicia James ventured to their local animal shelter to adopt a dog, they expected to meet a new member of their family. Rosenthal said the James' story really emphasizes the importance of getting your pet microchipped. "After Sandy, we had so many animals being turned in," said Jerry Rosenthal, president and CEO of the animal shelter.
