It is one of several area border crossings between the U.S. and Canada and is located east of Bellingham, Washington, and Vancouver, British Columbia. The reported shooting happened near the Huntington Border Crossing which connects the cities of Sumas, Washington, and Abbotsford, British Columbia. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection said the agent fired when a suspected "illegal border crosser" assaulted him during a patrol along the U.S.-Canadian border on Thursday. The Bellingham Herald newspaper, citing police radio dispatches, said the man was struck in the head. Federal and local authorities are investigating a deadly shooting by a U.S. Border Patrol Agent in Washington State.
