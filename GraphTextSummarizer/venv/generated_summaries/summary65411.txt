Similar testing in other states, including California and Washington, has shown comparable levels of iodine-131 in rainwater samples. -- Minuscule levels of radiation from Japan's Fukushima nuclear plant incident have been detected in a widening number of U.S. states, but the Environmental Protection Agency reaffirmed this week that the levels represent no threat to public health. Sensors in Maryland have also reported elevated levels of I-131 in air samples. "These types of findings are to be expected in the coming days and are still far below levels of public health concern." "To date, data from EPA's real-time radiation air monitoring networks continue to show typical fluctuations in background radiation levels," Jonathan Edwards, director of the EPA's Radiation Protection Division, said in a statement Monday.
