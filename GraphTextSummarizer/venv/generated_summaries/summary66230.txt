Even though I felt and looked great, I was experiencing what I now know are the classic symptoms of heart disease: frequent intense heart palpitations, light-headedness, shortness of breath and extreme fatigue. I made a commitment to use whatever platform I have in the public eye to raise awareness of heart disease in women. According to the American Heart Association and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, heart disease is the No. 1 killer of all Americans. The movement aims to dispel myths surrounding heart disease and raise awareness. With National Wear Red Day coming up this Friday, I'm reminded that bringing awareness to heart disease isn't about just wearing red one day a year.
