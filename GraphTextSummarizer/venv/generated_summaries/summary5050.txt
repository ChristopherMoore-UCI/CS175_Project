Last summer, Facebook began expressing interest to Palo Alto officials in obtaining more office space there, Burt said. "They'd love to stay in Palo Alto, and they've indicated that they plan to keep a presence in Palo Alto with a lot of their core engineering," said Pat Burt, a Palo Alto council member and former mayor. Menlo Park Mayor Rich Cline received the same e-mail, with no further explanation. The move would be a coup for Menlo Park over neighboring Palo Alto. Whether Facebook will designate Menlo Park as its headquarters or will continue to keep core assets in Palo Alto is unknown.
