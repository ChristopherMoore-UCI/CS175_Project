Chemically, added sugar is the same, but studies show many Americans eat more sugar than they realize. For women it's a smaller amount -- no more than 100 calories per day from added sugar, or about six teaspoons of sugar. If approved, the new labels would place a bigger emphasis on total calories, added sugars and certain nutrients, such as Vitamin D and potassium. The proposed labels would remove the "calories from fat" line you currently see on labels, focusing instead on total calories found in each serving. The American Heart Association recommends you limit added sugar to no more than half your daily discretionary calories.
