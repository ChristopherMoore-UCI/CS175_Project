-- The nation's major airlines -- lambasted for years because of canceled flights, long tarmac delays, late arrivals and lost luggage -- have significantly improved in all four of those key measurements of customer service, the federal government said Thursday. Industry officials say the complaints may be on the rise because the DOT has made it easier to file grievances, and because passengers may be complaining about factors not covered by the DOT report, such as rising ticket prices, cramped seating and baggage fees. The improvements are "very good news," said Kate Hanni of Flyersrights.org, a passenger advocacy group that fought for rules penalizing carriers for tarmac delays. The DOT received 344 complaints about airlines' treatment of disabled passengers during the six-month period, up 20.7% from the comparable period in 2011. "Our member airlines are delivering levels of customer service that no other industry, given its complexity, matches and are working to make air travel even more efficient for passengers and shippers," Nicholas Calio of Airlines for America said in a statement.
