Mishra, the former ambassador, says 55% of Nepali migrant workers deaths in Qatar are from "sudden" cardiac arrest, 20% die from work-related accidents, 15% from traffic accidents and an alarming 10% commit suicide. "Nepali migrant workers have the lowest per capita income in Qatar," says Suryanath Mishra, who served as ambassador to Qatar from 2007 to 2012. "While the vast majority of workers in Qatar are fairly treated, we recognise that a minority are not. When contacted about the deaths of foreign workers in Qatar, a spokesman for the labor ministry said that all workers deserve to be protected against exploitation. We are waiting for the body of Kishun Das, who left Nepal for Qatar only eight months ago.
