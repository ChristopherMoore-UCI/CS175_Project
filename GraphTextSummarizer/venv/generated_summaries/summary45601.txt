Kim's personal envoy, who was on a three-day visit to China, hand-delivered a letter from Kim to President Xi Jinping at a meeting in Beijing before returning to North Korea on Friday, according to state media. -- A personal envoy to North Korea's leader indicated Kim Jung Un was open to restarting nuclear disarmament talks, a move that came as China's leader delivered a blunt message to Pyongyang to return to the negotiating table, Chinese state-run media reported Friday. Choe said Kim's goal with sending the letter is to "improve, consolidate and develop" relations between North Korea and China, state news agency Xinhua reported. This month, North Korea test-fired rockets after criticizing the presence of a U.S. nuclear-powered aircraft carrier at a South Korean port and its reported participation in joint naval drills. During the meeting, Xi told Choe that North Korea needed to "stick to solving problems through dialogue and consultation," according to China Daily and CCTV.
