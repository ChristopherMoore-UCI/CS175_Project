According to UK government guidelines, humanitarian workers returning from Ebola-affected countries in West Africa who've been at high risk of exposure are expected to monitor their own health for 21 days after they get home. British media outlets have said she is a public health nurse who was part of a 30-strong team of medical volunteers deployed to Sierra Leone in West Africa by the UK government last month in a joint endeavor with Save the Children. A British volunteer nurse, William Pooley, was successfully treated in the unit following his return home from Sierra Leone in August after being diagnosed with Ebola. A spokesman for the government said the woman had been in West Africa recently, though she had no direct contact with anyone with Ebola. She traveled via Casablanca, Morocco, and London Heathrow Airport before arriving at Glasgow Airport on a British Airways flight late Sunday, the health agency NHS Scotland said.
