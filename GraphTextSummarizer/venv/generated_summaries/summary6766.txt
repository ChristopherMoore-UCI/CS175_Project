With moist eyes and soft voices, former U.S. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. and his wife pleaded guilty to federal charges on Wednesday related to years of using campaign funds for personal expenses that included purchases of Michael Jackson memorabilia and a Rolex watch. "Guilty, your honor," Jackson responded to U.S. District Judge Robert Wilkins while dabbing his eyes with a handkerchief after he looked back at family members in the courtroom, including his father, civil rights activist Jesse Jackson. "Mr. Jackson engaged in this scheme starting in 2005. " Jackson's wife is not mentioned by name in the document outlining misuse of campaign funds. "I used monies that should have been used for campaign purposes," Jackson, 47, acknowledged to the judge.
