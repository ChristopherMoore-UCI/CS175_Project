-- Barneys' internal review of accusations of racial bias toward customers absolves employees of racial profiling and places the blame on the police. The report also claims to have found no Barneys policy, written or unwritten, directing employees of the Loss Prevention department to engage in racial profiling and points out the department has a formal policy against racial profiling. In the Barneys case, Michael Yaki, who serves on the U.S. Commission of Civil Rights, conducted the review of the high-end retailer's actions and policies after public allegations of racial profiling, according to the retailer. Barneys is not the only major retailer facing accusations of racial profiling. Opinion: Jay Z can fight racial profiling in retail
