"For several years, Mr. McCauley abused his position as a family member to gain Mr. Cook's trust, and stole millions of dollars for his own personal gain," Attorney General Martha Coakley said after his sentencing. Erika McCauly, 35, will be in a Woburn, Massachusetts court Friday for a hearing on the status of the restitution payments and Darryl McCauley, 43, will have a hearing next week, according to Harry Pierre, Coakley's spokesman. Darryl McCauley, who was Cook's business manager from the early 1990s until 1998, pleaded guilty to larceny, embezzlement and forgery charges in October. The investigation began in December 2008 when Cook and his lawyer called police to alert them to the missing millions, according to Coakley's spokesman. McCauley, who kept Cook's financial books and managed his financial affairs, was accused of transferring millions of dollars from Cook's business accounts into his own personal accounts through checks and wire transfers, Pierre said.
