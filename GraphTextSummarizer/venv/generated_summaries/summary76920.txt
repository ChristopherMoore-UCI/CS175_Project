Health.com: I lost my insurance, stopped my diabetes medication, and had a heart attack Jauhar agrees that health literacy improves not only the quality of health care, but also life expectancy. "Health literacy is clearly very important, and how well patients are versed in their own health care is probably just as important a factor in determining longevity as genes or socioeconomic status," he says. " Many patients with heart failure, unfortunately, don't know which medicines to take, can't identify their symptoms, and don't follow up with their doctors, Jauhar says. "The same explanation may also be true for liver disease, but it may be a chance finding due to the sampling of patients for this study, and it really needs replicating in other larger studies to be certain it is a robust finding and to search for possible reasons for it." Adam Kelly, Ph.D., an assistant professor of medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine, in Houston,  Texas, conducted a 2007 study, that showed that doctors overestimate patient literacy and that a lack of patient knowledge leads to poorer care.
