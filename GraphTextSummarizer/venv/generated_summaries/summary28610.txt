Commenting on the current crisis Thursday, U.S. State Department Spokeswoman Jen Psaki said, "We continue to urge all sides to refrain from violence, exercise restraint, respect the rule of law." CNN's Sophia Saifi reported from Islamabad, and Jethro Mullen reported and wrote from Hong Kong. Sharif clashed with the military when he served as prime minister during the 1990s, resulting in a lengthy period of exile before his return to power last year. Demonstrations against the embattled government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif have been taking place in the capital, Islamabad, for the past two weeks. Qadri led demonstrations last year against the previous government, paralyzing the center of Islamabad. Both Khan and Qadri met late Thursday with the army chief, Gen. Raheel Sharif, who is not related to the prime minister.
