Leroy Alexander, was half a world away fighting with the Special Forces in Afghanistan, but he had found a way to send a floral arrangement to his wife, who was five months pregnant with twins. Alexander now lies in Arlington National Cemetery's Section 60, where 500 soldiers, Marines, airmen and sailors who have died in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried. Arlington's Section 60 is the final resting place for many casualties of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Adults, even some uniformed generals, walk slowly between the rows and rows of headstones, looking for a familiar name. A little necklace, Mardi Gras beads during Mardi Gras season.
