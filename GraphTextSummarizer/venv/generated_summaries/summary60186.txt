Editor's note: Actor and director Gary Sinise has appeared on film in "Forrest Gump," "Truman" and "Apollo 13" and on television in "CSI: NY." I have supported many grassroots troop support efforts as well, and visited our wounded in the hospitals several times. I wore that same rosary and dog tags as my character, "Lt. Dan," in the movie "Forrest Gump." Many years ago I got involved with Vietnam veteran support groups in the Chicago, Illinois, area. And so, I feel the need to do what I can to thank them for that service in order to help keep them strong in tough times.
