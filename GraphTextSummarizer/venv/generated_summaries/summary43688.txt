On March 8, when police recovered the body, an initial visual inspection did not indicate any signs of violence, Madrid officials said at the time. -- The final autopsy report on a San Diego State exchange student whose body was pulled from a Madrid river last March indicates an accidental drowning death with no signs of external violence, a Spanish court official said on Tuesday. At the time of the search, a family member told CNN in Madrid that contrary to initial reports, Bice was not refused entry to the nightclub by doormen and was not drunk, although "he had a few beers." The student, Austin Taylor Bice, 22, was studying a semester of business courses at the University of Carlos III in Madrid when he went missing after a night out with friends. There were no wounds on the body," said the official from Madrid's Superior Justice Tribunal.
