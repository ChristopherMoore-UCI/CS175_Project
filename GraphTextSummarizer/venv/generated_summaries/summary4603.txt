Serbia's renewed focus on building an impressive reputation in international movie production is benefiting several local industry players. "[Serbia] has a very long tradition of film making," says Ana Ilic, executive director of the Serbia Film Commission. " And now, filmmakers are taking notice once again as Serbia steps up its efforts to raise its profile as an important player in international filmmaking. But it's not just movie producers taking advantage of Serbia's bid to emerge as a key force in international filmmaking. Thanks to its diverse landscape and impressive architecture, Serbia represented a total of 18 countries in the mini-series, while the city of Belgrade served as the backdrop for seven world cities.
