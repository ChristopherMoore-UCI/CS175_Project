It's going to be worth it; Beck knows precisely where he needs to be to get the perfect picture when the overwhelming gold medal favorite Shaun White performs. Beck says when he has used a remote-fired camera, he's able to get other snowboarders in the frame perfectly, but White soars so high that much of the time he's at the top of the frame, if he's even in the picture. See 19 of Robert Beck's amazing SI photos from the Winter Games He knows where to be to get the shot he wants because Beck and his assistant, Kohjiro "Kojo" Kinno have been photographing White for months, learning his every move and tendency. For instance, Beck knows the best time to shoot a close-up of White is during his first practice run because the snowboarder doesn't go as high then. Fine has a request for Beck to get White at a certain angle.
