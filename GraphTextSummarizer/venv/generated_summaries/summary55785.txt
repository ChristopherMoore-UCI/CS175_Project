Now, decades later, I talked to the guys here at CNN and I told them I would like to end Larry King Live, the nightly show, this fall and CNN has graciously accepted, giving me more time for my wife and I to get to the kids' little league games," King wrote. " "He will end his run with Larry King Live on his own terms, sometime this fall," said Jon Klein, president of CNNUS. "Only God failed to show up for a Larry King interview," said Tom Johnson, who was CNN's chairman for more than a decade, ending in 2001. King has repeatedly talked about the importance of spending time with his children, including his two boys from his marriage with Southwick-King. King was hosting a nationally syndicated overnight radio talk show when CNN founder Ted Turner persuaded him in 1985 to try his interviewing skills on cable TV.
