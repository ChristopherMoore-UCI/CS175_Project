Bayern took a 2-0 lead after only 26 minutes as Franck Ribery and Thomas Muller scored within 60 seconds of each other, but Schalke's former Germany striker Kevin Kuranyi reduced the deficit soon after. Kuranyi should have leveled just before the break but missed from close range, and Schalke failed to seriously threaten the Bayern goal in the second spell. Bayern were again without Dutch forward Arjen Robben, who missed the United game with a calf problem, but surged into a two-goal lead when French playmaker Ribery fired home from a corner and Tuesday's match-winner Ivica Olic set up Muller. Borussia Dortmund consolidated fourth place with a 2-1 victory at home to Werder Bremen, scoring both goals in the first half through Kevin Grosskreutz and Neven Subotic before Aaron Hunt pulled one back in the 65th minute. Louis Van Gaal's team followed up the midweek Champions League victory over Manchester United with a win that puts them a point clear of previous leaders Schalke ahead of Wednesday's trip to England for the second leg of the quarterfinal.
