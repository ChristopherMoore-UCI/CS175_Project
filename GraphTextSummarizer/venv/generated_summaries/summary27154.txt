The Art Institute is making grief counselors available to students, noting, "This is a hard time for everyone and there can be a range of emotions that are felt." Stockton added a bulletin board has been set up for anyone to post memories of Nance. Nance, who was from Italy, Texas, will be laid to rest Thursday. Dallas police said officers were asked to investigate after Nance had not been seen for several days. Nance beat out about 60 other applicants to win the partial scholarship to the institute, Stockton said. She was majoring in animation, with about a year to go before getting her bachelor's degree, said Sarah Stockton, public relations director at the school.
