I took Danny to try every therapy known at the time: excising sugar, wheat or gluten from his diet, acupuncture, massage, psychic healers, trips to Toronto, Canada, to The Listening Centre for auditory integration. Feeling helpless and exhausted, we brought him to Dr. Isabelle Rapin, the head of pediatric neurology at the Albert Einstein School of Medicine. After three more visits with  Rapin, Danny was diagnosed as a high-functioning child on the autistic spectrum, and she recommended we take him to The Therapeutic Nursery at the Jewish Community Center on the Palisades in Tenafly, New Jersey. Before I can come up with one, Danny says, "United, United is a good word for U!" Five years ago, I was approached by a television executive to develop an animated musical series for children.
