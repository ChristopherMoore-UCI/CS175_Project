"Compounding this tragedy, the real murderer of Kent Heitholt has escaped arrest, prosecution, and conviction for 13 years because of Ryan's wrongful arrest, prosecution, and conviction. It alleges nine separate counts including suppression and fabrication of evidence, failure to investigate, malicious prosecution, conspiracy to deprive Ferguson of his constitutional rights, defamation and false arrest. Ryan Ferguson was freed last year after serving nearly 10 years for a murder he said he didn't commit. " Ferguson was just a teenager when he was arrested in Missouri in 2004, accused of killing Columbia Tribune sports editor Kent Heitholt three years earlier. The Jefferson City Correctional Center released Ferguson in November after Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster said he wouldn't retry Ferguson.
