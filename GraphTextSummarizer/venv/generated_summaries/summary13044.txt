Stephen Brodie was convicted of the 1990 sexual assault of a 5-year-old girl largely based on his confession rather than physical evidence, CNN-affiliate KTXA reported. On Monday, Brodie was in a Dallas courtroom where Judge Lena Levario ruled that he would be released, the judge's clerk told CNN. -- A deaf Texas man, who was imprisoned for years for a sexual crime, was released from a Texas jail Tuesday after a judge exonerated him on Monday based on new evidence. A spokesman for Richardson police, the department that arrested Brodie, told KTXA that the department did a thorough and competent investigation. Brodie told KTXA that he was harassed by police and confessed to the crime to get them to leave him alone.
