Before his murder Dink was on trial for "insulting Turkishness" because he referred to the World War I-era massacre of hundreds of thousands of ethnic Armenian as genocide. "The verdict was not only a travesty of justice, it shows our justice system is simply political and does not work," said newspaper columnist Asli Aydintasbas, as she marched along with her mother and thousands of others up Istanbul's Cumhuriyet Caddesi, the broad boulevard where Dink was shot dead. But while attracting the anger of Turkish ultra-nationalists, Dink was also outspoken in his defense of freedom of speech. A crowd estimated at more than 10,000 people marched silently on a bitterly cold day through downtown Istanbul Thursday to commemorate the five year anniversary of the murder of an ethnic Armenian journalist Hrant Dink. Three months before his murder, Dink gave an interview to U.S. National Public Radio, in which he argued against a proposed law in France to make the denial of the Armenian genocide a crime.
