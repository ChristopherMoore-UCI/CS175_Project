Official: 9 civilians die in attack on Kabul luxury hotel CNN's Masoud Popalzai reported from Kabul, with Laura Smith-Spark writing in London. The victims were two police officers, two election commission workers and a provincial council candidate, said spokesman Sediq Sediqqi in Kabul. Abdul Ghani Musamim, spokesman for Kunar's provincial governor, told CNN three insurgents stormed a branch of Kabul Bank, where police and other governmental workers had gathered to receive their salaries.

One also blew himself up, and Afghan security forces shot the third attacker, Musamim said.
