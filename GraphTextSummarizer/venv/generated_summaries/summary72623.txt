The NHL Players' Association ratified a new collective bargaining agreement Saturday, ending the lockout that began September 15. The league's board of governors approved the deal Wednesday, but it wasn't official until Saturday. Three games will open the truncated regular season at 3 p.m. ET on Saturday: Pittsburgh at Philadelphia, Ottawa at Winnipeg and Chicago at Los Angeles, the reigning Stanley Cup champion. The last time the league had labor strife, the entire 2004-05 season was eliminated.
