It has really nice beaches and the folks are really great," Deputy Press Secretary Bill Burton told reporters Thursday. -- President Barack Obama and his family begin a week-long vacation in Martha's Vineyard on Friday -- the president's second time on the island off the coast of Massachusetts. " The island, a vacation spot of the rich and famous, was a favorite getaway for another Democratic president as well: Bill Clinton, who spent plenty of time there. In 2009, Obama spent time there golfing and hanging out with family and friends. Some have questioned why the Obamas have chosen to go to an elite holiday spot in Massachusetts instead of the Gulf Coast, as Obama had encouraged Americans to help bolster tourism there.
