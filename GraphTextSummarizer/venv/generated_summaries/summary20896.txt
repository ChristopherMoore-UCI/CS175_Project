Four months after the school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, a bipartisan compromise amendment to secure universal background checks failed in Senate. On a much lighter note, we decided to take on Justin Beiber's visit to the Anne Frank house in Amsterdam, inspired by an excellent column Dean wrote for CNN.com. Second, we look at the failure of universal background checks to pass the U.S. Senate despite the support of nearly 90% of Americans. While I understand their frustration and favor background checks, I'm wary of passing laws that make us feel safer but do little to actually prevent the next Newtown. One possible silver lining: This was a teaching moment for thousands of Beliebers who had never heard of Anne Frank.
