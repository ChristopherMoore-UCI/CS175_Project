In March of 1981, Hinckley shot President Ronald Reagan, his press secretary James Brady, Secret Service agent Timothy McCarthy and Washington policeman Thomas Delahanty. The psychiatrist said that in the late1990s he had recommended Hinckley start taking the antipsychotic drug Risperdal to prevent any new symptoms. Federal prosecutors called Patterson as an expert witness in their effort to block a proposal from St. Elizabeths, the Washington mental hospital where Hinckley has undergone treatment for three decades, to increase Hinckley's periods of visitation to his mother's home in Williamsburg, Virginia, and his possible eventual release as a permanent outpatient. In December, experts called by Hinckley's lawyers testified his two most serious mental problems-- major depressive disorder and an unspecified psychotic disorder-- are in full remission. Patterson said Hinckley said he was engaged to CB and was unhappy his mother would not allow her to visit him during his stays at her Virginia home.
