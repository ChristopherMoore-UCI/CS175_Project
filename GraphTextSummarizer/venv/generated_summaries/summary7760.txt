Although many of the cases have occurred on the Arabian Peninsula, people have died of the infection elsewhere, including in European countries and Tunisia in North Africa. Last week, reports on social media said health care workers had refused to treat MERS-CoV patients. Saudi health officials are stepping up efforts to fight the Middle East respiratory symptom coronavirus, or MERS-CoV, after a recent spike in cases. MERS-CoV comes from the same group of viruses as the common cold and attacks the respiratory system, the U.S.-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says. After the spike in cases, Dr. Abdullah bin Abdulaziz Al-Rabiah stepped down as minister of health, state media reported Monday.
