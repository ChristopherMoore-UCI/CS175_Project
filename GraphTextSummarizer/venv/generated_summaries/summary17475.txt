The delays to paramedics were red-flagged on the second day of the lane closures last September when Fort Lee EMS coordinator Paul Favia wrote a letter to the mayor saying the snarled traffic was "causing unnecessary delays for emergency services. On September 9, Emergency Medical Services personnel received a call about an unconscious 91-year-old woman, and the response time was seven minutes because of traffic, Favia said in his letter. "This crosses a line that is rarely crossed: People's lives were in danger," said New Jersey state Sen. Ray Lesniak, a Democrat. " In two emergency calls, response time was doubled because of the traffic jams, Favia wrote. In summarizing a total of four delayed emergency responses on September 9 and September 10, Favia urged Mayor Mark Sokolich to take action.
