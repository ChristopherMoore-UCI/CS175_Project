The U.N. report noted that U.S. troops were not solely responsible for ruining the 4,000-year-old city. A military official said she had not seen the U.N. report, but added that one of the reasons troops set up a base at the site was to safeguard it. "Coalition forces first occupied the Babylon site in April 2003 during the ground campaign of Operation Iraqi Freedom with a purpose, among others, of protecting the ruins from looting after the provincial museums in Babylon and Kufa were robbed of their entire contents," said The United States has agreed to pay $800,000 to help rehabilitate the Babylon site, an Iraqi official said. Babylon, an hour's drive south of Baghdad, dates to ancient Mesopotamia.
