Gao and his girlfriend withdrew $6.8 million and transferred them to overeseas accounts in Hong Kong, China and the Wynn casino in Macau, according to court documents. In April of that year, Gao applied for overdraft financing for the gas station he co-owned with his mother in Rotorua, New Zealand, according to court records. The next day, Gao discovered the error in his bank account and told his girlfriend, Kara Hurring that he was "fâ€”ing rich" and had millions of dollars, according to court documents. After two and a half years on the run, Gao was arrested in Hong Kong in September 2011, and extradited to New Zealand in December. She has been found guilty of 28 counts of theft and two counts of money laundering, court records show.
