While homosexuality is not overtly outlawed in Egypt, gay people can face criminal charges under statutes that broadly claim to protect social "morality." The short video that went viral last week appears to have been filmed at a party on a Nile riverboat and appears to show two men in dark suits exchanging rings. Egypt's public prosecutor ordered the arrest Saturday of nine men on criminal charges of "debauchery" after a social media video purporting to show a gay wedding went viral. In April, four men were sentenced to prison for similar morality charges. In a statement, the prosecutor's office accused the men of "debauchery" and "undermining public morals" and ordered a physical examination by a forensic doctor, a common practice in Egypt when arresting homosexuals.
