-- Actor Michael Douglas says he has beaten throat cancer. "I think the odds are with the tumor gone and what I know about this particular type of cancer that I've got it beat," he told host Matt Lauer of "Today" in an interview to air on NBC Tuesday. The tabloids and paparazzi have published photographs of an emaciated Douglas as he was undergoing treatment, and while Douglas said he didn't follow the coverage, friends apparently did and called him to see how he was doing, he said. But it's been a wild six-month ride," Douglas said in his first television interview since undergoing cancer treatment. " A portion of the interview will air Tuesday on "Today," and the entire interview will air Sunday on "Dateline NBC" at 7 p.m. ET.
