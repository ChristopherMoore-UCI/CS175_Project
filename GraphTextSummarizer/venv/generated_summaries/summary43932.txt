It landed more than three hours later and about 40 miles away at Seattle, Washington's Boeing Field after having flown at a speed of 207 mph at 15,000 feet -- typical for a maiden flight, the company said. "Today is truly a proud and historic day for the global team who has worked tirelessly to design and build the 787 Dreamliner -- the first all-new jet airplane of the 21st century," said Scott Fancher, vice president and general manager of the 787 program, in a news release. "We think this is going to be a very efficient airplane," Jim Albaugh, Boeing executive vice president and CEO, told CNN. During their time aloft, the chief pilot and captain tested some of the airplane's systems and structures while flight data were transmitted electronically to engineers at Boeing Field. "They did too much outsourcing, too soon, with too little oversight," said Scott Hamilton of the aviation consulting firm Leeham Co.
