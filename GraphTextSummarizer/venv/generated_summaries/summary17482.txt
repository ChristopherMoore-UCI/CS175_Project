A research psychiatrist and scientist, Volkow said she is encouraged by this significant decline, particularly in synthetic drugs and prescription drugs, which had been a growing problem for teens. The patterns for other drug use are similar to other surveys. There has been a decline in the number of children trying synthetic drugs like K2/Special, also known as synthetic marijuana, in the two years the survey has measured this in all three grades. Researchers have seen a decline over the past five years in use of  prescription pain medicine and haven't seen an uptick in use of other drugs like heroin to compensate for the decline. "The main highlight is that for most indicators the news is very good," said NIDA Director Dr. Nora Volkow.
