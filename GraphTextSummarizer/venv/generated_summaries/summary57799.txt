Mann, whose specialty was internal medicine and pain management, allegedly set off an explosion that injured family practitioner Trent Pierce on February 4, outside Pierce's West Memphis, Arkansas, home. A third charge filed Wednesday accuses Mann of possessing chloroform in his jail cell, according to a news release from the U.S. Attorney of the Eastern District of Arkansas. But Duke said the board had taken several disciplinary actions against Mann's license. U.S. Attorney Jane Duke, speaking at a news conference, declined to comment on the suspected purpose of the chloroform. Randeep Mann, a Russellville, Arkansas, doctor, is charged with one count of using a "weapon of mass destruction" against a person and property and a second count of "maliciously" using an explosive to damage or destroy a vehicle, according to prosecutors.
