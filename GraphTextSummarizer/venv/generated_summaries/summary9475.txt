"A lot of people keep snoozing alarm clocks and still can't wake up,"  Hrachik Adjamian, Wakie's CEO and co-founder, told TechCrunch. Adjamian told TechCrunch that version may allow conversations up to five minutes, as well as letting users choose the gender of the person who calls them. Which starts to sound a bit too much like a wakeup dating app to us -- though there are worse ways to have early morning chats with romantically minded strangers, we suppose. The length of a call is limited to one minute, and users are encouraged to sing songs, tell jokes, recite poems or use otherwise creative ways to kickstart their slumbering community members' days. There are in-app tools to report abuse, but Adjamian says it's never really been a problem.
