-- An intruder was shot and killed at the home of a deputy district attorney and her sheriff's-deputy husband in Hot Sulphur Springs, Colorado, just before midnight Monday, according to a statement from the Colorado Bureau of Investigations. "There are no apparent ties to recent shootings" of other legal-system officials in Colorado and Texas, the statement said. Grand County Coroner Brenda Bock identified the man as Joshua Stevens, 31. He had moved to Colorado recently from Michigan, his father said. Bock told CNN she thinks Stevens was unarmed.
