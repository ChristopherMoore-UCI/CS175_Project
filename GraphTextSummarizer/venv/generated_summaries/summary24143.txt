-- Skier Lindsey Vonn is to take a sabbatical from World Cup competition, but the American insists the break has nothing to do with her recent admission she suffers from depression. This season Vonn has won two downhills and two super-Gs, with her St. Moritz super-G victory in Switzerland delivering a 57th career World Cup triumph to put her within five victories of record-holder Annemarie Moser-Proell on the all-time list. " Alpine Director of the U.S. Ski Team Patrick Riml added: "We support Lindsey in the decision so that she can return to the World Cup and compete in the World Championships at full strength." "After talking with my family and consulting with my coaches and trainers, I've decided to take a break from the World Cup circuit," said Vonn on her Facebook page. "I want to be emphatic that this has nothing to do with my recent interview with People Magazine," added the 28-year-old Vonn on Facebook, referring to her admission that she has suffered from depression and currently takes an anti-depressant to manage the condition.
