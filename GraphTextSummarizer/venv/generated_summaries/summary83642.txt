Algeria began the Group A match as clear favorites, but were 2-0 down by half-time thanks to goals from Russel Mwafulirwa and Elvis Kafoteka. After eight minutes, Russel found a yard in the Algeria box but headed wide under pressure from Madjid Bougherra. Algeria goalkeeper Faouzi Chaouchi attempted to clear a long ball but only succeeded in smashing the ball straight into the advancing Essau Kanyenda. Sunday's 4-4 draw between hosts Angola and Mali did not appear to have captured the public's imagination as the players kicked off in front of rows and rows of empty seats. Meanwhile, in the day's other match, tournament favourites Ivory Coast were held to a 0-0 draw by a stubborn Burkina Faso in their opening Group B match at the Estadio do Cabinda.
