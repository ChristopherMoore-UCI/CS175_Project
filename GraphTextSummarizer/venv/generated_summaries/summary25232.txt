And police in Essex Junction, located in western Vermont just outside Burlington, said the event also went "better than expected" from their end. The show took place at the Champlain Valley Expo in Essex Junction on Wednesday night -- nearly three weeks after Vermont experienced deadly, damaging floods caused by the remnants of Hurricane Irene. Vermont Gov. Peter Shumlin was among those attending the show, thanking Phish for coming back to Vermont, a state they hadn't played since 2004. Jam band Phish broke attendance records and raised more than $1.2 million for victims of flooding this week in their home state of Vermont. When it came to Vermont, the state where Phish was formed in 1983, however, the band concluded, "We have to do something bigger," said Beth Montuori Rowles from the WaterWheel Foundation.
