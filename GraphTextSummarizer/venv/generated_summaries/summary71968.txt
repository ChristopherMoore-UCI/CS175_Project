"We still do not have a motive why they opened fire," municipal police spokesman Adrian Sanchez told CNN in a phone interview from the scene. The soccer field is at a community center opened four months ago as part of a program to decrease drug violence in a city that has been racked by violence and killings linked to drug cartels. -- A group of heavily armed men opened fire at a soccer match between two local teams in western Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, killing seven people and wounding two others, according to a municipal police spokesman. Some of the victims were taken to hospitals by family members. The dead from the shooting Sunday evening were males ranging in age from 19 to 26, police said.
