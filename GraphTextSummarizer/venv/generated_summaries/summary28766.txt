The fallout may cost Guillen the trust of Miami fans. His comment to Time magazine that he loves Fidel Castro and later comment that he "respects" him rankled the Cuban-American community in Miami, home to the baseball team Guillen manages, the Marlins. In another city, Guillen's comments may not have been as controversial, but in Miami, there is a unique sensitivity to Castro, Wasserman said. Frank Ramirez, a longtime fan, said that Miami "is the last place you want to say something like that." Still, he drew a distinction between the ball club suspending Guillen for what he said, rather than acting in response to fan outcries. Miami's Cuban community is made up of a large number of exiles who fled the Castro regime and who strongly lobby in support of the U.S. embargo against Cuba and other anti-Castro measures.
