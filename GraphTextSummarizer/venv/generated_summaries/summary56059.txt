Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge James Brandlin signed off on 1,000 hours of such "community labor" for Brown as agreed to by the singer's camp and prosecutors. Brown sat quietly through Friday's court hearing in Los Angeles, with two brief exceptions: When he told Brandlin, "yes," he accepted the agreement and later that he had no further questions. District Attorney Jackie Lacey said then the paperwork the singer submitted to prove he'd done the work was "at best sloppy documentation and at worst fraudulent reporting." Geragos fired back, calling the prosecution's motion "fraudulent." Judge Brandlin made a point Friday not to pick sides on this debate over Brown's previous service, saying "the court does not make any findings regarding the alleged violation in this matter." Judge revokes Brown's probation The trigger for Brown's alleged rage was that Gure took a photograph of him and his girlfriend, Karrueche Tran, to document the scene because he allegedly refused to show her his driver's license, she said. The accuser in that case, Olga Gure, told investigators Brown "went ballistic" and screamed at her after his Range Rover rear-ended her Mercedes on a Los Angeles street.
