-- Pakistani security forces launched an operation against Taliban militants in the nation's tribal region along the border with Afghanistan on Tuesday, shutting down NATO supply routes, Pakistani military sources said. The Khyber Pass, a key transit link for NATO and U.S. military supplies from Pakistan to Afghanistan, has been closed as a result of the operation, said Tariq Hayat, Khyber's political agent. Recent hit-and-run attacks have compromised supply convoys, forcing coalition forces to find alternate routes. Containers bearing supplies for US-led forces and NATO in Afghanistan wait in Pakistan in November. The Kyber Pass -- an ancient, three-mile pass which links Pakistan to Afghanistan through the Hindu Kush range -- has traditionally been a vital route for supplies into Afghanistan.
