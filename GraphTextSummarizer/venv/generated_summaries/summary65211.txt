-- The son of late evangelist Oral Roberts and former president of Oral Roberts University was arrested early Tuesday on suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol and speeding, authorities said. "Our prayers go out to Richard and Lindsay Roberts and their entire family as they face this life challenge," said Jeremy Burton, spokesman for Oral Roberts University. Roberts was president of Oral Roberts University until 2007. Oral Roberts died in 2009. The trooper "detected the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage about Roberts' breath and person," the report said, and Roberts failed field sobriety tests.
