In the Vendee region of France, Thomson says he is held up on a pedestal, given superstar status like Beckham. " The psychologist has taught Thomson visualization exercises to keep his demons at bay. " Thomson has gained notoriety for two sailing stunts, one in which he stood on the keel of his boat as it was titled to the side in race mode before jumping off, the other seeing him hurtle up the mast before diving into the ocean -- both times bedecked in a designer suit.

Conscious of the risks involved of stunts and voyages alike, Thomson uses sports psychologist Ken Way to talk him through the emotions he is experiencing.
