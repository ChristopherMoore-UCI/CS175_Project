Japan, who have participated in every edition of the World Cup and are coached by former New Zealand wing John Kirwan, had little reason to cheer, but did manage to touch down beyond the All Blacks' line in the second half through Hirotoki Onozawa. The result left New Zealand top of their group, with a maximum 10 points from their two games so far. For Japan, this was their second-straight defeat, after a 47-21 reverse against France, and they sit bottom of Pool A. New Zealand wasted no time in opening the scoring, center Conrad Smith grabbing the game's first try after just three minutes. Four more tries followed for New Zealand before the final whistle; hooker Andrew Hore, Ma'a Nonu and flanker Adam Thomas all contributing to the runaway score. New Zealand's pressure was relentless and after the break Kahui ran over for his second try of the match before center Sonny Bill Williams scored his first of the game.
