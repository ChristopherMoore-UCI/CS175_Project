"It's been an odd relationship with F1," said IndyCar icon Dario Franchitti, who was in Austin to watch his cousin Paul di Resta drive for the Force India team. After the Indianapolis Motor Speedway lost its contract to host F1, the Texan city of Austin successfully bid to stage the race on a purpose-built track. The circuit received an official seal of approval in September but 12 miles away, pockets of downtown Austin remained unsure about F1. " There are even opportunities for teams with non-motoring products to market, such as Red Bull who sell most of their energy drinks in the U.S. But while the city, the circuit, the racing and the shop window it provides have all trumpeted F1's return to the U.S., it must still do more if it is to conquer America. Since the sport abandoned the U.S. in 2007 it has been a long road back -- but a journey F1 desperately needed to make as a global sport, especially with the bizarre 2005 race still fresh in some minds.
