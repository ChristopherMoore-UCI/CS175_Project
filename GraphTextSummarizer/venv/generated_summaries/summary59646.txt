Amid a stifling siege on Homs, where the Syrian Army regularly blocked food, medicine and supplies, Mohammad and Ayat got married. God willing, he will grant us the patience to overcome Ayat's death, too," Mohammad said. The Syrian uprising sparked by revolts across the Middle East forever changed Ayat's country and transformed Homs into a bastion of resistance against al-Assad's government. Ayat and Mohammad recently found out they were expecting their first child. "We hope once the regime falls we can have a wedding, because our happiness is the end of this government." Although Ayat and Mohammad married just a week after meeting, the two were in love, her mother said.
