In typical riot control protocol, police used water cannon and tear gas on Monday to clear out Taksim Square, the flashpoint of anti-government demonstrations that started in late May. Taksim Solidarity, the umbrella platform of activists and civil society groups, said in a media statement that roughly 80 people had been detained on Monday and that 32 of them are members of the group. The 6th Administrative Court in Istanbul overruled parts of the Taksim development project last week, including plans to rebuild old barracks in Gezi Park that would have been used for a shopping arcade. Turkish authorities reopened Gezi Park in Istanbul on Monday for the first time since a crackdown on protesters last month and soon closed it again, pushing demonstrators to the streets. "As we were walking through Taksim Square, our friends were detained." Istanbul's governor warned protestors before Gezi Park was reopened that the park would be opened to the public but that demonstrations there would not be tolerated. Tens of thousands of people poured into Gezi Park and Taksim Square in Istanbul's main commercial district in response to the police action and the planned development project.
