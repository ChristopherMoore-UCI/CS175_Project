Lightning strikes killed two people in two days in Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado, said Kyle Patterson, public information officer at the park. The park 75 miles from Denver had not had a lightning death since 2000, when a technical climber was struck on the Diamond on Longs Peak, Patterson said. On Friday, lightning hit eight people on the Ute Crossing Trail, about 500 feet from the trailhead, Patterson said. Both strikes hit the people on trails off Trail Ridge Road at elevations of 10,829 and 11,400 feet, Patterson said. Rebecca R. Teilhet, 42, of Yellow Springs, Ohio, died on the scene, Patterson said.
