"I don't think there was a great deal of evidence suggesting that withdrawing food dyes and food additives were helping those children," Pearson says. In a two-day meeting beginning Wednesday, an FDA advisory committee will discuss the strength of the evidence surrounding food dyes and behavior changes in children, whether food labels should be changed to better protect consumers, and whether more studies on the subject need to be conducted. However, some food manufacturers are proactively reducing their use of food dyes and other additives, and some retailers are declining to stock products containing artificial coloring. "Some research suggests that they may be linked to exacerbated symptoms in people who already have ADHD." Tying hyperactivity to specific food dyes or additives is especially difficult, Ulbricht adds, because "most products contain more than one." Doctors and consumer advocates have long wondered whether hyperactivity might be tied to certain dyes and additives used in processed foods, but in decades of research no studies have been able to conclusively prove -- or disprove -- such a link.
