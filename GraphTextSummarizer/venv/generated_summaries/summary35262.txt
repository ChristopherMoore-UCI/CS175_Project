Republican strategist and CNN contributor Rich Galen said children of presidential candidates are rarely in the limelight and that the spouses usually hold a more important role. -- As the most recognizable political offspring so far in the 2012 election cycle, the three eldest daughters of GOP presidential candidate Jon Huntsman are trying to use Twitter, television and YouTube to get votes for their dad. " Huntsman acknowledges the potential for mishap looms, but he told CNN that his daughters' success represents new campaign realities. "He hasn't had a chance to have America see him yet," Mary Anne told Morgan on Wednesday. During an interview with CNN's "Piers Morgan Tonight" on Wednesday, the conversation ranged from their father's campaign momentum to his attire and haircut.
