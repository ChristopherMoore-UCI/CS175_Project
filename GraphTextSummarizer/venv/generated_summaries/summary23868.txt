Another 28-year-old man died Tuesday afternoon at a hospital in Finland's capital, Helsinki, about 50 miles to the west, Fagerholm said. -- A quarrel between occupants of two vehicles at a McDonald's restaurant drive-through in southern Finland erupted in gunfire Tuesday, leaving three men dead, police said. "We believe it was a very small issue" that escalated, Fagerholm said late Tuesday. Three occupants in one of the vehicles have been arrested, said Peter Fagerholm, a detective inspector in the town of Porvoo. In 1995 he was sentenced to life in prison on one count of murder and two counts of attempted homicide, Fagerholm said.
