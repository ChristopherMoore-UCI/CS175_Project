Speaking outside court, Lawrence's mother, Doreen Lawrence, expressed her gratitude to those who had supported the family through their long fight for justice. Dobson had previously appeared in court in 1996 in connection with the Lawrence murder, but that case -- a private prosecution brought by the Lawrence family -- collapsed and he was acquitted. Gary Dobson and David Norris were convicted Tuesday in the killing of Stephen Lawrence in 1993, after a trial based on new forensic evidence. "Throughout the 18-year ordeal, the Lawrence family's desire has been the pursuit of justice -- today, justice was served," chief executive Paul Anderson-Walsh said in a written statement. Stephen Lawrence's father, Neville Lawrence, told reporters he hoped to be standing outside the court in a year's time marking the sentencing of the other men allegedly involved in his son's death.
