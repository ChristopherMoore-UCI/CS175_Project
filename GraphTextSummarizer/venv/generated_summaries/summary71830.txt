Still, two projects in post-earthquake Haiti demonstrate how local input can be instrumental in producing results. Haiti is a tough place, something that's especially so for its millions of poor, of course, but also for the country's middle and upper classes, and foreign visitors. Unfortunately, one of the critiques of Haiti's recovery has been that well-meaning foreigners flooded in and imposed their ideas, too often ignoring locals' wishes and ideas. As a result, during one nationwide campaign since the earthquake, drugs were delivered to an unprecedented 86% of Haiti's 10 million people -- no other recorded intervention in Haiti appears to have encompassed so many residents. A critical aspect of the success of these efforts has been the World Health Organization's use of local community leaders to organize, promote and distribute the drugs in their communities.
