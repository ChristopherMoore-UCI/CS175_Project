The paper, which has the catchy title, "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas: Evidence from Blackjack Tables," was produced by Bruce Carlin and David T Robinson, both finance professors at UCLA's Anderson school and Duke University's Fuqua school respectively. The study's key finding was that passive strategy errors, in which players fail to take the right action, were four times more common than mistakes in which they did something that was not necessary. They studied more than 4,300 hands of blackjack played for real at a Las Vegas casino -- more than $120,000 changed hands -- and uncovered what psychologists call an omission bias; that is, players being more conservative in their bets than the level which would have optimized winnings. Blackjack was the ideal pursuit to use as a testing ground as it is widely acknowledged that players are at the tables to maximize gain. "As we point out in the paper, blackjack is a great venue to study how people behave during risky situations," Carlin told CNN.
