Nicolas Sarkozy, president:  "Whereas there is no longer any doubt  (that Gadhafi will have to go), the president of the republic urges Colonel Gadhafi to avoid inflicting new futile sufferings on his people in abandoning what is left of his power and in immediately calling on his forces, who are still loyal to him, to a cease-fire, to drop their weapons, to go back to their barracks and to put at its disposal legitimate Libyan authorities." . Ed Miliband, leader of the Labour Party: "The situation in Libya remains fraught and fragile, but what is clear is that the regime of Colonel Gadhafi is crumbling. Clayson Monyela, spokesman, Department of International Relations: "With the imminent fall of the government of Colonel Gadhafi, we wish to urge the interim authority in Tripoli to immediately institute an all-inclusive inter-Libyan political dialogue aimed at building a truly representative and people-centred dispensation." We urge Colonel Gadhafi to accept the will of the people, step down immediately, and avoid further bloodshed and sufferance. China respects the choice of Libya people.
