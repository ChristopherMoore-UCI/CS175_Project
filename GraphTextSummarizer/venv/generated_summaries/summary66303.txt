Nandipati wins $30,000 and an engraved trophy from Scripps, a $2,500 U.S. savings bond and reference library from Merriam-Webster, a $5,000 scholarship from the Sigma Phil Epsilon Educational Foundation and more than $2,600 in reference works from Encyclopaedia Britannica. -- Snigdha Nandipati, 14, won the Scripps National Spelling Bee on Thursday night by spelling "guetapens," which means an ambush, snare or trap. The contest was held in the Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center in National Harbor, Maryland, outside Washington. "I was just taking it one word at a time," the eighth-grader from San Diego told CNN on Friday morning. She was cheered on by her brother, her parents (her father coached her) and her grandparents, who had traveled from India to watch.
