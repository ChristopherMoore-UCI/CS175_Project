Mark Mathews of the Bluefin search team said the initial launch Monday night took place "in the very far corner of the area it's searching, so they are just shifting the search box a little bit away from that deep water and proceeding with the search." With no debris found after weeks of searches and no possible pings from the plane's black boxes detected in a week, Houston said it was time to focus the search underwater. It's not unusual to get into areas where the charts aren't accurate or you lack information," Kelly told CNN's "Erin Burnett OutFront. And we believe that, with some confidence, we could push Bluefin to that depth." He said two-thirds of the search area was less than 4,500 meters deep. The deputy director for salvage and diving for the U.S. Navy told CNN that the Bluefin may actually be able to go deeper than it was first programmed to do, engineers have determined.
