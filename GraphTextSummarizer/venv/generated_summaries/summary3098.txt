CNN: Atlanta country radio has been touting Georgia as the new capital of country music thanks to artists like you, Jennifer Nettles, the Zac Brown Band and Lady Antebellum. Introspective songs such as "Amarillo Sky" and "Don't You Wanna Stay" have earned him big sales numbers, but concert fans clamor for his more upbeat numbers such as "She's Country." I think that, unlike a lot of other artists in the business, you know, he and I actually pull for each other. You're going to have a good time, and we encourage that -- probably a lot more than other people do. I think it's important to have other outlets away from the music industry.
