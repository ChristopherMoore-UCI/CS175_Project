Ivan Lopez and his fellow soldiers, rather than a medical condition, may have led to Lopez opening fire. But authorities have "no indication at this time" that Lopez was targeting specific soldiers when he opened fire on the Army post, Milley said. U.S. law enforcement officials previously said Lopez bought his gun at Guns Galore, a store in Killeen. But behind Lopez's smile lay a history of depression, anxiety and other psychiatric disorders, Milley told reporters. Army records don't show him as having been wounded in Iraq, but Lopez reported that he had suffered a traumatic brain injury, Milley said.
