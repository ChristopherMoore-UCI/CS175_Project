Thousands of people have taken to the streets of the South Korean capital in protest at the deal South Korea banned imports of U.S. beef in 2003 amid concerns over a case of mad cow disease in the United States. -- South Korea will open its market to most U.S. beef, a senior government official said Thursday, according to state media. When South Korea and the United States reached the deal in April to re-open the South Korean market, they removed the major obstacle to U.S. congressional approval of the Korea-U.S. Free Trade Agreement (FTA). The pending resumption of U.S. beef imports hasn't been without political costs for President Lee Myung-bak. The ban closed what was then the third-largest market for U.S. beef exporters.
