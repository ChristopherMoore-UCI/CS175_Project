Police say they found the infant with no obvious external injuries, but an autopsy later revealed blunt force trauma to the skull as the cause of death, according to Watertown Police spokesman Frank Derrigo. Jeffrey Sliker was charged in the death of Laurne Clark, also known as Mollie Sliker, after police responded to a call from the couple's house on Wednesday, according to Julie Call, a court spokeswoman in Watertown, New York. He was arraigned Friday morning in Watertown City Court and is being held without bail. Upon questioning, Sliker allegedly admitted causing the injury, Derrigo said. Sliker is expected to face a preliminary hearing in Jefferson County Court early next week.
