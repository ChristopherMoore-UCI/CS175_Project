That led to lengthy delays for hundreds of passengers at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport Wednesday night into Thursday morning, with dozens sleeping at the airport until their aircraft were cleared for takeoff. "Upon indication of a smoky odor in the cabin, our flight 365 from New Orleans to Dallas/Fort Worth returned to New Orleans as a safety precaution," said Spirit spokeswoman Misty Pinson. In that case, an engine failed on Atlanta-bound Spirit Flight 165 shortly after takeoff from Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport. A Spirit Airlines flight departing New Orleans en route to Dallas was forced to make an emergency landing Thursday, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. "The crew reported smoke in the cockpit and returned to New Orleans, where the flight landed safely," said Lynn Lunsford, an FAA spokesman.
