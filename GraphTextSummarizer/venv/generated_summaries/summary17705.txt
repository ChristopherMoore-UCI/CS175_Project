The shooter barricaded himself in the school's front office with employees before eventually surrendering to police, DeKalb County Police Chief Cedric Alexander told reporters. The gunman also threatened to harm police, the woman said, according to LeCroy. Suspected shooter Michael Brandon Hill, 20, faces charges including aggravated assault on a police officer, terroristic threats and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, police spokeswoman Mekka Parish said. The shooter fired about six shots from inside the school toward officers as they approached outside, Alexander said, and police returned fire. "Everybody's safe," DeKalb County Schools Superintendent Michael Thurmond said.
