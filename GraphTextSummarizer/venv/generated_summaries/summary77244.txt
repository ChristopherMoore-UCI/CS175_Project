"They're extremely comfortable, and they're extremely flattering to many body types," said fashion historian Valerie Steele, director and chief curator of the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology. References to caftans appear in Persian art and literature as early as 600 B.C., and revered Persian poet Ferdowsi mentions them in his seminal work, "Shahnameh," or the Persian "Book of Kings," she said. The word itself is Persian and translates to a battle garment worn by soldiers, said Niloo Paydar, curator of textile and fashion arts at the Indianapolis Museum of Art, which houses one of the country's largest collections of Islamic textiles. When wealthy jet-setters and superstars took off for places like Morocco and India in the 1960s, they brought back Eastern fashion traditions along with spiritualism, Steele said. Depending on what they're made of, caftans can be worn any time of the year, Steele said.
