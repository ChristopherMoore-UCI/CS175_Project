The phrase "war on terror" is misleading and may have done more harm than good as countries around the world fight extremism, British Foreign Secretary David Miliband said Thursday. Miliband said in a speech in Mumbai, India, that the phrase joined nations against a common enemy rather than together with common ideals. "The notion of a war on terror gave the impression of a unified, transnational enemy, embodied in the figure of Osama bin Laden and the organization of al Qaeda," Miliband said. "If we want to promote the politics of consent instead of terror and of democratic opportunity rather than fear and oppression, we must uphold our commitments to human rights and civil liberties both at home and abroad." Use of "war on terror" also implied a fight against a shared single enemy, David Miliband said.
