In a clever invention from screenwriter Eric Roth ("The Good Shepherd" and "Forrest Gump"), Queenie runs a caring home for the elderly, so Master Benjamin fits in reasonably well, though one old lady is disconcerted by his fondness for her granddaughter Daisy. Roth expands it into a rich Louisiana picaresque, ranging far and wide as Benjamin tastes romance in Russia with the wife of an English diplomat (a beguiling Tilda Swinton), comes off second-best in an encounter with a German U-boat, and pursues Daisy, the love of his life, first to New York and then to Paris. Between them, Fincher, star Brad Pitt, all the actors who play Benjamin at various ages, and some triumphant makeup and digital effects teams stitch together a character who is completely believable from first to last -- or last to first, if you prefer. Watch a preview of "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" Â» Benjamin's adoptive mother, a practical-minded African-American woman named Queenie (Taraji P. Henson), accepts the boy's unusual condition with the forbearance of someone accustomed to life's vicissitudes. If Daisy (Cate Blanchett) is a nod in the direction of another beloved Fitzgerald character, Button is more akin to a slightly savvier Gump than to Gatsby, constantly buffeted by time's arrow and his outrageous fortune.
