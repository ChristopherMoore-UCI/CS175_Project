A new study finds that 28% of parents following the CDC-recommended schedule for childhood vaccinations think it would be safer to delay the shots until children are older. The study, published Monday in the journal Pediatrics, confirms that about 2% of parents living in the United States are refusing all vaccines for their children, and more than one in 10 alter the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-recommended vaccination schedule by delaying or refusing certain vaccines. " Parents are refusing certain vaccines at higher rates than others, the study finds. Regarding her research into parents' "malleable" attitudes on vaccines, Dempsey said figuring out what is swaying parents away from the recommended schedule is  important, and something her research cannot yet answer. For example, children under 12 months old and those with certain medical conditions like HIV don't receive the MMR vaccine.
