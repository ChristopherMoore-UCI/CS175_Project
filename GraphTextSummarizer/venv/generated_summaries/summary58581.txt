In the complaint, filed June 23, Stovell says, "I recently have concluded that a comprehensive, sophisticated and well-funded effort might well have been underway for quite some time, perhaps beginning in its present form as early as when defendant LeBron James was in high school, to frustrate identification of his real father, and that there is a likelihood that the father in question is me." -- A Washington lawyer has filed a lawsuit in federal court, claiming he is the father of basketball star LeBron James. " Stovell said he had sex with James' mother, Gloria James, after meeting at a Washington bar while she was visiting from Ohio in 1984. A call to LeBron James' attorney, Frederick Nance of Cleveland, Ohio, was not immediately returned. He stopped short of saying he is certain he is James' father.
