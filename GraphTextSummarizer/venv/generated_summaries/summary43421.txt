The Restore Our Future super PAC is not only run by former Romney political operatives. Contrast that to the $84,500 contributed by Bain employees directly to the Romney campaign. It also is funded in large part by big donors who still work at Romney's former investment firm, Bain Capital. Viveca Novak with the Center for Responsive Politics said Bain's connection to "Restore Our Future" gives Romney a clear advantage in the race. That PAC, run by former White House Deputy Press Secretary Bill Burton, has one spot featuring a now infamous photo of Romney during his days at Bain.
