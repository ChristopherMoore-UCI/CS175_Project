Within seconds after the shooting began, at least one man who was grazed by a bullet grabbed the gunman, a middle-aged woman snatched ammunition away from him, and a group of people held him down while another man grabbed the gun out of his hand, a man and a woman who helped subdue the shooter told CNN Sunday. A third man wrestled the gun out of the shooter's hand, Zamudio said. People are really dying," said Joe Zamudio, one of the people who helped restrain the suspect. " The woman was Patricia Maisch, who said she didn't have time to think about what she was doing. Zamudio had been inside a nearby Walgreens when he heard the shots ring out.
