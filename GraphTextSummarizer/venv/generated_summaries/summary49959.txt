However, even if Ryan doesn't get asked a single question about technology or the Internet, it's still possible to glean some of his positions from his voting record and prior interviews. Technology issues might not be the most pressing topic facing Paul Ryan — Mitt Romney's running mate — as he campaigns for the White House. In fact, given the state of the economy and the other high-level issues facing the country, it's unlikely that Ryan or any of the other national candidates will be asked substantial questions about technology policy in the coming months. That group began "Operation Pull Ryan," a grassroots effort to support Ryan's opponent in an upcoming Congressional race. Last year, Ryan voted for a House resolution disapproving of FCC regulations mandating that any traffic management on the part of ISPs be "reasonable" — a step towards net neutrality.
