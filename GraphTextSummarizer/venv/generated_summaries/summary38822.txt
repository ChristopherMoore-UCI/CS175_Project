"My husband and I are getting a divorce," said Odalys Fragoso, who bought the house with her husband Jose Fragoso in 2001. Just in time for Halloween, the owners of the home made famous in the spooky 1970s film "The Amityville Horror" are dramatically slashing the asking price on their Toms River, New Jersey, colonial, which was used for exteriors in the film. Odalys Fragoso, 51, who is in the middle of divorce proceedings after 33 years of marriage, said the house was appraised this summer for $1.1 million, but the judge told her and her husband they had to lower the price. Originally listed last year at $1.45 million, the four-bedroom, three-bath home is now going for $955,000 -- a bargain, according to the agent. Last year it dropped from $1.45 million to $1.35 million before the house was taken off the market in October.
