As well as using wind turbines to provide electricity, and straw-burning plants to provide heating, some islanders have solar panels on their roofs and others warm their homes using geothermal energy and the heat given off by fresh cow's milk. -- Wind power provides a fifth of Denmark's electricity, most of it generated by giant wind farms built on land and in the country's coastal waters. There is an expectation that prices will come down as turbines become cheaper and bigger companies throw their buying power into developing wind farms. That's a drop in the ocean, but as a clean and renewable source of energy, wind power is receiving support from governments around the world. But the tiny Danish island of Samso is proving bigger isn't necessarily better by generating all its electricity using wind turbines of its own.
