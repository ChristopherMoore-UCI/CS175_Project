The Klan chapter wanted to clean a stretch of Georgia State Route 515 in Union County, Georgia, according to paperwork obtained by CNN. Citing safety concerns and the organization's history, Georgia transportation officials said Tuesday they would not allow a local chapter of the Ku Klux Klan to "adopt" a one-mile stretch of highway in North Georgia. The Southern Poverty Law Center, which monitors hate groups, lists the KKK as "the most infamous -- and oldest -- of American hate groups. " "Over the years since it was formed in December 1865, the Klan has typically seen itself as a Christian organization, although in modern times Klan groups are motivated by a variety of theological and political ideologies," the law center's website says. Georgia has been participating in the Adopt-A-Highway program for more than 20 years.
