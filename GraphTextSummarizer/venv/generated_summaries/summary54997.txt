In 2003, Sustainable South Bronx started an urban green-collar training scheme. Carter has now handed the day-to-day management of Sustainable South Bronx to her colleagues, allowing her to spread her messages of environmental justice and regeneration through green industry to others. The 11-mile-long stretch is the first new South Bronx waterfront park in over 60 years and provides alternative transport, recreational space, jobs and environmental enhancements to the local community. Landlords were burning their buildings to collect the insurance; light manufacturing industries were moving out of the Bronx; and waste facilities were moving in to take their place. -- "If power plants, waste handling, chemical plants and transport systems were located in wealthy areas as quickly and easily as in poor areas, we would have had a clean, green economy decades ago."
