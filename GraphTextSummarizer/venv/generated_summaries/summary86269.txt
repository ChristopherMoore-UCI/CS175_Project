WikiLeaks tweet Assange has repeatedly said that stopping him would not stop WikiLeaks. He and the anonymous, globally scattered WikiLeaks staff have warned since July's release of Afghanistan War documents that they are not to be messed with. Whatever you call the file Julian Assange has threatened to release if he's imprisoned or dies or WikiLeaks is destroyed, it's impossible to stop. It's not the first time Assange, the face and founder of WikiLeaks, has asked someone to dare him. Ben Laurie, a London-based computer security expert who has reportedly advised WikiLeaks in the past, said Assange is nothing if not exacting.
