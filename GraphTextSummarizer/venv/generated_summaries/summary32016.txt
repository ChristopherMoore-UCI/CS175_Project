Hernandez Castillo was writing "Este gobierno de criminales," or "this government of criminals," Mexico City district attorney Miguel Angel Mancera said. The shooting at the Balderas station in central Mexico City happened after police stopped Luis Felipe Hernandez Castillo, 38, from writing graffiti on the wall of one of the subway platforms. Hernandez Castillo also told investigators that he believed a great famine would come, and he traveled to Mexico City to relay a message, Mancera said. As police tried to stop him, Hernandez Castillo drew a .38 special handgun and began firing. Mancera said his first impression of Hernandez Castillo is that he may suffer from mental illness.
