"To our mind, since the middle of the 19th century Royal Ascot has always been the pinnacle of the whole season," explains Charles Barnett, chief executive of Ascot Racecourse. As well as being one of the most important elite race meetings in the world, this week's Royal Ascot is the jewel in the crown of the English "summer season" -- a whirl of society events in the warmest months of the year that includes the likes of rowing's Henley Royal Regatta and the Wimbledon Tennis Championships. Ascot occupies a distinctive place in British popular culture: it's no coincidence that Audrey Hepburn's character in the film "My Fair Lady" was unveiled as a fully paid-up member of the upper classes at Royal Ascot. But few sporting venues can match the rich history and heritage of Britain's Royal Ascot. But it is with Royal Ascot, a perennial favorite of the current Queen Elizabeth II, that the season seems properly to get underway each year.
