NoÃ«l Wells and John Milhiser, both featured players last season, and cast member Brooks Wheelan were dismissed from the sketch series earlier this summer, while five-season veteran Nasim Pedrad departed to co-star on the new Fox series "Mulaney" (executive-produced by longtime "SNL" boss, Lorne Michaels). But the show's biggest shake-up is a permanent one: Season 40 will be the first in decades without the booming voice of announcer Don Pardo, who died last month at age 96. An unconfirmed Deadline report also speculated that featured player and former writer Michael Patrick O'Brien could shift back to the writing staff or join Colin Jost for a co-hosting stint on "Weekend Update." Ariana Grande, following the chart-topping success of her second album, "My Everything," will serve as musical guest, while Chris Pratt, star of the blockbuster superhero flick "Guardians of the Galaxy," will host the premiere episode, which airs on September 27. "Saturday Night Live" is recruiting some breakout star power for its 40th season debut.
