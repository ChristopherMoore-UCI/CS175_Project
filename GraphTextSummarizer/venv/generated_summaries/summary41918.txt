Yet, as much as one might disagree with a particular corporate action, the honest choice demands either engaging in civil protest and accepting the consequences, or staging a symbolic protest (such as culture jamming, parody, or satire) that is clearly identifiable as an act of protest. Is Greenpeace's prank on Shell oil a 'scam'? But the line between legitimate protest through culture jamming and libelous misrepresentation or trademark infringement is muddy. It included a function where viewers could caption pictures said to be taken by Shell Oil in the north (a dangerous feature for Shell -- just imagine the captions people would generate under a picture of a baby Arctic fox on an oil company website). I doubt that such a verdict will impede people from using social media as a medium of protest.
