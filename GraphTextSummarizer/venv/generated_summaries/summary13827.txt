Cody Wilcoxson was armed with an AK-47 gun when he was detained at the Missouri University of Science and Technology in Rolla, said Rolla Police Chief Mark Kearse. He said Wilcoxson tried to get onto Fort Leonard Wood, a U.S. Army base more than 25 miles west of Rolla. But afterward, the police chief said, he fired dozens of rounds of bullets from his assault rifle in a shootout with police. -- A man suspected of firing an assault rifle in a shootout with authorities, which happened shortly after he tried to force his way onto a Missouri military base, was arrested Thursday on a college campus, police said. That wasn't the case earlier, according to Kearse.
