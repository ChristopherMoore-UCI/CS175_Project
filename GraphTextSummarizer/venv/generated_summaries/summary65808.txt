Medical Examiner Sam Gulino told jurors Monday he had to examine the remains of 47 aborted fetuses, some of which were frozen, as part of the investigation into the charges against Dr. Kermit Gosnell. When authorities searched Gosnell's office, they found bags and bottles holding aborted fetuses scattered throughout the building. In the courtroom of Judge Jeffrey P. Minehart, Assistant District Attorney Edward Cameron questioned Gulino about a series of graphic photos showing several fetuses with severed limbs and "defects" in the back of the neck that resembled holes. A grand jury investigation determined that health and licensing officials had received repeated reports about Gosnell's practices for two decades, but had taken no action, Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams said. Authorities accuse Gosnell, 72, of using scissors to sever the spinal cords of fetuses who emerged from their mothers still alive.
