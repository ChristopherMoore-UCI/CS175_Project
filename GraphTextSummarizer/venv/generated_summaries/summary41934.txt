Lansing Mayor Virg Bernero had issued a statement saying that while he opposes the "oppression of the LGBT community in Russia," he also hopes to maintain the relationship with St. Petersburg, which began in 1994 with a Russian-language high school exchange program. After nearly 20 years of building ties with their "sister city" of St. Petersburg, Russia, leaders in Lansing, Michigan, have found a key sticking point -- Russia's clampdown on discussion of gay issues. The city council in Michigan's capital voiced its concerns over Russian anti-gay policies on Monday by adopting a resolution calling for an end to the "sister cities" relationship with St. Petersburg. Russia has been drawing controversy for a recently enacted law that bars the public discussion of gay rights and relationships anywhere that children could overhear. Lansing Regional Sisters Commission President Barbara Roberts Mason said it was only one district within St. Petersburg that was the sister city for Lansing, and that "ceased abruptly" when the governmental structure of St. Petersburg changed years ago.
