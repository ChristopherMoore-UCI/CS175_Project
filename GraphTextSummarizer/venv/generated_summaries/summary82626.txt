"For Premier League clubs, the increase we've seen this year and one we'll definitely see next year because of the television deal, gives them a real opportunity to challenge even with the new UEFA Financial Fair Play regulations," added Bull, referring to the rules imposed by Europe's governing body to ensure clubs live within their means. According to Deloitte, a 21% growth in commercial income enabled Premier League club revenue to top $4.19 billion for the first time. "Matchday revenue also increased by 6% with fewer unsold seats at Premier League games than ever before. In total, Premier League revenue grew by $276 million, some 7%, with Manchester City, Manchester United and Liverpool responsible for 60% of the growth. "English teams will be generating more revenue than anyone else and while the likes of Barcelona and Real Madrid can negotiate their television rights, the Premier League sides will be very competitive," Bull said.
