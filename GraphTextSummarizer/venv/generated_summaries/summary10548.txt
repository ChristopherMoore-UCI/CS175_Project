(Buffett has objected to Schweizer's critique, pointing out in an interview with the Omaha World Herald that TARP was passed after his investment in Goldman Sachs and under the Bush administration which he said he didn't support: "Anyone, he said, could have invested in banks or other stock based on statements by Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben Bernanke that the Fed would 'do whatever it takes' to help the ailing financial system.") Earlier this month, an Obama administration foreclosure settlement increased the potential value of Buffett's Bank of America holdings by $154 million in a single day. During the financial crisis in September 2008 and the ensuing wave of bipartisan bailouts, Buffett was routinely treated as an almost impartial voice of wisdom and calm, advocating the Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP), the stimulus, a mortgage-restructuring plan, and increased spending on high speed rail. "All told," Schweizer wrote, "TARP-assisted companies constituted a whopping 30% of Buffett's publicly disclosed stock portfolio." As of July 2009, Buffett's investment in Goldman Sachs alone had already netted him $2.5 billion. As Peter Schweizer put it in a recent excerpt from his new book, "Throw Them All Out," Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, beginning that fall, began buying up large chunks of Goldman Sachs and General Electric on extraordinarily favorable terms, in addition to its growing stakes in Wells Fargo, Bank of America, American Express, M&T Bank, and the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway. Which suggests an ultimate test for raising the federal tax burden in a way pleasing to Warren Buffett, Barack Obama, and most of the fourth estate: Are we currently getting our $3.8 trillion worth of services?
