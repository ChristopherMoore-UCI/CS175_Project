Experts say a number of reasons may have contributed to the apparent increase in hornet activity, including the region's recent hot, dry weather, land development and hornet sensitivity to the smell of people. A total of 583 people in the area have been stung by hornets since July 1, say city officials. Chen Changlin was hospitalized after being attacked by hornets, while harvesting rice last week. This week's latest incidents spurred the Ankang city government to hold an emergency video call addressing local concerns. At least 19 people have been stung to death by hornets -- which may include the world's largest hornet species Vespa mandarinia -- in China's central Shaanxi province in the last three months, according to the city government of Ankang, the apparent epicenter of a recent spate of fatalities and injuries.
