The day has passed when the GOP can win the presidency by focusing on white Americans. The GOP has been unwilling to get its hands dirty and do the hard work when it comes to minority voters. Because every time top GOP officials open their mouths, all they seem to do is insult the very people they need to vote for them. It's about listening to what Americans desire and seeing where there is agreement, whether it's education, the environment, entrepreneurship, sentencing reform, immigration or a host of other issues. But I can guarantee the GOP one thing: If it ignores minority constituents and dismisses them, it will get destroyed at the ballot box.
