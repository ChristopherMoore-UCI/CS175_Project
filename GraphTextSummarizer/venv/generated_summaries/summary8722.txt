As for China, it is the world's biggest market for low-end mobile phones, but the government blocks many of the Google services -- like Gmail and Google Search -- that Motorola says will make Moto G the new smart phone of choice. -- Motorola unveiled its new relatively low-cost smart phone on Wednesday, aimed at consumers in emerging markets and those on a tight budget everywhere. But the one country noticeably missing from the rollout of Moto G was China, thanks to the unfriendly relations with Motorola's parent company Google. Many of those people are in emerging markets, like Brazil, the world's sixth largest economy with a rising middle class and a major smart phone market. In the U.S., Moto G is being targeted at the pre-paid market, especially students and children.
