Defense attorney William J. Brennan, no relation, also represents Rev. Brennan. At Thursday's preliminary hearing, Philadelphia Municipal Court Judge Karen Yvette Simmons dismissed felony involuntary deviate sexual intercourse and sexual assault charges against Andrew McCormick, 56. McCormick's arrest in July came in the wake of the landmark priest sexual abuse trial in Philadelphia, the result of a 2011 grand jury report that led to criminal charges against three Philadelphia priests and a parochial school teacher for allegedly raping and assaulting boys in their care, and charges against Monsignor William Lynn who was accused of allowing the priests to have access to children. "It was a huge win today," said defense attorney William J. Brennan. Defrocked priest Edward Avery was due to also go on trial with Brennan and Lynn, but pleaded guilty in March to involuntary sexual deviate sexual intercourse after admitting to sexually assaulting the 10-year-old altar boy during the 1998-1999 school year.
