With SI rookie Lawley and other larger-than-size 2 models busting out all over, refusing to let beauty be defined by the skinny few, could it the year of the plus-size model? Swimsuits for All, the size-inclusive swimsuit company that collaborated with Lawley last year, has an advertisement featuring plus-size model Ashley Graham in this year's swimsuit issue. She got more press for effyourbeautystandards, an Instagram account she started in 2013 for women to celebrate their bodies and unique looks. Plus-size model Robyn Lawley teamed up with Swimsuits for All last year to recreate the 2014 cover with bigger models. "Tastes and body types change over time and curves have never been more 'in'." Add to the list plus-size model Tess Holliday, who was recently signed to London-based MiLK Model Management.
