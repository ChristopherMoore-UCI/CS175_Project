Early mixes from the Queen of Pop's 13th album had been leaked, and longtime manager Guy Oseary asked the public to help find those responsible. The singer didn't plan on releasing her new album "Rebel Heart" anytime soon, but that all changed after unfinished versions of her newest songs found their way on the Internet. Thank you for waiting and if you have heard please know they are unfinished demos stolen long ago and not ready to be presented to the world," she wrote in her post. Earlier this month, the singer posted a photo of her smashed iPod on Instagram after discovering the leak of her track "Rebel Heart." The tracks available immediately for download include "Living for Love," an upbeat anthem, "Devil Pray," a haunting composition, "Ghosttown," an emotional mantra, "Illuminati," an electronic orchestra of melodies, as well as two other songs. In 2003, the singer's website was defaced and every song off her "American Life" album was leaked online.
