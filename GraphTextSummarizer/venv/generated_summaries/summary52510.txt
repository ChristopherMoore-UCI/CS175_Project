If we do not pursue responsible development in the Arctic, countries such as Russia -- perhaps even China, which is interested in securing access to Arctic hydrocarbon resources -- will dominate energy production from the Arctic. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, this region contains more oil than any comparable region located in the Arctic, including northern Russia. This is unfortunate, because we have some of the highest environmental standards in the world and we should be setting the bar for Arctic development. One of the arguments used by Arctic drilling opponents is that "we aren't ready," but it is obvious that no matter what preparations are made, they will argue that it isn't enough. By embracing the opportunities in the Arctic, the United States will show the world that it can be a strong leader in responsible energy development.
