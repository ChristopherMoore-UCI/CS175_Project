Police chief arrested on child pornography charges Ex-teacher accused of child pornography caught in Nicaragua Burglar finds child sex abuse on tapes he took, points out suspect Before taking the job at Mt. Carmel, McGill was the principal at two other schools -- one in the Douglas County system, the other out of state, said county schools spokeswoman Karen Stroud. Georgia authorities have arrested 14 people they accuse of traveling with the intent to have sex with children, including a suburban Atlanta elementary school principal, according to CNN affiliates and school system officials. It continued, "Online child predators visit chat rooms and websites on the Internet, find children, begin conversations with them, introduce sexual content and arrange a meeting with the children for the purpose for having sex." "I was notified (Sunday) that Mt. Carmel Elementary School Principal John McGill was arrested this weekend and is under investigation," said Douglas County School Superintendent Gordon Pritz.
