Two residents were airlifted to a larger regional hospital because of the extent of their injuries, said Brian Sladek, director of Lincoln County emergency management. "This tornado, what we believe is a tornado, moved through, hit the back of houses, jumped over the front of those, then hit the front of the houses homes and hit the front of the houses on the other side of the street," said Kaukauna Police Chief John Manion. Authorities in Lincoln County, in northern Wisconsin, did a door-to-door search after the Sunday night storm. An emergency declaration has been made for the city of Kaukauna, where early estimates were that 157 homes had been either damaged or destroyed Sunday night, the city's police chief said. At least 25 homes suffered severe damage, said Mark Handlin of the Lincoln County Sheriff's Office.
