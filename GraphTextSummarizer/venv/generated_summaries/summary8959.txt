A U.S. Coast Guard helicopter spotted the dock Tuesday along a remote section of the park's coast, the Washington State Marine Debris Task Force said. -- A massive dock, possibly debris from the March 2011 tsunami that struck Japan, has washed ashore in Washington state's Olympic National Park. Authorities were trying to reach the dock by ground Wednesday to determine whether it was tsunami debris and whether it harbors invasive species that could harm the area. Washington Gov. Christine Gregoire thanked the Coast Guard for finding the dock. If the dock is confirmed as tsunami debris, it would be the second to wash ashore in the Pacific Northwest this year.
