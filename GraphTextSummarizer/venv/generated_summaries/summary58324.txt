The Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer is designed to "orbit the moon to gather detailed information about the lunar atmosphere, conditions near the surface and environmental influences on lunar dust," NASA said. -- NASA launched an unmanned rocket to the moon Friday night to study its lunar atmosphere and environment. "A thorough understanding of these characteristics will address long-standing unknowns, and help scientists understand other planetary bodies as well," NASA said. If skies were clear, residents of the Carolinas, northern Maine, West Virginia and Pittsburgh could see it, authorities said. It launched at 11:27 p.m. ET at the Wallops Flight Facility at Wallops Island.
