Nearly three years after the collapse at the San Jose mine in Copiapo, Chile, prosecutors said, there's not enough evidence to file criminal charges. Two outraged miners told CNN Chile late Thursday that they plan to appeal the regional prosecutor's decision. "This was a complicated case, which is why it took us so long to make this determination," regional prosecutor Hector Mella Farias said. "This decision wasn't made on a whim," said attorney Catherine Lathrop. Attorneys for the mine's owners told CNN Chile on Thursday that the prosecutor's decision indicated that natural causes sparked the accident, and the company's owners are not responsible.
