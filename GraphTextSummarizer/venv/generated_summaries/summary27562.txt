Are you interested in seeing more films made by Palestinian directors? -- When the 10th London Palestine Film Festival opens this week, Londoners will have greater access to films made in the Palestinian territories than many people living in the region. Palestinian director Annemarie Jacir's first feature film, "Salt of This Sea," premiered at Cannes Film Festival in 2008. "I think there's a wave coming -- a lot of new filmmakers, a lot of people making documentaries and more experimental films, working together," Jacir told CNN. "We even had the entire Palestinian police force blocking traffic; going out of their way to help us," remembers Jacir.
