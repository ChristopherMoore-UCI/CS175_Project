"Since the videos were created so recently, we feel there's a child in danger right now." Korzak and Redling say investigators routinely identify both technical and visual clues in videos for evidence to identify criminals and to rescue victims. Without the public's help, we may not be able (to find the man) and more importantly stop the ongoing abuse of this victim," said Brian Korzak, a special agent with ICE's Cyber Crimes Center, Child Exploitation Unit. Publication of the man's photo "will greatly increase our chances of locating this individual," said Special Agent Patrick Redling. ICE filed a criminal complaint in the U.S. District Court of Washington on Friday, charging the man in the photos, identified as a "John Doe," of producing, possessing and distributing child pornography. In the United States, investigators with Homeland Security Investigations, the law enforcement arm of ICE, saw a Frito-Lay Rold Gold bag for thin pretzels in the videos.
