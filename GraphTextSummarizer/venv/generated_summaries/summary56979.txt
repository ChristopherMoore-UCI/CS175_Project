Launched back in 1975, "SNL" has been home to some of the most famous and beloved comic talent, including Will Ferrell, Tina Fey, Chris Rock and Jimmy Fallon, to name a few. SNL would not comment on Wheelan's departure, with a representative explaining that the show does not discuss casting changes.
