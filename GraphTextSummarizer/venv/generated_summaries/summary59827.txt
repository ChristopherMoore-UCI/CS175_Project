"Our ministry and our embassy will exert intensive efforts in cooperation with the Lebanese authorities to ensure the liberation of our pilots and their return to Turkey," the ministry said last week. The Turkish Airlines pilots were riding a bus heading from Beirut-Rafic Hariri International Airport to their hotel early August 9 when armed assailants stopped the bus, according to Turkey's foreign ministry. -- Lebanese authorities on Saturday arrested three people in connection with the kidnapping of two Turkish pilots, both of whom remain missing more than a week later. Other airline employees on the bus made it safely to the hotel, Turkey's foreign ministry said. Lebanon's state-run National News Agency reported Saturday that three people had been arrested by the Internal Security Forces Information Branch "in connection" with the kidnapping.
