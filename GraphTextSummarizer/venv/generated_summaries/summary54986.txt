While Brandon has buried his emotions in sexual release, Sissy is the opposite and wears hers on her sleeve, along with scars from a past of cutting and perhaps, suicide attempts. While his portrayal of Carl Jung in the Cronenberg film came alive when he was with Sabina Spielrein (Keira Knightley), Brandon shuts down when he's in sexual situations and the only person who can coax an emotion out of him is Sissy -- and that emotion usually is anger. It's routine self-numbing, and however charming or chatty Brandon may be in public, it's all just a means to an end -- the search for sexual release. Maintaining a tenuous balancing act between his work life and his life as an addict, Brandon is thrown off the rails by a visit from his equally but differently damaged younger sister, Sissy (Carey Mulligan). Brandon (Michael Fassbender) is an upwardly-mobile, thirtysomething New Yorker who just happens to spend every waking moment that he's not otherwise occupied with work, engaged in some sort of sexual activity.
