The IDF news release said that Israel carried out the operation after enduring eight years of rocket attacks from Gaza. "I think Israel should take all responsibility for all the war crimes that it is responsible for during its unjustified war in Gaza, and what they just announced is too little too late," Palestinian spokesman Ghassan Khatib told CNN. Conflict between the testimonies of Palestinian witnesses and military personnel made it "impossible to make a criminal connection" between this incident and an incident described by those Palestinian witnesses in which Israeli soldiers allegedly fired at people waving white flags, the IDF said. It was intended to halt the firing of missiles from Gaza into Israel. More than 1,400 Palestinians died in Israel's incursion, according to officials in Gaza.
