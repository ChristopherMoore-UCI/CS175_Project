What this means is that it's not uncommon for generals with government-controlled salaries around $100,000 a year to spend the twilight of their careers purchasing billions worth of munitions from arms companies who, in turn, offer these same senior officers state-side "consulting" gigs with multimillion-dollar salaries. His reaction was prompted by the trade-show floor -- a sea of displays and kiosks from weapons companies hawking missiles, machine guns, tanks, and bombs like they were next year's luxury sedans. I witnessed representatives from almost every nation spending millions of dollars on heavy munitions. Over the course of a week, more than 12,000 attendees tromped through massive tents housing hundreds of arms manufacturers. SOFEX takes place every two years in Amman, and is largely the brainchild of Jordan's King Abdullah II, who has a penchant for special operations and massive displays of artillery.
