In video recorded by James McCormick, the man behind the skyrocketing sales of ADE 651, police in Niger can be seen using the device searching for explosives by a live minefield. "We will do our utmost to make sure that James McCormick never lives off the proceeds of crime," Heath said. There's no laws of science or physics that could make them work," Detective Inspector Edward Heath told CNN. British police believe that McCormick paid off officials to buy the ADE 651 in bulk. In a training video to potential salesmen in India, McCormick can clearly be heard saying he "worked with explosives" during his time with the British police.
