West Hollywood, California, recently passed a first-in-the-nation ban on the sale of fur within its city limits, effective in 2013. The raccoons, foxes, beavers, chinchillas, minks, rabbits, and yes, sometimes even dogs and cats that are killed for fur are not very different from your beloved dog or cat. West Hollywood City Council member John D'Amico, who spearheaded the ordinance, told me, "We didn't want to be a city that supported the raising of animals to be killed just for fashion. There are obviously cruelty-free alternatives to fur that are very functional and warm the body even more than fur. Unfortunately, fur is still flying off the racks.
