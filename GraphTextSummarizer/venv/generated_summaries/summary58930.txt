Read the poll (pdf) "Republican opposition to Sotomayor's confirmation is a higher level of opposition from the party out of power than any Supreme Court nominee has faced in the past two decades," said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. Critics warn confirmation hearings for Judge Sonia Sotomayor could turn into a partisan battle. "One possible reason why the CNN poll shows less support for Sotomayor than other recent polls is a difference in the question wording," Holland said. The poll suggests a partisan divide, with nearly seven in 10 Democrats supporting Sotomayor's confirmation, Independents split, and nearly two out of three Republicans opposing Senate confirmation. Sotomayor, a New York federal appeals court judge, was nominated by President Obama in May to succeed retiring Supreme Court Justice David Souter.
