That was the message Friday from Jim Allen, one of the 10 American missionaries arrested January 29 in Haiti on child kidnapping charges. Allen, along with the seven other released missionaries, arrived at Miami International Airport late Wednesday night on a U.S. Air Force C-130 cargo plane from the Haitian capital, Port-au-Prince. Allen said he had no indication that there is any truth to the charge that Silsby was hoping to profit from the mission by looking for children she could later place with families for large fees. Allen said the group had been approached by a man at an orphanage who claimed to have a group of children with no parents or access to care. Allen, who lives in Amarillo, Texas, told Oprah Winfrey he had a very "good night of sleep last night."
