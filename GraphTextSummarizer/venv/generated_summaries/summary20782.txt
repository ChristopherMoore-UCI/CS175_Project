Further, he wrote, Stefan found no evidence in or around Storro's vehicle of an acid attack, and photographs of Storro's face did not match photos of other recorded acid attacks. Storro has spent about $1,500 of the nearly $28,000 donated to her, CNN affiliate KING reported, citing court documents. Wallis Stefan, the lead investigator in the case, said his initial interviews with Storro uncovered a number of inconsistencies -- including that the chemical burns on her face appeared to have been applied and not splashed. "Storro told me the reason she applied the caustic substance was to first, kill herself," Stefan wrote. " Storro told him she "thought there would be no evidence of me doing it to myself" and that police "would give up on trying to find the person and it would be done." Stefan said Storro acknowledged her Miranda rights and waived them before giving him a 90-minute statement.
