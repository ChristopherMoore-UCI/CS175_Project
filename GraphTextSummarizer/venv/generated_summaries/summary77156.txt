"I became convinced that I had died and no one was telling me" she wrote, invoking memories of the Dearborn, Michigan, cop who called 911 to report that he and his wife may have died after consuming pot brownies. -- She's an acerbic columnist who's made a living lighting up politicians and public figures in the opinion pages of The New York Times, but the only lighting up that Maureen Dowd did for her latest piece was the type typically done by her brethren over at High Times. Her objective was to point out that for all of the revenue, tourism and cases of munchies that have made it an economic windfall for the state, legalizing pot hasn't been without problems -- she quoted health officials who say hospitals are treating "growing numbers of children and adults sickened by potent doses of edible marijuana," and she brought up cases in which overly potent pot candy may have led one man to kill his wife, and another to leap to his death from a hotel balcony. "Maureen Dowd has a Pulitzer but this is what she'll be remembered for on Twitter," @conradhackett tweeted. That's not the case anymore; Dowd's long, strange trip has been retweeted thousands of times.
