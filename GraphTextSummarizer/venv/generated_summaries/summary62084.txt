As the clock ticked toward noon, NASA officials nervously awaited all-clears for technical items and a weather clearance from weather officer Kathy Winters who, time and again, said conditions were "red," meaning a no-go. NASA spokesman George Diller, who was moderating the launch preparations for broadcasters, communicated the frustration as launches were repeatedly called off with just minutes to go. -- NASA launched its Ares I-X rocket Wednesday, after multiple delays over two days because of bad weather. The launch comes at a critical time, when NASA is waiting for President Obama to decide future funding for the agency. An independent committee reviewing the future of space flight recently reported that the U.S. space program appears to be pursuing goals that exceed current funding.
