Syrian Foreign Ministry spokesman Jihad Makdissi said the plane was shot down in Syrian airspace, disputing Turkey's claim that it was downed over international waters after briefly straying into Syrian airspace by mistake. " Both sides say the jet strayed into Syrian airspace, but Turkey says the incursion was accidental and quickly corrected. Even Turkey says Syrian sovereignty was violated. The current issue is that the Turkish plane entered Syrian space and it was responded as an unknown target. "As you know there is a country called Israel there and as you know this Zionism country's planes are very similar and because they both are from the same factory, from the U.S., maybe Syria thought it was an Israeli plane," Syrian Information Minister Omran Al Zubi told the Turkish A Haber channel on Wednesday.
