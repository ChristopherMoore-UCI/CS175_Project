WCVB-TV in Boston identified the driver as Chad LaFrance of Dover, New Hampshire. The tanker overturned and caught fire at a traffic circle in the town of about 37,000 outside Boston. "I rode over the fire and my car caught fire," he told WCVB. "In consideration of everything that firefighters had to deal with, I think it's a miracle that we haven't seen some serious injuries," Everett Fire Chief David Butler said. -- At least 200 people were evacuated from their homes, including 84 residents of an apartment building for the elderly, after a tanker truck carrying 9,000 gallons of gasoline erupted early Wednesday in a northern Boston suburb.
