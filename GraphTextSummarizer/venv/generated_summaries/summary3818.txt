Recycling rockets Traditionally, rockets have been designed to fall back to Earth after separating from the spacecraft they lifted, and then burn up on re-entry or crash into the ocean. Private spaceflight company SpaceX scrubbed a scheduled rocket launch Tuesday, in which it planned to attempt the pioneering step of landing the rocket's first stage on a floating platform. The company has twice attempted soft landings of the Falcon 9's first stage on water. It adds, however, that this is just the first of a number of tests toward the goal of landing a rocket stage for reuse. Engineers called a hold in order to take a closer look," said John Taylor, of SpaceX communications.
