Woman raised as Christian, husband says Ibrahim, 27, was arrested after Muslim relatives accused her of renouncing her religion. His wife, he said, was raised a Christian by her mother, an Ethiopian Orthodox, after her Muslim father deserted the family when Ibrahim was 6. Sudan's foreign ministry denied published reports Saturday that officials were preparing to release Ibrahim at any moment. Wani says if Ibrahim is released early, her life and the lives of his two children could be in grave danger if she has to remain in Sudan. At first, Ibrahim was charged with adultery for marrying a Christian.
