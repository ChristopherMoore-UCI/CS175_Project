Continuing anti-India demonstrations claimed four more lives in India's Kashmir Valley on Saturday, police said. The mainly Muslim Kashmir Valley is part of India's Jammu and Kashmir state but many residents favor independence. The government has imposed strict curfews and deployed extra forces on the streets to keep the calm, senior police officer Shafaqat Ahmad said. They hurled stones at security forces and attempted an attack on a house belonging to a pro-India politician, police said. It is a dispute rooted in the 1947 partitioning of India when Kashmir was divided into two -- a part going to Pakistan and a bigger chunk remaining in India at the the ruling king's request.
