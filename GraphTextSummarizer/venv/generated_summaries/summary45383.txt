Amid a din of whistles and klaxons, and bearing banners emblazoned with "No cuts" and "Austerity is failing," thousands of protesters marched past London's landmarks Saturday in a show of popular anger over government cutbacks. The TUC wants the government to abandon its program of cuts to public services and austerity measures in favor of investment in infrastructure, new industries and training. The Trades Union Congress, a federation that includes most British unions, said ahead of the event, dubbed "A Future That Works," that it expected tens of thousands of union members to turn out in London. Chancellor George Osborne said last month though that the economy was "healing," and that the government's strategy was delivering results "despite strong headwinds. While the demonstration itself was peaceful, groups of masked youths were seen shouting at police and running through the streets in central London on Saturday afternoon.
