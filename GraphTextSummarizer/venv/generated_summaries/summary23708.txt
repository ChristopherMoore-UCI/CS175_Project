During some fires, Short said, "I've made over 100 drops in one day." A firefighting super-chopper is especially valuable now, as California braces for what may be one of the worst wildfire seasons on record. Ã‚ Los Angeles County Fire Department senior pilot Tom Short talks about this helicopter like it's a super chopper. The state's firefighting agency, Cal Fire, has responded to more than 2,500 wildfires in 2014 -- a huge increase in the average number of fires at this point in the year, the agency says. "Having been in all of the aircraft that are out there fighting fires, the Firehawk is the best firefighting machine I've ever seen -- simply because of what it does," Short told CNN on the phone this week. In May, several fires in San Diego County forced thousands of residents from their homes and charred more than 31 square miles.
