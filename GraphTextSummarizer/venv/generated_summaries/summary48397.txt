A public transit bus driver in Dayton, Ohio, was attacked by three teenagers early Monday morning after his bus broke down on the side of the road, police told CNN affiliate WHIO. Rickey Wagoner, 49, was shot three times at point-blank range and stabbed in the arm, but survived because both bullets aimed at his chest were stopped by a New Testament devotional Bible in his front pocket, according to WHIO. During the attack, Wagoner told police, he used an aluminum pen from his pocket to stab one of the teenage boys in the leg, according to WHIO. Wagoner was transported to a hospital and was being treated for a bullet wound to the leg, among other injuries, according to WHIO. Michael Pauley told WHIO.
