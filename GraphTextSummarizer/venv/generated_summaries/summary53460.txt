In a memo from his office to the Montana attorney general's office, attorneys had argued the relevant statute was "misapplied and the minimum sentence that could be imposed in Rambold's case was two years" -- anticipating the judge's Tuesday order. The case drew widespread attention when District Judge G. Todd Baugh imposed the 30-day sentence on Stacey Dean Rambold and made controversial comments about the victim, saying she "seemed older than her chronological age. At a hearing last month, Baugh ruled that Rambold's infractions weren't serious enough. Case details The case began in 2008 when Cherice was a student at Billings Senior High School and Rambold, then 49, was a teacher. This meant that all charges against Rambold would be dismissed if he completed a sex-offender treatment program and met other requirements.
