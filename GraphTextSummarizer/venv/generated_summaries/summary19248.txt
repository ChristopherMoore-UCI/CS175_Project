One Northern League official said "she seems like a great housekeeper," but "not a government minister." Letta, who called the episode "shameful" and "intolerable," made an appeal to Northern League leader Roberto Maroni to "close this chapter right away." If he doesn't, "we will enter a logic of complete confrontation which I don't believe he needs, no one needs it," Letta said. He also is quoted as saying that Kyenge's success has encouraged illegal immigration to Italy and that she should be a minister "in her own country." Kyenge moved to Italy in the 1980s to study medicine. It is the latest in a string of racial slurs and insults directed at Kyenge, a Congolese-born member of the Democratic Party. A local politician recently said on Facebook that Kyenge should be raped so she can understand the pain felt by victims of crime, which some politicians blame on immigrants.
