Los Angeles County authorities exhumed the remains Wednesday of a woman whose mysterious disappearance and death in Malibu Canyon have been the subject of a family crusade for justice, the coroner's office said. Last January, after an emotional public appeal, Richardson's mother persuaded Los Angeles County authorities to exhume the remains and involve the FBI crime lab in examining them and Richardson's clothing. Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca has said Richardson's case showed "no indication of a homicide," but he and the coroner's office agreed to the exhumation as a matter of cooperation with her family. The cause of Richardson's death remains undetermined, Winter said Wednesday. "We've been working with family ever since her remains were recovered," Winter said Wednesday.
