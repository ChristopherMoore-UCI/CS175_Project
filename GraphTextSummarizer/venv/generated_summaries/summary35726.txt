Opinion: Sharp spike in death sentences Sub-Saharan Africa, for example, saw a 28% fall in reported cases, and executions recorded in the Middle East and North Africa were down 23% compared to 2013. The state of Washington also imposed a moratorium on executions last year. "In the majority of countries where people were sentenced to death or executed, the death penalty was imposed after proceedings that did not meet international fair trial standards," the report stated. The United States has the dubious distinction of being the only country in the Americas to conduct executions, but the number of convicts put to death here fell slightly, from 39 in 2013 to 35 in 2014. The United Nations Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, last year stressed the need to move toward abolition of capital punishment.
