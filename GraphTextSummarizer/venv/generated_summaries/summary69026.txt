Mishra and his team have held countless meetings with the community to make them understand the difference in water quality and why clean water is worth paying for. Water shortages are a perennial problem in much of India, but this summer the country's newly elected government is facing extra heat over water. In a New Delhi neighborhood, residents line up in the blistering 45 degree Celsius heat (113 Fahrenheit) carrying empty jerry cans and water bottles, waiting for the government water tanker truck to arrive. Some 150 million Indians have no access to clean water, according to government data. There are no laid pipelines in unplanned areas like this, so tanker trucks are their only source of water.
