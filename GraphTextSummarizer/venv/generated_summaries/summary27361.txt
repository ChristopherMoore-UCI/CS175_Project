So far, jihadi groups in Syria have not been sending foreign fighters on attack missions in the West in any sort of systematic way. Al Qaeda excelled at taking foreign fighters who had come to fight with the Taliban and persuading them to undertake attacks in Europe or the United States instead. Ultimately, though, ISIS is unlikely to go all in on global operations the way al Qaeda Central has. For example, the Afghanistan-Pakistan area has a high blowback rate because it is home to the so-called al Qaeda Central, a group whose sole preoccupation is to mount attacks in the West. And it is also important to remember one more thing, namely that although the early signs suggest that the threat from foreign fighters returning is low, the potential for attacks is still there.
