-- At least 20 people were killed Monday when an explosion rocked a bus station in the northeast Nigerian city of Gombe, which has recently come under repeated attacks blamed on Boko Haram insurgents, officials said. "So far, 20 people have been killed in the explosion and another 18 were badly injured," said Mato Yakubu, Gombe state director of the National Orientation Agency (NOA). "(An) investigation is in progress to ascertain (the) cause of the explosion and level of damage to property," Bauchi state police spokesman Haruna Mohammed said. The Islamist militant group has fought an anti-government campaign to institute Sharia, or Islamic law, attacking police, schools, churches and civilians, and bombing government buildings. Later Monday, an explosion tore through a crowded market in the northern Nigerian city of Bauchi, killing 17 people and injuring 42 others, officials said.
