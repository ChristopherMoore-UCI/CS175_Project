-- A submarine found by anti-drug police in Ecuador last week cost $4 million to build and could have hauled 6 to 10 metric tons of cocaine, a top U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration official said Wednesday. "This is the first seizure of a clandestinely constructed fully operational submarine built to facilitate trans-oceanic drug trafficking," the DEA said in a statement last week. The fully functional submarine was built at a drydock at a clandestine complex that housed 50 people, said Jay Bergman, Andean regional director for the DEA. "Traffickers historically employed slow-moving fishing boats, sail boats, pleasure craft go-fasts," Bergman said last week. Authorities found the sub hidden in marshland under triple-canopy jungle, Bergman told CNN's "American Morning" program.
