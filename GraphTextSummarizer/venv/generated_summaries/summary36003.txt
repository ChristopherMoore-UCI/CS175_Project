But in addition to the obvious costs in human lives and the weakening of trust in police and the legal system, the killings must surely be taking a toll on police officers. But unless you believe that it is acceptable for police to kill hundreds every year -- people who still deserve due process even if they are guilty -- there is surely a need to review and revise those protocols. Many will have seen the images of a 12-year-old boy who was shot last month in Cleveland after someone called police saying he was pointing a gun at people. In contrast, not a single one was killed in Britain last year, where police fired their guns a grand total of three times, according to The Economist. Of course, there are situations in which police have no choice but to shoot to kill -- where members of the public or officers themselves are in imminent danger.
