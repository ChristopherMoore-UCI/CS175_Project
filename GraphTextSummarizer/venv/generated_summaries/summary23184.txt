Three more Majors followed in 2000, the U.S. Open, British Open and U.S. PGA, before winning his second Masters in 2001 to become the first player ever to hold all four Majors at the same time, dubbed the 'Tiger Slam'. Woods became a father for the first time in 2007, when Elin gave birth to daughter Sam Alexis but in 2008 recurring problems forced him to undergo a third operation on his left knee. Success followed success through the decade with notable landmarks including breaking Byron Nelson's record for 114 consecutive cuts made on the PGA Tour while also passing the $40m career earnings mark in 2004 -- the year Woods married Swedish model Elin Nordegren.
