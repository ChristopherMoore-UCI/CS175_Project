The idea for Intern Latin America came to British co-founder David Lloyd, 27, after he had a hard time securing an internship for himself while living in Buenos Aires in 2006. The government of Chile recently awarded Intern Latin America a $40,000 grant and office space in Santiago. Bonsor is one of a growing number of international graduates and students looking to Latin America for internship experience to bolster their resumes. The LIV Fund is a new initiative that offers two $500 scholarships per month to international students looking to intern, study or volunteer in Latin America. In Latin America, the growth is mainly due to the fact that it's a region in rapid development and people want to experience that, and develop language skills," says Lloyd.
