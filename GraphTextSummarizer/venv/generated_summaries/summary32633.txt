Davis said Tuesday that for the second time, U.S. helicopter crews have been exposed to elevated, albeit low, levels of radiation during flights near Japan's nuclear reactors. Most of the nine U.S. Navy warships now operating off Japan are involved in helicopter operations. On Sunday, tests detected low levels of radioactivity on 17 U.S. Navy helicopter crew members when they returned to the USS Ronald Reagan after conducting disaster relief missions in Japan, the military said Monday. Officials expect that air crew members will continue to be exposed to increased low levels of radiation, so the Navy is telling helicopter crews to keep their sleeves rolled down and keep cabin windows closed when possible. Out of concern about radiation, those ships, the USS Essex, USS Harpers Ferry and USS Germantown, will now position in the Sea of Japan on the west coast of Honshu, rather than the east coast, to aid in disaster relief.
