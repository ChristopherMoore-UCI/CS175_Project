Nigeria now drinks more Guinness than Ireland -- making it the second-biggest consumer in the world, after Britain, according to Guinness Nigeria. Brewed in Nigeria since 1962, the country's thicker-tasting "Foreign Extra" is not just supporting Shodeinde and his family, but helped Guinness Nigeria defy the global recession with 6 percent annual growth this year, according to the company. The Dunlop and Michelin tire companies have in recent years closed their factories in Nigeria, because of the rising cost of production. But there's no secret to Guinness' Nigeria success, said Chairman Tunde Savage. Yet, Nigeria Guinness is expanding its facilities to increase production.
