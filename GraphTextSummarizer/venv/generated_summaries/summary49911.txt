Power outages in California stretched Thursday from San Clemente in Orange County to the state's border with Mexico, a San Diego County spokesman told CNN. Parts of Mexico's Baja California and Sonora states were also without power, Mexican authorities said. Power began to be restored by late evening Thursday, though officials warned it would take until Friday to completely restore power in portions of San Diego and Orange counties. San Diego Gas & Electric said all of its 1.4 million customers were without power. It's going to take a long time to bring the power," San Diego Mayor Jerry Sanders told reporters.
