I was invited to a State Dinner at the White House in 1979 when President Jimmy Carter hosted Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin after they signed the Israeli-Egyptian Peace Treaty. Which restaurant would you take your loved one to for an anniversary or other special occasion? That's where I have lived for many years, and I feel very much at home there. All of [the attractions] are great and unique, but I especially love the Lincoln Memorial and the Jefferson Memorial. It's really amazing and helps keep a lot of mundane things in perspective.
