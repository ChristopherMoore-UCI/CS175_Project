According to Human Rights Watch, French and African Union peacekeeping forces are deployed in the larger southwestern towns of Boda and Carnot but do not patrol the road between them where these villages lie. , rights group Human Rights Watch said Thursday. "These horrendous killings show that the French and AU peacekeeping deployment is not protecting villages from these deadly attacks," said Lewis Mudge, Africa researcher for Human Rights Watch. France, the former colonial power in the Central African Republic, deployed 1,600 personnel there to support African Union troops in December after a U.N. Security Council vote authorizing military intervention. Witnesses told Human Rights Watch that anti-balaka fighters were behind the two attacks on Muslims in Guen, one on February 1 and the second four days later.
