Now with the death toll rising as Iraq battles extremist fighters who have taken over large swaths of the country and vowed to overthrow the government, more and more children are being brought to Al Noor. It's a question likely asked by many at the Al Noor Children's Center in Baghdad's Sadr City, a Shiite enclave home to more than two million people. The center serves as day care center with a twist, a place where the children can go for food, clothing and education. Al Aboudi started the children's center in 2009 on the outskirts of Sadr City. In a city known for its violence, the center is full of children with tales of a parent lost to a bomb blast or a gunfight.
