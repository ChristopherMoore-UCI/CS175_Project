Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Saturday he sees no change in U.S. policy toward Iran despite the U.S. promise of a "new beginning. Khamenei's comments, which he made in a televised address to mark the start of the Iranian New Year on Friday, come a day after U.S. President Barack Obama reached out to Iran in a videotaped message. Obama said the United States seeks engagement with Iran that is "honest and grounded in mutual respect. " Ahmadinejad said last month that Iran would welcome talks with the United States "in a fair atmosphere with mutual respect. He looked back on the February 25 testing of Iran's first nuclear power plant, at Bushehr, as one of the "joyful developments" of the past year.
