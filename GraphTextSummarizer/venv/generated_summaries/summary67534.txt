The 26-year-old led a sweep of the podium positions for the C4 Citroen team with reigning world champion Sebastien Loeb in second place, 7.9 seconds adrift. It couldn't have been better." Ogier, the junior world rally champion in 2008, has moved into second place in the title standings behind the all-conquering Loeb, who has 126 points after six rounds. 2009 championship runner-up Hirvonen finished fourth in a Ford Focus as he overtook Norway's Petter Solberg, who crashed out in his Citroen C4 in the final SS18 near the finish. "I'm incredibly happy, we had a perfect weekend, with a perfect car from start to finish," Ogier told the official WRC Web site. Loeb pulled back 14 seconds by claiming the first four specials on Sunday, but could make no further impression.
