"One guy rolled metal carts into some of my actors trying to shake us down for thousands of dollars to not play his loud music or hit us with bricks." Bay, 48, is in Hong Kong filming "Transformers: Age of Extinction" starring Mark Wahlberg and Nicola Peltz, which is due in theaters next June. "Yes, some drugged up guys were being belligerent asses to my crew for hours in the morning of our first shoot day in Hong Kong," Bay said in a posting on his website Thursday. She said the men demanded that Bay give them 100,000 Hong Kong dollars, which is about $12,000 in U.S. currency. "It took 15 Hong Kong cops in riot gear to deal with these punks," Bay said. "After that, we had a great day shooting here in Hong Kong," Bay said.
