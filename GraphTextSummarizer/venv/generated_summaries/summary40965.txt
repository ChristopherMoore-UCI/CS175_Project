-- A judge ordered two men to stand trial on charges relating to the beating of San Francisco Giants fan Bryan Stow after a Los Angeles Dodgers game last year. Stow is recovering from a brain injury suffered in the beating, and a website set up by his family stated last week, "As we have said before, Bryan's memory was hugely affected, mainly his short term. Stow, a 42-year-old paramedic from Santa Cruz, California, went into a coma as a result of the March 31, 2011, beating in the parking lot of Dodger Stadium after a game with the Giants. The Los Angeles judge made the ruling in the defendants' preliminary hearing, which began last week. Sanchez is also charged with two misdemeanor counts -- one for battery and the other for assault -- against one person inside the ballpark and another person in the parking lot on the same day, according to court documents provided by prosecutors.
