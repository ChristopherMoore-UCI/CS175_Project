"I'd usually have an appetizer of cured meats, the largest available steak, or a rack of lamb for mains, a side of vegetables sautÃ©ed in butter or oil, rich desserts like molten chocolate lava cake or chocolate ganache and a cheese board with dessert wine to finish," says McLaughlin. Between the two of them, McLaughlin says they would split three bottles of wine with dinner. "Now I tend to drink wine only, and I enjoy and savor the taste instead of just drinking for the sake and experience," McLaughlin says. In 2010, McLaughlin moved from Ireland to New York, after landing a job as software architect for the New York Stock Exchange. McLaughlin had struggled with weight his entire life.
