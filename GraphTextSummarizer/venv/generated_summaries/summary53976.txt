-- As victims of a stabbing attack at Lone Star College near Houston recover physically and psychologically, the suspect in the incident waived his right to a court hearing Thursday, CNN affiliate KHOU said. After his arrest, Quick told police he had had fantasies of stabbing people since he was 8, Harris County Sheriff Adrian Garcia told reporters. According to authorities, Quick attacked people on two floors of the school's health science center Tuesday. The teen book club on campus encourages youths to enroll in the community college after high school graduation, and Quick did. Witness Steven Maida said he and other students chased Quick down and pinned him to the ground until authorities arrived.
