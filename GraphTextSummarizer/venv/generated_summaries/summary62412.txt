The Cold War has passed, and to some younger people from all walks of life, the issue of Cuba is old news. I did get to look at their eyes and freckles and cocoa black skin, the curls and the friendliness and the warmth of family ties, to feel familiarity and truly appreciate my Mom. There is a commonality to their pain: their longing to see and relate country-to-country, family to family. For me, and the thousands of people like me who lost touch with Cuba, this is what Thursday's news is about. I have interviewed people on both sides of that anger -- at the embargo or at Castro, at communism or the limits to any exchange.
