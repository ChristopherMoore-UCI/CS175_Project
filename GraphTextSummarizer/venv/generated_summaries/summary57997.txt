Having seen City lose 3-1 at Southampton on Saturday, Ferguson resisted the temptation to rest key players ahead of the Champions League trip to Spain and was rewarded as veteran Ryan Giggs and top scorer Robin van Persie sealed a crucial win. Alex Ferguson's team moved 12 points clear of rivals Manchester City after Sunday's 2-0 win over Everton -- the side who last season came back from 4-2 down to snatch a draw at Old Trafford and derail United's challenge for a record-extending 20th title. -- After a week remembering one of the most traumatic incidents in the club's past, Manchester United fans can now look forward to one of their biggest days in modern history. Before the match, United fans had unveiled a huge banner commemorating the 55th anniversary of the Munich air disaster, which killed 23 of 44 people onboard including eight United players. Everton dropped to sixth after the weekend's results, losing ground in the race for Champions League qualification.
