-- Authorities in St. Tammany Parish, Louisiana, say they have arrested a suspect and recovered more than $3 million in stolen property in a multistate string of J.C. Penney store burglaries. Police said the suspect admitted to his involvement in five J.C. Penney store burglaries nationwide during questioning. Detectives are working with J.C. Penney officials to coordinate the return of the recovered property, police said. Hector Castillo of Houston, Texas, is under arrest in connection with a string of J.C. Penney burglaries. The rash of thefts began in June, with a break-in at a J.C. Penney store in Indiana.
