We were lucky to have several trained mountaineers among us who gently reminded us of their maxim, "take nothing but picture, leave nothing but footprint, kill nothing but time. We rented a mini-bus that took us at the foot of Jinshanling section, located in the mountainous areas in Luanping County, Hebei province, 125 kms (78 miles) northeast of Beijing. "Appreciating history and escaping the hustle and bustle of the city and the pollution," POP stalwart Owen Tiam tells me. In Beijing and its surroundings, the Great Wall is 629 km (391 miles) long with five sections, including the Badaling, the first one opened to tourists in 1957. I traveled light, with one backpack (spare clothes, boiled eggs, fruit, chocolate bars, and bottled water) and a sling bag (cameras, a whistle, small flashlight, knife, wipes, pen and notebook, and a photocopy of my passport.)
