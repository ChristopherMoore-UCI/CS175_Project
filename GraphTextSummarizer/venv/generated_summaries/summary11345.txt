He acknowledged that the interview was the first time he publicly said Stern injected Smith with drugs. Stern's defense lawyer, Steve Sadow, grilled Brighthaupt for more than an hour Monday morning about his direct testimony in which he said he saw Stern inject Smith with drugs. Brighthaupt said he never saw Smith abusing prescription drugs before her son's death. The defense countered Smith was not an addict under the legal definition because her demand for drugs was fueled by chronic pain, anxiety and depression, especially after her son's death. The doctor kept Smith on a regular eating and sleeping schedule, he said.
