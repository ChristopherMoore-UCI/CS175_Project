Although the Obama administration billed the appearance as an official White House event set to "underscore the important progress America has made since the economic collapse," the Laborfest speech featured a jacket-less Obama who, for most the most part, appeared to be in campaign mode. While Obama focused much of the speech on the midterms, he was noticeably mum on Wisconsin's hotly contested race for governor between Democrat Mary Burke and Republican incumbent Scott Walker. Burke and Obama did not appear on stage together, but the gubernatorial candidate did tweet that she had a "great chat" with Obama backstage and that she looks "fwd to seeing him again b4 11/4." President Barack Obama told a large union audience in Wisconsin on Monday that while "Republicans in Congress love to say no," he is the one who "placed a bet on America's workers." Before Obama's speech, Burke walked around Laborfest and shook hands with supporters and union members.
