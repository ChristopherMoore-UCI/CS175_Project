Fans of the Adam West and Burt Ward program have been waiting years for this moment, as a long-running rights dispute between 20th Century Fox and Time Warner (the latter is CNN's parent company) made it seem like it would never come. For a time, the show had people tuning in the following night -- "same Bat-time, same Bat-channel" -- to see how Batman and Robin got out of their latest jam. Try as she might, Catwoman (played at various times by Julie Newmar, Eartha Kitt and Lee Meriwether) never could seduce Batman into a life of crime. As the pair danced, Batman unleashed some moves of his own, and the Batusi was born (soon to be replicated in "Pulp Fiction"). As Batman went into a nightclub (with the underage Robin waiting outside), he happened upon the Riddler's girlfriend, Molly.
