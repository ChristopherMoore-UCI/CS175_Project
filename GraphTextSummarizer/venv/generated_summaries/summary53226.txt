This was the first reunion of Chicago police officers assigned to the streets during the 1968 Democratic National Convention. Many of the marquee players from the famous Democratic convention -- Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin from the dissenters, the first Mayor Richard Daley from the city, Chet Huntley and David Brinkley from the national media that spread the pictures -- are dead. " Bob Greene says a beer summit wouldn't unite Chicago police veterans and protesters remembering 1968 conflict. "You ask about your buddy -- you say, 'How's so-and-so doing?' " said John Murray, 62, who was 21 during convention week. Thus, half a block to the west of the lodge this summer, protesters were gathering behind police barricades.
