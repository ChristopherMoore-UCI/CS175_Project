-- Japanese raider Orfevre failed in his bid to become the first non-European trained winner of the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe when he was denied by home-grown outsider Solemia at Longchamp Sunday. Outside of the duel for first place, Masterstroke, ridden by French jockey Mikael Barzalona, finished third. The Aiden O'Brien-trained Camelot, ridden by Godolphin jockey Frankie Dettori, never factored and finished down the field in seventh place. Thousands of Japanese fans and more than 100 accredited journalists from the country had descended on Paris to witness arguably their best chance at capturing the Arc since Deep Impact in 2006. After a huge last-to-first move, Orfevre was dramatically run down in the final strides by Solemia to give jockey Olivier Peslier his fourth win in the race, breaking thousands of Japanese hearts in the process.
