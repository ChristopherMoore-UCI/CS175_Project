Lost in this shameful rhetoric is the fact that the right to housing is a bedrock of international law and protected by U.S. law. Homeless people also tend to be the victims of countless hate crimes, even though they are a protected class under numerous state hate crime statutes. Homeless families and single adults are routinely turned away by shelter homes because of lack of bed space. Some courts have held that tearing down camps when no alternative is available amounts to cruel and unusual punishment and a deprivation of property without due process of law. The total number of homeless people residing in tents and makeshift homes is unknown.
