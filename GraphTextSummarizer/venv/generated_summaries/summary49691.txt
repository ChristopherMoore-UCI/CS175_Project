San Diego mayor sued, called unfit for office Filner says he will enter a behavior counseling clinic next month for two weeks of "intensive therapy," but he has repeatedly said he won't step down. Opinion: No room for lecherous mayors The San Diego City Council met earlier Tuesday and unanimously decided to file suit against Filner, saying it is the mayor who should pay the city's legal bills in defending the case. "Bob Filner can't pay back San Diegans for the damage he's done to our city's reputation, but he can and should repay the city if there are any taxpayer costs as a result of this lawsuit," Faulconer said in a statement. Many of the accusations allegedly took place during Filner's five terms in Congress, before he was elected mayor last year. San Diego says it shouldn't be part of the lawsuit in the first place because it had no role in the mayor's behavior and because it has a zero-tolerance policy against sexual harassment.
