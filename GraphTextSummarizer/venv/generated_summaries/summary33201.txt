-- Former porn star Jenna Jameson said she wants to get back with Tito Ortiz four days after things got "tragically out of hand" and he was arrested on a domestic violence charge. Ortiz, 35, was arrested at his Huntington Beach, California, home Monday morning when Jameson's father called police as the couple argued. "Unfortunately, what actually happened has now been dramatically distorted and misinterpreted and remarks that both Tito and I made after the police arrived reflect the state of shock that we were both in," Jameson said Friday. But the couple's reconciliation "is irrelevant" to the prosecution of Ortiz since it is the state of California, not Jameson, who filed the charge against the mixed martial artist, a police spokesman said. Ortiz and his lawyer told reporters later Monday that he was upset because he thought Jameson had relapsed in her rehabilitation from a prescription drug addiction.
