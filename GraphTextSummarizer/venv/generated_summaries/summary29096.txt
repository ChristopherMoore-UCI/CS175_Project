The abduction occurred after the journalists were interviewing a Tuareg rebel near the northern town of Kidal, a local governor said, according to RFI sister network France Info. As part of France's intervention this year to flush out militants in Mali, the French military secured the area around Kidal. -- The bodies of two French journalists, who were killed in Mali, arrived in France Tuesday, Radio France International reported. Both were kidnapped by four men in a Toyota, said Gov. Adama Kamissoko of Kidal. Kidal was one of the strongholds of the Islamic militant Tuareg uprising last year that plunged Mali into chaos after a military-led coup.
