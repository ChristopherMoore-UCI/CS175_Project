Many students were concerned, Brown said, because the school board had warned that if a new budget was not eventually passed, they might have to eliminate athletic programs, other extra-curricular activities and introduce additional administrative cuts, including the elimination of some teacher positions. North Syracuse Central School District Superintendent Dr. Kim Dyce Faucette told CNN she was aware of the situation, but could not comment on disciplinary matters related to specific pupils. He also suggested holding classes outside to save on air conditioning costs. According to Brown, on Thursday he was called into the office and told he would be suspended for three days for harassing the principal, using a mobile phone in class and disrupting the learning environment. While he admits to using his phone in class, Brown said his teacher never addressed it at the time, and he never threatened anyone.
