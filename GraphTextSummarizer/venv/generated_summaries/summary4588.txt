So when the United States slams civilian deaths in Israeli military actions, Israel can in turn point to U.S. military actions -- including wars in Afghanistan and Iraq -- that also have killed civilians. Tensions between U.S. President Barack Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have been strained for years. The United Nations estimates about 70% were civilians, but Israel Defense Forces say about 900 militants were killed, as were 64 Israeli soldiers and three civilians in Israel. In describing its military action publicly, Israeli officials have compared it to U.S. military actions against terrorism. Netanyahu did not deny reports that he told U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and U.S. Ambassador to Israel Dan Shapiro "not to ever second-guess me again" on how to deal with Hamas, which is in charge of the Palestinian government in Gaza.
