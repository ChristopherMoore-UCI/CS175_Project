" Shimon Brand, Hillel director at Oberlin for more than 30 years, noted that these types of incidents were "exceedingly out of the ordinary" but that students have worked together to address the incident. The sighting of the person wearing a white hood and robe was reported early Monday morning and follows a string of recent hate incidents on Oberlin's campus that have ignited shock and confusion among the student body. Oberlin College is a small liberal arts college in Oberlin, Ohio, with almost 3,000 students. "We're looking into it and we're trying to talk to other students to see if we can verify the incident," said Oberlin Police Sgt. In lieu of classes, college administrators asked students, faculty and staff to "gather for a series of discussions of the challenging issues that have faced our community in recent weeks," a statement on Oberlin's website said.
