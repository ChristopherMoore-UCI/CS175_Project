The country's National Assembly President, Pany Yathotou, was on board the Laos air force plane, which was carrying 18 people, according to Lt. Gen. Nipat Thonglek, a Thai defense spokesman. In October, a Laos Airlines propeller plane flight crashed near the Mekong River, killing all 49 on board, after flying through remnants of Typhoon Nari. A regional governor was also on board the plane, which crashed in Xiangkhouang province north of Laos. -- A plane carrying senior government officials from Laos crashed Saturday in a province bordering Vietnam, authorities said. Other high ranking officials were on board, including the Laotian defense minister, who was traveling with his wife, the spokesman said.
