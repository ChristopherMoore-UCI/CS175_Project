The 40-year-old antiquarian bookstore and library in the old city souk of the Serail neighborhood is the life's work of Ibrahim Sarrouj, a Greek Orthodox priest. Since the attack by suspected Muslim extremists, hundreds of people have come out in support of Sarrouj, helping with the clean-up, donating books and  setting up an online crowd-funding effort to refurbish the library. Sarrouj says he has been inundated with telephone calls from all over the world pledging money, and tens of cartons of books are being sent to him from all over Lebanon by publishers, universities and the Lebanese Ministry of Culture. A priest's flock is crowd-funding $35,000 to restore a renowned Lebanese library, which was set on fire a few weeks ago. If they are successful in crowd-funding $35,000, they will spend it modernizing the library's crumbling interior, installing security equipment and buying back rare books.
