Only once before have England lost successive Tests by a margin of more than 200 runs, but following the 381-run loss in Brisbane, it now faces an almighty challenge to avoid humiliation. "It's certainly not impossible," England captain Cook told a press conference following the day's play. -- Alastair Cook might just be the most optimistic man in Australia right now -- for there are few who would back his assertion that the England cricket team faces anything other than "Mission Impossible". One of the most frightening prospects for England is facing Australia's fast-bowler Mitchell Johnson, who has already taken 17 wickets in the first two matches. Captain Cook has struggled for runs at the top of the order while the likes of Kevin Pietersen and Matt Prior have also failed to live up to their billing.
