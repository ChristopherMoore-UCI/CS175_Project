"Everybody's got, sort of, a lump in their stomach about it," zoo director Steve McCusker told CNN affiliate KSAT. In a written statement, Libby Castillo said two Amazon tree boas, two Solomon Island skinks and a Red Mountain Racer also perished. Firefighters faced unusual circumstances at the scene, CNN affiliates reported. -- Scatha, a 15-year-old Komodo dragon, and five other reptiles died Monday after smoke from a fire filled an enclosure at the San Antonio Zoo, a spokeswoman for the zoo said. And there was a 22-foot-long, 350-pound reticulated python named Bernice that had to be carried to safety, said KSAT.
