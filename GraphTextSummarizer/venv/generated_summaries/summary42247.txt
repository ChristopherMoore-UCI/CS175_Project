"We have planned more attacks on Pakistani forces and its installation as it works to please the USA," Ehsan said. The Bacha Khan International Airport was cordoned off after the rocket fire, senior police official Imran Shahid said. Taliban official Ehsanullah Ehsan said their target was in fact the air base. Militants have a strong presence in that region, which borders Afghanistan. Mian Iftikhar Hussain, information minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, said after the attackers fired the rockets they tried but failed to drive an explosives-laden vehicle into the airport.
