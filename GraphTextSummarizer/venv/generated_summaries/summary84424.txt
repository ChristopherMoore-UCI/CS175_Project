Other winners included "The Lego Movie" -- snubbed by the Oscars -- as best animated feature, "Guardians of the Galaxy" for best action movie and J.K. Simmons for best supporting actor. Host Michael Strahan led off the ceremony by doing a little stripping -- he has a part in the "Magic Mike" sequel -- and Judd Apatow, who presented the best director award, brought up Bill Cosby. "Birdman" earned trophies for best acting ensemble and star Michael Keaton, while "Budapest" took home the award for best comedy. Just after Thursday's Oscar nominations, the Critics' Choice Movie Awards moved the discussion forward on awards season Thursday night -- and the leader continues to be "Boyhood." Apatow, who was apparently a late addition to the presenters' lineup, has been a noted Cosby critic.
