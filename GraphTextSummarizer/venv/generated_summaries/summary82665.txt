iReport.com: Chris Brown fans: Share your reaction If the reconciliation is real, Rihanna is also setting a dangerous example for other abused women. Pop star Chris Brown has been charged with two felonies -- including assault -- in the Rihanna beating case. If she is going back to Chris Brown so soon, Rihanna is putting herself at risk and seems to be falling into the brutal cycle of powerlessness, fear and low self esteem that often accompanies abusive relationships. A Los Angeles County affidavit says Brown gave Rihanna a vicious and continuous beating. The report goes on to say that in between barrages of punches, Brown placed Rihanna in a headlock and bit her ear -- still driving, mind you.
