" Kovalcik goes on to say that her identical twin sister also wears hearing aids, and wishes Coleman luck in the Super Bowl. In the weeks leading up to the Super Bowl, Seattle Seahawks player Derrick Coleman Jr. probably expected an onslaught of encouragement from his fans. In a hand-written letter tweeted to the player, Kovalcik tells Coleman that she, like him, wears hearing aids. The tweet quickly made the rounds on social media, spurring a hand-written response, which Coleman posted on Wednesday. The letter-writer was identified as 9-year-old Riley Kovalcik, who is hearing impaired, according to CNN affiliate KOMO.
