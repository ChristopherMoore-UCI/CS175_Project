The displaced say they have urgent need for baby formula, clean water and gas, said local aid coordinator in Jambur Siabang-abang. The hot ashes and smoke have caused pyroclastic flows -- a fast-moving mass of gas and rocks -- to stretch to seven kilometers down the southeast slope of the 2,600 meter (8,530 foot) mountain in North Sumatra. The local government is still able to cope with the disaster, and no casualties have been reported according to Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's national agency for disaster management. -- A volcanic eruption in Indonesia that has displaced more than 22,000 people is intensifying, local authorities say. Last week, flows reached three kilometers.
