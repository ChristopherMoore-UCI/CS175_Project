They were Polish towns, Rowne and Lwow, in 1939 before Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union invaded Poland and changed the map. My parent's hometowns are part of Ukraine now, and the people who live there deserve the peace, prosperity and freedom that Poland and other countries achieved after breaking from the Kremlin's orbit. Last summer, I visited Rivne and Lviv, Ukraine, hometowns of my mother and father. I took pictures of the stadium and noticed that off to one side, was an old kiln made out of aged red bricks, bricks from my father's house, just as the old man had said. -- Poland has been firmly in Ukraine's corner in recent years, which is quite a shift given that the two nations were historically rivals.
