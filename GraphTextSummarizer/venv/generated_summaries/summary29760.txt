Over the following months, Lajeunesse raised $38,000 with students at Princeton to build the pipeline that would bring clean water to La Source. We wanted to see for ourselves what Lajeunesse had accomplished -- what had become the subject of a documentary named "La Source." Now that he's brought water to La Source, he is working with a local charity to build a school in the village. As a young boy growing up in La Source, Lajeunesse and his brother Chrismedonne would make the treacherous three-hour climb up and down the side of a mountain to reach a spring. "The government cannot do everything," Lajeunesse says emphatically as we walk through La Source, dodging the rain under the canopy of trees.
