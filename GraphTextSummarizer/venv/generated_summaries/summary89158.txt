"It's not common, but it's not unheard of," said pilot Mark Weiss, a 20-year veteran of commercial aviation who has frequently flown Boeing 737-700s, the same kind of aircraft that touched down Sunday at a small airport in Taney County, Missouri, about seven miles from where it was supposed to land at Branson Airport. Apology following landing announcement Passenger Schieffer told CNN the flight had been late in departing Chicago's Midway International Airport on Sunday afternoon, but nothing seemed amiss. The plane stopped about 500 feet from the end of a runway at M. Graham Clark Downtown Airport, but no one was injured, said Chris Berndt, the Western Taney County Fire District fire chief and emergency management director. "Who knows what would have happened?" The airport's runway is 3,738 feet long, about half the length of the Branson Airport runway, which is 7,140 feet. He then repeatedly apologized to passengers who were stuck on the tarmac for two hours while steps could be brought over from Branson Airport to help them deplane.
