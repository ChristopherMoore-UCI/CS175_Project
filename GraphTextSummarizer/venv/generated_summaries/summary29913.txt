Sharma has teamed up with Indian business tycoon Anand Mahindra to launch India's first pro kabaddi league, based along the lines of Indian cricket's successful Indian Premier League (IPL). In urban India, it lost out to other sports like cricket and to a lesser extent, football, which are televised and so very easy to watch. "Everybody thinks of kabaddi as a very rural, basic, aggressive sport, you play on the grass or in the mud, but when you see international kabaddi today, its exhilarating," says Bachchan. If you grew up in India, chances are you played kabaddi as a child. In another huge boost for kabaddi, major broadcaster Star Sports decided to screen these matches live every night on prime time television.
