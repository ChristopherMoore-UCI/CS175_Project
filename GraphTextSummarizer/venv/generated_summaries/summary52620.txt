Brazil's president Dilma Rousseff has launched a R$133bn ($65.6bn) stimulus package to spur investment in the country's creaking infrastructure and shore up ailing investor confidence in the world's second-largest emerging market economy. Bret Rosen, senior credit strategist for Latin America at Standard Chartered, said the move was a step in the right direction, with infrastructure bottlenecks posing one of the biggest obstacles to faster growth in Brazil. But he added: "The easy thing is making the announcements, the harder thing is execution, and the track record not just of Brazil but of Latin American countries in general is pretty poor on infrastructure." Brazil's economy has slowed to a crawl over the past 12 months as inadequate infrastructure including roads and ports and a shortage of skilled labour has raised costs and stifled industry. "This is a plus for the long-term but it doesn't improve the growth prospects in the short-term," said David Beker, Brazil economist with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
