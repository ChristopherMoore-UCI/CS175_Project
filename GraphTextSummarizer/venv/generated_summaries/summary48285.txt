"Turkey has outperformed Europe in the last two years, consecutively growing around 9%," Guler Sabanci, Sabanci Group chair, told CNN. Sabanci, who helms one of Turkey's largest companies, warns Europe's slowdown is "an important issue" for the country, and will create headwinds in the months ahead. -- Turkey's Istanbul, the city where east meets west, is seen as a potentially pivotal center for relations between Europe and Asia. But Sabanci expects Turkey to continue its pitch for European Union membership, noting the country is already "economically integrated" with the region. Nearly half of Turkey's exports head to the eurozone, while around 75% of the country's foreign investment is injected by Europe.
