Before this meeting, a professional interventionist typically meets with family members or friends of the addict to get a history of what's happened, said Dr. Marvin Seppala, chief medical officer at Hazelden Foundation. " Legal action In most states treatment for addiction cannot be forced by family members or friends, Seppala said. " A more formal, direct intervention involves family members confronting the person and encouraging the addict to seek help. But sometimes the very threat of police intervention is enough to prompt an addict to consent to treatment, Seppala said. Dr. Bankole Johnson, chairman of psychiatric medicine at the University of Virginia, said this confrontational approach leaves the addict somewhat humiliated and may reduce the benefits of rehab treatment for the person.
