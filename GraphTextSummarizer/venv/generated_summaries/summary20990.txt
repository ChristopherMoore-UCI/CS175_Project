The investigation is being led by Secret Service Director Mark Sullivan, who has been briefing members of Congress. U.S. government sources have said there was a dispute between at least one Secret Service member and a woman demanding payment. Military law also bars service members from patronizing prostitutes, displaying conduct unbecoming an officer or, for enlisted personnel, conduct "prejudicial to good order and discipline." Some of the agents and military personnel maintain they didn't know the women were prostitutes, the official told CNN. A military official who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the ongoing investigation told CNN that two of those being questioned are Marines who handle military working dogs.
