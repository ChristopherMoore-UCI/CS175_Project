"We are paraben free, we are talc free and we are free of those things because we feel that you should not have to sacrifice your health for beauty," said Kim Roxie, creative director of LAMIK Beauty. The company had previously pledged to remove such ingredients in baby products by the end of 2012. "There's lead acetate in hair dyes, lead in lipsticks, formaldehyde and 1, 4-dioxane in baby shampoos and other shampoos," said Lisa Archer, co-founder and former director of the Campaign for Safe Cosmetics and current director for the environmental group Friends of the Earth. Archer said she hopes other multinational companies follow Johnson & Johnson's lead by removing the potentially toxic chemicals from their products, but she also advises consumers to continue to do their homework. Evans has since discovered natural and organic skin care products such as LAMIK Beauty.
