Since then, space shuttle crews have fixed satellites, performed scientific studies, and ferried materials and people to International Space Station Alpha, a football field-sized construction project in orbit. -- Floating 245 miles over the Earth Tuesday, NASA engineers Michael Fossum and Ronald Garan tethered themselves to the International Space Station and paused to absorb the view. Atlantis lifted off Friday on NASA's final space shuttle mission. But NASA said Mission Control verified that the debris will pass a safe distance from the station and shuttle. The excursion was Fossum's seventh spacewalk and Garan's fourth, according to a NASA statement.
