-- A British woman has been found dead in a hotel room, days after being confronted by a television reporter who accused her of online attacks on the family of missing girl Madeleine McCann. " Scotland Yard confirmed that its officers were looking into allegations of malicious communications with the McCann family, having received a letter and other documentation on September 9. On Thursday, Britain's Sky News reported that London's Metropolitan Police Service -- also known as Scotland Yard -- had launched an investigation into alleged online abuse of the McCanns. "Nobody has been interviewed by MPS officers in relation to this matter." Kate and Gerry McCann left Madeleine and her younger twin siblings asleep in the apartment on May 3, 2007, while they went for dinner with friends at a tapas restaurant nearby. Scotland Yard reopened its investigation into Madeleine's disappearance in July 2013 after a two-year review of the original probe.
