"The United States is convinced that credible elections are key to resolving Cote d'Ivoire's decade-long crisis and are central to political reconciliation and creating conditions that will result in good governance and economic development," the U.S. Embassy in Abidjan said in a statement. The election pits incumbent Laurent Gbagbo against 13 challengers, including opposition leaders Henri Bedie and Alassane Ouattara. U.S. President Barack Obama said the nation's citizens are entitled to a fair election. Ouattara, a former economist for the International Monetary Fund, was banned from previous races. The Ivory Coast was once one of Africa's success stories, but a 2002 civil war plunged the nation into political instability.
