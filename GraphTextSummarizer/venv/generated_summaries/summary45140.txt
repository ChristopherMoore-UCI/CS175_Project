The student was charged last October with kidnapping, sexual assault and murder in the death of Ridgeway, whose body parts were found in a park in a Denver suburb. -- Austin Reed Sigg must face trial on 18 of 20 counts related to the slaying of 10-year-old Jessica Ridgeway and an attack on a jogger last year, a spokesman for Colorado's courts said Friday. Police found parts of her body at a park five miles away five days after the bespectacled blonde girl disappeared while walking to Witt Elementary School on October 5. Rob McCallum made the announcement after the 18-year-old Sigg appeared before Jefferson County Judge Stephen Munsinger in a preliminary hearing. Sigg, a student at Arapahoe Community College, also was charged with attempting to kidnap, sexually assault and kill a female jogger last May. Sigg, who lived about one mile from Ridgeway's home in Westminster, was 17 at the time of the killing; he is charged as an adult.
