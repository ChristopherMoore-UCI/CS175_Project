CNN followed Jones on a recent visit to Lansing, Michigan, where he told attendees at a green-jobs conference that saving the planet and saving jobs can go hand in hand. "We want to bring green jobs to people who don't have hope," says Van Jones, the president's "green jobs" chief. My job is to make sure that the president's desire that we have literally millions of green jobs in our country actually turns into reality," said Jones. In describing his turn from social activist to environmentalist, Jones recounted his experiences with young people in Oakland, California. Now, he is the president's pitchman for green jobs, helping to coordinate government agencies focused on delivering millions of green jobs to the ailing U.S. economy.
