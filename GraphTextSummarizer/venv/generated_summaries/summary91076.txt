Soon, users will have the option to stop personalized advertisements, ads tailored to your Web-surfing habits that have sparked significant privacy concerns. Many consumer advocacy groups and government officials have pushed for the latter feature, which would mean behavioral advertising would no longer come default -- users would have to opt-in in order to see personalized ads. For the tool to work, ad tracking companies essentially must opt-in to the system, and agree not to monitor web-surfing habits of users who have chosen to opt-out. If Mozilla, Google, and other browser companies don't address these concerns soon, they could face legislative mandates, as FTC chair Jon Leibowitz has threatened. With this extension, Google has made these particular cookies permanent; however, users will still be required to opt-out of ad tracking themselves.
