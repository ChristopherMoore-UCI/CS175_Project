The Cessna 210 single-engine plane went down shortly before 6 p.m. in a residential area of Roy, Utah, according to Ogden police dispatcher Brittany Dean. The plane had been cleared for landing at nearby Ogden Airport when it crashed, said Mike Fergus of the Federal Aviation Administration. Roy fire Chief John Ritchie told KSL that the pilot was talking when he was transported to a local hospital, where he was in critical condition Sunday night. -- After his plane ripped into pieces as it crashed Sunday night in a Utah neighborhood, the pilot was found burned and banged up but coherent, according to a witness. The crash knocked out power for 1,700 homes, starting at 5:58 p.m., said Margaret Oler of Rocky Mountain Power.
