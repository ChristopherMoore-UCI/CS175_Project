Ray McDonald was allowed to play in the San Francisco 49ers' Sunday night game against the Chicago Bears, but California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom has asked the team to suspend McDonald after his arrest on domestic violence charges last month. The women tapped to help craft league policy are: • Anna Isaacson, the league's vice president of community affairs and philanthropy; she will now be vice president of social responsibility; • Lisa Friel, former head of the sex crimes prosecution unit in the New York County District Attorney's Office; • Jane Randel, the co-founder of NO MORE, which aims to "raise the profile of and normalize the conversation about domestic violence and sexual assault"; • Rita Smith, the former executive director of the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell will work with four women "on the development and implementation of the league's policies, resources and outreach on issues of domestic violence and sexual assault," according to a memo Goodell sent to the league's teams Monday. With Ray Rice suspended indefinitely for hitting his then-fiancee in an elevator, the league saw three more of its players come under scrutiny over domestic violence or child abuse allegations. Fourteen players have been arrested for violence against women in the last two years, a Sports Illustrated article last week reported.
