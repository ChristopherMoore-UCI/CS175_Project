The Swede, who also collected $1.44 million for winning the Deutsche Bank Championship earlier this month, finished three shots clear of young American hope Jordan Spieth and veteran Steve Stricker. Stenson had given them hope when he dropped a shot at 14, but allayed any fears of another blowout like Saturday as he bounced back immediately with a birdie and finished with pars to complete a memorable wire-to-wire victory. It put the 46-year-old in third place in the FedEx Cup standings, while Spieth was seventh. The 37-year-old went into the final day at East Lake with a four-stroke advantage, having been nine ahead halfway through Saturday's round, but Spieth ate into that as he fired a superb six-under-par 64. Last season's FedEx Cup winner Brandt Snedeker, who has battled bone disease this year, tied for 20th after closing with 68.
