"I can go to the Afghan people and argue for immunity for U.S. troops in Afghanistan in a way that Afghan sovereignty will not be compromised, in a way that Afghan law will not be compromised," he said. On Friday, President Barack Obama and Afghan President Hamid Karzai agreed to speed up the military transition in that country, meaning Afghan forces will take the lead in combat operations nationwide starting this spring. "They will still be fighting alongside Afghan troops. That doesn't mean that coalition forces including U.S. forces are no longer fighting," Obama said. "It will be a historic moment and another step toward full Afghan sovereignty."
