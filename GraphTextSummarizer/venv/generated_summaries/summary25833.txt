In Sunday night's biggest surprise, Beck's downbeat "Morning Phase" nabbed the Grammy for album of the year -- eclipsing darling-of-the-moment Sam Smith, who collected four Grammys, and pop queen Beyonce, whose latest, self-titled album was a critical and commercial smash. "The most complete album of the bunch is 'Morning Phase,' " wrote Bay Area music critic Jim Harrington in making his Grammy predictions before the ceremony, "yet it feels 10 to 15 years too late to hand this trophy to Beck." But all the Grammy love -- "Morning Phase" also won best rock album -- has sparked renewed interest in an artist many may have forgotten. The Grammys often reward strong album sales, and most prognosticators thought Queen B was overdue to claim her first album-of-the-year prize. Kanye West briefly crashed the stage in what appeared to be mock protest but then said Beck "should've given his award to Beyonce."
