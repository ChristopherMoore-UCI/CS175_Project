Coast Guard regulations do not require duck passengers to wear personal flotation devices (PFDs), which puts them in danger of drowning, Mongeluzzi said. Read the NTSB's preliminary report on the accident Citing "an unacceptable level of risk to passenger safety," the NTSB recommended in May 2002 that duck operators and refurbishers "provide reserve buoyancy through passive means," such as installing watertight compartments or buoyant foam in the hull. Eric Christensen, chief of the Office of Vessel Activity at Coast Guard headquarters in Washington, told CNN recently. The preliminary NTSB report on the Philadelphia accident did not indicate whether passengers were wearing PFDs, but eyewitness accounts and images from the scene showed some were and some weren't when they were rescued. Ride the Ducks has suspended its Philadelphia operation since the accident, but company President Chris Herschend said he expected tours to resume soon.
