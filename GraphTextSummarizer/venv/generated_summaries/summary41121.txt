" World's 50 best surf spots Organizers of the big wave event said they will keep waiting until the end of February for "just one day of quality surf" when wave face heights reach around 40 feet. A large storm with hurricane-force winds is spinning far north of the islands, but is sending a giant swell toward the warning areas, according to CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller. Surfing event canceled The massive waves would appear to be a surfer's paradise, but organizers of a big wave surf contest postponed this week's event. The event -- the Quiksilver In Memory of Eddie Aikau big wave invitational -- isn't an annual occurrence. The heavy surf peaked Wednesday night, but waves were still supposed to reach 30 to 40 feet on Thursday.
