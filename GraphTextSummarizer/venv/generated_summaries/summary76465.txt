Tucker received a medical discharge from the Army last year and he now is Officer Chris Tucker of the Savannah-Chatham Metropolitan Police Department. Chris Tucker, who served three tours in Iraq, suffers from hearing, back, foot problems and still has nightmares. Watch former VP Cheney discuss Iraq war strategy Â» "I think we are in too deep to pull out," Tucker said. " There will be no more tours for Tucker, but a colleague on the Savannah-Chatham force will soon deploy for his first Iraq tour, and is being ribbed around the precinct, by Tucker and others, as "the grandpa going off to war. " Tucker is as tired of the Iraq war as anyone, but his experience tells him things can suddenly take a turn for the worse, and so he is skeptical of President Obama's promise to get most combat troops out of Iraq by August 2010.
