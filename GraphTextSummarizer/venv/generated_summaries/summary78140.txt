-- Apple has refreshed its line of MacBook Air notebooks, dropping in more powerful processors and knocking $100 off the price. "With MacBook Air starting at $899, there's no reason to settle for anything less than a Mac," Phil Schiller, Apple's senior vice president of marketing, said in a written statement. Apple says the new processors work with its OS X Mavericks operating system to provide 12 hours of battery life on the 13-inch models and 9 hours on the 11-inch MacBook Airs. The new versions of the computers, which Apple announced Tuesday, contain fourth-generation Intel Core i5 and Core i7 processors. Apple-centric blog 9to5Mac is reporting that Apple is developing a hybrid, 12-inch MacBook Air that would perform like the larger, more powerful model while being almost as portable as the current 11-inch Air.
