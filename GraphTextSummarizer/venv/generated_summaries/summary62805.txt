Judge dismisses sexual assault charges against Philadelphia priest Philadelphia priest abuse trial's impact on Catholic city Two priests barred amid sexual abuse probe Jury acquits man charged with assaulting priest he accused of molesting him They were among dozens of Philadelphia priests accused of sex abuse in the grand jury report. The former altar boy, now in his 20s, testified earlier this year during the landmark trial of two Philadelphia priests charged with child sexual abuse and conspiracy. The Rev. Charles Engelhardt, who was a priest at St. Jerome Parish in northeast Philadelphia, and Bernard Shero, a teacher at the parish's school, have been charged with rape, indecent sexual assault and other criminal charges in the alleged assaults that occurred more than a decade ago. It marked the first time a Catholic church leader -- in this case, Monsignor William Lynn -- has been convicted for covering up the crimes of offending priests.
