-- Ramadan, the holy month of Islam, began Saturday with Iraqis hoping for tranquility but fearful after recent attacks that have shaken the country. " Four Iraqi soldiers and a government worker were killed Saturday in attacks in Baghdad and Mosul, according to an official of the Interior Ministry. Gunmen opened fire earlier in the day on an army checkpoint in the Sunni neighborhood of Adhamiya in northeastern Baghdad, killing two soldiers and wounding one. A roadside bomb also exploded near a car and wounded two people in the Saidiya district of southeastern Baghdad. On Wednesday, more than 100 people were killed and more than 500 were wounded in a series of truck bombings in Baghdad.
