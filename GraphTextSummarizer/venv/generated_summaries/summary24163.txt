"As the investigation progressed, we became aware that these two individuals were extremists in their beliefs and were actively plotting to kidnap and kill at least one southern Nevada police officer," said Lt. Jim Seebock with the department's counterterrorism Section. Following a four-month investigation, police arrested roommates David Allen Brutsche, 42, and Devon Campbell Newman, 67. An undercover police operation stopped a plot by members of an anti-government movement to kidnap and execute police officers, Las Vegas police said Thursday. During a sting operation, police said both Brutsche and Newman espoused the views of the sovereign citizens movement, which the FBI characterizes as "a growing domestic threat to law enforcement" and considers it "a domestic terrorist movement." FBI: 'Sovereign citizens' fraudulently taking over foreclosed homes "Sovereign Citizen is an ideology which in and of itself is fine," Seebock said.
