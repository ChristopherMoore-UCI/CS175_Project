Hezbollah, which is backed by Syria and Iran, is anti-United States and anti-Israel, and the United States has classified the movement as a terrorist organization. Hundreds of people have died after anti-government protests that began out in mid-March, and in recent weeks, Syrians have fled to Lebanon to escape the clashes between protesters and security personnel. Nasrallah said that the ferment across the Middle East and Syria was a "doorway for Israel and the United states" to interfere in Middle Eastern affairs. "A majority of the Syrian people believe in the regime and support Bashar al-Assad," said Hassan Nasrallah, speaking on television in Lebanon. It is a political movement in Lebanon and has a presence in the country's parliament and government.
