Chimp cartoon 'very, very wrong' Just like George Carlin's seven dirty words, there are also no-no's for cartoons, Adams said. "Being that the stimulus bill has been the first legislative victory of President Barack Obama and has become synonymous with him, it is not a reach to wonder: Are they inferring that a monkey wrote the last bill?" "But it has been taken as something else -- as a depiction of President Obama, as a thinly veiled expression of racism," reads the statement. But soon after the issue hit newsstands, the Rev. Al Sharpton, and other black opinion makers such as CNN's Roland Martin, blasted the cartoon as an attack on Obama's skin color and African-Americans in general.
