The group had to get out of the rapidly sinking sailboat so quickly, they could get only four safety vests for five people, safety officer Steve Conway said Monday. While conducting search patterns, Coast Guard members spotted the light through their night vision goggles, Rivera said. "We now know that Roger Stone died a hero in the classic sense of the word." Conway said that as the group huddled in the water, they saw rescue jets go by three times before they were spotted. Steven Guy, a Texas A&M University sailor, said Roger Stone saved him and another sailor by helping them to safety.
