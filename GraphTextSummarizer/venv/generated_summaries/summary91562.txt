Opinion: Fairness needed for U.S. pregnant workers Eman Al Nafjan, a Saudi writer and blogger, told CNN that the electronic monitoring controversy is a complicated issue that has been somewhat misunderstood -- that this is simply the latest iteration of an antiquated guardianship system Saudi women have had to live with for far too long. For Al Nafjan, the electronic monitoring is a serious matter, but one that has overshadowed something far more important: "This (male guardianship) system enables exploitation of women -- it's government-sanctioned exploitation," said Al Nafjan, adding how Saudi laws enable men to exert complete control over their female dependents. " Al-Sharif, for her part, wondered why there aren't e-government services in place in Saudi Arabia to assist women who are in trouble, "to help women go file complaints against their abusers if their actual guardians won't go with them. When word started spreading last week that Saudi women -- already some of the most oppressed and restricted in the world -- were being monitored electronically as they left the country, activists were quick to express their outrage. "It's very shameful," said Manal Al-Sharif, who became an icon of female empowerment in 2011 after defying the conservative kingdom's driving ban and encouraging other Saudi women to do the same.
