"We wanted to come up with a different way of solving that problem other than reconstructing, putting in a sewer system and adding water to our already full sewer system," said Janet Attarian, sustainability coordinator with the Chicago Department of Transportation. That's a big deal, Attarian explained, because the city takes about a billion gallons of water out of Lake Michigan every year. The program aims to stop polluted rainwater in the city's alleyways from ending up in adjacent Lake Michigan. Chicago workers resurface alleys with permeable concrete that cleans rainwater before it runs into Lake Michigan. The cleaner water makes its way into the groundwater, called an aquifer, and then flows into Lake Michigan.
