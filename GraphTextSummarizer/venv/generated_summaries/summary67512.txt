Hours after Hadi fled Sanaa on Saturday, Houthi officials tried to force parliamentarians to meet immediately to accept his resignation, but their efforts failed. Hundreds of thousands of supporters of Yemeni President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi filled the streets of seven Yemeni provinces on Sunday, one day after Hadi escaped house arrest in the capital, Sanaa. Hadi had been under house arrest for a month after he resigned under pressure from Houthi rebels. "Hadi's withdrawal (of his resignation) would save the country and end the Houthi oppression of the Yemeni people," said Mohammed Al-Sabri, senior official of the Nasserite party. Houthis then pressured Hadi to step down last month after he refused to agree to certain political demands.
