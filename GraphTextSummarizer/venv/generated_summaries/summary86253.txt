South African authorities were locked in a three-year court battle to get Dewani extradited from the UK to face trial. Dewani, 34, was accused of hiring hit men to kill her in Cape Town in November 2010. He avoided extradition to South Africa on mental health grounds during a lengthy court battle, but he was eventually sent back in April to face trial. Differences seen in witnesses' accounts Traverso found there was no reasonable chance a court would convict Dewani unless he took the stand and incriminated himself, CNN legal analyst Kelly Phelps said Monday. In a plea deal with South African authorities, he said Dewani paid him to carry out the killing and to make it look as though the couple were the victims of a carjacking.
