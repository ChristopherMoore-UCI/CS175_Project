But the expense of outfitting planes with GPS is dwarfed by the cost to upgrade from radar to satellite tracking of planes. However the new systems would still not enable air traffic control to track planes over remote ocean areas. According to Airbus the capabilities of tracking a black box is down to the airline; satellite tracking of black box recorders is not a standard requirement. When a plane has crashed black box recorders automatically emit a honing signal, located via radar. Michel Roelandt, aviation expert for Eurocontrol, a European air navigation safety organization, told CNN that nearly all modern planes are fitted with GPS navigation systems.
