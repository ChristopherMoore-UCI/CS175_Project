Cosby never once mentioned the accusations of sexual assault that have cast a shadow over his reputation and career in recent months, leading to a string of show cancellations in other cities. Earlier Saturday, Allred held what she called a "teach-in" at the nearby Crawford Hotel, to share the stories of Cosby's accusers and encourage people to speak out against sexual abuse. " "I, myself, am a survivor of sexual assault and I just find it sickening that Bill Cosby has been able to get away with this for so many years,"  Leyba said. The group of demonstrators included attorney Gloria Allred, who represents eight of Cosby accusers, including Beth Ferrier, who is from Denver and has previously shared her story with CNN. Cosby, 77, was greeted with cheers and a standing ovation as he walked on stage wearing a gray sweatsuit with the words "Hello Friend" written on the front.
