-- South Korea said Thursday it will have to consider the North's motivation in calling for unconditional peace talks before agreeing to them. Since then, the North has called for better ties with South Korea, urging dialogue and cooperation this year, and asking the South to end its military exercises. Tensions have been running high between North and South Korea ever since the sinking of the South Korean warship Cheonan last March, killing 46 sailors. In November, North Korea said the South's navy fired into Northern waters and, in retaliation, it shelled Yeonpyeong Island, killing four South Koreans. In response, the South Korean foreign ministry said Thursday that the north should follow up its words with action.
