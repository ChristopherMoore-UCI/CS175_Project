S Voice technology -- Samsung's equivalent of Apple's Siri -- enables users to wake up their phone with a simple voice command. A 4G version will go on sale in North America, Japan and South Korea in the summer. Samsung said the phone will be available in Europe on May 29, followed by launches in Asia, Africa and Latin America.
