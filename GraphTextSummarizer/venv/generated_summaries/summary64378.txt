Special Agent Stephen Ivens appeared to be distraught and may have been suicidal, FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller said, citing interviews with family members and evidence collected by investigators. He wears prescription glasses, police said, and is described as having brown hair with a receding hair line and brown eyes. Investigators and volunteers working for local police, as well as about 50 FBI agents, had searched the rugged Verdugo Mountains after bloodhounds tracked his scent in the area, according to authorities. -- An intensive weekend search of rugged terrain near Los Angeles failed to turn up evidence of a missing FBI agent, but authorities continued searching for the man there and elsewhere, an agency spokeswoman said Monday. Authorities have since scaled back, but have not ended, the mountain search, Eimiller said.
