"The state is withdrawing charges against the accused," Chris Mutangadura, a senior lawyer with Zimbabwe's attorney general, told a Harare magistrate court Wednesday. Three or four times a year since 2000, members have paid their own way to Zimbabwe to give antiretroviral medicine, vitamins, clothing and food baskets to impoverished people with AIDS. The Americans are Dr. Anthony Jones, nurses David Greenberg and Gregory Miller, and Allen Temple Baptist Church AIDS Ministry administrator Gloria Cox-Crowell. Before their arrest, the U.S. health workers had been working in Zimbabwe for almost a decade on HIV/AIDs projects and were  given a farm by the government to operate from in Mutoko, about 200 kilometers east of Harare. Police had accused the American health workers of dispensing AIDS drugs without proper registration and licences, claims they flatly denied.
