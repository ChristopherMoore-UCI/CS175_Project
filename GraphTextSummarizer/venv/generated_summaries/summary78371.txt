It involved a video clip of a televised congressional hearing from 2008 in which a congressman referenced an affidavit from Laura Pettitte about purported steroid use encountered by her husband, former New York Yankees pitcher Andy Pettitte, Clemens and other players. Federal prosecutors accuse Clemens of lying to Congress when lawmakers investigated the illicit use of steroids in professional baseball. Jury selection is expected to begin Monday in the trial of former Major League pitcher Roger Clemens, nine months after the previous one ended in a mistrial. U.S. District Court Judge Reggie Walton ruled in pre-trial proceedings that Laura Pettitte's testimony about steroid use was uncorroborated and inadmissible. The charges stem from Clemens' 2008 testimony before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, during which he denied using anabolic steroids.
