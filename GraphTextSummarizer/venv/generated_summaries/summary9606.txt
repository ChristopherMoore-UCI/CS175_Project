"At no time during recent incidents featured in the media were CDC workers or the public in harm's way," agency spokesman Tom Skinner said. The leak occurred on February 16, when air flowed the wrong way out of a germ lab into a clean-air corridor, rather than through the powerful HEPA filter that cleans the air, congressional sources and CDC officials said. The lab handles small mammals such as rats, ferrets and mice as part of its experiments with pathogens, according to CDC officials. CDC officials say the lab was clean, was not active at the time, and no one got infected. The request came in the wake of a report on internal CDC e-mails about the incident, first reported by USA Today last week.
