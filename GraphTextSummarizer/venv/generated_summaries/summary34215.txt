Further travel headaches are in store for passengers of other airlines at Heathrow and Aberdeen airports next week. The baggage handlers and check-in staff are employed by SAS Ground Services UK Ltd. The strike will affect travelers on Turkish, Emirates and Thai airlines at Heathrow and passengers on KLM, Air France, Wideroe and Atlantic at Aberdeen, Unite said. Unite has been engaged in a bitter dispute with British Airways management. Eurostar, however, said service would not be affected, because drivers from France and Belgium would be used. -- A strike that would have crippled British Airways over Christmas and New Year's Day cannot go ahead, a judge ruled Thursday.
