The hand went without a blood supply for many hours while Xie searched for a hospital that could perform such a surgery. Tang decided the best way to save the hand was to attach it to Xie's calf where there was a good blood supply. Most of all, Xie said, he is thankful to doctors for "living up to their promise" that they would be able to reattach his hand and make it functional again. Xie kept his hand in a plastic bag at first, then stored it in a cooler of ice. The worker, Xie Wei, said he was initially unsure if his right hand could be saved, but he thought it was worth a try.
