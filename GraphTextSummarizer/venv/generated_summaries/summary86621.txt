Some of their targets -- the Assyrians included -- have taken up arms in an attempt to defend their communities, fighting alongside Kurdish militia, which have made some recent gains against ISIS in Syria's northeast. They're on the cusp of taking some inhabited by Assyrians and were clashing Wednesday with ISIS forces around Tal Tamer, the London-based monitoring group reported. The Assyrians were kidnapped early Monday from villages near Tal Tamer in northeastern Syria.

Edward said he feared the hostages would face the same fate as Assyrians targeted in Iraq and the more than 20 members of Egypt's Coptic Christian minority slaughtered by ISIS in Libya last month.
