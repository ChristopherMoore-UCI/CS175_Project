He was pushed all the way by 23-year-old Ostberg, who took the lead on Friday's opening stage and drove without error for his best career result alongside Swedish co-driver Jonas Andersson. Seven-time defending champion Sebastien Loeb finished well off the pace in sixth after suffering delays on Friday. The 30-year-old Hirvonen could afford to avoid mistakes in the final showdown as he took his 13th world rally championship victory after finishing runner-up to Loeb in the 2008 and 2009 title races. Loeb's compatriot Sebastien Ogier claimed victory on the stage, which concluded the competitive action. Hirvonen, who won the corresponding race last season, showed his liking for the only rally of this status held solely on snow, with a commanding victory.
