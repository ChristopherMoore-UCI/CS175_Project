Violence erupted earlier in the day in the city -- also known as Derry to some residents -- when masked youths attacked police vehicles with petrol bombs and a pipe bomb, setting fire to and hijacking a number of vehicles. Police said protesters hurled several dozen petrol bombs early Saturday and a mail van was later hijacked and set on fire as the main parade started. The Troubles pitted mostly Catholic republicans, who want the province to become part of the Republic of Ireland, against pro-British loyalists, who are mostly Protestant. Derry's hard-line Catholic, republican-nationalist groups opposed to the Irish peace process have reacted violently in previous years to these annual Protestant marches, seeing them as provocations. Protestant groups claim they have the right to follow their centuries-old tradition.
