Travis Manion and Lt. Brendan Looney, met a decade ago while attending the United States Naval Academy. The Manion family immediately set to work with Arlington National Cemetery to try to transfer Travis' body. However, Manion-Borek said that after a phone call with Manion's mother Looney chose to stay, telling her he was, "finishing this for Travis." This year, however, "Team Travis" will be dedicated to Lt. Looney. Even through training and deployment, Looney continued to stay close to the Manion family and the foundation.
