The former mayor first met Chavez during the Venezuelan leader's 2006 visit to London and said Chavez's offer of discounted oil for advice was characteristic of a man who saw himself as more than just the president of Venezuela. " Chavez, who died Tuesday, used some of Venezuela's vast oil wealth to bankroll huge social programs for the poor during his 14-year presidency. -- Former London mayor Ken Livingstone paid tribute to his "friend and comrade" Hugo Chavez, calling him the first Venezuelan president to "put his people before the interests of American oil companies. Livingstone, nicknamed "Red Ken" for his socialist leanings, struck a controversial deal in 2007 with Chavez to fuel London's buses with discounted Venezuelan fuel, in exchange for advice on how to develop Venezuela's urban infrastructure. Livingstone dismissed criticism of the deal, saying the advice he and his associates gave Venezuela would have cost "hundreds of millions of pounds" from the private sector, and insisting Chavez only ever had the interests of Venezuelans in mind.
