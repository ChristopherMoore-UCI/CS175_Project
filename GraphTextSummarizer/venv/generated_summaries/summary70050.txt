The "Three Amigos" -- or, as they're more formally known, the leaders of the United States, Canada and Mexico -- announced an agreement Wednesday to work on a plan to streamline trade and travel, including border controls among the countries. White House spokesman Jay Carney insists that differences among Democrats over trade issues date back several administrations. But members of his own party, including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, have voiced firm opposition to such authority. Senior administration officials told reporters last week that Obama remains committed to comprehensive immigration reform that includes a pathway to citizenship for undocumented workers. While in Mexico, Obama faced another delicate balancing act over the issue of immigration reform.
