Police don't yet know why Hawkins chose the mall or the Von Maur department store in particular, Warren said, adding only that the teen "may have frequented the Westroads Mall." The 19-year-old gunman sent at least one text message to his former girlfriend, with whom he broke up about two weeks ago, Omaha Police Chief Thomas Warren said. The incident itself appeared to be premeditated, as Hawkins left a suicide note and other correspondence, Warren said. Another person was still being treated Thursday afternoon, Warren said, but he did not specify whether the individual was a customer or employee. Westroads Mall remained closed Thursday, but the facility, including the Von Maur store, could reopen Friday.
