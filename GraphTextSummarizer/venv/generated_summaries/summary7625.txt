Ebola prompts talk of enhanced screening These common sense steps, while not foolproof, would go far in preventing an outbreak of Ebola and assuring the American people that their leaders are not taking the threat of this disease for granted. These steps include appointing a single, accountable official to coordinate with the many agencies tasked with containing the Ebola epidemic, and moving from passive to active screening at U.S. ports of entry for all passengers traveling from countries with known outbreaks of Ebola. Just as travelers are now asked where they have been, whether they are bringing in fruits or vegetables or have been in contact with livestock, travelers from West Africa would be asked if they were in contact with someone with Ebola, someone displaying symptoms of Ebola, or if they have any symptoms of Ebola. CDC chief: U.S. can stop Ebola in its tracks This particular patient in Dallas apparently did have contact with someone with Ebola and might well have been identified by active screening. This case proves that in today's global society, great distance will not prevent a disease like Ebola from spreading from Africa to the United States.
