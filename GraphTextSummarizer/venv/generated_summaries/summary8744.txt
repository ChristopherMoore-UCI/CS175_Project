-- Singer-actress Pia Zadora landed in jail after she allegedly fought with her teenage son when he wouldn't go to bed early Saturday, police said. Zadora, 61, was charged with domestic violence battery and coercion for allegedly scratching 16-year-old Jordan's ear as she tried to take his cell phone when he dialed 911, according to a Las Vegas Metropolitan Police report. " When police arrived, they were not allowed inside the home, but they realized a police officer -- Jeffries -- lived there, the report said. Zadora became "upset and angry" and "got the hose and started squirting everyone, insisting that Jordan go to bed and Mike Jr. leave." The trouble began around 11 p.m. when his mother said she was tired and she ordered him to bed, the police report said.
