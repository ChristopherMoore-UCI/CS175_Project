Members of Congress using elective office as little more than a gateway job to something more lucrative on Wall Street or K Street. Candidates for Congress could forgo the constant fundraising from wealthy donors and special interest lobbyists, avoid the perception of being in their pockets and focus on representing the interests of their constituents. We need to return to a government that is truly of, by and for the people, not bought and paid for by big money donors and special interests. It means members of Congress are increasingly dialing for dollars or spending time with people who can write maxed-out checks to their campaigns. As CNN's Drew Griffin reported for "AC360ยบ," 78 members of Congress can count federally registered lobbyists as family members.
