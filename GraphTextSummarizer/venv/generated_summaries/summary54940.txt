This was a deliberate assault on sovereign American soil against an American company, costing it millions of dollars in direct damages and hundreds of millions in reputational damages while blocking most of its employees from using their internal systems to get routine work done. This attack on American interests began on November 24 when there was a massive hacking assault on Sony. No one should underestimate the historic importance of the North Korean cyberwar against America and the collapse of American defenses in the Sony Pictures attack. Other countries and other terrorist groups will conclude that it is open season on American interests and even American lives. Second, we should develop an immediate response capability to defend American interests and crush cyberopponents immediately.
