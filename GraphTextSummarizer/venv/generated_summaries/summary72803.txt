New York police officers quickly arrived at the scene and -- after a verbal back-and-forth captured on video -- shot and killed the attacker. " Israel described the scene as very chaotic, right up until a New York police officer stationed at a nearby command post learned what was happening and came to the scene. Noting that at least one witness heard an "anti-Jewish comment," New York police Commissioner William Bratton said that his department's hate crimes unit is investigating. "People should at least see this is happening for a reason," Israel said of police shooting the suspect. This officer-involved death comes at a time of emotional protests over a grand jury's decision not to indict New York police Officer Daniel Pantaleo in the death of Eric Garner.
