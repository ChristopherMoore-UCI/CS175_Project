"She has still not confessed, still has not said that she murdered Jonathan Foster," Gott said of Nelson. Officers at the apartment complex were in the process of trying to talk with Nelson, who they understood had talked with Jonathan around 12:30 p.m., Gott said. Mona Yvette Nelson, 44, a maintenance worker and an acquaintance of the boy's family, was arrested Wednesday and the Harris County District Attorney's Office has accepted capital murder charges, said spokesman Kese Smith of the Houston Police Department. The suspect met Jonathan's stepfather two weeks before he vanished, according to CNN Houston affiliate KHOU. Investigators said Nelson, the only suspect, made a "self-serving statement" that places her with Jonathan, but she has not admitted to killing the boy.
