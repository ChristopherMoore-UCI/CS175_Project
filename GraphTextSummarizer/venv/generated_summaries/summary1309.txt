Last week, Live Action released undercover videos of four Planned Parenthood health centers in Virginia and one in New Jersey. Schear described the undercover videos as "an effort to undermine the credibility of Planned Parenthood staff in Live Action's coordinated lobbying effort to support legislation that would bar Planned Parenthood from receiving federal funds." Planned Parenthood officials fired a staff worker in the New Jersey office, but defended the others by saying they behaved professionally and appropriately reported the incidents to the U.S. Justice Department. Justice Department spokeswoman Alisa Finelli said Tuesday the U.S. attorney general's office received a letter last month from Planned Parenthood alerting officials to the visits by the purported pimp and prostitute seeking abortions for minors. Planned Parenthood reported the visits to the U.S. Justice Department before any of Live Actions videos were released.
