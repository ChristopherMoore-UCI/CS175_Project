-- The growth of the Hispanic population in the United States is outstripping pre-census estimates, the Pew Hispanic Center report released Tuesday says. Last month, a Pew Hispanic Center report said a two-year decline in the unauthorized immigrant population in the United States had leveled off. "The number of Hispanics counted in the 2010 Census has been larger than expected in most states for which the Census Bureau has released detailed population totals so far," the report says. "What we've seen historically is that when employment opportunities have increased, we've seen increased flows" to the United States, he said. A rebounding economy may be a counteracting force, one of the study's authors, Jeffrey S. Passel, said.
