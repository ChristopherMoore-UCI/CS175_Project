Rosie Napravnik made history by becoming the first female jockey to win the $2 million Breeders' Cup Distaff Friday -- then she dropped the real bombshell by revealing she was seven weeks pregnant and would retire after racing again on Saturday. The 26-year-old guided the three-year-old fillie, Untapable, to a one and a quarter length victory over its closest rival at the prestigious event in Arcadia, California. In the past she has spoken about the challenges female jockeys face compared to their male counterparts. She is currently the sixth highest earning jockey on the North American circuit, winning more than $13 million of prize money in 2014 alone. A two time winner of the Kentucky Oaks and the Breeders' Cup Juvenile in 2012, Napravnik is married to Joe Sharp who is a racehorse trainer himself.
