The presence of Saudi women is the result of several months of pressure by the International Olympics Committee on Saudi Arabia to include women competitors or face being banned from participation. In sports and in daily life, women have few rights in Saudi Arabia. Saudi women in general are denied the right to practice sports. It was touch and go whether one of the Saudi women, Shaherkani, would even participate this year when the president of the International Federation of Judo said women wearing headscarves would not be allowed to compete for fear of choking and injury. It would be tempting to see the Saudi's decision to include women in the Olympics as a big step forward.
