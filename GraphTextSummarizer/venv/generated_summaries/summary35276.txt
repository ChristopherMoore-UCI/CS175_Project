"Those two girls were evil and they were spies for the enemy (the Somali government), but the mujahedeen caught them and after investigation, they admitted their crime, so they have been executed," said Sheikh Yusuf Ali Ugas, commander of Al-Shabaab in Beledweyne, a town in central Somalia. " The El-gal area has been the scene of heavy fighting recently between Somali government forces and Al-Shabaab. Al-Shabaab is waging a war against Somalia's government in an effort to impose a stricter form of Islamic law, or sharia. Last year, Al-Shabaab stoned a teenage girl to death in Kismayo, a town in southern Somalia. Somalia has not had a stable government since 1991, and fighting between the rebels and government troops has escalated the humanitarian crisis in the famine-ravaged country.
