The victim was being bused about 6:30 a.m. Tuesday to Palm Glades Preparatory Academy Charter School in Miami, said Javier Baez, spokesman for Miami-Dade Police. A motive hadn't been determined Tuesday, and police were investigating the relationship between the shooter and the victim, Officer Alvaro Zabaleta told reporters. "It's traumatic for them for what they had to witness to begin with, and now you're going to have to question them to ask them exactly what they saw," Zabaleta told CNN affiliate WPLG. Same shooter might be behind three slayings CNN's Nick Valencia contributed to this report. The 13-year-old girl was airlifted to Miami Children's Hospital, where she died, police said.
