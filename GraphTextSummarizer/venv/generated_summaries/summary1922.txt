"It's more important what's discussed in Brussels than in Portugal," Garcia said from his office in the northern city of Porto Portugal aims to cut its public sector deficit from 6.8% of gross domestic product last year to 4.6% this year and to just 3% next year, in line with European Union guidelines. The political turmoil comes on the eve of European Union summit in Brussels that had been expected to focus on the debt crisis in the eurozone but which will now likely include additional attention on Portugal. The question for many is how Portugal's delicate financial situation, with 10 percent unemployment and tepid economic growth, will fare under a caretaker government.

Portugal's high debt and borrowing costs have prompted repeated speculation in the European Union and in international financial markets that the nation might need a bailout, like Ireland and Greece before it.
