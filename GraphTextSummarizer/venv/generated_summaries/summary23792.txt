Attorney James Weinberger told CNN the ruling "should serve as a deterrent to Mr. Yung or anyone else who thinks they can register names that include Trump's trademark and name and use them for commercial purposes." -- A Brooklyn man who registered domain names related to real estate mogul Donald Trump must pay $32,000 damages, a judge ruled Friday. J. Taikwok Yung, a self-described "domainer" developed four websites -- trumpmumbai.com, trumpindia.com, trumpbeijing.com, and trumpbudhabi.com -- parodying the well-known businessman and providing commentary, often disparaging, on Trump and his television shows "The Apprentice" and "The Celebrity Apprentice." In 2010, Yung rejected $100 per domain that Trump's lawyers offered him. That's defined by the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act as "the registration as domain names of well-known trademarks by non-trademark holders who then try to sell the names back to the trademark owners.
