News International, the UK subsidiary of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. that publishes newspapers including The Sun and The Times of London, announced a new name Wednesday: News UK. The new name for News International, News UK, is "designed to convey a more coherent and logical identity for the new parent company across the globe," a company statement said. " News International was forced to close News of the World, its bestselling Sunday tabloid, in July 2011 amid anger over allegations an investigator working for the paper had in 2002 hacked the voice mail of a missing 13-year-old girl, Milly Dowler, who was later found murdered. They include Rebekah Brooks, the former News of the World and Sun editor who served as chief executive of News International from 2009 until 2011, and former News of the World editor Andy Coulson, who went on to work for Prime Minister David Cameron but subsequently resigned. The rebranding is being mirrored in Australia, where News Limited -- the company from which Murdoch built up his media empire -- will become known as News Corp. Australia.
