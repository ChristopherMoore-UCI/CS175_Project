Private e-mails and documents allegedly from the servers at the University of East Anglia's Climate Research Unit, a world-renowned center on the study of climate change, are thought to have been leaked by hackers. The most famous public document on global warming calls itself "An Inconvenient Truth" -- and yet that document itself is filled with untruths, on every subject from sea levels to polar bears. Suffused by self-righteousness, the East Anglian scientists felt entitled to twist the evidence and delete the counter-evidence. -- I asked a knowledgeable environmentalist earlier this week: "How big a story is the CRU scandal in your community?" "The what?" "The e-mails hacked at the Climate Research Unit at [the British] East Anglia University?" "Ah." (The bears are doing fine, populations at record levels in the Canadian Arctic.)
