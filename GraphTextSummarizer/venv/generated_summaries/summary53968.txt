-- Agents on Wednesday will release dozens of interviews conducted during the investigation of sexual assault allegations against star professional quarterback Ben Roethlisberger. Although prosecutors determined that no charges would be filed, the investigation showed that Roethlisberger had provided underage college students with alcohol, National Football League Commissioner Roger Goodell has said. Roethlisberger, who led the Steelers to Super Bowl titles in 2006 and 2009, faced the threat of criminal charges after a 20-year-old woman accused him of raping her in a Milledgeville, Georgia, bar in March. A seventh man, who was not identified, was also questioned and released, and remains under investigation, according to Lake Delton, Wisconsin, Police Chief Thomas Dorner. The Steelers quarterback is not the only NFL player dealing with allegations of sexual assault.
