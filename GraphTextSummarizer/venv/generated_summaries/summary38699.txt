Ready for Hillary, a super PAC working to help Clinton in her all-but-certain presidential run, blasted an email out to supporters on Monday that featured a picture of Palin, the former Republican vice presidential candidate, holding a Ready for Hillary magnet. Palin spoke at the Iowa Freedom Summit over the weekend, where she needled Democrats for efforts like Ready for Hillary and others that are organizing around a Clinton run before she has even declared her candidacy. " "No, Sarah Palin did not join Ready for Hillary's effort," reads the fundraising email. "Let's show Sarah Palin and everyone else that millions of Americans will stand with Hillary and have her back every single day." Pro-Clinton Democrats are trying to cash in on Sarah Palin.
