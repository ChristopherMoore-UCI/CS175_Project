Colorado City -- a rural central Texas town -- is about 70 miles west of Abilene, Texas. Billie Dunn was under the influence of narcotics on her first polygraph examination, and she failed the second, according to a law enforcement affidavit posted on the website of CNN affiliate KTAB in Abilene. -- Affidavits in the case of a missing 13-year-old Texas girl indicate her mother and live-in boyfriend failed polygraph exams on her whereabouts and they had a New Year's Eve party a few days after she disappeared. The Colorado City Police Department responded to a domestic dispute in February 2010 after Adkins allegedly threatened Billie and Hailey Dunn, the released documents show. Billie Dunn said Adkins was on anxiety medication at the time of the first test.
