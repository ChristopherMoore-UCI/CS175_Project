Authorities, at the time of the shooting, said Shah tried to rob people at a park named in honor of slain former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. The shooting death was the latest in a series of human rights incidents that has deeply eroded public confidence in security agencies. Shah apparently tried to snatch the Rangers' guns, authorities said at the time. Five other soldiers, also members of the Sindh Rangers, and a civilian were given life sentences for their roles in the June killing of 17-year-old Sarfraz Shah, Muhammed Khan Buriro, a special public prosecutor with the Anti-Terrorism Court, said Friday. They said Shah had pointed a pistol and wanted to steal cash and cell phones.
