-- A bank trader accused of fraud in connection with a $2.3 billion loss in unauthorized trading reported by Swiss giant UBS is "sorry beyond words," his lawyer said Thursday. Adoboli faces a charge of fraud by abuse of position between January and September 2011, causing losses in excess of $1.5 billion, and two counts of false accounting. A new charge of fraud by abuse of position from October 2008 to October 2010 was also added Thursday. The 31-year-old was first charged Friday, a day after he was arrested in connection with the discovery of unauthorized deals at UBS. In a statement to the court, lawyer Patrick Gibbs said his client was "sorry beyond words for what happened here.
