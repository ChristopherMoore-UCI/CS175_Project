-- An explosion at close range, and not a direct hit, caused the 1,200-ton patrol ship Cheonan to sink last month, a team of South Korean military and civilian investigators has tentatively concluded. South Korea has not ruled out a theory that North Korea was involved. But Seoul has avoided directly blaming North Korea, which sloughed off allegations it is responsible. The investigators' determination was reported Sunday by the Yonhap news agency. The ship sunk in the Yellow Sea near the western sea border with North Korea on March 26.
