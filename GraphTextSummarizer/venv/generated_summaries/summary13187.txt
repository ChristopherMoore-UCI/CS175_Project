U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, addressing the conference after Merkel, said it was time for Russia not to just agree to peace -- referring to a September ceasefire between Ukraine and pro-Russian separatists that was agreed in Minsk, Belarus -- but to act on it. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Saturday that prospects for peace in Ukraine are "uncertain" following talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The French, German and Russian leaders met to begin drawing up a new proposal to end the bitter conflict in eastern Ukraine. The new diplomatic push comes as a worsening conflict in eastern Ukraine is taking an increasingly heavy toll on civilians. Russia has shown disrespect for peace and territorial integrity, she said, and Moscow's actions in Ukraine stand in stark contrast to their commitments.
