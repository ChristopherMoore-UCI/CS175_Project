The balloon and others like it, nicknamed Scabby by the Chicago-based company that made them, have been used by labor unions as street theater since 1990 to protest anti-union activities. " "There is no evidence to suggest that a rat balloon is significantly more harmful to aesthetics or safety than a similar item being displayed as an advertisement or commercial logo," wrote Justice John Wallace Jr. The court concluded that while townships have a right to maintain an "aesthetic environment" and ensure public safety, its restrictions on expressive displays "do not justify a content-based restriction of non-commercial speech. Big Sky Balloons, based in Chicago, Illinois, rents out "union rats" like Scabby and other inflatables. About 200 Scabby balloons are used by labor unions nationwide, according to Big Sky Balloons.
