The then-senior Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee urged the CIA in 2003 not to destroy videotapes it had made of the interrogations of terrorist detainees, according to the newly declassified letter. CIA General Counsel John Rizzo, who opposed the tape destruction, has agreed to voluntarily appear before the committee. The release of the letter comes a day after the Justice Department announced there is enough evidence to warrant a criminal investigation into the destruction of the CIA tapes. Last month, the CIA acknowledged videotapes were made in 2002 of two terrorist detainees but were destroyed in 2005. In the case of Zubaydah, the tactics captured on videotape included waterboarding, which simulates drowning, a controversial technique that critics consider a form of torture.
