The Priorities USA board has long been seen as the hub of pro-Clinton group coordinating and the rift gave Clinton opponents fresh ammunition to remind the public of campaign infighting from 2008 and worried supporters who feared the return of staffing turmoil that led to the last campaign's implosion. A key problem for the pro-Clinton groups -- and by extension Clinton -- is that each of these organizations were conceived to play a specific role that relied on each other to do it's job. The two groups that were seemingly left out of the recent infighting were Ready for Hillary, the grassroots arm of the pro-Clinton outside group world, and Emily's List, a group focused on electing women candidates and, by extension, Hillary Clinton. From the start of the 2008 campaign, Clinton advisers were at odds with how to portray the candidate. And while the web has not always been harmonious -- some close to Priorities USA tried to sink Ready for Hillary early on in the group's founding -- it has worked effectively and helped ice some of the field that could challenge Clinton.
