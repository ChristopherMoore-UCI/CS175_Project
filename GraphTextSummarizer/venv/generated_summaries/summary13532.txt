Seven truckloads of medical supplies should arrive in Port-au-Prince Sunday night, it said. That plane carried additional medical supplies and hospital equipment, the group said, adding it is still concerned about delays in the delivery of vital supplies. It was unclear Sunday afternoon whether the plane had landed. Asked about the matter on CNN's "State of the Union" Sunday, Lt. Gen. P.K. Keen, deputy commander of U.S. Southern Command, said the Port-au-Prince airport, which is being run by the U.S. military, is operating at maximum capacity 24 hours a day. U.S. paratroopers using helicopters from an aircraft carrier delivered 130,000 daily-ration packets on Saturday, Keen of U.S. Southern Command said on "Fox News Sunday."
