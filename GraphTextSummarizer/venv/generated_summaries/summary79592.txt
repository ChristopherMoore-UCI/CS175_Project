The decision drew, in part, on precedent established in a lawsuit against Facebook by the Winklevoss twins and held that a 2001 agreement between the heirs of Superman co-creator Jerry Siegel and Warner Bros was indeed binding and that a district judge in a 2008 case had "erred" in granting the Siegel heirs partial copyright. In 2011, Jerry Siegel's daughter Laura Siegel Larson published a letter likening her family's legal battle with Warner Bros. to a "David versus Goliath struggle" and said that her father had "co-created Superman as the 'champion of the oppressed ... sworn to devote his existence to helping those in need!' Before the latest ruling, Warner Bros. would have been unable to create new "derivative works" based on Superman's first appearance in Action Comics #1 â€” presumably including Superman films â€” without accounting for the profits to the Siegels as co-owners, complicating plans for a potential Man of Steel sequel and the Justice League movie slated for 2015. The recent ruling on the fate of Superman hinged upon a 2001 agreement between the Siegel heirs and Warner Bros, which the Siegels had claimed was not finalized and therefore not enforceable. -- Warner Bros. scored a huge victory in the long-running and byzantine legal battle over the copyright to Superman yesterday, thanks to a ruling by 9th Circuit Court of Appeals that cements the studio's control over the lucrative superhero character.
