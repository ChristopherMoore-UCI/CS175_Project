Over Thanksgiving weekend, movie theaters sold an estimated $295 million worth of tickets, breaking the record of $273 million set in 2009. Knowing that there were going to be several hot movies in theaters and that people love to take pictures of their ticket stubs, we asked readers to tag their Instagram photos of ticket stubs #stubreview and share a brief review. Share your thoughts in the comments area below or post video commentary on CNN iReport. Most attendees showed us first-run films, but some went to see older movies. The posts corresponded with the top five movies in the Thanksgiving weekend box office results, so we compiled a list of movies to feature based on those two sources.
