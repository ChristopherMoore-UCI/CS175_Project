"It is not only a standout achievement in the history of New Zealand golf but also in the annals of New Zealand sport. Ko's three-shot victory at the Canadian Women's Open, four months and two days after her 15th birthday, made her the youngest winner in LPGA Tour history, and the first amateur to win on the U.S. circuit since JoAnne Carter in 1969. "In the end it was a pretty comfortable win for a player who is new to this level and competing with the top 48 out of 50 money winners on the LPGA Tour," said New Zealand golfing legend Bob Charles, who won the 1963 British Open. " New Zealand Golf chief executive Dean Murphy hailed Ko's triumph as a landmark day in the history of the sport in the country. "She has delivered one of the great days in New Zealand golf history," said Murphy.
