Indeed, the Real Clear Politics average of national political polls of the potential 2016 Republican field found Ryan in third place, behind former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. But even as he's decided to say no to a presidential bid, Republicans have a chance for deja vu with his top-of-the-ticket running mate, former GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney. Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan will not run for president in 2016, he said in a statement on Monday, preferring instead to focus on policy work as chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. A CNN/ORC poll conducted in mid-December, however, found him farther down in the pack, tying for sixth with Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. The nine-term congressman has made a national name for himself as a policy wonk on Capitol Hill, helping to draft and promote the GOP's budget proposals as chairman of the House Budget Committee.
