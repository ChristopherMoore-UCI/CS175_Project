" The motion filed Tuesday is part of a lawsuit that the ACLU has filed against the Itawamba County School District and Itawamba Agricultural High School. At the center of the lawsuit is a memorandum from the school to students, dated February 5, which says that prom dates must be of the opposite sex. Also, when McMillen expressed a desire to wear a tuxedo to the prom, the district superintendent told her only male students were allowed to wear them, according to court documents. But the county's board of education said in a statement last week that "Due to the distractions to the educational process caused by recent events, the Itawamba County School District has decided to not host a prom at Itawamba Agricultural High School this year." "We are determined to get the prom back on the calendar and open to all students," said ACLU lawyer Christine Sun.
