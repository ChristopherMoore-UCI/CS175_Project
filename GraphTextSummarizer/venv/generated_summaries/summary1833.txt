No suicide note was found in the home, but Goodyear said a witness told police he received a text from Thomas about 3 a.m. that said she wanted to be cremated with the children. Tod Goodyear said, according to CNN affiliate WKMG. He said authorities have received previous calls from Thomas' home pertaining to domestic violence. The other children -- Joel Johnson, 12, Jazlin Johnson, 13, and Jaxs Johnson,15 -- were all dead, as was Thomas. -- A Florida mother shot her four children early Tuesday morning before turning the gun on herself at her home in Port St. John, police said.
