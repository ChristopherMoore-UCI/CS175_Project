Officers closed off the entrance to Facebook's headquarters in Menlo Park and asked its employees to stay where they were, the San Jose Mercury News reported. It was made at around 7 p.m. local time (10 p.m. ET), said police spokesman Dave Bertini. Police gave the all-clear, and Facebook's staff departed normally for the night, Bertini told CNN. The city recently allowed Facebook to pay it $200,000 a year to make a police officer closely accessible to its campus, the San Jose Mercury News reported. Police responded to Facebook's headquarters in Northern California to check on a threat Tuesday night.
