-- When Dallas nurse Nina Pham left hospital after treatment for Ebola last week, all she wanted to do was hug her dog. "He's such a joy, you can't help but love this little guy," said Dr. Cate McManus, operations manager of Dallas Animal Services. The small spaniel is classified as a toy dog by the American Kennel Club, and is called a Blenheim Cavalier because of chestnut markings on a white coat. "All three samples came back negative today," said Sana Syed, the Dallas city spokeswoman. Pham was released from the National Institutes of Health in Maryland after undergoing treatment for the virus.
