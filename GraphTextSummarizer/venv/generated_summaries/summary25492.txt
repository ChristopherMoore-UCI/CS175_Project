The so-called "barefoot bandit" suspect will be sent to Washington state to face charges there, a federal judge in Miami, Florida, ruled Friday after Colton Harris-Moore waived his right to an extradition hearing. U.S. Marshal Albert Diego said the defendant will continue to be held at the Federal Correctional Center in downtown Miami until a secure flight to Seattle, Washington, is available for him. Typically in extradition cases, the accused makes a first appearance in the federal court closest to where he was arrested, said Emily Langlie, spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Washington. A public defender represented Harris in lieu of his attorney in the state of Washington, who will be present when a court there reads the charges against Harris and then conducts a detention hearing. The charge in the complaint -- interstate transportation of stolen goods -- stems from the theft of a plane in Bonners Ferry, Idaho, that crashed outside Granite Falls, Washington, Langlie said.
