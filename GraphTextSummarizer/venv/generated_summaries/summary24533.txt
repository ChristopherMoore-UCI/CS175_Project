While it's rare for North Korean defectors to sail to Japan, in 2006, four North Koreans floated to northern Japan. In 1987, a family of 11 drifted from North Korea  to west Japan. A small wooden boat found off the western island of Sado in Japan contained decomposing bodies, according to local police. Last September, a group of nine North Koreans sailed to Japan and was discovered drifting about 15 miles off the coast of Noto peninsula. The boat was badly damaged and contained faint markings on the side that appeared to be Korean characters, according to the Sado West Police.
