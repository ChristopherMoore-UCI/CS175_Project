-- A body pulled from a Wisconsin river has been identified as the son of Green Bay Packers offensive coordinator Joe Philbin, police said Tuesday. No cause of death was immediately determined, and an autopsy was set for Tuesday, Oshkosh Police Chief Scott Greuel said at a news conference. Michael Philbin, 21, went missing early Sunday while in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, to visit friends, police said. Michael Philbin was the second-eldest of six children of Joe Philbin and his wife, Diane, according to the Packers' website. He didn't sound like he was under duress or he had any medical condition," police spokesman Joe Nichols told CNN affiliate WTMJ Monday.
