"We can use these death master file records to infer patterns" in the way numbers are assigned, said Acquisti, who then derived formulas to zero in on a range of Social Security numbers that might have been assigned to a person. Professor Alessandro Acquisti and researcher Ralph Gross of Carnegie Mellon University said they began by studying a half-million expired Social Security numbers obtained from the "death master file" published by the Social Security Administration. Because the process depends on the date the Social Security number was assigned, it works best for people born after the late 1980s, when it became common to issue numbers to newborns. Professor Alessandro Acquisti says Social Security numbers issued after the late 1980s are vulnerable. States with a large population, such as New York, cycle through dozens of numbers, while less populous states, such as Wyoming, use only one.
