" Tunisia now leads Group B on four points ahead of Cape Verde and DR Congo on two points and Zambia, which has a single point. The "Group of Draw" may be no more but Zambia, Congo DR and Cape Verde are all hunting an elusive win in Monday's decisive Group B matches. The second match at the lively Estadio De Ebebiyin saw Cape Verde and DR Congo play out a physical, often scrappy, draw. The second qualifying place from Group B is still up for grabs, however, after Cape Verde and the Democratic Republic of Congo played out a goalless draw in the late game. Cape Verde represent the smallest country at AFCON -- the island territory stretches to just 1.5 square miles --but the 'Blue Sharks' have big ambitions.
