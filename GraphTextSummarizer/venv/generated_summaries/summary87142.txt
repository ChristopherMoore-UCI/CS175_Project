As in fantasy football or baseball, "Fantasy Election" is an online social game in which participants strategically build virtual teams of candidates and compete against other players from around the country for glory and prizes. Gamers will rack up points in "Fantasy Election '12" for registering to vote, watching debates and publicly supporting candidates with transparent fundraising records and who refrain from political mudslinging. Columbia University political science professor Daniel Green says he's skeptical that "Fantasy Election" will motivate young people who are not engaged with the political process. The details of the game won't be finalized until the private beta launch around June, but Facebook is the likely hub of "Fantasy Election." To encourage players to select honest, inspiring politicians, the most valuable candidates will have measurable integrity as well as strong poll numbers.
