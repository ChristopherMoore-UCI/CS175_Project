In some cases, the younger siblings of children with autism are being denied lifesaving vaccines, despite mountains of scientific evidence indicating no link between vaccines and autism. Thousands of parents of children with autism were persuaded to pursue "detoxification" treatments to reverse nonexistent vaccine damage. But all of this has been overshadowed by a seemingly relentless preoccupation with the notion that vaccines might cause autism, despite mountains of scientific evidence that have concluded there is no link. -- You might not know it to read the news of the discredited research that had long linked vaccines to autism, but there really is good progress on the autism research front. We will never be able to say we have done a definitive study showing vaccines don't cause autism.
