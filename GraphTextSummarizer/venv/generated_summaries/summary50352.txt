A total of 4,464 American troops have died in Iraq since the invasion, including 56 since the United States declared an end of combat operations exactly a year ago, according to a CNN analysis of Pentagon statistics. They have a January 1, 2012, deadline to withdraw, but the United States is widely expected to agree to some kind of limited extension of training personnel and equipment. While the United States pulled its combat troops from Iraq last year, between 46,000 and 50,000 troops have remained to provide support and training. No U.S. troops were killed in Iraq in August, marking the first month without an American military death there since the United States invaded the country in 2003. For Iraqis, August saw the worst wave of violence to strike the country in months.
