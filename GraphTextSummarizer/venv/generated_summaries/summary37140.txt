-- National park officials said Monday afternoon that the man found dead in Washington's Mount Rainier National Park is Benjamin Colton Barnes, the suspect in the shooting death of park ranger Margaret Anderson the previous day. Authorities had launched a massive manhunt across steep, snow-covered and wooded terrain for the 24-year-old Army veteran following the fatal New Year's Day shooting of park ranger Margaret Anderson. A ranger at Mount Rainier for four years along with her husband and fellow park ranger Eric, Anderson "was on the job not for money or for glory but out of a love for wild places and the national parks," Taylor said. All the weapons that Barnes had with him when he allegedly shot Anderson and then fled are believed to be accounted for, said Ed Troyer, a spokesman for the Pierce County sheriff's department. There's nothing she could have done," said Troyer, from the Pierce County sheriff's department.
