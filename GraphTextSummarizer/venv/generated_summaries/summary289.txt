Morsi's historic swearing-in took place amid tight security before the Supreme Constitutional Court and was overseen by the military rulers who have been in control of the country since a popular revolution ousted President Hosni Mubarak last year. Restoring parliament would take power away from the country's Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, which ran the county for more than 16 months until Morsi was sworn in, and currently claims legislative authority. -- Egypt's President Mohamed Morsi is looking at ways to return lawmakers to office after parliament was dissolved, his spokesman said Monday, putting the new leader on a likely collision course with the country's powerful military only days after he was sworn in. Shortly after the swearing-in, Morsi went to Cairo University, where he gave his first speech as president. Morsi became president by defeating Ahmed Shafik, a former air force general who served as Mubarak's last prime minister.
