"It's almost like she never left," said Sharpe James, a former Newark mayor who organized concerts for a young Houston as well as her mother, gospel singer Cissy Houston. Students told CNN affiliate WCBS afterward that Houston's successes prove that there's no limits for a girl from northern New Jersey. Yet Houston has a special connection because -- according to public leaders, family friends and other residents -- she never forgot her roots in Newark, where she was born, and nearby East Orange, where she moved to as a child. Still, Depeine -- a CNN iReporter -- said the middle-schoolers know Houston's music through their parents as well as her unique place in Newark lore. "She is a little piece of Newark." Pastor Joe Carter from New Hope Baptist Church in Newark, which Houston attended growing up, recalled how she would come sing at some Easter Sunday services even after she'd made it big.
