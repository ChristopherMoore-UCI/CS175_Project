In the report, Bahrain alleges that Shiite groups coordinated political strategy inside the country and used Hezbollah's television channel, Al-Manar, to mobilize opposition protests. The report details meetings between Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and other senior officials of the group with members of Shiite organizations in Bahrain, such as Wefaq, one of the country's major opposition parties, and the banned Haq group. In the report sent to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, Bahrain's government claims that Iranian-backed Hezbollah has been training opposition figures at its camps in Lebanon and Iran in an effort to destabilize the Khalifa monarchy. Bahrain has long made claims that Iran and Hezbollah have sought to fuel instability in the nation. "Evidence confirms that Bahraini elements are being trained in Hezbollah camps specifically established to train assets from the Gulf," the report reads.
