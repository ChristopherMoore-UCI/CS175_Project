-- Barcelona's Champions League title defense suffered a big blow in rainy London in midweek, and the Spanish club's hopes of a fourth successive La Liga crown were all but ended in similarly wet conditions on home turf on Saturday. "We've taken a gigantic step in La Liga by defeating Barcelona," Real captain Iker Casillas told the club's website. Real Madrid moved seven points clear of their archrivals with just four games to play after clinching a tense 2-1 victory in the "El Clasico" clash -- Barcelona's first home defeat this season, ending a 54-game run in all competitions at the Camp Nou. The match was ominously similar to Wednesday's 1-0 defeat by Chelsea, as Barcelona dominated possession despite slippery conditions -- but failed to capitalize against a Madrid side who lost 2-1 to Bayern Munich in the first leg of their Champions League semifinal. In Italy's Serie A, fourth-placed Udinese's Champions League hopes were dented by a 0-0 draw with mid-table Chievo on Saturday.
