Known as the show that started the idea of the quick hook, CBS's 1961 live celebrity game show "You're in the Picture" was hosted by Jackie Gleason. There were a few shows pushing buttons in the tumultuous time of the 1960s, but the producers of the late-'60s sketch comedy show "Laugh In" thought the envelope hadn't been pushed quite enough. In 1997, Fox unveiled "Lawless," an action series featuring NFL star Brian Bosworth as a detective. Next on the "so bad it shouldn't have aired" reality show train is "Anchorwoman," a 2007 show about model Lauren Jones becoming an anchor for a small-town Texas station. It was so dismal, Gleason spent a half-hour the following week apologizing for letting the show air, and it was then replaced with "The Jackie Gleason Show." 2.
