A senior administration official told CNN on Sunday that the White House informed Christie and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo -- who also ordered quarantine for people returning to his state from West Africa -- along with other state officials that it "has concerns with the unintended consequences of policies that are not grounded in science may have on efforts to combat Ebola at its source in West Africa." Hickox was the first medical professional to be quarantined in New Jersey immediately upon returning to the United States from West Africa, where she had worked in treating Ebola patients. A battle of words broke out during the weekend between Kaci Hickox, who returned home from Ebola-ravaged West Africa only to be ordered into quarantine, and the Republican governor. The White House seemed to agree with Hickox's sentiment that Christie doesn't have the medical authority to impose regulations that trump federal guidelines on handling Ebola patients. Gov. Chris Christie's office said Monday that the nurse quarantined at a New Jersey hospital is being allowed to transfer to Maine, the latest development in a medical and political saga regarding possible cases of Ebola in the U.S., and how politicians in charge are responding.
