Among the ways leaders instill purpose in an organization, according to research conducted my book, Lead With Purpose, Giving Your Organization a Reason to Believe in Itself, is through communicating the vision, tying customer benefits to employee contributions, and linking work to results. I have developed two questions that managers can ask themselves to ensure that they are using purpose as a lever to effect positive results. Organizational purpose emerges from the vision, mission and values of an organization. As Nayar wrote in his book, Employees First, Customers Second, "The role of the CEO is to enable people to excel, help them discover their own wisdom, engage themselves entirely in their work, and accept responsibility for making change." Inspiration emerges from purpose, knowing what you do and why you do it.
