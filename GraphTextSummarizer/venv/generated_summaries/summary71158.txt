The Kommersant business daily on Wednesday said the Lourdes signals intelligence facility, which was mothballed in 2001, would reopen as part of a deal struck by Russian President Vladimir Putin and Cuban President Raul Castro. If Lourdes reopens, it is not clear how soon the defunct facility will again be operational or how much Russia would pay to be able to monitor U.S. telecommunications from Cuba. The hi-tech listening post Russia used to spy on the United States from Cuba may once again gather intelligence, according to a Russian newspaper report. A university official who only gave his name as Benjamin said he doubted Russia could restore Lourdes to its role as a cutting edge listening post just off U.S. shores. During the daylong visit to Cuba, Putin and Raul Castro announced agreements on a wide variety of issues, including a pact to safeguard each country's national security.
