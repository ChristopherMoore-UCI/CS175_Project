"The team's objective has always been to reinforce itself in every aspect: economically, technically and in a sporting aspect," said team principal Colin Kolles. "Without a doubt, the addition of Pedro de la Rosa for next year will be a fundamental foundation in the development of our project. De la Rosa first entered F1 with Arrows in 1999 before joining Jaguar in 2001. -- Veteran Formula One driver Pedro de la Rosa has signed a two-year contract to race with Hispania, the Spanish team announced Tuesday. The Barcelona native raced for Sauber as a replacement for Sergio Perez at this year's race in Canada, after the Mexican was injured during a crash at the Monaco Grand Prix. The 2011 season will come to a close with the Brazilian Grand Prix at Interlagos on November 27.
