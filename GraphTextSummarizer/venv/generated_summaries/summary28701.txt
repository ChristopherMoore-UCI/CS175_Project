Witnesses said two of the three children injured were initially engulfed in flames, according to CNN affiliate KUTV. One little girl's clothes were on fire, we're told," witness Brittany Tait told KUTV. They were a part of a Civil War re-enactment group watching a parade in Orem, Utah, when a cannon set off an explosion Saturday. The extent of the children's injuries was not immediately known Sunday, but authorities said they were in stable condition when they were transported to a nearby hospital. The cannon was fired, and a spark landed on a pouch containing additional charges for the cannon.
