-- Creditors agreed to a plan to restructure Greek government bonds, government officials said Friday, marking a vital move to the financial future of the country. More than 85% of private bondholders agreed to the deal, Deputy Prime Minister Evangelos Venizelos said in a statement. But not doing the agreement could have meant that Greece would not qualify for more bailout money and could face default. Now that the deal is accepted, European finance officials could approve the final portion of Greece's bailout as early as Friday. Investors who own Greek bonds could now see losses of up to 75%.
