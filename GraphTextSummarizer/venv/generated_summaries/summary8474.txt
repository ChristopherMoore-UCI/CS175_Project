But a number of problems in the Ivory Coast, the world's largest producer of cocoa beans, are casting a cloud over the longer-term supply outlook and leading to increasing volatility in cocoa prices, experts say. The last 10 years have seen cocoa crops in the Ivory Coast flat-line, while consumers' insatiable appetite for chocolate has increased. Recently, the market has attracted speculators who, betting that prices will rise, buy up cocoa stocks and store them to sell later. That order accounted for around 7 percent of annual global production and caused cocoa prices to rise to their highest level in more than 30 years. The upward trend in cocoa prices has affected consumers, to a degree.
