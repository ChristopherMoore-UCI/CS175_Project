Poland's Interim President Bronislaw Komorowski has won a runoff election against Jaroslaw Kaczynski, twin brother of former President Lech Kaczynski, who was killed in a plane crash in April. The former president, his wife and more than 90 others were killed April 10 in western Russia on their way to a service commemorating the 70th anniversary of the Russian massacre of Polish prisoners of war in the village of Katyn. Kaczynski, once prime minister, is a divisive figure in Polish politics. Sunday's ballot was required under Polish law after an earlier round of voting failed to give either candidate more than 50 percent of the vote. The Polish electoral commission said Monday that Komorowski garnered 53 percent of the vote versus Kaczynski's 47 percent.
