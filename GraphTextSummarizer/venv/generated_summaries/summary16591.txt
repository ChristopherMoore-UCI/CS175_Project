Nigerians consider the subsidies one of the few benefits of living in an oil-producing nation that has little infrastructure, high unemployment and intermittent electricity. Throngs of protesters have taken to the streets to demand government accountability and a return of fuel subsidies that ended on January 1, a move that doubled gas prices and sent the cost of other goods skyrocketing. Oil labor unions will not shut down production of crude as planned, according to union sources who did not want to be named because of the sensitivity of the talks. Demonstrations started as an outcry against the removal of fuel subsidies and grew into anger against government corruption. -- Nigerian labor unions resumed talks with the government Sunday in a bid to reach a deal to stop a national strike over soaring fuel prices, sources close to the negotiations said.
