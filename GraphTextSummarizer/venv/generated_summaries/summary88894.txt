Initial enrollment figures lower than hoped Website progress garners muted reaction from Congress Marilyn Tavenner, the official charged with implementing Obamacare as director of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, told a congressional hearing last month that the administration initially hoped to enroll 800,000 people by the end of November. The Republican National Committee wasted no time Monday, distributing a list of media reports that noted administration officials warned people to expect continued glitches with the problem-plagued online portal. They focused on canceled coverage for some individual policy holders as an example of how Obama and Democrats failed to fulfill a pledge that people could keep health insurance they liked. A properly functioning HealthCare.gov is crucial to implementing the most vital provisions of the health law that require people to have health coverage. "Insurers are still getting enrollment files that are duplicative and have missing or inaccurate information," Robert Zirkelbach, spokesman for health insurance industry trade association group America's Health Insurance Plans, said in a statement to CNN.
