James Edwards Jr., 15, and Chancey Luna, 16, were charged as adults with felony murder in the first degree, according to Kaylee Chandler, Stephens County Court Clerk. Christopher Lane, who was from Australia, was gunned down in Duncan, Oklahoma, while he was out jogging last week. When police arrested the teens, one of them offered up a motive that made clear that Lane, who attended East Central University on a baseball scholarship, was chosen at random. "He said the motive was, 'We were going to kill somebody,'" Ford told Australian radio station 3AW.
