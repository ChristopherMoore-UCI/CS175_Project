The Illinois Senate on Thursday voted unanimously to remove impeached Blagojevich from office. The commission, led by former U.S. Attorney Patrick Collins, is an independent body that aims to evaluate existing Illinois law and practices in government, according to its Web site. Quinn had set up the commission earlier this year when he was lieutenant governor under Rod Blagojevich, whom lawmakers impeached earlier this month and removed from office Thursday. -- In his first executive order as Illinois governor, Pat Quinn established Friday the Illinois Reform Commission as an official state body under the governor's office. Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn wants a review of state government practices completed in 100 days.
