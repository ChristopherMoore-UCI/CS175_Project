-- South Korea's Lee Jung-Su confirmed his reputation as the top men's short-track speedskater at the 2010 Winter Olympics with his second gold medal on Saturday night, while American Apolo Anton Ohno snatched a place in the history books with a last-gasp bronze. Romano Lemm scored nearly two-and-half-minutes into extra time to leave Norway bottom with three defeats from three despite a hat-trick on Saturday from Tore Vikingstad. The 24-year-old Fischbacher won Austria's second gold medal at the Vancouver Games after beating Vonn's time, with Slovenia's Tina Maze then pushing the American into the bronze position. That thrilling 1,000-meter final capped an action-packed ninth day of the Vancouver Games, as Swiss ski-jumper Simon Ammann made history with his second gold medal and Americans Lindsey Vonn and Shani Davis missed out on double titles in skiing and speedskating. Cross-country skiing Marcus Hellner gave Sweden a second gold medal in the cross-country skiing program, and third overall, winning the men's 30-kilometer pursuit title to follow up compatriot Charlotte Kalla's triumph in the ladies' 10 km free event on Monday.
