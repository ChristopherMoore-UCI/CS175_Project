-- Fabiola Leocal's story ought to be uncommon, but in post-earthquake Haiti, it's not. " Buried alive together, survivors reunite for first time Oxfam International, one of many international charities working in Haiti, said progress is at a "snail's pace." "With a new government in place and billions of aid dollars pledged, Haitians are left asking why there has not been more progress in rebuilding the country," said Oxfam's country director in Haiti, Cecilia Millan. The United Nations, Haitian officials and private aid agencies have said that Haiti has made strides in the two years since the quake. " Michel Martelly, the former pop star who was elected president last year partly because he presented a fresh face in Haitian politics, campaigned on a pledge to fix Haiti. Thousands of Haitians marched Wednesday through Port-au-Prince to the Parliament building to demand a reform of land laws so they can be freed to build homes, said Marjorie Bertrand Dumornay, coordinator of the grass-roots campaign funded by ActionAid Haiti.
