Speaking at a news conference, Attorney General Linda Kelly urged anyone with information about the case to come forward, particularly the unidentified boy whom a graduate assistant testified was assaulted by former Penn State defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky in 2002. While Kelly said that Penn State head football coach Joe Paterno has cooperated with authorities and is not a target of the investigation, she declined to comment on whether investigators were looking at anyone else for possible charges. "Their inaction likely allowed a child predator to continue to victimize children for many, many years," Kelly said of Penn State Athletic Director Timothy Curley, 57, and Gary Schultz, 62, the university's senior vice president for finance and business. The relationship, which began in 2005 and lasted into 2008, included overnight stays at Sandusky's home, where touching led to sexual acts, according to Kelly and grand jury testimony.
