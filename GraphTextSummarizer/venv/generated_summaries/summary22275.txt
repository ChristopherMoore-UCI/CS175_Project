Margaret Truman Daniel The helicopter parent is nothing new. And in 1956 she married New York Times editor Clifton Daniel, with whom she had three sons. When a New York Times reporter found Margaret in Aurobindo's ashram in Pondicherry, India, in 1943, she had been living there four years. Born in 1924, Margaret was Harry and Bess Truman's only child. By the time of her wedding, she had received several academic degrees, including a law degree from New York University Law School, and was admitted to the bar in New York and Indiana at age 22.
