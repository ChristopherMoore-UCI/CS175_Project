-- A bomb inside a van exploded in northeastern Madrid Monday, after a warning call by the Basque separatist group ETA. Authorities allege the new parties are simply new names for other leftist Basque parties already outlawed for their links to ETA. ETA is blamed for more than 800 deaths in its long fight for Basque independence. The attack came just hours after Spain's Supreme Court declined to allow two new leftist Basque parties to compete in the March 1 Basque regional elections in northern Spain. Exactly four years ago, on Feb. 9, 2005, ETA placed a bomb in the same Madrid neighborhood that was hit on Monday.
