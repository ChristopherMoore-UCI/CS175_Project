In the age of Anderson Cooper and Ellen DeGeneres, LGBT people have become invisible anew, hiding in plain sight. I'm gay, but, growing up in Oklahoma, I don't think I was friends with an openly gay person until I left the state, after high school. " Until I read your interview, though, I'd forgotten how much this "magical" visibility is needed in modern America. Many people -- especially the "shrilly liberal" media -- would blame you for not knowing anyone who's openly gay. I've traveled around the country, to places such as Mississippi, where there are still people who aren't sure whether gays exist, much less whether they should befriend them.
