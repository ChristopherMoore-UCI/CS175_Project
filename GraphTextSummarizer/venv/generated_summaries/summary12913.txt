-- The San Diego County, California, sheriff and other officials are to hold a town hall meeting Tuesday night about what will become of the house that's the site of the nation's largest cache of homemade explosives ever found in one spot. For now, the single-story suburban house in an unincorporated area outside Escondido has been deemed too dangerous for bomb squad technicians to re-enter after they discovered homemade explosives inside last week, officials said. Sheriff Bill Gore, Escondido Police Chief Jim Maher, Escondido Fire Chief Michael Lowry and other public safety officials were to answer questions from residents about the explosives and hazardous chemicals that remain in the house, and authorities will provide information about personal safety regarding the planned disposal of the volatile materials. On Tuesday afternoon, Assistant San Diego County Sheriff Ed Prendergast declined to provide details of officials' presentation for the town hall meeting, scheduled to start at 7 p.m. PT at Woodland Park Middle School in San Marcos. Friction from moving any papers or boxes could cause hidden explosives to ignite, officials said.
