"We planned to conduct the project at the end of July," Bernier said, "because it was the best opportunity to have good weather and open water in Mercy Bay, according to our observations based on many years of experience in this national park. Bernier said McClure, an important figure in Canadian history, has been credited with the discovery of the Northwest Passage and was knighted for that. Parks Canada has released images of the HMS Investigator, found late last month at the bottom of Mercy Bay. "Fortunately, part of the bay where the ship had been abandoned became free of ice and the search began," Parks Canada said. -- A British navy ship abandoned and lost in Canadian Arctic waters since the mid-19th century has been found in relatively good shape at the bottom of a bay, the Canadian government says.
