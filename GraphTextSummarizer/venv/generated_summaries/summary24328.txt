North Korean state media has not acknowledged the exact date of Kim's birth in either of its Korean and English-language archives. And North Korean workers at the joint Kaesong Industrial Complex never have asked for a holiday on January 8 in the past two years, according to the South Korean Unification Ministry, the agency which handles North Korean affairs. A South Korean report that released this week indicated that North Korea could be closer to miniaturizing a nuclear warhead indicating that Kim has continued with the focus on nuclear weapons. Kim's birthday is believed to fall on January 8, but like most affairs of North Korea, his personal details are opaque. The Kyodo News reported last year that the current North Korean leader's birthday is not likely to be celebrated as a national holiday this year, after it reviewed five North Korean calendars for 2015.
