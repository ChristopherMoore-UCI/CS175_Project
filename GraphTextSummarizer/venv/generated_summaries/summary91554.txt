Michael J. Fox's triumphant return to TV Executive produced by Fox, Will Gluck, Sam Laybourne and Richard Schwartz, "The Michael J. Fox" show was easily one of the most anticipated debuts of the 2013 fall TV season. Instead of trying to work around Parkinson's, he's chosen to work with it: The premise of NBC's new "Fox Show" has the actor portraying a New York news personality named Mike Henry, who also left TV due to Parkinson's, but has made a recent return, much to his family's relief. "The best part about 'The Michael J. Fox Show' is Michael J. Fox, who is still as sharp, sarcastic and on-point as ever," critiques E!. -- Michael J. Fox's return to TV with NBC's "The Michael J. Fox Show" is an exciting and inspiring move -- there's no argument there. "The Michael J. Fox Show" does use the same documentary-style approach that shows like "The Office" have used to success, which means many critics felt it was trying too hard to be like ABC's critically acclaimed "Modern Family."
