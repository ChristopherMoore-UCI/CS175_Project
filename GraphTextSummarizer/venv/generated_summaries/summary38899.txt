-- Condolences continued to pour in late Sunday night following the death of heavy metal rocker Ronnie James Dio, who lost his battle with stomach cancer earlier in the day. Black Sabbath released three albums with Dio, including "Heaven and Hell" in 1980, "Mob Rules" in 1981 and "Live Evil" in 1982. Dio most recently was touring with Heaven and Hell, a version of Black Sabbath renamed for legal reasons. He called Dio "one of the kindest souls I have ever met and his talent was beyond inspirational to so many of us." "Those of us that had the opportunity to know Ronnie can tell you what a wonderful and passionate man he was," Sixx said. "Today my heart is broken, Ronnie passed away at 7:45 a.m. 16th May," his wife, Wendy Dio, said in a message on his official website.
