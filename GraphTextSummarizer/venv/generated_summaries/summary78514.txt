Fais said he felt it would be beneficial for the video to be viewed because it was about "more than Mr. Cordle." Dressed in a green prison uniform, 22-year-old Matthew Cordle addressed the Columbus, Ohio, courtroom before Judge David Fais handed down his sentence. Asked Thursday what he thought about the sentence, Cordle told CNN's "New Day" from jail that "there is really no fair sentence when it comes to the loss of life. Dennis said Cordle showed "courage to surrender and take responsibility for his actions and show contrition to the family of his victim." Rising to speak on behalf of her father was the victim's daughter, Angela Canzani. Wednesday morning, Cordle's confession video was played in the courtroom.
