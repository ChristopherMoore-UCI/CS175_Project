Forrest added that Snowden "wants to talk to a tech-focused audience about the importance of building the next generation of online tools that protect user privacy." Privacy and government surveillance is a subplot of SXSW Interactive's programming this year, with other slated speakers to include journalist and civil liberties lawyer Glenn Greenwald as well as WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. -- Even though he can't set foot in the United States for fear of arrest, fugitive National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden has joined the speakers' roster at this year's South by Southwest Interactive Festival. Hugh Forrest, director of SXSW Interactive, said it took more than three months to secure Snowden's participation and called it an essential part of this year's programming. Snowden, who fled the United States in June with thousands of top-secret documents, will appear via teleconference Monday from Russia for a discussion about how the tech community must defend itself against mass surveillance. Snowden, a former CIA employee and NSA contractor who fled the United States after leaking details of the American government's spy programs, was granted temporary asylum in Russia last year.
