Sen. Angus King, a Maine Independent, is holding private conversations with Independent Senate candidates to urge them against siding with Democrats or Republicans before the election. King recently advised Independent Kansas Senate candidate Greg Orman on how to be most effective running outside the two party system. The reality is that Independent candidates in most campaigns still register in single digits at best, and are viewed by party leaders as mere spoilers taking away votes from GOP or Democratic candidates. That's why candidates like Orman, and to a lesser extent Pressler, a former Republican, are doing well, and Independent candidates in other states are doing well enough to make an impact on their races. And while King is careful to say he is not sure there is a major trend towards Independent candidates quite yet, he openly dreams of Orman and Pressler actually winning and what that would mean for the future of Independents in politics.
