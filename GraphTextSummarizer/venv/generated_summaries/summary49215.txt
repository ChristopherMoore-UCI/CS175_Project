Hamas officials closed all border tunnels connecting Gaza with Egypt in the wake of the attack, according to Tahir Al-Nono, a spokesman for the Palestinian Authority in Gaza. A gunbattle between the attackers and armed forces ensued, and the Rafah border crossing has been closed indefinitely, North Sinai security official Ahmed Bakr said. -- Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy on Monday condemned a deadly attack hours earlier against soldiers at an army checkpoint at the Rafah border crossing in Sinai, vowing "to capture those who conducted this traitorous attack on our sons." Morsy called on the military council to hold an emergency meeting, state TV in Egypt reported. At least 15 Egyptian soldiers were killed and nine others wounded Sunday when masked assailants carried out the attack as the men were breaking their Ramadan fast at sunset, officials said.
