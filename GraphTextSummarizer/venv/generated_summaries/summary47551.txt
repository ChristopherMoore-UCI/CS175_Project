Territorial spat China and Japan have a long-standing territorial dispute in the East China Sea over a group of islands known in Japan as the Senkakus and in China as the Diaoyutai. It says: "China has intruded into Japanese territorial waters frequently and violated Japan's airspace by its government ships and aircraft belonging to maritime law-enforcement agencies, and has engaged in dangerous activities that could cause unintended consequences, such as its vessel's direction of a fire control radar at a JMSDF destroyer, the flight of fighters abnormally close to JSDF  aircraft, and  its  announcement  of  establishing  the  'East  China  Sea  Air  Defense Identification  Zone'  based  on  its  own  assertion  thereby  infringing  the  freedom  of  overflight over the high seas. The spokesperson said China was exercising its legitimate rights and interests in establishing the East China Sea ADIZ, and was "in conformity with international laws and common practices." Japan also has a territorial dispute with South Korea over the Takeshima/Dokdo group of islands in the Sea of Japan/East Sea. Dangerous activities Japan's annual defense document, approved by the Abe cabinet on August 5, says Chinese ships and aircraft have engaged in "dangerous activities" in disputed areas such as the South China and East China Seas, and these could have "unintended consequences. Japan's new defense white paper has done little to mend fences with Beijing, with the Chinese government complaining that its Asian neighbor is using the "China threat" to justify a bigger defense budget.
