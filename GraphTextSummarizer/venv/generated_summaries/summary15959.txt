What's Next: In Mauritania, sunny with a chance of locusts All this may be interesting enough in the abstract (Couzin said he's been fascinated by swarming organisms since he was a young boy). Locust swarms are blamed for countless deaths in West African countries including Mauritania, which Couzin visited to conduct some of his research. "Why this is important is that we can now build better predictive models and computational models of where swarms may break out," Couzin said. Thanks in part to the work of Princeton ecologist Iain Couzin, now we know better. On Tuesday, the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization said in a news release that locust swarms were threatening pastures and crops in Niger and Mali.
