-- Indiana financial manager and pilot Marcus Schrenker is a smooth talker who promised investors steady returns on their money, said two former commercial pilots named in an Indiana Department of Insurance complaint. The order also applies to Schrenker's wife, who was seeking a divorce, and his three companies: Heritage Wealth Management, Heritage Insurance Services and Icon Wealth management. A judge in Indiana froze Schrenker's assets at the request of investigators looking into his business dealings. Britt told CNN affiliate WRTV in Indianapolis, Indiana, that the couple has two young sons and a daughter and that Schrenker was involved in school activities. "Anyone who would do this to their friends and neighbors and be so brash about it deserves the full penalty that's coming to them." Attorney Lisa Harpeneau said she took the call from Kinney in August 2007, and he told her "we had a rogue agent in the state of Indiana." However, Schrenker is also accused of defrauding people outside of the financial arena.
