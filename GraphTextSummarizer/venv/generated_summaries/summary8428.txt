AAU officers were told of the allegations on November 11, and flew to Orlando to meet at AAU offices with Dodd on November 14, Sachs said. The AAU headquarters in Orlando, Florida, began to receive "brief, cryptic, anonymous e-mails on November 7, 8 and 9 that alleged, in very general ways, acts of child sexual abuse by Bobby Dodd," said Ron Sachs of the Florida-based Ron Sachs Communications. "Dodd informed the officers that he had also received calls making these kinds of general allegations during the same time period of the first half of November," Sachs said. Louis Stout, who replaces Dodd as acting AAU president, said the organization has provided the Memphis Police Department "with the limited information we have up to this point" and begun to review such safeguards as screening and training for staff and volunteers. About the same time that the accusations were unfolding, Dodd learned that he had colon cancer and underwent surgery, Sachs said.
