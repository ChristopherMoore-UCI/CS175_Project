Watch Blagojevich demand a fair trial Â» Blagojevich also is asking for a change in a Senate trial rule that he said is preventing him from calling witnesses such as Valerie Jarrett, a confidant of Obama's; Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr.; and White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel. Blagojevich missed deadlines this month for answering the impeachment charge and for filing a motion to dismiss, a spokesman for Illinois Senate President John Cullerton has said. Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich denies any wrongdoing. The Illinois state Senate on Monday began its impeachment trial against Gov. Rod Blagojevich without the governor present. State Sen. Matt Murphy, part of the nine-member committee that put the Senate trial rules together, called Blagojevich's complaints "the theater of the absurd."
