The passenger group believes that a merger will result in higher fares and reduced choices for fliers. Details about when the airlines will combine reservations and ticketing, frequent flier clubs and other operations are still being worked out, and those combinations are not likely until the beginning of 2014, at the earliest. For the foreseeable future, though, passengers will still be booking flights under both the American Airlines and US Airways names. The U.S. Supreme Court has cleared the way for American Airlines and US Airways to merge into world's largest airline company. But the combined company will be the largest airline in the world in terms of revenue, passengers carried and the number of miles flown by paying passengers, surpassing United Continental Holdings, which was also formed by a merger.
