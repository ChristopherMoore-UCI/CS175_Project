Authorities have said they believe the Tsarnaev brothers acted alone, but are investigating whether they could have learned from or have been aided by terror groups, including groups overseas. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has said they built the bombs there, U.S. law enforcement officials briefed on the progress of the investigation said. CNN affiliate WCVB reported that the hearse that picked up Tsarnaev's body ferried it to a funeral home 30 miles away from Boston, near the Rhode Island state line. Tsarnaev died on April 19 after he and his brother shot a university police officer to death, carjacked an SUV and hurled bombs at officers pursuing them, according to authorities. CNN obtained a copy of Tamerlan Tsarnaev 's death certificate, which lists the cause of death as "gunshot wounds of torso and extremities" and "blunt trauma to head and torso."
