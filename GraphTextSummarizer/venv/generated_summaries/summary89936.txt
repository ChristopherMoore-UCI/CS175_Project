Because of the Super Bowl, which will keep over 100 million Americans in their living rooms and out of theaters, studios are estimating drops in the 70 percent-range on Sunday, which causes most titles to have larger-than-usual weekend drops. Fox's $15 million found footage film "Chronicle," a thriller directed by newcomer Josh Trank about a trio of teenage boys who acquire super powers, soared into first place with $22 million in its first three days. The supernatural spookfest, which CBS acquired for just $3 million from British financier Hammer Film Productions, succeeded in capturing young viewers (especially young women) on opening weekend, and Harry Potter himself, Daniel Radcliffe, proved his drawing power outside of the Potter franchise -- something the Twilight stars have yet to do. Awareness for "Chronicle" appeared disconcertingly low a few weeks ago, but thanks to an aggressive TV marketing push, a viral video advertisement ("Flying People in New York City"), and, perhaps most notably, the film's zeitgeist-y found footage appeal, the adventure managed to bring young people to the theater in droves. Despite the average grade, with  reviews so much stronger than most films aimed at teens, and an encouraging 18 percent bump on Saturday (which suggests positive word-of-mouth), "Chronicle" might not plummet at the box office the way "F" graded "The Devil Inside" did a few weeks ago.
