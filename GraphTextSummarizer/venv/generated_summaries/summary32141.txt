The top four all won this weekend but fifth-place Tottenham suffered a blow in its chase for a Champions League spot, losing 1-0 at relegation threatened Norwich City. Loic Remy scored in second-half injury time to give Newcastle a 1-0 win against Aston Villa at home, leaving Villa, like Norwich, four points above the relegation zone. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers wasn't afraid to say this month that his men were title contenders and with the offense flowing, his team trails Chelsea by a mere four points atop the standings. "It was an important win for us," Rodgers told Sky Sports. Liverpool has conceded 35 goals, the most of any team in the top seven. "As always as a coach, you'll analyze where you can be better, and we're looking to improve (on defense) for next week," said Rodgers.
