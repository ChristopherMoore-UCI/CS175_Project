In the wake of the Boston Marathon bombings, the cast and crew of a new Sandra Bullock-Melissa McCarthy comedy about Boston law enforcement want to show their appreciation for FBI agents and police with an advance screening of the film. " Bullock credits the film crew from Boston for working "crazy hours" with the "last-minute film." "Usually, there's chaos and things fall apart, but because of them, it held together the way that it did, and I really feel like the reason this film got made in the way that it did is because of that group: the Bostonians." I love that city." Bullock plays an FBI agent who is sent to Boston to work on an investigation. Director Paul Feig said Thursday that he is arranging an advance screening to show support for the city. " McCarthy plays a Boston cop who clashes with Bullock's character over jurisdiction.
