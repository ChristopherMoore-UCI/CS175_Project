"One of the reasons why we partnered with Topsy was because a secondary goal was to boost the ecosystem around big Twitter data," says Sharp. " When election day rolled around in November 2008, Twitter had one of its biggest traffic days ever. The collective goal is to dive into Twitter's deep trove of data, and pull up insights faster than Gallup and other traditional polling companies. By applying highly tuned algorithms to Twitter's fire hose of data, the service offers a real-time look at voters' moods, and scores which presidential candidate is trending up (and who is trending down) day to day. This was in Twitter's salad days, literally, when the most common knock on Twitter was that it offered little more than people boasting about what they ate for lunch.
