Led by their leader Song Binbin, the students labeled Bian as a counter-revolutionary and "opposing Chairman Mao," according to historian Wang Youqin, who attended the school at the time. Bian became a respected educator at an elite Beijing middle school. I respected Ms. Bian, but I was too afraid to say anything," says Feng Jinglan, another former student. Each time Bian fell to the floor, someone would douse her with cold water and drag her upright again by the hair to endure further criticism," says Wang. The trouble started in the early summer at Bian's school in Beijing.
