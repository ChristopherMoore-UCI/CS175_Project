MBTA police were called to the Forest Hills MBTA station in Jamaica Plain, a neighborhood of Boston, on Tuesday afternoon for a report of a man taking photos up a woman's dress, according to MBTA police. The charges against him were eventually dropped because Massachusetts' highest court ruled that Robertson did not violate state law when he took photos up the skirt of a woman because she was not nude or partially nude, as stipulated by an old state law against secretive photography. They passed a bill making "upskirting" illegal and the governor signed it into law on March 7. When police arrived they questioned the 26-year-old victim who told officers that while she was standing in the upper busway she felt "something" brush against her knees. He admitted to the deed, according to police, and stated to officers he had previously heard on the news it was not illegal to "take pictures up a girl's skirt.
