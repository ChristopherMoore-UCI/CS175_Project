AT&T has been developing Buzz.com for more than a year and a half, so this isn't so much a case of being late to the party as it is poor timing -- and poor naming. Google Buzz coupled with Google Places is extremely similar to what Buzz.com is all about. With Google Places, YellowPages.com has increased competition, and we think that Buzz.com will need to get some killer features -- like pulling in recommendations from other location-based sites and promoting special offers or coupons -- and that the YellowPages.com database will need to be seriously culled in order for this idea to take hold. Google Buzz isn't the only service that Buzz.com is going against; Yelp, Citysearch and more location-based social networks like Foursquare, Gowalla and Loopt are all in this same territory. The only real difference is that Buzz.com is designed to plug into Facebook Connect, whereas Google is using its own social graph.
