So-called "death squads" targeted those perceived to support his opponent, Alassane Ouattara, who himself was forced to rely on U.N. protection after pro-Gbagbo soldiers surrounded his Abidjan lagoon-side hotel. Human-rights groups say both sides committed potential crimes against humanity during the six post-electoral conflict, and have accused Ouattara's government of implementing a one-sided justice since taking the reins of power. -- Twelve members of former Ivorian president Laurent Gbagbo's inner circle have been indicted for crimes relating to the post-electoral crisis that left over 3,000 dead. Around 70 Gbagbo loyalists have been charged by military or civilian courts, while an international arrest warrant has been issued for Charles Blé Goudé, the leader of the pro-Gbagbo Young Patriots militia. Among those charged are Gbagbo's son Michel, former party leader Affi N'Guessan, and former prime minister Gilbert Aké N'Gbo.
