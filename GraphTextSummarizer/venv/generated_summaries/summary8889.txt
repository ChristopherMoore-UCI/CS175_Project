A prolonged undersea search for the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 could cost nearly a quarter of a billion U.S. dollars if private companies are used, Australia's top transport official said Thursday. Underwater search Officials didn't indicate whether Bluefin's fourth mission was a lengthy one. A preliminary analysis of an oil sample collected in the ocean shows that it is not aircraft engine oil or hydraulic fluid, Australia's Joint Agency Coordination Centre said Thursday. And as the underwater focus continues, officials faced other setbacks. Bluefin operators said they can reprogram it to operate at 5,000 meters (16,404 feet), giving it more leeway.
