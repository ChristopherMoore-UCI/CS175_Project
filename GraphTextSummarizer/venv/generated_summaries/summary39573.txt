-- Andy Murray fought off the tears to claim victory in the final of the Brisbane International following the news that one of his best friends has been diagnosed with a form of cancer. British tennis player Ross Hutchins, 27, is a former doubles partner of Murray's as well as a Davis Cup teammate. "I thought the standard of tennis was good today," Murray said told reporters. "I am doing well, very positive with excellent medical support, friends and family around me. " Denmark's Caroline Wozniacki eased past Urszula Radwanska 6-1 6-2, while there were also wins for Russia duo Maria Kirilenko and Ekaterina Makarova.
