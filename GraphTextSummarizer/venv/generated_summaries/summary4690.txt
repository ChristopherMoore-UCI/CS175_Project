Why well-rested Spurs have edge in Finals "Tim has laid the groundwork for how he wants his NBA career to be handled," TNT and NBATV analyst Mike Fratello said, explaining that Duncan has chosen to stay in one of the league's smallest markets, alongside a coach he trusts, Gregg Popovich. After reading a CNN story from last year about the Spurs' supposed inability to tantalize, he handed the rock Thursday to one of his blog's longtime commenters, Lauri (bold and italics imparted by the commenter): "...the whole 'Duncan is boring' argument is so effing tautological. Kerr, whose 15-year playing career included four seasons with Duncan and the Spurs, said he can't explain it. Duncan's numbers are a smidgeon higher in the playoffs, which his Spurs have reached in every season since he joined the roster. it's hard to imagine that's not primarily a product of Duncan's no-nonsense efficiency, though Fratello points out that Popovich and the Spurs' front office -- as well as the personnel it's paired with Duncan -- deserve credit.
