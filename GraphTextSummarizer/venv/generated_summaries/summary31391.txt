Harris talked to the man about how a person "can make it through anything," Atlanta Police spokesman James Polite said. U.S. Attorney Sally Yates called for Harris to be sent back to prison for two years, saying "there has to be a significant consequence for undermining the [plea] agreement" that Harris received two years ago to resolve federal gun charges. "I believe that I have been put here for a purpose, and I believe that I have an ability to reach people that most people can't reach, that I can turn lives around that other people -- they can't have the same affect," he said. " Friday's hearing was triggered when Harris was arrested on drug charges after a traffic stop on Sunset Boulevard in West Hollywood, California, in September, a violation of the rapper's probation on the weapons conviction. Harris, in a prepared statement he read in court, said that he had been "sincere in my message to kids that guns, gangs and drugs threaten your life and I mean it."
