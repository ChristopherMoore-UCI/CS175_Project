Two witnesses, one who was traveling behind Newton's Dodge truck and one who was behind the Buick sedan that struck Newton, told police that the other driver -- identified as a Fort Mill, South Carolina, 46-year-old -- pulled out in front of Newton as he was on his way to the Panthers' facility. On Wednesday night Newton posted a picture of his truck on Facebook and wrote a message to his fans, thanking God for watching over him and telling his supporters to forgive grudges and tell others how much you care for them. Newton suffered two horizontal fractures in his back in the wreck, the Panthers said in a statement Tuesday. He will be sidelined for Sunday's game after spending parts of Tuesday and Wednesday in the hospital. The quarterback was released from the hospital Wednesday, team spokesman Charlie Dayton told CNN.
