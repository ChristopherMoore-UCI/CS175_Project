-- With Syria limiting access to foreign journalists, Western media outlets are largely relying on amateur photos and videos to tell the story of violence on the ground. While the images contain disturbing scenes -- including slain children and a mass burial -- they help paint a portrait of the situation in Syria, which grew dramatically more violent Friday when dozens were massacred in the city of Houla. Opposition leaders say the massacre is the latest in Syria's crackdown against protesters. CNN, which is working to vet a wealth of material coming out of Syria, has obtained numerous graphic images of victims. President Bashar al-Assad's regime insists it was not behind the massacre and blames terrorist groups.
