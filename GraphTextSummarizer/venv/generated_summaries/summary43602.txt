The major tunnel between Windsor, Ontario, and Detroit was scheduled to reopen at 5 p.m. ET Thursday following a shutdown because of a bomb threat, Windsor police said. Matthew D'Asti with Windsor police told HLN. The tunnel is one of two international crossings between the cities of Windsor and Detroit. Police "fully inspected" the tunnel before reopening it, Windsor authorities said. Neal Belitsky, president and CEO of Detroit-Windsor Tunnel, said the threat was called in to the Canadian side.
