Protesters opposed to Thaksin took to the streets last year wearing yellow shirts, occupied the Government House and blockaded Bangkok's major international airport, stranding throngs of tourists who provide much of the country's revenue. Participating Asian leaders were on their way out of the country, according to Thai Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva. The protesters are loyal to former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted in a 2006 coup. Lawmakers named the 44-year-old, Oxford University-educated Abhisit prime minister in December in the wake of months of demonstrations against Thaksin and his ruling party, People Power Party. The demonstrations ended in early December when a court ruled that the People Power Party was guilty of electoral fraud and threw Thaksin's brother-in-law out of the prime minister's seat.
