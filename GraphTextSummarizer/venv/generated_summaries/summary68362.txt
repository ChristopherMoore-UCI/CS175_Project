Romney tied with Obama in latest poll Miles A. Romney's great-grandfather led the first group of Mormons to the state of Chihuahua, the same Mormons to whom the family of U.S. presidential candidate Mitt Romney traces its heritage. Miles Romney is so proud of Mitt Romney's political career that he managed to get a Romney bumper sticker sent to Mexico which he proudly displays on his pickup truck. Kelly Romney says Mitt Romney himself has never been here, but the fruit grower says he saw him once in the States. In the rolling hills of northern Mexico, about 180 miles south of the U.S. border, lies a community that stands out for its religious roots. His peach and apple orchards, together with those owned by other members of the Romney family, are a crucial source of employment in this part of Mexico.
