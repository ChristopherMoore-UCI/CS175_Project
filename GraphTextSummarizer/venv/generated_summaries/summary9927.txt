Mitchell, 56, is scheduled to stand trial November 1 on charges of kidnapping then-14-year-old Smart in June 2002 and transporting her across state lines for improper purposes. -- A federal judge has denied a request to move the trial of Brian David Mitchell, who is accused of kidnapping Elizabeth Smart in 2002, but may revisit the issue depending on the results of potential juror questionnaires. He is accused of snatching Smart at knifepoint from her bedroom in her family's Salt Lake City, Utah, home. She was found nine months later, walking down a street in the Salt Lake City suburb of Sandy with Mitchell and his wife, Wanda Barzee. And he pointed out that the jury pool will not come only from Salt Lake City or Salt Lake County, but the entire state of Utah, which has a population of 2.8 million people.
