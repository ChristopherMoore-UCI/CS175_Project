"Twitter has one of the better user policies out there (they actually notify their users of subpoenas), and to see them standing up to fight subpoenas like this is promising." Do you think Twitter should stand up to court orders such as these? " "I think that this goes to show that Twitter realizes what allowing the state to subpoena accounts can do to their credibility to social and political movements," Rae told Mashable via email. "If the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement applies merely to surveillance of one's location in public areas for 28 days, it also applies to the District Attorney's effort to force Twitter to produce over three months worth of a citizen's substantive communications, regardless of whether the government alleges those communications are public or private," wrote Twitter in its motion. Twitter motioned to quash my subpoena all on their own, saying that I do retain rights to my content." -- Twitter, which has a history of complying with court requests for users' data, appears to be drawing a line in the sand.
