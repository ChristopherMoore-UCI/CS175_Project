After being introduced to American audiences in 2000 with "Croupier," Owen has carved out a career in films portraying an intense, if disheveled, man of thought and action in "Children of Men," "Closer" and "Inside Man." He also talks about what terrified him as a child and as an adult, and the power of secrets in families. CNN: How important do you think family secrets are? In the new psychologically driven horror-thriller "Intruders," which opened March 30, Owen plays John Farrow, father to a 13-year-old daughter terrorized by the tormenting being "Hollow Face," who wishes to possess her and might be connected to a family secret. Along with the online sexual predator film "Trust" -- and to some degree the single-parent drama "The Boys Are Back" -- "Intruders" seems to mark a new chapter of Owen's career playing fathers who often feel powerless.
