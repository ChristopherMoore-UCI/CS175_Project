The three main unconventional gas techniques are shale gas, coal bed methane (CBM/CSG) and underground coal gasification (UCG), which literally involved setting fire to coal seams underground to exploit the energy released. Whatever the outcome of that gamble, higher prices and less gas are assured, but the destruction of communities and the environment however, is something we do have a choice about. We take particular heart from Australia where a growing movement of organized communities appears to having some success in resisting the spread of fracking companies. Fracking companies are losing money hand over fist, drilling has slumped, prices are rising and gas production looks set to decline. The threat to the energy corporations, whose influence in government is huge, is not energy shortages, from which they will profit handsomely, but sensible energy conservation which will make people less dependent on them.
