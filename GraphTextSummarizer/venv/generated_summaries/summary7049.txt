"President Nasheed is being beaten up as of now in an ongoing peaceful protest." Four members of Parliament were detained as violence gripped the nation's capital, Male, lawmaker Eva Abdulla said, and the head of the party was hospitalized in critical condition. "We're urging the government and the political parties to work together to resolve the situation peacefully and we're continuing to monitor the situation," U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said Wednesday. She said U.S. envoy Robert Blake would make a stop in Male on Saturday as part of previously scheduled trip to the region. Nasheed resigned Tuesday after a revolt by police officers. Earlier Wednesday, Nasheed had called for his successor to leave office, saying he was forced to resign in a coup.
