-- Manchester City hired Manuel Pellegrini as its new manager Friday and he was given the clear message that one of his tasks will be to develop younger players alongside the expensive stars bankrolled by wealthy owner Sheikh Mansour. Mancini steered City to its first top-flight title in 44 years in 2012 but last season it lagged 11 points behind Manchester United, struggled in Europe and suffered a shock defeat in the FA Cup final. Defending its league title last season, City finished a distant second after failing to sign striker Robin van Persie, who went to Manchester United from Arsenal. "He shares the club's approach to football and our ambition to achieve onfield success, coordinating with the wider football support teams to ensure natural progression from the Academy to senior level," said Manchester City chief executive Ferran Soriano. "We have been greatly impressed throughout the selection process by his philosophy, his attitude, and his commitment to the long-term development of Manchester City," City chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak said.
