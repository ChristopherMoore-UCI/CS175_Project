The law sets up a special government anti-piracy agency to monitor "internauts," as French Internet users are called. -- French Internet users who download files illegally could have their service cut off under a new law enacted by the French government. Though the new law still faces a court test and may not be compatible with European legislation, the government plans to have the agency up and running by next year. Opponents of the law worry the government agency could be packed with over zealous enforcers who will side with filmmakers and the recording industry, or even invade the privacy of Internet users. That means it can disconnect Internet service without oversight.
