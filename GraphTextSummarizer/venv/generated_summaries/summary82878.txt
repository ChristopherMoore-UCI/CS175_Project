VOA said its Amharic language listeners have experienced interference since February. "Comparing a respected and professional news service to a group that called for genocide in Rwanda is a baseless and inflammatory accusation that seeks only to deflect attention away from the core issue," spokesman Gordon Duguid said. Press freedom advocacy groups have said Ethiopia is trying to limit media coverage leading up to the May elections, an accusation the government denies. "This right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers," Duguid said. The Ethiopian government may disagree with VOA news, but interfering with its broadcasts undermines the nation's constitutional commitment to censorship and freedom of expression, he added.
