"President Obama and I and our government believe strongly that expanding economic opportunity is as essential as building democratic institutions," Clinton said while surrounded by executives from companies as far-ranging as Occidental Petroleum, JP Morgan Chase, General Electric, Microsoft and Lockheed Martin, in a round-table discussion aimed at getting companies focused on commercial opportunities in Iraq despite its current "tough environment." With one of the largest customer bases in the Arab world, along with one of the best-educated work forces in the region, Clinton said, Iraq poses significant opportunities for American companies. " With additional help from the Departments of Treasury, Energy and Agriculture, among others, the United States will actively support efforts of American businesses to set up operations to compete with Turkish, Chinese, French, Jordanian and Iranian companies already seeking business opportunities in Iraq. -- Iraq is open for business, and American companies should make an effort to invest there, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Friday. The State Department is leading an inter-agency effort to support American companies in their efforts to secure commercial opportunities in Iraq.
