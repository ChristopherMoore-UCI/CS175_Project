French hostage Serge Lazarevic has been freed after being held for more than three years in Mali by al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, French President Francois Hollande announced Tuesday. "There's not one French person who believes for one instant that Mr. Lazarevic has been freed just to please Mr. Hollande," he said. The French consistently deny that they pay ransoms in hostage takings, but they have been remarkably successful at freeing hostages by nonmilitary means. It's not the first time this year that France has welcomed home freed hostages. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius insisted that France had not paid a ransom, Radio France Internationale reported at the time.
