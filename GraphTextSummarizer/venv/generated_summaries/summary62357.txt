'Grey's Anatomy' cast near deals to return But spiced up with commercial-grade Latin-American content (including a scene or two of warm, Spanish-speaking familia time) and starring the glamorous, likable, and marketable Cuban-American Mendes in a pretend attempt at looking haggard, this inauthentic teen tale, with its cosmetically softened edges, serves neither the young people nor the Mendes fans for whom it might be intended. Here's the cautionary tale of an overworked teenaged girl (Cierra Ramirez), neglected by her self-absorbed, single, working-class mother (Eva Mendes), who embarks on a self-destructive plan to speed up her journey to adulthood and escape her mother's chaotic house. Told by a different storyteller -- perhaps in a movie with subtitles and scenes in a Balkan cafÃ© -- "Girl in Progress" would qualify as a tragedy, a horror story, an upsetting drama of child abuse.
