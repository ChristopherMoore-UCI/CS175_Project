-- Injury doubt Novak Djokovic has confirmed his participation, new dad Roger Federer is a maybe, but they will go into the Rome Masters next week in the knowledge their old nemesis Rafael Nadal is finding his feet on clay again after some shock recent defeats. By contrast, the other semifinal was a close and grueling affair, with Halep eventually prevailing 6-7 6-3 6-2 in two hours 36 minutes against former Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova. Nadal, who is the defending champion at the Masters 1000 event, lost in the quarterfinals at Monte Carlo and Barcelona to David Ferrrer and Nicolas Almagro to show rare vulnerability on his favorite surface. Second-ranked Djokovic was due to play in Madrid, but pulled out at the last minute due to the right wrist injury which first hit him in Monte Carlo. Nadal booked his participation in his 90th ATP Tour final with a 6-4 6-3 win over fellow Spaniard Roberto Bautista Agut at the Madrid Open Saturday -- always in command in the one hour 43 minute clash.
