"The U.S. views the migration talks as an important opportunity for both the United States and Cuban governments to discuss policies and procedures that promote safe, legal, and orderly migration," State Department spokesman Michael Tran told CNN Sunday. "We intend to review trends in illegal Cuban migration to the United States, and to improve operational relations with Cuba on migration issues," Tran said about the agenda for Friday. -- U.S. and Cuban officials are set to sit down together in Washington on Friday to discuss immigration and other issues, according to a State Department spokesman. Relations between Washington and Havana have deteriorated in recent months, in part because of Cuba's detention of American contractor Alan Gross, who has been held in Cuban prison since December. "Other matters of mutual concern may arise in our meetings, but the main purpose is to discuss migration issues."
