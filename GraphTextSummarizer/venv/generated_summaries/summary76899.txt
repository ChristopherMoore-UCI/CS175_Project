International internet traffic to and from Libya was shut down on Saturday morning from about 1 to 8 a.m. and again on Sunday during the same timeframe, according to Renesys' analysis, which was posted on the company's blog and is based on traffic data the company collects from internet service providers around the world. That would make it easier, in theory, for the country to shut down internet connections than it was in Egypt, where the government had to call several internet service providers and order them to cut service as part of emergency law. " Google's online "Transparency Report" shows internet searches from Libya, which is controlled by anti-government demonstrators, have been happening at below-average levels in recent days. -- Libya is the latest North African country to experience internet trouble as democratic protests continue to sweep the region. Iran, for example, is known for shutting down internet traffic at the neighborhood level, or removing capacity from the local internet to the point that local and international Web traffic simply overload the system, Cowie said.
