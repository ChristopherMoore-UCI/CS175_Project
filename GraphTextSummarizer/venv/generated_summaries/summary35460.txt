"Very heavy casualties are feared and I cannot give the exact number without a proper survey," said Uttarakhand Chief Minister Vijay Bahuguna, according to CNN's sister network CNN-IBN. Rescue workers reached the town Wednesday and evacuated hundreds of people to safer areas, CNN-IBN reported, but thousands more remain stuck there. A local official in Uttarakhand, Om Prakash, said that the death toll in the state had reached 150, but cautioned that he wasn't able to give an exact estimate since some villages were still inundated, CNN-IBN reported Thursday. "Our hearts go out to the families of those who have lost their lives and those who have suffered injury or loss of property in this huge tragedy," said Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who carried out an aerial survey of the affected areas in Uttarakhand on Wednesday. Authorities have relocated more than 5,000 people from affected areas, the network said, citing Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit as saying the situation is under control.
