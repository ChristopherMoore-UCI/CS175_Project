Novak Djokovic wasted little time in breezing through to the second round of the French Open with a straight sets victory over Dutchman Thiemo De Bakker in Paris Monday. Rafael Nadal, under pressure from Djokovic for the No.1 ranking, opens his bid for a sixth French Open title Tuesday against big-serving American John Isner. The victory extends Djokovic's remarkable winning streak since the start of the year to 38, four short of the record held by John McEnroe from 1984. Federer and Djokovic are on collision course for a semifinal meeting, but the danger in their portion of the draw may well lie with Argentina's Juan Martin Del Potro. Roger Federer joined Djokovic in the second round after he dispatched Spaniard Feliciano Lopez with a 6-3 6-4 7-6 victory in the next match on the main court.
