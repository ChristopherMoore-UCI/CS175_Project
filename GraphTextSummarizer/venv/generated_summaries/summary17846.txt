Last week, fish and plankton collected from the Pacific Ocean near the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant were said to contain elevated levels of radioactive materials. The tremor generated a massive tsunami which smashed into the coast, swamping three prefectures including Fukushima, the site of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant. Michael Friedlander, a former senior operator at U.S. nuclear power plants, said in this instance the words "cold shutdown" are "completely inappropriate" to describe the situation at the Fukushima plant. -- Twisted metal beams still jut from the top of Japan's Fukushima Daiichi stricken reactors, almost one year after a massive tsunami triggered nuclear meltdown. Friedlander said that while the ticking bomb nature of the Fukushima disaster "very appropriately" focused attention on stabilizing the site, a year later the world should be paying more attention to the inevitable spread of radioactive material.
