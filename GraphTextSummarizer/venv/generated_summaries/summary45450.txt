Along its winding path — and elsewhere — Polish photojournalist Justyna Mielnikiewicz met people whose lives have been profoundly changed since fighting erupted last year between Ukrainian government forces and pro-Russia rebels. Mielnikiewicz also photographed landscapes reflecting the mood of the region: a cable car suspended over the mighty Dnieper, giant concrete wave-breakers blocking a road, and a protest billboard depicting Russian President Vladimir Putin wearing a Hitler-style mustache. Russia annexed Ukraine's semi-autonomous region of Crimea in March, supported by Crimea's ethnic Russian majority. Her camera captured fascinating people linked to the conflict: a masked fighter brandishing a piece of wood shaped like a rifle, children wearing paramilitary uniforms standing at attention, a young couple dramatically embracing in the midst of an intense protest. The farther east of the river you go, residents tend to lean toward pro-Russia rebels.
