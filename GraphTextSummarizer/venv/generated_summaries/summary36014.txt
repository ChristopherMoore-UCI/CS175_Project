-- Taking inspiration from the teenage exploits of Michelle Wie, already admired by the most successful player of her generation Annika Sorenstam and with a bucketful of talent, New Zealand's Lydia Ko has the world of golf at her feet. Wie fan Wie's exploits, even before she reached her teenage years, are well-documented and Ko, who first picked up a golf club at just five years of age, quite naturally was a fan. "Lydia Ko is exceptionally talented, mature beyond her years and well liked by golf fans and competitors alike," the Swedish legend wrote in the published citation. To be mentioned in the same breath, Ko will have to claim her share of golf's majors and came close to claiming her first when runner-up in the Evian Championship in France last year. Park is only 25 years old and has held the number one status for a year, surely to come under challenge from Ko, who was born in Seoul before her parents emigrated to New Zealand while she was a toddler.
