About 37 million pounds of the meat went to school lunch programs and other federal nutrition programs since October 2006, said Ron Vogel, of the USDA's Food and Nutrition Service. The USDA said it will work with distributors to determine how much meat remains, the AP reports. Raymond said cattle that had lost the ability to walk since passing pre-processing inspections were slaughtered without an inspector having examined them for chronic illness -- a practice he said violated federal regulations and had been going on for at least two years. Federal inspectors halted operations at the plant earlier this month after finding "clear violations" of USDA regulations. Sunday's action was a Class II recall, under which authorities say there is little risk of illness.
