Maya Wang, China researcher at Human Rights Watch, said the activists were best known for their "performance art" style protests -- occupying public toilets to highlight long lines at women's restrooms, donning blood-spattered wedding gowns to protest domestic violence and shaving their heads to protest against barriers to higher education for women.

Wang told CNN that prosecutors had to decide whether to pursue the charges within seven days of the submission -- by Monday.
