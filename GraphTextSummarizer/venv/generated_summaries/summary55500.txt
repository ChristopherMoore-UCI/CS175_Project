"We are proud to support a top-class European Tour event and delighted to see Tiger competing in Turkey for the second year," said Turkish Airlines' chief marketing officer Faruk Cizmecioglu. -- World No. 1 Tiger Woods will take to the tee at the inaugural European Tour event in Turkey, a tournament with a bumper prize fund of $7 million. The Turkish Airlines Open will be played between November 7-10 and will form part of the new Final Series, the climax European Tour's big-money Race to Dubai. Fourteen-time major winner Woods first played in Turkey last year at the eight-man World Golf Finals, a precursor to this year's event being held at the Montgomerie Maxx Royal in Antalya. "It is an honor to welcome back the world's No. 1 golfer to what is, in our opinion, the best golfing destination in Europe," added Turkish Golf Federation president Ahmet Ali Agaoglu.
