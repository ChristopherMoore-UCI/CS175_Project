According to York University, the find is the second major discovery during archaeological investigations on the site of the University's $745 million campus expansion. We gave the skull special conservation treatment as a result, and sought expert medical opinion," she said in a statement on York University's Web site. Dr Sonia O'Connor, Research Fellow in Archaeological Sciences at the University of Bradford added: "The survival of brain remains where no other soft tissues are preserved is extremely rare. "It jogged my memory of a university lecture on the rare survival of ancient brain tissue. The dig site was described by investigators from York Archaeological Trust as being in an extensive prehistoric farming landscape of fields, track ways and buildings dating back to at least 300 BC.
