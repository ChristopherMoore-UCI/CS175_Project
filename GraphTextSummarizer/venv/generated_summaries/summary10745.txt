-- The United Nations' secretary-general called once again Wednesday for a cessation of violence in Syria and for international action. Pressure grows for intervention "From beginning of this Arab Spring, whenever I had an opportunity of speaking or meeting with Arab leaders, I made it quite pointedly this role of women," he said. U.N. action on Syria has remained deadlocked in the Security Council, where China and Russia, among others, remain skeptical about the need for them to become involved. It was an idea invoked for the first time by the Security Council in the March resolution that authorized military intervention in Libya. The U.S. State Department singled out Russia on Tuesday for holding up action against Syria.
