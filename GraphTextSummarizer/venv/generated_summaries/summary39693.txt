Salvador Hernandez, deputy assistant director at the FBI in 2007, told lawmakers that the FBI opened 184 cases on crimes that occurred aboard cruise ships between 2002 and early 2007. There are no U.S.-mandated "cruise police," nor are FBI agents assigned to cruise ships. Some attorneys question the training of private cruise ship security officers. Cruise crimes have made headlines in recent years, like the Connecticut newlywed who vanished from his Royal Caribbean honeymoon cruise in 2005. This week, several victims of cruise crimes will meet with senators to discuss the issue.
