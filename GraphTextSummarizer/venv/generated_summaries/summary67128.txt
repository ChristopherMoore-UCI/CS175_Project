Cooper is the director of child health and mental health at the National Center for Children in Poverty and an assistant clinical professor of health policy and management at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. There are many barriers to better mental health care for children: a lack of awareness of the issue, a lack of a unified vision from the federal government, no political will to change the situation, a lack of adequate funding and the de-stigmatization of mental illness. Twenty-five years ago, she wrote a report that summarized, state by state, the programs available to children with mental health needs and their families, and the policies that govern them. Carter, Cooper and Knitzer all pointed to the recent passage of the "mental health parity" provision, tacked on to the $700 billion economic bailout bill, which would require health insurance companies to cover mental illness on an equal basis with physical illness. "We know in the mental health community that if you give children good health care before and after birth, good nurturing, good mind stimulation, they have a much better chance to grow up to be contributors to the community, well-adjusted young people," Carter said.
