Child development experts contacted by CNN agree with this age of majority for permanent body modification in young adults, but also assert age is but a number; maturity level is a much better parameter to go by. And in Minnesota, it is unlawful for anyone under age 18 to receive a tattoo without written parental consent. Most states allow tattoos and body piercings for children under the age of majority, which is 18 years old in most of the United States, with parental consent. Unless it is a quality-of-life procedure like gastric bypass, he, like Bober and Pitts-Taylor, also thinks it's best for young adults to wait to have any body-changing procedures until they're of legal age. "It is important for young people to develop what is on the inside and then what other people see will not matter as much," says Bober.
