While she did not compete in this year's Boston Marathon, she had an emotional reaction after learning of the horrendous attacks. While it might sound crazy to even think about running 26.2 miles after a devastating injury, Traum has invited the amputees to join him and his nonprofit group of disabled runners, Achilles International, to participate in next year's Boston Marathon. "If I lost a leg in Boston, you know what I would be thinking of is that I'm going to come back next year and slay the monster," said Traum, who ran the New York City Marathon in 1976 on a prosthetic leg. -- Dick Traum, who made history as the first amputee to run a marathon, has a message of hope and triumph to those who lost limbs during the Boston Marathon bombings. At least 13 of those injured in the Boston attacks underwent amputations.
