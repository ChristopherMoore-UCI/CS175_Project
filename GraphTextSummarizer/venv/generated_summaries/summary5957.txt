Skiing superstar Lindsey Vonn led an historic sweep of a World Cup podium for the United States with a stunning comeback victory in the downhill at Lake Louise Saturday. It left her 0.49 seconds ahead of teammate Stacey Cook, with Julia Mancuso in third completing a triumphant race for the American team, the first time it has achieved such a feat at this level. Vonn's boyfriend Tiger Woods, who has been battling fever and indifferent form on his comeback to golf after injury, summed up their respective fortunes on Twitter. Vonn can also gain encouragement from her second place in the super-G competition Sunday which concluded the weekend's racing at Lake Louise. Vonn is nicknamed "Lake Lindsey" because of her liking for racing at this venue, wrapping up her 15th victory there in all disciplines since her first win in 2004.
