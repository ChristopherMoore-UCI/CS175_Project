Other people change people. Of course, many people want to find their life partner in college. There is this truth in Patton's letter: When you live in close proximity to thousands of other people your age, it's not unreasonable to hope that you will meet at least one other person who captures both your heart and mind. But don't do it to meet other people. I have wonderful friends with great careers with degrees from non-elite schools.
