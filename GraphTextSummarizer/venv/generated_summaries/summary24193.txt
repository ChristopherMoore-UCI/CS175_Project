-- Pardoned but hardly chastened, ex-President Richard Nixon defended his administration's secrecy and wiretaps in combative testimony before a Watergate grand jury following his resignation, newly released documents reveal. The debacle began with a bungled burglary of the Democratic National Committee offices by Nixon campaign operatives before the 1972 election. " The material includes Nixon's recollection of one of the most unusual moments of his presidency -- a pre-dawn meeting at the Lincoln Memorial with student demonstrators outraged by his 1970 invasion of Cambodia. Nixon dodged questions about the mysterious 18Â½-minute gap in his Oval Office tapes that has fascinated historians for more than three decades, telling prosecutors that he "practically blew my stack" when he learned of it. Special prosecutors were still trying to document the breadth of the scandal that had driven him from power nearly a year earlier, while Nixon did his best to defend his presidency.
