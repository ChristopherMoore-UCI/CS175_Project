"Following a review of broadcast footage, Lawes was cited by Independent Citing Commissioner Murray Whyte (Ireland) under Law 10.4(a) for striking Mario Ledesma with the knee," read a statement on the official Rugby World Cup web site. -- England's Courtney Lawes was handed a two-match ban on Tuesday after he was found guilty of recklessly striking his opponent with a knee during his country's opening match of the 2011 Rugby World Cup. Therefore Lawes is suspended for two Rugby World Cup matches. The London-born player will be hoping he can still play a significant part in England's bid to reach a third successive World Cup final. Lawes, 22, made the tackle on Argentina's Mario Ledesma during England's 13-9 victory in Pool B on Saturday.
