With winds of 25 to 40 mph expected and as a much as a foot of new snow possible in some areas, North Dakota officials weren't ready to let down their guard. North Dakota National Guard members inspect a levee along the Red River near Fargo on Monday. Some residents were breathing sighs of relief Monday as the Red River receded, but an early-spring snowstorm that swept into the area prompted officials to warn the flood dangers weren't over. A contingency dike contained the water, said Fargo Mayor Dennis Walaker, but three houses between the contingency and primary dikes also flooded. "It's not over," Fargo Deputy Mayor Tim Mahoney said during a televised meeting of officials.
