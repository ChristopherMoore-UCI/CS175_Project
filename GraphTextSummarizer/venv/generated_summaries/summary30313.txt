Just as this was my chance to eradicate the suffocating bitterness from my youth, here was Frank's opportunity to travel back in time, to relish four hours not as the wheelchair-bound MS sufferer, but as Frankie Z., the cocksure Italian teenager from long ago. A staple of the traditional Sunday morning flag football games, Frank ran like the Flash, charged a quarterback like a bull and threw deep bombs with uncanny precision. I shook hands with Ray Mahoskey, the star running back, and chatted up Pete Lorenzini, the shotputter who was voted track captain over me. From September 1989 through June 1990 -- the span of my senior year at Mahopac High School in Putnam County, New York, -- I never kissed a girl or even held a girl's hand. But in particular, I paid close attention to the plight of Frank Zaccheo.
