For three days over Labor Day weekend (Friday - Sunday), more than 30 bands will take the stage for the Verizon Wireless American Music Festival, playing all kinds of music -- rock and roll, jazz, blues country, and R&B -- by local, regional and national bands on a giant beachfront stage on 5th Street as well as several outdoor stages at the 17th Street Park, the 24th Street Park and the 31st Street Park. Check out the Autobahn Indoor Speedway in the Esskay Family Fun Zone for a chance to drive high-speed electric go-karts from Italy -- go-karts for children ages 8-13 go up to 25 miles per hour while the ones for ages 13 and up can go as fast as 50 miles per hour. Rent a single kayak for $15 per hour or $35 per day, or a double kayak for $20 an hour or $45 per day. Should you suddenly have the urge to work off everything you've just eaten, take Miami's public bike sharing program, Decobike Miami Beach, for a spin and rent a bike anywhere from 30-minutes to a full day. Whether you're in the mood for a Jazz Festival in Chicago, a quirky traditional event held every year in Park City, or an American music extravaganza in Virginia Beach, we've rounded up eight exciting events and festivals around the country you won't want to miss.
