Kang's body had been found Friday in one of the small mountains near the Jindo Gymnasium where bereaved families are taking shelter, according to local police. He had gone to Jindo with the school in an effort to support families, said one fellow educator. "As the one in charge of the safety of the students, he was suffering from guilty feelings," another teacher had told Korean media. The hearse carrying his coffin traveled a few miles east and pulled into Danwon High School, circling the campus for one last time -- signifying Kang's last visit to his school. During this period, several students from the high school came to the funeral home to pay their respects to Kang's family. Kang, who was vice principal at Ansan's Danwon High School, was rescued from the sinking Sewol ferry.
