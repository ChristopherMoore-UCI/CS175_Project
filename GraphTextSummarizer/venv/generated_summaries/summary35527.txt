Odom, who is married to reality TV star Khloe Kardashian, changed his not guilty plea, entered before a Los Angeles County judge two months ago to a no contest plea, Wilcox said. Odom is a free agent who has played in the NBA for 14 years, including for the Los Angeles Lakers, the Dallas Mavericks and, most recently, the Los Angeles Clippers. -- Basketball star and Kardashian spouse Lamar Odom settled his drunken driving charge with a no contest plea Monday.
