French secret services were notoriously good at preventing such plots and President Hollande today revealed that many planned attacks had been very recently foiled. Cabu and Wolinski, in particular, both in their late 70s, have accompanied generations of French people and made them laugh every week, in many different publications, on radio and on television, for over 50 years. The news that the French writer Michel Houellebecq, is now under police protection, as a result of today's attack on Charlie Hebdo, means that the French Interior ministry takes no chances with terrorism, but it also shows the depth of the malaise at the heart of French society. French President Fran√ßois Hollande was very quick on the scene, the terrorist nature of the events was confirmed almost immediately and so was the shocking number of casualties: 12 dead and 11 injured, some critically. While their identities have not yet been confirmed, France, with the largest Muslim community in the Western world (around 6 million out of a population of 66 million) has always been a prime target for Islamist extremists.
