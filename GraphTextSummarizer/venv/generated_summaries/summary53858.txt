From 'Hustle' to 'Mr. Banks,' the season's films make music into magic Based on Wall Street evil genius Jordan Belfort's 2007 memoir about getting insanely rich from conning investors, "Wolf" stars Leonardo DiCaprio as an amoral Horatio Alger with a rolled C-note up his nose. As bad judgment and paranoia take hold and the high rollers get careless about stashing their loot in Swiss banks, "Wolf's" pace never stops panting. (EW.com) -- Pay no attention to the title: Martin Scorsese's new shoot-the-works epic "The Wolf of Wall Street" isn't about rapacious stockbrokers or shady financial shenanigans.
