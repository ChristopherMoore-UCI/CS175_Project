Collaboration and Sharing Like Microsoft's SkyDrive and Box, Google Drive offers in-browser access to files and folders, including document editing via Google Docs. For users and businesses heavily tied to Google Docs, Google Drive will likely make sense. Google's new cloud-based document and storage solution is priced aggressively and boasts best-in-class integration with other Google services -- including Google Docs. For $30 a year ($2.50 a month), users get 25GB to use for Google Drive and Picasa, plus 25GB of Gmail storage. Mobile Integration Although Google Drive's Android app is already around, Google is making iOS users wait for access to the app.
