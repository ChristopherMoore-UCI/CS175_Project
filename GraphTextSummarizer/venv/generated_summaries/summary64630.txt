With that said, my wife, Tana, and I are proud to be ambassadors of Women's Aid, a national charity in England working to end domestic violence against women and children. Domestic violence is not identified solely by violent physical abuse; instead, it is defined as physical, sexual, psychological, financial, or emotional violence that takes place in a relationship, intimate or family-oriented. The statistics are staggering: 1 in 4 women in the UK experience domestic violence in their lifetime, and between 6-10 percent of women suffer from domestic violence in a given year. And even still, a phone call is made to the police every single minute in the UK to report a case of domestic violence. I encourage everyone to help take a stand against domestic violence.
