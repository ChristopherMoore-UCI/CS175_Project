Federal agents say Coffman revealed she had experience connecting potential recruits with ISIS facilitators. Investigators say Coffman, using the name Ubeida Ametova, listed her "work and education" on her Facebook account as "jihad for Allah's sake" and posted images of ISIS fighters armed with AK-47s with captions including, "We are all ISIS" and "Virtues of the Mujahideen." Investigators say they also discovered a man whom Coffman claimed was her husband. Coffman, mother of a 7-year-old son, is accused of trying to help people go to Syria to take up arms with ISIS. After establishing a relationship, the undercover agent told Coffman about an associate who shared their views on Islam and was prepared to join the fight with ISIS in Syria, according to the criminal complaint. Coffman first caught the attention of the FBI through her Facebook activity, according to a criminal complaint filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia.
