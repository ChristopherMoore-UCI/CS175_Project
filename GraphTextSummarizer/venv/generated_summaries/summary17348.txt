Patty Hill says losing 135 pounds through weight loss surgery  still took discipline, planning and hard work. Some of the more common side effects of weight-loss surgery can be difficulty digesting starchy foods and protein, which can lead to other physical conditions including hair loss, fatigue, swelling and muscle weakness. Hill immediately started researching the procedure, in which an adjustable band is placed around the upper part of the stomach to restrict the amount of food the stomach will hold. Ultimately, Hill surpassed her original weight loss goal and lost another 10 pounds. Hill was scheduled to have the same surgery and believed it was the only way to end her lifelong struggle with obesity.
