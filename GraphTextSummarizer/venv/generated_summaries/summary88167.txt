According to French media reports, his brother had been on the radar screen of French security services, suspected of wanting to wage jihad in Syria. In March 2012, Mohammed Merah, a self-styled al Qaeda jihadist, killed seven people -- including soldiers and Jewish children -- in a series of attacks in the southwestern city of Toulouse. Britain has also been a target in recent years of violent attacks by Islamist extremists. A U.S. counterterrorism official told CNN that U.S. counterterrorism agencies are looking at a number of groups as possibly being responsible, including al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, ISIS, and core al Qaeda. The risk of such an attack has increased since France joined the coalition against ISIS, she wrote, adding: "France has a long history of jihadist militancy, while exclusion of migrants, French foreign policy and domestic secularism are all drivers of radicalisation."
