David Burstein, filmmaker and author of the forthcoming book on millennials, "Fast Future: How the Millennial Generation Is Shaping Our World," tells me that "with sustained increased youth participation in 2004, 2008 and now 2012, it's impossible to say that young people don't show up to vote. The 2020 election will be the first presidential race where all millennials will be of voting age -- with 90 million eligible voters (as opposed to this year's 64 million). Millennials are concerned with national debt and the deficits. After three presidential elections cycles of voting for the Democratic candidate, there's a danger that millennials will vote blue from here on out. Mitt Romney improved with millennials more than any other age group over John McCain's performance -- no other age group had such a dramatic swing.
