-- Five people were detained off Somalia's coast Wednesday after pirates mistook a French ship involved in an anti-piracy operation for a commercial vessel, the French Defense Ministry said. Europe and other Western powers have stepped up their maritime patrols off Somalia's coast following a spate of pirate attacks over the past year. Those who have tracked pirate activity say it started in the 1980s in Somalia, when the pirates claimed they were aiming to stop the rampant illegal fishing and dumping that continues to this day off the Somali coast. The BCR Somme was carrying supplies off Somalia's coast to forces involved in the European anti-piracy operation, called "Atalante," the ministry said. The pirates opened fire at midnight local time, about 250 nautical miles (463 kilometers) off Somalia's coast, officials added.
