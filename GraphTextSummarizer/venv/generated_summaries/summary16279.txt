Rivera-Hernandez, of the National Council of La Raza civil rights group, said officials should devote more resources to helping families on the island. The report says 56% of Puerto Rican children live in poverty, compared with 22% for the entire United States. Whether it is because in their homes there are not enough resources or because in the community where they live there are not enough resources," said Nayda Rivera-Hernandez, senior research analyst at the National Council of La Raza. The study, released last week by the Annie E. Casey Foundation and the National Council of La Raza using data from the U.S. Census American Community Survey, showed that the percentage of Puerto Rico's teenagers who are not in school or working is higher than in any U.S. state; at 18%, the rate is twice as high as the national U.S. figure, according to the National Council of La Raza. More than 80% of children in Puerto Rico live in high-poverty areas, according to a recent report.
