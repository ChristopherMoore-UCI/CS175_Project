Refusing to confirm or deny rumors, Dille did say the lack of a cellular data connection could be holding back Sony's PlayStation Portable game system. Dille, the senior vice president of marketing at Sony Computer Entertainment of America, was asked about the so-called PlayStation Phone, which was first reported by Engadget, in a fireside chat Wednesday at a conference in San Francisco. Stopping short of directly addressing intensifying speculation about a PlayStation phone, Sony's Peter Dille acknowledged that its portable game system could be due for a change soon. However, Dille said Sony has competitors, like Apple's iPhone and Google's Android, beat for the attention of serious gamers. Indeed, Sony has had to reverse its marketing strategy to target younger gamers for that system, Dille said.
