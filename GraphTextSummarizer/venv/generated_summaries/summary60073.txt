Simultaneously, drone technology has the potential to revolutionize delivery, agriculture, photography and possibly disrupt major industries. Put another way, the day when Amazon or Apple opens a drone app store is the day when drone innovation takes off. For example, it wouldn't be surprising if Amazon delivery drones were equipped with cameras for loss prevention. Amazon, in particular, managed to capture the public imagination when founder Jeff Bezos outlined a plan to deliver packages by drones. As drones become more mainstream, the prospect of excessive surveillance and other dangers loom.
