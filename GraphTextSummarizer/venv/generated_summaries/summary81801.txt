But that's how many Mac users are feeling after the Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that Orbitz was steering Mac users toward higher-priced hotels than PC users, based on spending habits discovered by one of the site's algorithms. Orbitz, on the other hand, says it's trying to provide Mac users with the best hotel recommendations based on what other Mac users are choosing. "What we have found is ... that Mac users are 40% more likely to book four- or five-star hotels than PC users," Harford said. Orbitz data show that Mac users are likely to spend $20 more a night on a hotel than PC users, on average, Harford said. Harford said his company is in no way charging Mac users more for the same hotel as PC users.
