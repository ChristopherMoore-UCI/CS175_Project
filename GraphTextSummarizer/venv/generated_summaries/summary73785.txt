If you recall, the scandal forced Petraeus to resign from his post as CIA director after the FBI, in reading e-mails sent to Kelley, found he had had an extramarital affair with Paula Broadwell. She wouldn't show me the e-mails that she received anonymously from Broadwell, which Kelley described as threatening. Watch: The media's failure on the Manti Te'o hoax Nor did Kelley show me any of the e-mails she sent to Allen. Kelley played another role in the scandal after the FBI investigated whether Allen, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, sent her inappropriate messages. There's no evidence the married mother of three had an affair with anyone, unlike Paula Broadwell, whose romantic liaison with Petraeus led to his downfall as CIA director.
