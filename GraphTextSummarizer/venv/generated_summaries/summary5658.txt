Yapak Beach (Puka Shell Beach) More commonly referred to on the island as Puka Beach, this 800-meter-long stretch of glistening white sand on Boracay's northern tip is arguably Boracay's most beautiful beach. Opposite White Beach, Bulabog Beach greets the rising sun. This small secluded beach, also far from the crowds of White Beach, is located in the upper north eastern tip of the island around the corner from Yapak Beach and on the opposite side of the island to Banyugan Beach. Today White Beach is Boracay's most developed stretch of shore, lined with resorts, hotels, bars, restaurants and even a shopping mall. Once the sea calms, Ilig Iligan Beach offers scenic snorkeling, but be warned: the beach has a strong current and is better suited to experienced swimmers.
