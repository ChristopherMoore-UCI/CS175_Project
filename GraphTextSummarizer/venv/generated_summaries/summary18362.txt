A man with the foresight to realize that environmental sustainability would play a key role in future product design, in 1971 he turned his efforts to changing the design of trucks, which he felt were not aerodynamic or eco-friendly. " Studying aerodynamics at Paris-Sorbonne University in the late 1940s, Colani considered how birds were able to fly and then used those postulations in aircraft design. He is a professor at several Chinese universities and, as befits his belief in young people, says he is to begin the world's first biodesign professorship in Milan next year, giving him the chance to share his knowledge and unique outlook with aspiring designers. To promote his streamlined design, Colani says he plans to take his trucks on tour around the world next year. "Nature had hundreds of millions of years to refine their things, we have only stupid 100 years of aerodynamics," he says.
