But shipping papers identified the fuel as a less volatile "Packing Group III" product, investigator Donald Ross said. Irving Oil, which was shipping the petroleum crude oil from the Bakken oil field in North Dakota to its refinery in St. John, New Brunswick, did not return a call to CNN for comment. Both types of fuel -- Packing Group II and III -- are shipped in the same Class III tank cars, Ross said. The U.S. Department of Transportation also launched an inspection operation to verify that shippers and rail carriers are properly classifying crude oil. The incident "brings into question the adequacy of Class III tank cars" for transporting large quantities of low flash-point flammable liquids.
