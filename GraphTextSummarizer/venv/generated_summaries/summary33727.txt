" For victims in Sierra Leone, Taylor's verdict brings relief Taylor directed his gaze downward while Presiding Judge Richard Lussick read the sentencing statement, which began with a horror cabinet of carnage committed in Sierra Leone by rebels from the Revolutionary United Front, which the former president backed.

Karl Doenitz, who became president of Germany briefly after Adolf Hitler's suicide.
