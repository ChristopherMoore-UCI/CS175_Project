The subject of modern-day peeping Toms made national headlines this week when Massachusetts' highest court ruled that a man who snapped cell phone photos up the skirt of women on the Boston subway did not violate state law because the women were not nude or partially nude, as stipulated by a state law against secretive photography. Knecht said states such as Kentucky, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota and Wisconsin have not updated laws to make the distribution of such images or videos on the Web a crime. "There's an epidemic around street harassment broadly, but also we've received tons of 'upskirt' reports as well," said Emily May, executive director of ihollaback.org, a Web site that encourages women to share their stories and cell phone photographs of harassers and peeping Toms. After state House Speaker Robert DeLeo said the legislature would seek to close the loophole in the law quickly, the House and state Senate on Thursday passed a bill making "upskirting" illegal, with the measure going to the governor for signing. Washington state changed its law to add language noting that people have an expectation of privacy in public as well as private spaces.
