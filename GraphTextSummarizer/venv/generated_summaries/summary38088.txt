" Iran has previously allowed IAEA inspectors access to the heavy-water reactor at Arak, said Shashank Joshi, a research fellow at the London-based Royal United Services Institute think tank, so the latest visit is a "welcome step" in terms of increased transparency but may not reveal much that's new. -- The International Atomic Energy Agency will accept Iran's invitation to send inspectors to visit its Arak heavy-water production plant on December 8, IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano said Thursday. Iran insists it's enriching uranium and building nuclear reactors only for peaceful civilian energy needs. Iran's agreement to freeze work at the Arak plant is more significant than it allowing the inspectors in, Joshi said. Though the IAEA does not have inspectors stationed permanently in Iran, it has at minimum a team of two inspectors at any given time, and usually has two teams of two inspectors, he said.
