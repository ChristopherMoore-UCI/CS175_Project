It's centered around the real-life trio of psychiatrists Sigmund Freud (Viggo Mortensen), Carl Jung (Michael Fassbender) and Sabina Spielrein (Keira Knightley), a woman who is at first a patient and later a pioneer in psychoanalysis, herself. Lacking any of the dark or macabre trappings of many of Cronenberg's previous films ("Crash," "Dead Ringers"), "Method" is instead a romantic, bittersweet and ultimately tragic character-driven film, focusing on the deep friendship between Freud and Jung, as well as both men's relationship with Spielrein. The methods and theories that Freud had been advancing were strange and uncomfortable to the psychiatric community, not to mention the general public and having Jung as a comrade in arms gave Freud intellectual protection when the two functioned as a united front. A non-specific condition attributed almost exclusively to women and based at least in part on the Greek word for womb (hystera), it is a diagnosis no longer made, due in part to the work that Freud and Jung did with Spielrein. Around this time, Jung was experimenting with a radical new method of treatment for mental illness that Freud had developed, the "talking cure," which we now refer to as psychoanalysis.
