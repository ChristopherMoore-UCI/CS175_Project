Embattled Mayor Rob Ford vowed "outright war" after Toronto's City Council voted to strip him of most of his powers Monday in a tumultuous meeting during which a charging Ford knocked down one of its members. In Monday's session, Ford and his brother, City Councilor Doug Ford, sparred with hecklers in the council gallery who chanted "Shame, shame, shame," during a recess. City Councilor Karen Stintz said Ford "doesn't understand the issues he's facing," and Monday's votes reduce him to "a figurehead." "We are a great city, and the reality is Mayor Ford does not represent the face of the city," Stintz said. But Councilor Raymond Cho said Rob Ford -- who has touted his expansion of Toronto's subway system and vowed to derail what he calls the "gravy train" of city government -- was running both a "gravy train" and a "crazy train. During that break, Rob Ford stomped over to his brother, knocking down Councilor Pam McConnell in the process -- an apparently accidental act for which the mayor had to issue another apology.
