But what if this year, on Presidents Day, we realize something else: We have an unhealthy obsession with presidents as the sole movers of American politics. Presidents are also profoundly affected on foreign policy by what they inherit. But presidents don't act in a vacuum. The electorate plays a huge role in giving presidents the kind of Congress that they need or taking that kind of Congress away. The reality is that presidents operate within a thick institutional environment inhabited by military officials, defense contractors and bureaucrats who play a big role in creating boundaries for the   options that a president can employ.
