Among the weekend openers was Warner Bros.' R-rated comedy "Tammy" (C+ Cinema Score), which managed to take in just $21.2 million in its first weekend in release and $32.9 million across the five-day, cooling star Melissa McCarthy's recent box office hot streak. How to Train Your Dragon 2 -- $8.75 million ($140 million domestic total) "Earth to Echo," meanwhile, opened at No. 6 and earned an estimated $8.25 million across the three-day and $13.5 million over its five days in release from 3,230 screens, failing to meet analyst and distributor expectations by a few million dollars. "Transformers: Age of Extinction" showed its summer might once more by holding onto the No. 1 spot in its second weekend of release, grossing an estimated $36.4 million from 4,233 locations and effectively shutting out the slate of new releases. And, while it may have missed the mark opening weekend, the A- Cinema Score could indicate that word of mouth will be strong for this movie and that it'll perform decently across the next few weeks. That's only a 41 percent fall from last weekend for the comedy, which now boasts a domestic total of $158.9 million.
