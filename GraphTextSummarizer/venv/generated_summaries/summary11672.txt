-- From one-time participant to present-day activist against the illegal sport of animal fighting, Michael Vick came to Capitol Hill Tuesday in support of legislation that would criminalize spectators and others who organize the fighting. Sutton was at the news conference along with Rep. Jim Moran, D-Virginia, who is among the co-sponsors. He was accompanied by the head of the Humane Society of the United States, Wayne Pacelle, who acknowledged it was initially difficult to consider accepting Vick's offer of help, until he realized Vick could carry some influence. The House bill, introduced last week, would establish federal misdemeanor penalties against convicted spectators, and make it a felony for adults found responsible for spectators who are children. His case involved bankrolling illicit animal fights in the state of Virginia.
