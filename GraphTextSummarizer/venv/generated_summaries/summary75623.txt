Orion is scheduled to lift off on its first test flight at 7:05 a.m. ET Thursday from Space Launch Complex 37 at Cape Canaveral, Florida. -- It looks like a throwback to the Apollo era, but NASA's new spaceship is roomier and designed to go far beyond the moon -- to an asteroid and eventually Mars. Orion will be launched on a United Launch Alliance Delta IV Heavy rocket, the largest rocket available. "Sesame Street" is sending up some mementos to inspire students about spaceflight including Cookie Monster's cookie and Ernie's rubber ducky. Orion will climb to an altitude of 3,600 miles (15 times higher than the International Space Station) and orbit Earth twice during the four and a half hour test run, NASA says.
