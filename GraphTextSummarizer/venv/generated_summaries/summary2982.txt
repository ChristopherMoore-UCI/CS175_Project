On Friday, rows of police officers separated pro-government supporters from anti-government protesters. " Police said four activists were injured last Friday during clashes, one of which involved demonstrators calling for political reform and a group of men with sticks. This week's protest was the latest in a string of protests throughout the country and came as anti-government protests have spread across the Middle East and north Africa. Nimer Al-Assaf, deputy secretary general of the IAF, said the group's decision to join to protesters this week was motivated in part by concern over the attack on demonstrators last week. Mansour said the IAF and other opposition groups recently sent a letter to Bakhit asking for the new elections law and the political parties law to be addressed within two months.
