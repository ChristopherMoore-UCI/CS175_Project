However, one of Bradley's lawyers has asserted the grand jury likely wanted to relate Hernandez's alleged conduct in Florida to Lloyd's slaying in Massachusetts. Hernandez is next expected to appear in court Friday in Fall River, Massachusetts, for arraignment on a grand jury indictment in Lloyd's slaying and weapons charges. -- Ex-NFL star Aaron Hernandez is asking a Miami federal judge for a delay in defending himself against a lawsuit accusing him of shooting a man in the face in Florida. Alexander Bradley of Connecticut is suing Hernandez, claiming the then-New England Patriot tight end shot Bradley in February after the two got into a fight at a Miami strip club. In a motion filed by his lawyers, Hernandez argues that he's unable to defend himself while battling murder and weapons charges stemming from the execution-style killing in June of Odin Lloyd.
