A representative at the Russian Embassy in Washington declined to comment, and according to Russian state news agency RIA Novosti, Russia's Foreign Ministry declined to comment as well. According to the New York Times, one source familiar with the case said Firestone turned down a March request from Russian intelligence operatives to spy for Russia. -- An American lawyer based in Moscow who used to work at the U.S. Embassy there was expelled from Russia two weeks ago, his law firm said on Monday. "Neither our colleague nor we have been informed of the reason for this action." Until 2012, Firestone was the resident legal adviser at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, specializing in crime and corruption issues in Russia. But after a trip abroad, when Firestone tried to return to Russia, he was detained for 16 hours at the Moscow airport and was eventually put on a plane to the United States, the newspaper said.
