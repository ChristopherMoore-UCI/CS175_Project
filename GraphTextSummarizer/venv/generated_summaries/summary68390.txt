In an apparent move to protect her assets, Greig sold "all my rights, title and interest" in the house and land in South Boston to Margaret McCusker, according to a filing with the Suffolk Registry of Deeds. Bulger and Greig were known in Santa Monica as Charles and Carol Gasko. " Prosecutors released a series of photographs showing cash, weapons and even a grenade recovered from the Santa Monica, California, apartment that she apparently shared with Bulger for 15 years while he was being hunted by the FBI. The long-time companion of notorious fugitive James "Whitey" Bulger has sold her share of her family's Boston home for $1 to her twin sister, according to registry records. The government has 30 days from the hearing day to indict Greig, who is being held without bail.
