Arnwine said the activism of the Justice Department in recent years when it comes to civil rights has a lot to do with Holder himself. On the other hand, it's a really great thing that we have federal civil rights statutes." After all, it took the federal government to convict seven men on conspiracy charges for the 1964 killing of civil rights activists James Chaney, who was black, and Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner, who were white. As recently as April, the Justice Department found that the police department in Albuquerque, New Mexico, engaged in "a pattern or practice of use of excessive force, including deadly force" that violated people's civil rights. Many of the federal civil rights statutes in use today have their roots in the Reconstruction period after the Civil War, Ifill said.
