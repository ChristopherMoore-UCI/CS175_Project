It's more than any other female, but she still considers herself the dark horse -- and in many ways, she is, especially since she's up for top female vocalist against such heavyweights as Carrie Underwood and Taylor Swift. [Newfield is up against Underwood, Swift, Lee Ann Womack and Miranda Lambert.) For 10 years, Newfield was the lead singer of the honky-tonk trio Trick Pony. Did you feel guilty about leaving Trick Pony? Newfield: No, not an ounce of guilt. In other genres -- pop, rock, hip-hop and rap -- people can leave all the time and do amazing things on their own.
