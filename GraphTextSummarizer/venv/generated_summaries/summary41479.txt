Quiroga, 50, received a bachelor's degree in industrial engineering from Texas A&M University in 1981 and holds a master's degree in business administration from St. Edward's University in Austin, Texas. The former president, who ruled from August 2001 to August 2002, said the Banco Union was "a money-launderer for resources obtained in a bad way, for Venezuelan resources and for resources from corruption," the state-run Agencia Boliviana de Informacion said. At the time of Quiroga's comments, the Bolivian Public Ministry was investigating Banco Union in connection with $450,000 in a trust fund handled by businessman Jorge O'Connor D'Arlach, who had been shot to death in January 2009, the state news agency said. -- Former Bolivian President Jorge Quiroga will appeal his prison sentence of nearly three years for defaming a bank, his attorney said Sunday. He served as Bolivia's vice president from 1997 to 2001, when he assumed the top spot after President Hugo Banzer resigned due to health problems.
