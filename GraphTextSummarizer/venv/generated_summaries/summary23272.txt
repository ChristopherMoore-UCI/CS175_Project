-- Baltimore Orioles pitcher Alfredo Simon was freed Thursday by an appeals court in Puerto Plata Province in the Dominican Republic after being held more than two months in jail for involuntary homicide, his lawyer told CNN. The 29-year-old athlete, who paid bail of about $50,000, spent the time in the Fortaleza San Felipe in Puerto Plata, the only jail in the country that has a baseball field, lawyer Carlos Olivares said. Simon surrendered himself and his weapon on January 3 to Dominican National Police and was jailed in the northern coastal town of Puerto Plata after being accused in the New Year's Eve shooting death of 25-year-old Michael Esteban Castillo. Simon still faces the charge, Olivares told CNN in a telephone interview from Santo Domingo. Simon hails from Santiago, about an hour south of Puerto Plata.
