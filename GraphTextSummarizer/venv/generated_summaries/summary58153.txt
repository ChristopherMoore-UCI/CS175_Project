The boys' mother, Brenda Perry, called police around 4 p.m. ET Tuesday to say she could not find the boys or her mother, who Perry said had a history of mental illness, according to CNN affiliate WFSB-TV in Hartford. Connecticut State Police say the grandmother, 47-year-old Debra Denison, killed the boys and then herself Tuesday in Preston, Connecticut. After the bodies were discovered, WFSB reported, Perry posted to her Facebook page, "God has two beautiful angels helping him now." He was turning 2, and grandma was bringing him and his baby brother, Ashton, home from day care to celebrate. All three were dead of gunshot wounds, WFSB reported.
