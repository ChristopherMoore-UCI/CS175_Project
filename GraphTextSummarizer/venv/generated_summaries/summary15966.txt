The plot may seem overwhelming, "but 'Jane' approaches the melodrama with a sly wink, and Rodriguez grounds it with a warmly genuine performance as Jane, whose relationship with her mother (Andrea Navedo) is already primed to be one of the show's best features," Entertainment Weekly said. "Jane" stars Gina Rodriguez as 23-year-old Jane Villanueva, the daughter of a young single mother who has taken her grandmother's advice to preserve her virginity to heart. " "(T)hanks to star Gina Rodriguez, who makes the lead character believable and likable, the journey to Jane's choice (about the pregnancy) and the inevitable consequences that follow make 'Jane the Virgin' highly entertaining and compelling television," The Wrap says in its review. The plot hinges on a twist that's soapy even by The CW's standards, but critics say "Jane the Virgin" works, and primarily because of star Rodriguez. But when Jane accidentally gets pregnant during a doctor's visit -- it was accidental artificial insemination, to be exact -- Jane's life starts to look something like the telenovelas she watches with her mother and grandmother.
