Tuesday's Kansas City and Wednesday's St. Louis shows were also canceled. She canceled a show in Charlotte, North Carolina, last week because of what was reported to be a flu-like illness. The statement sent to CNN by Cyrus' representative did not specifically say it, but it implied that her upcoming shows over the next week -- including Nashville; Louisville, Kentucky; Philadelphia; Uniondale, New York; and Connecticut -- would be off. Cyrus, 21, tweeted to fans Thursday morning that she is "over the hospital," along with a photo of her lying in bed. Her illness interrupted her "Bangerz" tour when she was admitted to a Kansas City hospital Tuesday.
