The Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act (JVTA) would support victims by taking fines and criminal assets from convicted human traffickers and directing them toward services and treatment to help victims restore their lives. The JVTA doesn't only help victims, it also arms law enforcement with more tools to go after human traffickers. When a state passes a safe harbor law, it means that kids sold for sex are steered towards child protection services, rather than being arrested, charged, or convicted under a state's criminal statutes. The second bill is modeled after Minnesota's "Safe Harbor" law, which helps make sure minors sold for sex aren't prosecuted as defendants, but are instead treated as victims. And while institutionalized slavery has long been cast from America's history books, thousands of children still suffer from the bonds of sex trafficking.
