I like the idea of going over and being able to help translate him or explain him to readers because I really feel that readers in other countries are risking more to read a Mickey Haller book than a Harry Bosch book. Connelly: Before we started filming "Bosch," I was working on a new Harry Bosch book. Meantime, Connelly has not forgotten fan favorite Bosch, who makes a brief cameo in "The Gods of Guilt. On one hand, I'm just as much influenced by great movies and great TV as I am by great novels, so it's just instinctive that I want to try and do this and do it right. So Mickey Haller doesn't translate as well in other countries, I'm not just talking about language translation.
