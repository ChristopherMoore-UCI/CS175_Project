-- Bill Haslam, the mayor of Knoxville and considered a moderate Republican, easily won the Tennessee GOP primary for governor Thursday, the Tennessee Department of State's website reported. In a high-profile Congressional primary, two-term Democratic Rep. Steve Cohen overwhelmingly defeated former Memphis Mayor Willie Herenton. As Tennessee faces great economic challenges, Bill Haslam will be a strong voice for job creation, fiscal restraint and individual freedom. Herenton has been urging voters to elect him as the only African-American member of the state's congressional delegation, saying, "It is as if only white people live in the great state of Tennessee. I believe that it is very clear to the majority of the citizens of this community that we lack representation." Cohen, who served as a state lawmaker in the area before being elected to Congress, has campaigned on what he's done for education and health care in the area.
