It added an extra layer of spice to their face off in Friday morning's fourballs, the two ably flanked by the other half of their current bromances -- Spain's Sergio Garcia and 2011 U.S. PGA Championship winner Keegan Bradley. When Bradley holed his birdie putt on 10, it was the American pair with a pep in their step, Garcia and McIlroy trudging behind, buried in conversation. His 2014 campaign came to life almost the minute he'd announced his engagement to tennis star Caroline Wozniacki was off. Answering a question about togetherness in the U.S. camp, 'Lefty' referenced an ongoing court battle between McIlroy and his former management company, which counts his Ryder Cup teammate Graeme McDowell as both client and shareholder. Mickelson and Bradley won all three of their pairs matches at the 2012 Ryder Cup and for good reason.
