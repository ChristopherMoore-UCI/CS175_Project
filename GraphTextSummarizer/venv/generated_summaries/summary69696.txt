Dean eventually sold his meat company to Sara Lee Foods in 1984, but remained its chairman and TV spokesman, which kept him in the public eye until recent years. Musically, Dean is best known for his song "Big Bad John," which made it to No. 1 on both the country and pop charts in 1961 and was honored with a Grammy. His narrative style of song also produced hits like "Little Black Book" and "P.T. 109" -- a song about John F. Kennedy's command in the South Pacific during World War II. In the late 1960s Dean also appeared regularly on the NBC series "Daniel Boone." "We played every dive in Washington at one time or another," Dean said in his biography on the Country Music Hall of Fame website.
