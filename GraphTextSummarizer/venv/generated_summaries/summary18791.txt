Shiites form a majority in Iraq but for years they were dominated by minority Sunnis empowered by Iraqi ruler Saddam Hussein. -- Two car bombs targeted Shiite pilgrims Saturday in Baghdad, killing at least 32 people and injuring 68 others, police said. However, militant Sunnis have not stopped attacking Shiite pilgrims and the scale of this week's attacks sparked fears of renewed violence on levels of the past. Many began their treks days ago, traveling on foot from the Shiite heartland in southern Iraq and other far-flung places. A second bomb went off in Sanaa Square killing 18 more people and wounding 36 The car bombs followed a wave of attacks Wednesday that targeted pilgrims headed to Baghdad and killed at least 93 people.
