Known simply as Date prior to her marriage to German motor racing driver Michael Krumm in 2001, the veteran of the women's tour knows her continuation at Wimbledon won't be easy against the five-time champion -- one who has won her last 33 matches. Also advancing on Thursday were former U.S. Open champion Samantha Stosur and Sabine Lisicki, the big-hitting German who wasn't even born when Date-Krumm first played at Wimbledon.
