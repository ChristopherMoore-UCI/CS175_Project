Maybe this is why social media has more threat potential, and it's not because it can reach many persons: Social media is more threatening for its potential to reach one specific person—but be overheard by many others. In that sense, social media threats are less like a musical performance, and more like a menacing phone call placed on speakerphone for others to hear, or a call surreptitiously recorded by your Russian girlfriend (as with Mel Gibson). Tasked as they are with defining threats on social media, will their reasoned opinion reflect a current understanding of how people communicate—or threaten—online? Art and music have always spoken about violence in the most graphic terms, whether it's in rap lyrics or Guns N' Roses songs. But songs on an album just don't seem to contain the same direct threat potential of social media today.
