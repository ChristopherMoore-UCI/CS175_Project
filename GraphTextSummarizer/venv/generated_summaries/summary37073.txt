Asked late Tuesday to comment, a U.S. State Department spokesperson said, "U.S. laws on confidentiality do not permit me to disclose the specifics about individual visa and parole cases, or requests for asylum." According to the newspaper, Glenda Murillo crossed the Mexico border at Laredo, Texas, and was paroled as provided for by a policy that allows Cubans who set foot on U.S. land to stay. Asked by CNN to confirm a published report that Murillo had defected, the individual responded, "You already know that." Murillo defected this month, reported El Nuevo Herald in Miami, citing sources. Glenda Murillo, daughter of Vice President Marino Murillo, was on her way Tuesday to visit her boyfriend in Hialeah, Florida, and could not be reached for comment, the individual close to her said by telephone. The younger Murillo never received a U.S. visa to visit relatives or study in the United States, according to El Nuevo Herald.
