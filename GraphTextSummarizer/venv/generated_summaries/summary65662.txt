Del Potro beat Federer in last month's Basel final but has a losing 13-3 record against him despite notable victories in the 2009 U.S. Open title match and in the round-robin stage of that year's ATP finals. Federer marched into the semifinals of the $5.5 million ATP World Tour Finals on Thursday, beating in-form Spaniard David Ferrer 6-4 7-6 (7-5) for his second successive straight-sets win in Group B. " The 17-time grand slam champion relinquished the year-end top spot to Novak Djokovic when he decided not to defend his Paris title last week, having pushed his record tally to 302 weeks at the top. That run continued on Thursday after Ferrer failed to covert three break points on Federer's serve in the opening game. and I'm extremely happy to win," Federer said after ending Ferrer's 11-match unbeaten run.
