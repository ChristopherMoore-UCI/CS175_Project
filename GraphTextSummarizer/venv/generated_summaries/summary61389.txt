The recruiter suicides come at a time when the total number of suicides in the Army's ranks has been growing, Army officials said. The U.S. Army is establishing a suicide prevention board to examine the mental health of its recruiters around the country after the fourth suicide in three years by Houston, Texas-based recruiters, according to Army officials. "The suicides in the Houston battalion are a very loud, very bright alarm that Army officials and politicians can't afford to ignore," said Paul Sullivan, executive director of Veterans for Common Sense. Another Houston recruiter killed himself in 2007 and a yet another in 2005, Army records show. The sergeant's was the second suicide within the ranks of the battalion within weeks, Army officials said.
