So when Tony Blair was elected British prime minister in 1997, Cherie Blair went from being a fairly obscure but accomplished barrister to the spouse of the country's political leader. " Combining advocacy and humanitarian work Blair says her 10 years at Downing Street helped provide a renewed purpose when it came to championing the rights of women around the world. We all know actually men and women flourish best when they're both given the opportunities to reach their dreams," says Blair. "I think on my gravestone, I'd like it to say 'Cherie Blair, wife, mother and feminist'." I had the opportunities that my mother and my grandmother would only -- well did -- dream of," explains Blair.
