"We are not there yet," Notre Dame coach Brian Kelly said. -- Alabama rode the tide of a commanding halftime lead to beat Notre Dame 42 to 14 to win the BCS National Championship game at Miami Gardens, Florida. By that time, despite the fact that the half of the game was yet to be played, many commenters on Twitter were jokingly wondering if Notre Dame would come out of the locker room for the second half. Notre Dame Fighting Irish head coach Brian Kelly said his team will learn from the loss. McCarron got in his lineman's face and Jones pushed him some three yards back, a feat that Notre Dame could never do throughout the game.
