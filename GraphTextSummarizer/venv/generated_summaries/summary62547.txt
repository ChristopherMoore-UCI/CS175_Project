According to Zagat, many of the city's best restaurants are now offering pre-fixed price menus at lunchtime, aimed squarely at business people. Although individuals are generally spending less on eating out, corporate spending is currently the largest driver of growth at fine dining and casual restaurants across New York, according to American Express. This is the "most funky, fun area in New York," says Zagat. "We definitely have a younger clientele - very sexy, fashionista, very cutting edge" boasts manager Michael Bailey. "I could tell you 30 or 40 restaurants in New York off the top of my head, where you would find a full house, and nobody is spending less than $100 for lunch," he said.
