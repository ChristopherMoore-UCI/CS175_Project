More than 70 years ago, the board voted unanimously to endorse President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order 9066 in February 1942 that put 120,000 Japanese Americans, about a third from Los Angeles County, in internment camps for up to three years, Ridley-Thomas said. Los Angeles County Chief Executive Officer William Fujioka, a third-generation Japanese-American, told the board that his grandfather, a prominent businessman in Los Angeles' Little Toyko neighborhood, was among the first detainees rounded up and was sent to Fort Leavenworth because the U.S. government "thought he was a spy. "The internment of American citizens of Japanese ancestry was no doubt a low point in American history. " 'Ways of escaping the barbed wire fences': George Takei's internment camp experience Bill Watanabe, the recently retired executive director of the Little Tokyo Service Center in Los Angeles, a social welfare agency, said he read the 1942 resolution on Tuesday and found it disturbing. Donald Nose, president of the Go For Broke National Education Center, a nonprofit group dedicated to Japanese-American civil liberties issues during WWII, said, "To this day, my uncle and mother still have nightmares about the incarceration process." Los Angeles County Supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas introduced the motion Wednesday to void the board's 1942 endorsement of the barbed-wired camps.
