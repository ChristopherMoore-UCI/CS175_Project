Michael  Enright pleaded not guilty last month in the August attack, and the judge said then he would wait to set bail  for Enright until he was medically cleared from Bellvue Hospital Center's psychiatric ward,  where he was ordered for mental evaluation in early  September. Enright is facing charges of  second-degree attempted murder as a hate crime, second-degree assault as a  hate crime, second-degree aggravated harassment as a hate crime, and  fourth-degree criminal possession of a weapon in the August 24 incident, according to New York police. The attack occurred amid public debate over plans to build an Islamic cultural center and mosque to be called Park51 two blocks from the site of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center. The Manhattan district attorney's office said if bail is made,  Enright must wear a monitoring bracelet and  surrender his passport as well as adhere to an 8 p.m.  curfew. They were "shocked and dumbfounded," said Robert Chase, executive director of Intersections International.
