Lohan has been in court nine times in the past year, mostly for hearings related to probation violations for her 2007 drunk driving case. "It's undisputed that Ms. Lohan walked out of the store with the necklace on," Holley said. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Stephanie Sautner also ordered Lohan to serve 480 hours of community service, including 360 hours at a downtown Los Angeles women's center. She did a short stint in jail last year, but she also checked into substance abuse rehab twice under court order. -- Lindsay Lohan was taken into custody at the end of Friday's hearing in her necklace theft case after the judge sentenced her to 120 days in jail for violating her drunk driving probation.
