The show, which wrapped its first season in March, has motivated many young adults to create such lists right now, rather than waiting until they're about to "kick the bucket" like Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman's terminally ill characters in "The Bucket List" or Queen Latifah's supposedly terminally ill character in "Last Holiday. Gamez was inspired to dream up his list of goals after watching MTV's "The Buried Life", a reality TV show about four friends who set out to accomplish the tasks on their joint bucket list. "You might think [a bucket list is] just a list of goals, but if you're really thinking about things you want to see, experience and feel before you die, then the whole concept of setting goals is totally different," Chua said. Like Fulton, Cheaney was inspired to write a bucket list after his friend died suddenly in a motorcycle accident last summer. But goals like start a flash mob, travel to Lebanon -- from where Fulton and her sister were adopted -- and overcome her crippling stage fright, will be more difficult to accomplish.
