"I have long thought that it would be good if my wealth was spent for society in a valuable way." Lee, who came to office last February, promised to donate his personal wealth to society in late 2007 when he was accused of amassing his fortune through illegal means. "I know that the best way for me to pay back such kindness is to give back to society what I earned." Analysts say this move will hopefully encourage many others to follow. President Lee Myung-Bak is criticized by opposition parties who say he supports policies that favor the rich. Lee is a former CEO of Hyundai Construction and the Seoul mayor. "My fortune, which I accumulated through hard work during my life, is very precious to me," said Lee in a statement.
