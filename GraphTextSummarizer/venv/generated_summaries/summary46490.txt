Japanese Dreamliner held due to A/C power glitch Ethiopian Airlines said in a posting on its Facebook page that the incident occurred on one of its jets after it arrived Friday morning on a normal flight from Addis Ababa to Heathrow. -- A fire that broke out Friday in an empty Boeing 787 Dreamliner at London's Heathrow Airport does not appear to be related to the jet's batteries, the UK Air Accidents Investigation Branch said Saturday. Though Boeing shares sank Friday 3.6% on the news, they were still up more than 30% since the start of 2013. Senior Air Safety Investigator Lorenda Ward was to be accompanied by NTSB airplane systems investigators and representatives of the Federal Aviation Administration and Boeing. No injuries were reported, but the cause of the fire inside the Ethiopian Airlines plane was not clear.
