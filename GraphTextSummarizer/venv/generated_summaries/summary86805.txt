In a statement, Nobles said an adviser to her school's Students Alliance for Equality organization "reached out to Ms. Minard via Facebook after reading (news coverage of Minard's expulsion) to offer support and encouragement as a fellow lesbian who recently married her partner. " Earlier this month, in a letter that Minard shared with CNN, an administrator at Southwestern Christian University noted that he'd been told of Minard's same-sex marriage and saw pictures of it posted to Facebook. " Adrienne Nobles, assistant vice president for university relations at the University of Central Oklahoma, confirmed Minard is enrolled in fall classes at the school in Edmond. Christian Minard said in a post to Facebook Tuesday, "Finally got into classes!! " In a conversation through Facebook with CNN, Minard said Wednesday she has received mixed reactions from the public, but said many people reached out to share their own stories.
