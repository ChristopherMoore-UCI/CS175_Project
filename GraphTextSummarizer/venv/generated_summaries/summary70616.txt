(PEOPLE.com) -- Saturday was the big day for "Bachelor" and "Dancing with the Stars" contestant Melissa Rycroft, who tied the knot with her fianc√©, insurance agent Tye Strickland, in Mexico on Saturday, PEOPLE has learned. The couple, who met three years ago in their hometown Dallas, got engaged in June, less than four months after Rycroft was jilted on national television by "Bachelor" star Jason Mesnick. Rycroft, 26, and Strickland, 28, were previously a couple but split shortly before she left to be a contestant on "The Bachelor" last year. "We want to have it be as fun and relaxing as possible for our families," Rycroft said last summer as she and Strickland planned for the big day. After splitting with Rycroft, Mesnick began dating runner-up Molly Malaney.
