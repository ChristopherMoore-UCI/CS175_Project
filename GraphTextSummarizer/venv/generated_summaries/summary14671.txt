If you want to learn more about the eclipse, NASA astronomer Mitzi Adams will take questions on Twitter @NASA_Marshall. A lunar eclipse happens when the sun, Earth and moon form a straight line in space, with the Earth smack in the middle. " NASA says lunar eclipses typically happen at least twice a year, but this eclipse is the third in a series of four in a row, known as a "tetrad." Watch it live on NASA TV While people west of the Mississippi River will have the best view, at least a partial eclipse will be visible across the nation. Sky watchers in western North America are in for a treat: a nearly five-minute total lunar eclipse this morning.
