Jensen thinks the Cuddle Con is the perfect way to introduce the benefits of touch not only to those who are single, but to people in relationships. Hess sees 2015 as the year of the cuddle and hopes people will start to see the positives of platonic touch. She said there is research to suggest that cuddling, which is commonly associated with romantic relationships, can also be found in platonic relationships as well. She is also the founder of Cuddle Me Up, a business that provides platonic touch for clients through cuddling sessions. The 12-hour convention, which is strictly platonic and nonsexual, was created by professional cuddler Samantha Hess.
