-- Police in northern Virginia charged Washington Redskins defensive lineman Albert Haynesworth with assault Saturday for punching a fellow motorist last week. The motorist told police the driver of a pickup truck -- whom police later determined to be Haynesworth -- was tailgating him, so he delivered a "nonverbal hand gesture" to the driver, Officer Shelley Broderick said. The man told police that when the two stopped at a red light, Haynesworth got out of the truck and the two briefly exchanged words before Haynesworth threw a punch, according to Broderick. The charge stems from an allegation by an unnamed driver who said Haynesworth punched him February 2 while they were driving on the Fairfax County Parkway, police said. Police said officers interviewed Haynesworth on Saturday at the Reston District Police Station before he signed the warrant.
