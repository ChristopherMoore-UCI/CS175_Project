The board's review team interviewed dozens of Capitol Police officers and examined written reports, radio transmissions, and command center incident logs. The shooting at the Navy Yard facility several blocks south of the U.S. Capitol complex attracted a number of law enforcement, including some Capitol Police officers who "self-deployed." "It is impossible to say how the outcome would have been different if the CERT team had been permitted to respond." Capitol Police Chief Kim Dine then ordered the police board review team to look into the allegations the special response team was diverted from the shooting scene. -- A traffic snarl outside Washington's Navy Yard -- not a tactical command decision -- prevented a special U.S. Capitol Police unit from responding at the scene of a mass shooting there in September, an internal police report found on Friday. "Initial reports of the actions of USCP personnel were inaccurate and failed to convey the nuanced complexity of such situations including the personal and professional impact on potential first responders," said a summary of the report by the U.S. Capitol Police Board.
