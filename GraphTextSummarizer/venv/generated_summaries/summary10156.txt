Having to guard NBA stars like LeBron James and Paul Pierce can be the most daunting task for many basketball players. Although he wasn't initially seen as one of the most exciting prospects to come out of college basketball that year -- he was a second-round draft pick for the Bucks -- Mbah a Moute was determined to not let this chance slip through his fingers. In the summer of 2009, Mbah a Moute traveled to Johannesburg, South Africa, to take part in Basketball Without Borders, the NBA's ongoing effort to give talented youth a chance to play the game. But for Milwaukee Bucks forward Luc Richard Mbah a Moute -- who is actually a prince in his native Cameroon -- turning up against such basketball royalty is an enthralling experience. The agile forward is one of seven African basketball players currently in the NBA, hoping to walk in the footsteps of other basketball legends from the continent such as Hakeem Olajuwon and Dikembe Mutombo.
