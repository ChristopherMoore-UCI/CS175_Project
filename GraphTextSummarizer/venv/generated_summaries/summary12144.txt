"Many Ainu are also reluctant to say they are Ainu. The Japanese government did not formally recognize the Ainu as indigenous to Japan, with a distinct language and culture, until 2008, while the westernization of Japan in the Meiji era from 1868 to 1912 lead to greater integration with mainstream Japanese culture.
