"The concept is that based upon that current year, if the team fails academically, they can't get their bonus," says board member Tom McMillen, a former basketball player and former U.S. representative. Four state universities within the Maryland system will be affected: The University of Maryland in College Park, Towson University in Baltimore, Coppin State University in Baltimore and the University of Maryland-Baltimore County. On Friday, the board of regents for the University System of Maryland voted to withhold bonuses from Division One coaches if fewer than half of their team players are on track to graduate. McMillen said he hopes it will force coaches to think before recruiting "one-and-done" basketball players who often bring a year of success to a team and then leave for the draft. McMillen said the Athletic Department uses an NCAA point system called the APR -- for Academic Progress Rate -- to track each athlete's progress toward graduation.
