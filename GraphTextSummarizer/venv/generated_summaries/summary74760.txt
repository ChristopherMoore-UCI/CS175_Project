The new law says the TSA should establish guidelines for screening travelers in military uniforms and combat boots, and consider incorporating military personnel into trusted traveler programs that give preference to passengers who undergo pre-screening. Pistole said the TSA test would not immediately result in quicker screening for service members. The new law was signed just days after two incidents involving the same soldier at airports in North Carolina and Texas. On Saturday, he was arrested at Midland International Airport in Texas on his return trip when TSA screeners found an undisclosed amount of C-4 explosives in his bag. In November, TSA Administrator John Pistole told CNN that he was already working on ways to expedite screening for service members.
