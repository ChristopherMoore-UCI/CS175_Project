Recovered from his illness, del Potro blasted his way past new world No. 1 Rafael Nadal 6-2 6-4 to reach Sunday's final against Novak Djokovic. Del Potro will likely have to play just as well or better to defeat Djokovic, who boosted his winning streak in China to 19 matches by downing Jo-Wilfried Tsonga 6-2 7-5 earlier Saturday. "But we'll see." When Djokovic and del Potro last met, Djokovic prevailed in a near five-hour classic in the Wimbledon semifinals. Djokovic, now second in the rankings, regained his composure after a controversial line call in the second set. "I would wish to get even a better performance tomorrow for the most important match this week," Djokovic, who crushed Nadal last week at the China Open, told reporters.
