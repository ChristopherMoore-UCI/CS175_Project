Veteran midfielder Massimo Ambrosini put Milan ahead on the stroke of half-time when he hooked the ball home after goalkeeper Francesco Benussi failed to deal with a David Beckham cross. But Cristiano Lucarelli poked home a mis-hit Claudio Bellucci shot just before the hour mark to earn Livorno a point. -- AC Milan wasted a golden opportunity to close the gap on leaders and city rivals Inter at the top of the Italian Serie A table after being held to a 1-1 draw at home to lowly Livorno. Second-half substitute Stefano Okaka struck the winner three minutes from time in his final match before joining English Premier League side Fulham in a six-month loan deal. Elsewhere in Italy, striker Antonio Cassano has confirmed he has turned down the chance to join Fiorentina, choosing to remain with Sampdoria despite reports of a fall-out with coach Luigi Del Neri. Milan's failure to win means in-form Roma have joined them on 41 points after a narrow 2-1 home win over bottom side Siena.
