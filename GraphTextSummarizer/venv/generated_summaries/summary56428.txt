Judge Michael Baylson granted a temporary injunction and ordered U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius to direct the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network to waive in Javier's case a policy that keeps children younger than 12 from being prioritized for available adult lung transplants. " A judge on Thursday made Javier, from Bronx, New York, more quickly eligible for adult lungs. The ruling came the same day the judge granted an injunction for 10-year-old Sarah Murnaghan, whose parents' push for an organ transplant policy change has thrust the issue of who gets donated organs into the national spotlight. According to Murnaghan and Martinez's attorney, Stephen Harvey, the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network is expected to consider Monday evening the families' requests that the "Under 12" rule -- which places children under age 12 at the bottom of the organ allocation list -- be struck down. Martinez said she was "excited" after hearing the news of the the ruling in Javier's case.
