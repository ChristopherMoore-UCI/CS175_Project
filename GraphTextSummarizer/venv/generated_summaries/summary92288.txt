While South Africa became the first host nation to be eliminated at the group stage, five-time champions Brazil will be expected to go all the way on home soil. -- FIFA general secretary Jerome Valcke has admitted to flaws in the ticketing system for the World Cup in South Africa and vowed not to make the same mistakes for the 2014 event in Brazil. Tickets for the 2010 World Cup were slow to sell after FIFA's rigid internet-based system alienated South Africans, who are more accustomed to buying tickets at the stadium. "In Brazil the goal will be to win the World Cup at home for the first time." " Valcke said the key difference between South Africa 2010 and Brazil 2014 would be the strength of the host nation.
