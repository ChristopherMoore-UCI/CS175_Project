-- Tiger Woods said Sunday that he is focused on "living a life of amends" after "living the life of a lie" in one of his first interviews since a November car crash outside his home unleashed a media frenzy amid rumors of extramarital affairs. Woods told The Golf Channel's Kelly Tilghman that his mentor and father, the late Earl Woods, "would be very disappointed in me. I saw a person that I never thought I would ever become." Woods said two of his lowest points in the past four months came when he had to tell his wife, Elin Woods, and his mother about his affairs. Woods credited inpatient and outpatient therapy for helping him start the process toward making amends. The Golf Channel simultaneously aired its similarly brief interview with Woods on Sunday night.
