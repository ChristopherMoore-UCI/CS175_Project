Mr Vekselberg resigned as Rusal's chairman on Monday night, saying it had been transformed from "a world leader in the aluminium industry into a company overburdened by debt and involved in a huge number of legal battles and social conflicts". Falling aluminium prices and heavy debts have cast a cloud over Rusal since it launched an initial public offering on the Hong Kong stock exchange in early 2010. Mr Vekselberg and Mr Deripaska have also been at odds over whether Rusal should sell its 25 per cent stake in Norilsk Nickel, the world's biggest nickel miner. Mr Vekselberg co-owns a 15.8 per cent stake in Rusal with another Russian oligarch, Leonard Blavatnik. Mr Vekselberg has been seeking to sell many of his Russian assets over the past year, and supported a $12.8bn offer from Norilsk to buy back most of Rusal's stake.
