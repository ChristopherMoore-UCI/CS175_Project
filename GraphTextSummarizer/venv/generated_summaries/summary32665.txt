While I had heard dozens of Christian apologists claim that meaning cannot be found without God, I had a curious experience. Absurdism is a school of thought arguing that humanity's effort to find inherent meaning in life is futile. The problem is not solved by inventing a God in which to place all our hopes, but rather, to face life honestly and create beauty from the absurd. My appreciation for life and its potential increased when I stepped away from my faith. It means that life itself is absurd.
