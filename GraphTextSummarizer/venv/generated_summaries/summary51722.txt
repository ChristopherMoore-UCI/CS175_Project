Marco Reus gave Dortmund the lead going into the break before a sweeping strike from Robert Lewandowski and a late Arjen Robben penalty swung the match in Bayern's favour. -- It may not have had the table topping tension of recent Der Klassiker clashes but the old quality certainly remained as Bayern Munich overcame Borussia Dortmund in a pulsating match at the Allianz Arena Saturday. The speedy Pierre Emerick Aubameyang was denied by Bayern keeper Manuel Neuer just after the half hour mark when put through by Shinji Kagawa -- but Dortmund didn't have to wait long to make the breakthrough. The ex-Dortmund man was the first to react to a loose ball that broke against Dortmund defender Neven Subotic and he fired low beyond the diving Weidenfeller who had yet to fully set himself. Henrikh Mkhitaryan then cracked a post for Dortmund shortly after before a spectacular scissors kick from Thomas Muller was dealt with by Weidenfeller.
