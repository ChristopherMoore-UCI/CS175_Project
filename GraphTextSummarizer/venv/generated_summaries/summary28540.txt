Saari died Tuesday afternoon from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head at Tampere University Hospital, said medical director Matti Lehto. Finnish police had interviewed and released Saari a day before Tuesday's bloody rampage at a college in Kauhajoki in southwestern Finland, the country's interior minister said Tuesday. Saari did not directly threaten anyone in the videos, so there were no grounds for further action, national police Commissioner Mikko Paatero told YLE. The gunman -- identified by authorities as Matti Juhani Saari -- also died after turning the gun on himself. " MTV-3's Foreign Editor Risto Puolimatka told CNN that Saari was issued with a temporary gun license last month.
