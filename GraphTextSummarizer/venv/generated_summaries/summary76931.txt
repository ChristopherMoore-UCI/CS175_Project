The case, King v. Burwell, places at issue whether federal subsidies for purchasing health insurance can be made available to qualified individuals purchasing coverage in states lacking their own marketplaces, or exchanges. "We may have that vote," McConnell said of repealing President Barack Obama's signature health care law on Fox News Thursday. In his re-election pitch, the likely incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell vowed to repeal Obamacare, saying the law should be pulled out "root and branch." Instead, McConnell suggested that an upcoming Supreme Court ruling may be the best way to undermine the law to the point of collapse. Asked in the interview what would happen if the Supreme Court rules against allowing the subsidies, McConnell replied, "I think it's on its way to collapse, yeah."
