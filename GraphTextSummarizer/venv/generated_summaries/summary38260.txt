Twenty seven mansions survived the turbulent years of revolution and now make up the heart of Anren old town, mostly in the form of hotels or restaurants. Due to a lack of industry, Anren would likely have remained a backwater but for local landlord Liu Wencai, whose legacy has driven the town's rebirth as an historic destination. A decade ago, Anren was like many other ancient towns dotted around the country -- rich in history but largely forgotten. At the far end of a long driveway lies a colossal complex and one single word that has come to define Anren: museums. Liu Family Old Manor is the house where Wencai Liu lived with his close relatives.
