"Our focus on building out a mobile-only experience is a unique path that we've chosen for many reasons, the most important of which is that Instagram, at its core, is about seeing and taking photos on-the-go," said co-founder Kevin Systrom in a blog post announcing the feature. The photos shared on the app are meant to be taken with the built-in cameras on mobile devices and their low resolution a perfect match for Instagram's grainy film filters. Login at Instagram.com and you'll get a replica of your Instagram home screen with photos from everyone you follow unfurling as you scroll down the browser window. Unfortunately, the web version is still missing the most important Instagram feature: the ability to upload photos. First you could view a page for individual photos from any browser, and in November it added profile pages that displayed all of a user's images.
