"The theory is now that we're dealing with one serial killer," Suffolk County Police Commissioner Richard Dormer told CNN affiliate WABC on Tuesday. Dormer previously said that only the bodies of four females uncovered in December were thought to be the work of a serial killer or killers. Suffolk County District Attorney Thomas Spota said in May that the newly found remains were not believed to be connected to the first four victims. The reward for information leading to an arrest -- once topping out at $5,000 -- was raised five-fold, making it the largest offered in Suffolk County history. Authorities at the time said the evidence suggested two other killers dumped bodies along Ocean Parkway in Gilgo Beach, about 40 miles east of New York City.
