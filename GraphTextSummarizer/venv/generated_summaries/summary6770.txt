"Andrés Escobar - always in our hearts," wrote Colombia's most capped international and Escobar's former teammate -- Carlos Valderrama on Twitter. He also had a spell at Young Boys in Switzerland but it was in his native Colombia he is remembered most fondly, and afforded the nickname "El Caballero del Fútbol" which translates as "The gentlemen of football. But that glamor tie against hosts Brazil also comes 20 years after perhaps Colombian football's darkest hour -- the murder of former national team player Andres Escobar.

This vivacious side has also energized Colombia, the public hoping this verve and swagger can help chart a new path for a country that has for so long been synonymous with drugs and violence.
