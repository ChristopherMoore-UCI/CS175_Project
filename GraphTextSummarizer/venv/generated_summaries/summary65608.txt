It was still producing lots of rain and creating dangerous surf conditions, including rip currents, along the coast from northeastern Florida to North Carolina, the hurricane center said. It brought more than 5 inches or rain to Palm Coast, Florida, just south of Jacksonville, according to the local National Weather Service Forecast Office. -- After ruining Memorial Day plans along the Florida and Georgia coasts, the remnants of Tropical Storm Beryl are forecast to bring more rain to the Carolinas. Beryl's maximum sustained winds Monday evening were near 30 mph, down 5 mph from Monday morning, and the hurricane center said there will be little change in strength over the coming days. Beryl cut short weekend plans for hundreds of campers and day-trippers to Georgia's Cumberland Island National Seashore as they were ordered to leave ahead of the storm, the National Park Service said.
