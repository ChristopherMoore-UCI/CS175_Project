A grand jury indicted Andrea Sneiderman on murder, racketeering, perjury and other charges Thursday morning, DeKalb County, Georgia, District Attorney Robert James announced. Georgia man gets life in day care murder "Neuman and Andrea Sneiderman conspired together to murder Rusty Sneiderman so that they could enjoy a life together, eliminate Neuman's debt problems and fully benefit from the assets the Sneidermans had acquired, as well as the proceeds of Rusty Sneiderman's life insurance policies," the indictment states. According to the indictment, she and her then-boss, Hemy Neuman, had been having an affair for about seven months before husband Rusty Sneiderman was killed in November 2010. Neuman's lawyers argued that Sneiderman had "manipulated" him into killing her husband, and said Thursday's indictment could boost his chances of a successful appeal. Her attorneys accused James of turning the arrest into a "media circus," saying they had already offered to surrender Sneiderman if charges were brought.
