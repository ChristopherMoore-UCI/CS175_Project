Through her Bumi Sehat health clinics, Lim offers free prenatal care, birthing services and medical aid in Indonesia, where many families cannot afford care. At the tribute show, hosted by Anderson Cooper in Los Angeles, one of the top 10 will be named CNN Hero of the Year and receive an additional $250,000 to continue their work. This is the sixth year CNN has conducted its annual search for CNN Heroes. They will be honored at "CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute," a globally broadcast event that airs live December 2 at 9 p.m. ET/6 p.m. In those years, the campaign has profiled more than 180 people on CNN and CNN.com.
