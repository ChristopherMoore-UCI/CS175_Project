And as the FDA panel prepared to meet, a Senate committee added to the controversy by releasing documents its leaders said show Glaxo "failed to publish studies that found serious health risks associated with Avandia in a timely manner and actively promoted the drug despite the known safety concerns." In February, the same committee released a report criticizing the FDA's handling of Avandia and saying the FDA has been "too cozy" with drug makers. -- A prominent Food and Drug Administration researcher sharply criticized a safety study by the manufacturer of the diabetes drug Avandia on Tuesday as an FDA panel weighed whether to yank the drug from the market. Glaxo says several trials have shown Avandia is safe, but its usage has fallen sharply since a 2007 study that linked ito the an increased risk of heart attacks and other related problems. Patients trust drug companies with their health and their lives and GlaxoSmithKline abused that trust," Montana Sen. Max Baucus, the committee's chairman, said in a statement accompanying the documents.
