Excell White, who killed four people in 1974 and wasn't executed until 1999, spent more time -- 8,854 days -- on death row before being put to death than any other Texas convict. The Dallas County medical examiner's office said it would take six to 12 weeks before Chambers' cause of death could be definitively determined. Guards found Chambers, 55, unresponsive around 6:30 a.m. while doing their rounds, Dallas County Sheriff Spokeswoman Kim Leach said. -- Nearly 35 years after a Texas judge sentenced him to death, Ronald Chambers was found dead Monday morning on the floor of his cell. But Leach said Chambers had many health complications when he came last year to the Dallas County jail.
