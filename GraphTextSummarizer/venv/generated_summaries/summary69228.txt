The outbreaks reported and investigated by the CDC infected at least 3 percent of the people aboard cruise ships carrying at least 100 passengers on cruises lasting between three days and three weeks. Norovirus is a common cause of viral gastrointestinal illness outbreaks on cruise ships, the CDC says. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia, said the outbreak was the result of norovirus, which can spread from contact with contaminated food or drink, by touching objects infected by people who are already sick, or through close contact with people who are infected, the agency says. So far this year, three such outbreaks have occurred on cruise ships that docked at U.S. ports, according to the CDC. The Mercury left Charleston last week for the eastern Caribbean.
