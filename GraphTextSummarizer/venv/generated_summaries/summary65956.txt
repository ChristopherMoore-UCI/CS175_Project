"We've not spoken with Ms. al-Obeidy since she left Qatar, but we have been in contact with senior officials in the Transitional National Council in Benghazi, and we've made clear U.S. interests in her case," State Department spokesman Mark Toner said in reference to the rebel government in control of eastern Libya. "All eyes are now on the authorities in eastern Libya, who should allow al-Obeidy to leave the country. UNHCR was present at the hotel where Ms. al-Obeidy was staying in Qatar, ready to accompany her to the airport to travel to an emergency transit center in Romania. The United States is "disappointed" by the expulsion by Qatar of Eman al-Obeidy to Libya, a decision that it said is a "breach of humanitarian norms. The U.S. criticism comes on the heels of reports that al-Obeidy was beaten in Qatar before being deported back to Libya.
