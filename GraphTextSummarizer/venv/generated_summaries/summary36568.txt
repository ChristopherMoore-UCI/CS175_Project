Authorities responded to a 6:35 a.m. call that three people had been swept into the water at the breakwater, a popular gathering spot for fishing and taking pictures, said Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman Brian Humphrey. The 36-year-old victim, whose name was not released, was one of several people who jumped into the waters near the Cabrillo Beach breakwater after the teen and a 49-year-old man were swept into the ocean, Los Angeles Port Police Lt. San Pedro is about 25 miles south of Los Angeles. The 36-year-old victim had no pulse and was not breathing when fire department divers pulled him from the water, Humphrey said. Rescuers performed CPR as they transported him to Providence Little Company of Mary Medical Center, where he was later pronounced dead.
