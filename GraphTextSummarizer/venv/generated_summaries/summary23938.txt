President Barack Obama announced Friday that 24 Army veterans would receive the Medal of Honor -- the nation's highest military award, bestowed on U.S. troops who show "gallantry above and beyond the call of duty " -- for their combat actions in Vietnam, Korea and during World War II. Many of their fellow soldiers received this medal long ago, for doing similar things in similar places at similar times. In 2002, Congress -- as part of the Defense Authorization Act -- set up a review of Jewish and Hispanic veterans who served in combat since the middle of the century "to ensure those deserving the Medal Of Honor were not denied because of prejudice," explained the White House. In 1969, the Army Green Beret got hit multiple times by bullets during combat. The radio-telephone operator was caring for wounded colleagues in 1969 in Vietnam when his position came under attack.
