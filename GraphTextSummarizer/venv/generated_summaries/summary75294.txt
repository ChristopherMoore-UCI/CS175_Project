Norsigian: I would say that we can all make more intelligent decisions about personal health and medical care as well as the policies we want to see in our communities. That's one of things about this book: It's probably the most trustworthy source about women and health out there. Norsigian: There were three things that kept hitting us between the eyes: sexism, paternalism, condescension -- things that really interfered with getting good health and medical care. If you don't deal with things like education and housing, access to health care, these are critical issues that ultimately have a profound impact on women's health and well-being. I was acutely aware of the lack of good information out there for women of all ages, so I was very excited about being a part of this effort.
