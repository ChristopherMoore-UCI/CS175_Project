According to the Post, government documents and interviews reveal that senior White House aides — including Kathryn Ruemmler, who was then serving as White House counsel — were given information by the Secret Service at the time suggesting that the scandal extended to a member of the advance team who was in Cartagena at the behest of the White House. Each time, the White House counsel and other White House aides conducted an interview with Dach and concluded that he had done nothing wrong. White House spokesman Eric Schultz insisted, "Of course there was no White House interference with an IG (inspector general) investigation." And yet, despite the hijinks in Cartagena, it seems what happened next in Washington, on the part of White House officials, was the real dereliction of duty. Besides having to shore up lapses in White House security and recovering from the resignation of its former director, Julia Pierson, the Secret Service now has to contend with more fallout from a story that seemed to be over and done with.
