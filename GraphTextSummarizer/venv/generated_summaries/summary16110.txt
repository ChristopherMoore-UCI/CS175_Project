They'll be combing CERN's servers for data preserved from that time. The European Organization for Nuclear Research, known as CERN, is celebrating the 20th anniversary of the date it released, for free, the technology and software needed to run a Web server. CERN's team aims to change that, restoring the earliest versions of files that were on the site as well as making it a home for stories about those formative days. That computer is still at CERN's headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland. "There is no sector of society that has not been transformed by the invention, in a physics laboratory, of the Web," said Rolf Heuer, CERN's director-general.
