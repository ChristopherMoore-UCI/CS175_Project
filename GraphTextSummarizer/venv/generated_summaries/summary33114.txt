Iran's President Hassan Rouhani -- who replaced the country's controversial previous president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, last year -- will be at Davos and is due to speak on the subject of "Iran in the World." -- Business leaders, heads of government, entrepreneurs and even the odd celebrity will be rubbing fur and down-quilted shoulders at Europe's highest altitude town, Davos, for the World Economic Forum's annual meeting this week.
