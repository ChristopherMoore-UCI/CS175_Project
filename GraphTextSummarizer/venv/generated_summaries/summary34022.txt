Cesc Fabregas rattled the crossbar with a first half free kick and Theo Walcott hit the woodwork after the break, but a miserable afternoon for the Gunners was complete when Laurent Koscielny was sent off in added time. Hodgson, who was under pressure before his side's improvement since New England Sports Ventures took control of the club, was delighted to see Torres back to his best. You can't have success if you don't have front players who do a good job for you," he told Sky Sports. Chelsea manager Carlo Ancelotti introduced striker Didier Drogba, who had an overnight illness, after the break and it sparked an improvement by his side after a lifeless first half. The first came after 11 minutes as he instantly controlled a Dirk Kuyt through ball before beating Petr Cech with a low shot.
