The Wilkins Ice Shelf -- a large mass of floating ice -- would still be connected to Latady Island, which is also part of the peninsula, and Alexander Island, which is not, said professor David Vaughan, a glaciologist at the British Antarctic Survey. Further rifts developed in October and November, said Angelika Humbert of the Institute of Geophysics at Germany's Muenster University. Along the coast, the ice gradually floats on the sea, forming massive ledges known as ice shelves, the ESA says. The ice shelf experienced a great amount of changes last year, the ESA said. That meant the "bridge" of ice connecting Wilkins to the islands was just 984 yards wide at its narrowest location, the ESA said.
