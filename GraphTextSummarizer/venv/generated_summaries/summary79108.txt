-- The last South Korean employees left Mount Kumgang resort in North Korea Tuesday morning as the struggle over the scenic mountain facility continued. The Unification Ministry issued a statement saying, "We cannot accept North Korea's unilateral announcement of freezing South Korean assets in Mount Kumgang. But Seoul suspended South Korean tours to the facility after the 2008 shooting of a South Korean tourist by a North Korean soldier when the woman allegedly walked into an off-limits area. North Korea said Monday it would seize the South Korean properties that it said had been abandoned by Seoul and gave the remaining South Korean employees 72 hours to leave. We demand the situation be restored immediately." South Korea says it wants security assurances from the North before allowing South Koreans tour groups to return to the resort.
