-- China is continuing to speak out against a multibillion-dollar U.S. arms sale to Taiwan, with the Chinese foreign minister telling U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton Monday that the Obama administration should reconsider the deal. Clinton also told Yang that the United States supports improved relations between mainland China and Taiwan. Taiwan began as the remnant of the government that ruled over mainland China, until a Communist uprising proved victorious in 1949. Beijing broke off military contacts with Washington last year to protest another arms sale to Taiwan. The $5.3 billion arms package includes upgrades to Taiwan's F-16 fighter fleet, a five-year extension of F-16 pilot training at Luke Air Force Base in Arizona and spare parts for the upkeep of three different planes currently in use by the Taiwanese, according to the State Department.
