Boehner has insisted that any extensions of tax cuts or other programs be paid for, and he outlined a list of spending cuts over 10 years to offset the impact on the deficit, according to House Republican aides. "Keep your word to the American people and don't raise taxes on them right now," Obama said, arguing that extending the lower payroll tax rate enacted last year would help the nation's economic recovery. In a statement to reporters at the White House, Obama said failure to act would mean almost 160 million people would pay higher taxes next year, violating a pledge by Republican legislators against raising taxes. Senate Democrats on Monday offered a new proposal to extend the payroll tax cut before it expires at the end of the year, and President Barack Obama quickly urged Congress to help middle-class Americans by passing it. Boehner's comment broke from conservative GOP orthodoxy that contends the payroll tax cut enacted last year had failed to benefit the sluggish economic recovery.
