-- Opposition groups in Cameroon are planning "Egypt-like" protests Wednesday to call for the president's ouster after almost three decades in power. Walla said the nation has been inspired by the recent uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt that led to the ouster of their longtime rulers. "We want to take charge of our destiny like the people in Egypt and Tunisia did," Walla said. He's been in place for 28 years," said Kah Walla, 45, an opposition member who is also running for president. Walla said they chose the date because it is "symbolic of the ongoing fight" in the west African nation.
