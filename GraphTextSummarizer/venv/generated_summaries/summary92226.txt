Carter said there were no apparent patterns in election procedures that "favored a particular candidate." Mubarak led the North African nation for 30 years before being forced out last year amid a popular outcry that marked one of the seminal developments of the Arab Spring. Anti-Shafik protests were also reported in Alexandria and other cities, and revolutionary leaders said they would hold more on Tuesday outside Egypt's High Court of Justice. -- Demonstrators angry that ousted strongman Hosni Mubarak's former premier will face off against a representative of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt's presidential runoff have called for more protests Tuesday. On Monday, several thousand protesters in Tahrir Square called on Egyptian courts to disqualify former Prime Minister Ahmed Shafik, chanting, "Where is the revolution?" Others ransacked Shafik's campaign headquarters and set it ablaze after learning that he was one of the two candidates who made it through the first round of voting. In Tahrir Square, the epicenter of the 2011 revolt, the crowd carried Khaled Ali -- a presidential candidate who failed to make the runoff -- on their shoulders while demanding an end to the military government that followed Mubarak.
