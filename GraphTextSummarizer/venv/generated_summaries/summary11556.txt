The one-term governor is polling neck-and-neck in his re-election battle against Republican nominee Tom Foley, a former U.S. ambassador to Ireland who lost to Malloy by only 6,400 votes in 2010. "If they come out to vote, turn out in full force, Gov. Malloy's confident he's going to win this campaign." Connecticut is a reliably blue state, but not totally averse to GOP governors -- Malloy himself succeeded two Republicans when he took office. Obama reiterated that theme in Connecticut earlier Sunday at a rally for Gov. Dannel Malloy. Despite these poll numbers, Connecticut Democratic Party spokesman Ian Sams said Sunday he believes a heavy emphasis on voter turnout will bring Malloy a win on Tuesday. "I think with President Obama coming here today, we're going to see a lot of interest from base Democratic voters," Sims told CNN.
