The onetime vocalist -- who "worked in a bank and sang in a Baptist church and a Jewish temple to pay for rent, food, and voice lessons," according to his biography on the Country Music Hall of Fame's website -- eventually worked under Arturo Toscanini, produced recordings by Julie Andrews, oversaw a variety of labels and helped make hits of songs by Barbara Mandrell, Freddy Fender, the Oak Ridge Boys, Merle Haggard and Reba McEntire. -- Jim Foglesong, a famed Nashville music executive and producer who played a key role in launching the careers of such notables as Garth Brooks, George Strait and Suzy Bogguss, has died. His death on Tuesday morning was confirmed by a statement from Vanderbilt University's Blair School of Music, where Foglesong taught for more than 20 years. A statement from the Blair School notes that his "Business of Music" course, a weekly three-hour seminar, was one of the school's most popular offerings. Foglesong chaired the boards of directors of the Country Music Association and the Country Music Foundation, and was active in a variety of other local organizations.
