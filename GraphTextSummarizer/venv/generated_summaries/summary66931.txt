Very little unless you're Kumar Mangalam Birla, industrialist and CEO of Aditya Birla Group, the India conglomerate with companies that produce the metal for car manufacturers and the insurance for those who will drive them, as well as a raft of other commodities, products and services. I was only 28, limited experience but a lot of exposure, high quality exposure, to the world of business. Apart from a family tradition of being business-minded, Birla has continued the legacy of largesse as Aditya Birla give 3% of its net profits to charity. While he continued family traditions in the company, Birla has displayed a keen eye when it comes to acquisitions, overseeing the purchase of 20 companies across the world, boosting revenues and, he hopes, India's image as an emerging business heavyweight abroad. At 43, Birla is one of India's richest men, inheriting control of the company in 1995 that was founded by his father, and has increased the overall turnover from $2 billion to $29 billion by 2010.
