-- A New York woman is facing multiple fraud and larceny charges for allegedly pretending she had terminal cancer to get thousands of dollars from sympathetic donors to pay for an over-the-top wedding and honeymoon, according to a court statement released Tuesday. "By pretending to have a terminal illness, Vega inexcusably took advantage of the community's hearts and minds, and profited off of their generosity," said Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman. It is not clear how much money the alleged scheme netted, but it is believed to be in the thousands of dollars, said Attorney General's Office spokeswoman Jennifer Givner. Jessica Vega, 25, who was arrested last week in Virginia and later brought to New York, has been indicted on fraud and grand larceny charges and one misdemeanor in the alleged ruse. Vega is suspected of fabricating the tale to con sympathizers into buying her gifts and giving her money, according to a statement from the New York Attorney General's Office.
