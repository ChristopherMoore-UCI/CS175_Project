Both Kremer and Meckler are confident that, despite heavy-handed criticism of both frontrunners, the tea party movement will mobilize behind any candidate that is the nominee and prioritize Obama's defeat over tea party ideals. Meckler described Bachmann and Paul as having long-term records that are "consistent" with tea party values, but cautioned that the tea party caucus founded by Bachmann was assembled with the understanding that "they didn't speak for us, they didn't have any influence over us," and "they don't represent us." "The other interesting candidate out there is Newt Gingrich because (he) has been involved in the tea party movement from the very beginning," she said, crediting his organization American Solutions as being one of the original sponsoring organizations of the 2009 Tax Day Tea Party and his staff members with reaching out to work with tea party groups across the country. Galen noted 2010 U.S. Senate losses of tea party backed candidates O'Donnell in Delaware and Sharron Angle in Nevada as lessons for the movement that prove endorsements may be too risky to gamble. "What we're looking for is for all candidates to try their best to articulate and reflect tea party values, and I think that we've been very successful in pushing the debate so that they're all required to do so," Meckler said.
