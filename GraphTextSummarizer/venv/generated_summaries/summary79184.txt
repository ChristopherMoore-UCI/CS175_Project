During his six-hour visit, Obama will meet with Myanmar's President Thein Sein, whose reform drive has seen the release of hundreds of political prisoners and steps to open up the country's economy. Speaking Sunday alongside Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra, Obama emphasized that the United States is "a Pacific nation," and that events in the Pacific "will shape so much of our security and prosperity" in the future. "This is an acknowledgment that there is a process under way inside that country that even a year and a half, two years ago, nobody foresaw," Obama told reporters in Thailand on Sunday, the first stop on his Asia trip. As well as meeting Thein Sein and Suu Kyi, Obama will deliver a speech at the University of Yangon before departing for Cambodia on Monday afternoon, where he will attend the East Asia Summit. On the eve of his Myanmar trip, Obama insisted that the visit was "not an endorsement of the Burmese government."
