" Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina; and Claire McCaskill, D-Missouri, also previously expressed concerns about the military lumping all sexual assault and sexual harassment cases under the category of unwanted sexual contact, rather than breaking out the more severe crimes of rape, sodomy and assault. The military has been hit hard over the issue of sexual assault among its ranks, with the Defense Department reporting an estimated 26,000 cases of unwanted sexual contact, ranging from rape to groping, in 2012. " A handful of recent high-profile incidents have brought this issue to the forefront: -- An Army sergeant first class assigned to the sexual assault prevention unit at Fort Hood, Texas, is being investigated for alleged sexual assault, pandering, abusive sexual contact and maltreatment of subordinates. Referring to media reports that there is only one way to report sexual assault, the Michigan Democrat asked each of the military heads at a hearing if there currently are multiple options in addition to notifying a unit commander. Sen. James Inhofe, the top Republican member of the Armed Services Committee, earlier called sexual assault in the military "an enemy to morale and readiness" and urged his colleagues to tread carefully in tackling the issue.
