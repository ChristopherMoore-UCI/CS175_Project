But the revelation Tuesday that the Cowboys own part of a company that won a Port Authority of New York and New Jersey contract, which was endorsed by Christie and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, raised questions about a possible quid-pro-quo. On Wednesday, the co-chairman of the New Jersey legislative panel investigating the Bridgegate scandal told CNN that he is considering an inquiry into whether it was appropriate for the governor to accept free tickets from Cowboys owner Jerry Jones after a company the team has a stake in was awarded a contract supported by Christie. Woodhouse filed a complaint with the New Jersey State Ethics Commission and the governor's Advisory Ethics Panel this week, arguing that "Christie's acceptance of gifts from Mr. Jones ... appears to violate at least two separate provisions of New Jersey's Conflicts of Interest Law, the New Jersey Uniform Ethics Code, and the Governor's Code of Conduct. Former Republican state Sen. Bill Schluter, who served on the State Ethics Commission, said Christie was offered the tickets because of his position as governor, which "just doesn't pass the smell test. Christie, a lifelong Cowboys fan, said through a spokesman that Jones paid for the ticket and transportation to the game.
