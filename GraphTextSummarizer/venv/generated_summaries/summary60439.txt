-- People in poorer countries send text messages more often than those in wealthier countries. In Spain, 29% of male cell phone owners use their devices to access the Internet, compared to 13% of female phone owners. Two notable exceptions were Egypt, where 28% of respondents now use social networks -- up from 18% last year -- and Russia, where social-networking use rose from 33% to 43%. The survey by the Pew Research Center's Global Attitudes Project found that text messaging is now a widespread global phenomenon: In the countries polled, 75% of cell phone owners say they text. Social networking is generally more common in wealthier nations, largely driven by the fact that they have higher rates of Internet access.
