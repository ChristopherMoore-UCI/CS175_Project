In China, the birth ratio of girls to boys is the most skewed in the world -- approximately 100 girls born for every 118 boys. All too often, women in these cultures do not "choose" their daughters for abortion. But what about gendercide -- the practice of killing baby girls, whether aborted or neglected after birth? Indian girls, moreover, die of disease and neglect at a much higher rate than boys. That one-third of the world's women -- those living in China and India -- are deprived of their right to bear girls is the biggest women's rights abuse on earth.
