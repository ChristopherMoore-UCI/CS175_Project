See our photo gallery of Formula One's greatest drivers Â» As much as Stewart admires seven-time champion Michael Schumacher, he's finds it hard to put the German in the same league as Fangio or Clark. Though Fangio was the greatest, Stewart rated fellow countryman Jim Clark as the best driver he raced against. What's more, as Stewart points out, Fangio didn't start racing in Formula One until he was 39-years-old, and whether driving a Ferrari, Lancia, Maserati or Mercedes, he kept on winning races. Stewart, who retired from Formula One in 1973, is a great admirer of the current crop of drivers and he singled out Lewis Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel as potential legends of the future. It's this win to race ratio that really separates the good from the great Stewart believes.
