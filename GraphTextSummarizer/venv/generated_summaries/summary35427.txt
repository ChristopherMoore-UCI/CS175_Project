But even when all these new coaches are rolling, commuter trains will have to carry 1.5 times their capacity at peak hours. Even after a $2 billion upgrade, Mumbai's trains will still have to carry 1.5 times their capacity at peak hours. At peak hours more than 550 people cram into a carriage built for 200. Trains -- plastered with adverts for items like toothpaste, underwear and condoms -- run every five to seven minutes, but delays are common, leading edgy commuters to hit out at the slightest provocation. On average, 4,000 people die a year on Mumbai's railways, crushed under trains, electrocuted by overhead power lines or killed as they lean from jam-packed carriages to gasp for air.
