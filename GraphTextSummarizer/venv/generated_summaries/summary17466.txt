Obama has dealt gingerly with racial issues since he burst onto the national political scene in 2004 as a state senator from Illinois who delivered a galvanizing speech at that year's Democratic National Convention. For five years after Obama's seminal speech on race in Philadelphia, he tried to avoid racial issues but stumbled over the controversial case of Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates, Jr. who was arrested in his own home in 2009. Obama was deeply affected by a private meeting he held last year with a group of young black boys about a mile from his home in Hyde Park, Chicago. President Barack Obama -- who once famously declared "there is not a black America and a white America" -- is again feeling his way through a volatile debate over race that offers fresh evidence of the nation's enduring divisions. Instead, Obama pledged to lead a national conversation on race and address the deep rooted belief in many communities of color "that our laws are not always being enforced uniformly."
