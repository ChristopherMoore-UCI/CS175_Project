-- Fabio Cannavaro is to join the Italian national squad on Sunday for their World Cup qualifier against Cyprus next week, despite being under the cloud of a drug test controversy. Fabioo Cannavaro's proudest moment came in 2006 when he led Italy to World Cup glory. " Cannavaro will not travel to Dublin for Saturday's World Cup qualifier against Ireland as he serves a one-match ban, but is expected to lead the Azzurri in Wednesday's qualifier against Cyprus in Parma. "When he came to the national team, after the Roma game, he told us what had happened and he told us that without the medicine that contained cortisone he would have had a reaction, an anaphylactic shock," Castellacci said. The player requested an exemption from taking drugs tests on the grounds of having taken a medication in an emergency situation but his request did not include a document necessary to complete the application.
