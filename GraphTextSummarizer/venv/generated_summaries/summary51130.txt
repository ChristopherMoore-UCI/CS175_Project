-- A joint session of Pakistan's parliament will meet Tuesday to discuss new terms of engagement with the United States, a spokesman for the country's prime minister told CNN on Saturday. Amid huge domestic and military pressure after NATO airstrikes on the Pakistani-Afghan border killed 24 Pakistani soldiers last November, Pakistani Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani created the Parliamentary Committee on National Security, a group of 18 members of parliament responsible for reviewing relations with the United States. President Asif Ali Zardari, in an address to parliament Saturday, described 2011 as a "challenging year" in the "multi-dimensional and important" relationship between his country and the United States. " Rizvi expects that the recommendations -- which won't be made public until Tuesday -- will be approved, but not before several days of debate. The parliament will debate the recommendations of a special commission and will vote whether to accept them or not, spokesman Akram Shaheedi said.
