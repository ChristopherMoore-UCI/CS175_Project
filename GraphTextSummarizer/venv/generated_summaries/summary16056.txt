But Lu says that China's record of media control at home signals that Beijing will still have a say on what is being broadcast by CCTV Africa. Mark Masaai, the Kenyan anchor of CCTV's flagship show "Africa Live," says the mission of his program is to change the narrative about Africa. But analysts say that CCTV's expansion in Africa is a way for Beijing to change the narrative of China's involvement in Africa from one of exploitation to one of opportunity -- China's deepening engagement with Africa is often portrayed as pillaging the resource-rich continent, giving very little in return. Over the last decade, China, Africa's largest trade partner, has quietly invested significant sums in building communications infrastructure across Africa, providing technical upgrades for state broadcasters and training journalists from across the continent. And now, China's media strategy in Africa has taken a step further by providing customer-oriented news offerings and poaching some of the best journalistic talents to bring African news to the continent and to the world.
