Atlanta police spokesman Carlos Campos told CNN on Friday that authorities want to speak again with Robert Kirk, a St. Louis resident who earlier told police that he had stayed with English between December 24 and 26 in her residence in the Buckhead section of Atlanta. In an interview with police on New Year's Eve, Strothers said that her friend "appeared upset" and told her "she felt as if someone was attempting to hurt her." "She also stated that Ms. English was acting out of character, and began discussing the end of the world and quoting biblical scriptures," said the police report. On Friday, search-and-rescue dogs joined mounted Atlanta police officers to comb part of south Atlanta, near the Aarons Amphitheatre at Lakewood, which sits in a fairground area, according to a police statement. "Investigators continue to pursue leads and work the case." Earlier, English's mother and stepfather told police that they typically talked with her "several times a week" and became worried after she did not answer their calls since they last talked with her on Christmas. According to a police report, Kirk previously told investigators that English was "acting peculiar and out of character" during his stay, adding that "she began screaming in the apartment and shouting biblical scriptures and indicating that the world was coming to an end."
