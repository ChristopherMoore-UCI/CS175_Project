And after Fallon settles in at "Tonight," another "Saturday Night Live" star, Seth Meyers, will take over hosting duties for "Late Night." NBC has confirmed that Fallon will have a seat on Leno's "Tonight Show" couch on February 3, which will kickoff Leno's final week. In less than a month, Jay Leno will pass the "Tonight Show" torch to Jimmy Fallon. His debut will be on February 24 with former "SNL" alum and "Parks and Recreation" star Amy Poehler as his first guest.
