Carter says he believes Moriarty put him in the Hawaiian orphanage and told authorities his name was Tenzin Amea. His biological father, Mark Barnes, reported him missing more than three decades ago after his mother, Charlotte Moriarty, took him for a walk and didn't return. Thousands of children under the age of 18 go missing each year, the center for missing children reported. And yet authorities say stories like Carter's and White's are rare. Barnes, who now lives in California with his two daughters, was not immediately available for comment, and Moriarty's whereabouts are unknown.
