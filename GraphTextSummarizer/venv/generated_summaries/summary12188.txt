Meet Margarita Louis-Dreyfus, the chairperson of French commodities giant Louis Dreyfus Holdings, with a net worth estimated at an eye-watering $6 billion according to Forbes. I'm telling you this because many people expected that I suffered from hunger. For example in Israel, the youth orchestra includes Arabic children together with Jewish children who are learning through music how to love together. Because all of these men, they have big egos and I was kind of there to absorb these egos, give them the feeling of respecting their opinion -- even if you don't take it. Later when I came to the man's world of commodities, also with big egos, I was used this experience.
