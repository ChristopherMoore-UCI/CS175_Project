Shinzo Abe, leader of the opposition Liberal Democrat Party (LDP), has said that, if elected, he'll decide within three years whether to restart the nuclear plants that were shut down after an earthquake and tsunami triggered nuclear devastation in March 2011. "We'll regain economic power in Japan," he said. He has promised to phase out nuclear power by 2040, seizing on a popular backlash against the energy source since last year's nuclear disaster. Whether the combined leadership of the LDP and the New Komeito Party is able to introduce policies to contend with Japan's major structural challenges` remains to be seen, Henry said. Earlier this year, he urged residents to donate cash to fund the purchase of the islands Japan calls Senkaku and China refers to as Diaoyu.
