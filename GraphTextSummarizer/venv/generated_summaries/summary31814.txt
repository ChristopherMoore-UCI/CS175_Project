PARIS, France -- Samoa center Brian Lima's World Cup is over after his dangerous tackle on England star Jonny Wilkinson. But World Cup judicial officer Professor Lorne Crerar has upheld the complaint lodged by match citing commissioner Steven Hines. Wilkinson escaped injury and match referee Alan Lewis did not punish Lima during the game, which England won 44-22 to knock Samoa out of the competition. Lima arrives for his hearing regarding his dangerous challenge on England's Jonny Wilkinson. Samoa will head home after the U.S clash, having already seen the current World Cup campaign consigned to being the worst in their history.
