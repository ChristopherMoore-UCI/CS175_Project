The other defendants are Belgian citizens: Hicham Beyayo, Ali El Ghanouti, Yussuf Said Harrizi, Hicham Bouhali Zrioul, Jean Trefois, Abdullazziz Bastin, and Mohammed Bastin. -- A trial for nine terror suspects accused of having ties to al Qaeda opened in a Belgian court Monday, with the main defendant suspected of nearly launching a terror attack just hours before a 2008 European Union summit in Brussels. The Belgian-Moroccan woman was considered an "al Qaeda living legend" upon her arrest on December 11, 2008, as leaders of the European Union's 27 member states arrived in Brussels for the summit. He said he met in Waziristan in northwest Pakistan with at least three members of this group, including Garsallaoui and Zrioul, a Belgian-Moroccan who once worked as a taxi driver in Brussels. He told investigators that about the time he became an al Qaeda member, he came across several Belgian and French militants.
