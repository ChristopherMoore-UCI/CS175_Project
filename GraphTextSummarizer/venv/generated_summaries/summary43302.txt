But Iran has denied the accusation, saying that "Israeli agents are often the perpetrators of such terrorist acts. Allegations that Iran was involved in the attacks "are fabricated and false and are prepared by the U.S. and the Zionist regimes," the official Iranian Islamic Republic News Agency, quoting a spokesman for the Iranian Foreign Ministry, said last month. The Bangkok blasts did not kill anyone, and their intended targets were not clear, although authorities have said they were intended for Israeli diplomats. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has blamed Tehran for the attacks. Indian police are on the lookout for three Iranians they suspect of involvement in last month's bombing of an Israeli Embassy car in New Delhi, a senior investigator said Thursday.
