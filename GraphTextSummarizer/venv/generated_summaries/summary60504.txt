"I think it's easy to see instances of child abuse and child neglect and assume they're pervasive and they characterize all of those working children. "But the risks associated with agriculture are actually a lot more extreme than a lot of shopkeeping-type tasks that you can imagine: children involved in toxic chemicals, children exposed to pests, children operating machinery that's too large for them, isn't designed to be done by them. It was as if they had done this same activity many times." Durón Miranda soon learned that many children in Bariloche dropped out of school to spend their lives as "ragpickers." "I saw children collect green sausages, a bag of potato chip crumbs, a bag of noodles with cream, and recovered leftover yogurt next to a diaper," said Durón Miranda, a Mexican who, at the time, was visiting the country for work. "Usually either their father died or the father is disabled, mom can't work, so these kids are forced into child labor."
