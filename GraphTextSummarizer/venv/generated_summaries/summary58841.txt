Members of ISIS believe that they are the vanguard fighting a religious war, which Allah has determined will be won by the forces of true Islam. The Syrian town of Dabiq is where the Prophet Mohammed is supposed to have predicted that the armies of Islam and "Rome" would meet for the final battle that will precede the end of time and the triumph of true Islam. Last week the seventh issue of Dabiq was released, and a close reading of it helps explains ISIS' world view. " In other words, ISIS wants a Western ground force to invade Syria, as that will confirm the prophecy about Dabiq. The beheading of 21 Egyptian Coptic Christians in Libya by an ISIS affiliate led Egypt's air force on Monday to drop bombs on ISIS positions in eastern Libya.
