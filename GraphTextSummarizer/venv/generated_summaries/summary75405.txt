Bedouin kidnappers want authorities to release a relative who is in detention in Alexandria on drug charges, said Gen. Ahmed Bakr, head of security in the North Sinai. -- Two American tourists and their guide were kidnapped Friday in the Sinai region of Egypt, authorities said. Kidnappings and armed robberies have increased since a popular uprising ousted Egypt's long-ruling dictator, Hosni Mubarak, last year. In February, two American tourists were kidnapped and soon released in the Sinai region. In the most recent incident, Bedouins stopped a tour bus en route to Taba and kidnapped the two tourists -- a man and a woman -- and their guide, Bakr said.
