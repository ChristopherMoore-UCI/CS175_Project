In the Marvel universe, Ultron is a sentient robot that has an incredibly wide range of abilities, coming equipped with super-speed, super-strength, flight, mind control and a coma ray, to name a few. Written and directed by Joss Whedon, "The Avengers: Age of Ultron" will show a more humanized -- but just as fearsome -- villain, Whedon told Entertainment Weekly. In the meantime, Spader will be on the small-screen as well: The three-time Emmy winner stars in NBC's "The Blacklist," which premieres September 23. The next time the Avengers assemble, it'll be to face off with James Spader. Whedon's Ultron won't be quite as versatile, and the filmmaker is imagining a less robotic bad guy.
