So how does a reality dating show with a 9.5 percent success rate reel in about 8 million viewers week after week? Matuscak Gamin, who started watching the reality series last season when contestant Rozlyn Papa was sent home for allegedly having a relationship with one of the show's producers, says she watches "The Bachelorette" not as a dating show but as a comedy. -- Of the 14 "Bachelors" and five "Bachelorettes" who've handed out roses to prospective life partners on ABC's hit reality show, only four couples are still together and only two have actually gotten married.
