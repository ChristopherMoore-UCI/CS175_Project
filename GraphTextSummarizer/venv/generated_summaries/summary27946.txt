Typically such tests from Facebook only affect a small number of users, whereas this change affects all Like buttons. Because it was never made clear to users that the Like button would function differently than the Share button, many never understood what it meant to click Like on a piece of content. Making the result the same as the Share button could build stronger user expectations, ultimately fashioning a better user experience. Though users may now think twice about hitting the button, given how prominently it will appear on their walls and in their networks' newsfeeds, it should ultimately increase traffic to publishers' websites. Previously, only a link to the story would appear in the recent activity, often going unnoticed by users.
