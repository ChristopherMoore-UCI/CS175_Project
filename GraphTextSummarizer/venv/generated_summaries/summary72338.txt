For William, Africa provides an escape that helps with his royal work back home: "Its escaping to a kind of different world where I am just who I normally am anyway, and I can let that side, that sort of slightly immature, silly person come out a bit more than I normally do. Prince William told me Africa first got under his skin during a trip to Kenya when he was 17. " His personal connection with Africa was sealed when he got engaged to Kate Middleton in Kenya in 2010. William says it just happened on that particular holiday: "She understands what it means to me being in Africa, and my love of conservation." -- Dreaming of Africa is one way that Prince William escapes from the stresses he faces as the future king of Britain.
