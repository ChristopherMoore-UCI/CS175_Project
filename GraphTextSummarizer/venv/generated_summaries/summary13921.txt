-- The wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas said Tuesday that she reached out to Anita Hill, whose accusations of sexual harassment almost derailed Thomas' high court nomination 19 years ago. " Hill, who formerly worked for Clarence Thomas, testified at his 1991 Senate confirmation hearing that he used inappropriate sexual language around her. According to a source at Brandeis who spoke on condition of not being identified, the message left over the weekend said: "Good morning, Anita Hill, it's Ginni Thomas. In a statement to CNN, Virginia "Ginni" Thomas said: "I did place a call to Ms. Hill at her office extending an olive branch to her after all these years, in hopes that we could ultimately get past what happened so long ago. Charles Radin, the Brandeis director of news and communications, said Hill received the voicemail message and turned it over to the campus Department of Public Safety, which then turned it over to the FBI.
