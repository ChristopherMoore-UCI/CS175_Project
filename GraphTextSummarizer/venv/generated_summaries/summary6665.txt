Cuban doctors battle to control cholera outbreak Doctors were not certain how cholera was reintroduced to the island, but said that heavy rains that caused outhouses to flood into drinking wells were to blame for the disease's rapid rate of transmission. Cuban health officials said they responded to the outbreak by bringing in clean drinking water, closing down food stands in affected areas and setting up checkpoints on roads to keep people ill with the disease from traveling. -- Cuba's government declared Tuesday that health workers had eradicated a cholera outbreak that infected 417 people and killed three, according to a statement from the country's Health Ministry. According to the Health Ministry statement released Tuesday, 10 days have passed since the last reported case of cholera.
