The bottles were confiscated over a two-year period in and around the Afghan capital, according to Kabul police and criminal investigations chief Mohammad Zahir. -- Thousands of bottles of alcohol were destroyed in Kabul this week, in what authorities described as the product of a crackdown on illegal smuggling and sales. Zahir said that it was in these areas -- mostly international hotels -- that local sellers had come into possession of the alcohol. The illicit items were being stored by Afghan customs officials, who burned the bottles Wednesday after receiving authorization from the city's attorney general's office, he added. Certain areas that cater to foreigners, however, are permitted to sell it.
