In December, Bacani walked into the Foreign Correspondents' Club in Hong Kong where her prints were hanging in 20 x 29 inch frames against a yellow, brick wall. It's easy to see why Bacani gets mistaken for a tourist or just another 20-something visitor on the streets of Hong Kong. Xyza Cruz Bacani has lived in Hong Kong for nine years and still doesn't feel like she belongs. "When I see the girls, I talk to them, I absorb all their emotions and I can't really believe that some people can do that to other human beings," Bacani says. That's how she caught the attention of Filipino documentary photographer Rick Rocamora who introduced her to a community of mentors.
