Chris Christie on possible Ebola lawsuit: 'Whatever' Mukpo, a freelance cameraman who tested positive for Ebola in Liberia and was treated in the United States, said rules like the one in New Jersey treats health care workers "as though they are a problem as opposed to a public asset. -- Ebola survivor Ashoka Mukpo, in his first television interview since returning home from the hospital, told CNN's Don Lemon that he sharply disagrees with Gov. Chris Christie's controversial quarantine policy for health care workers in New Jersey. Critics argued the policy of quarantining health care workers for 21 days is unnecessary and could deter volunteers from going to West Africa to combat the outbreak. "And i just think that it's counterproductive." Chris Christie on Ebola policy: 'We're not moving an inch' Christie, however, has staunchly defended the policy, saying it's only for people who show signs of Ebola and argues the rule is in the public's best interest.
