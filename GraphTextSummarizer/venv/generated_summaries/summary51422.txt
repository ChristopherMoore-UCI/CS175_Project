-- Former New Jersey Nets star Jayson Williams was sentenced to five years in prison Tuesday for the fatal shooting of his limo driver in 2002. The fatal shooting occurred February 14, 2002, in the bedroom of Williams' New Jersey estate. After sentencing, he will be taken to the Central Reception and Assignment Facility in Trenton, New Jersey, said Corrections Department spokeswoman Deirdre Fedkenheuer. "There's not a day I wake up and I don't feel sorry for what I did to Mr. Christofi," Williams said. Williams, who retired in 1999 because of a leg injury, played nine seasons with the Philadelphia 76ers and New Jersey Nets.
