Le Trung, 33, from Toronto in Canada, says Aiko can do the cleaning, mix his favorite drink and read him newspaper headlines. " Aiko actually means "love child" in Japanese but the software engineer denies he has created the robot for sex. "Like a real female she will react to being touched in certain ways," he told Britain's Sun newspaper Thursday. " Creating Aiko has cost Le Trung around $21,000, with much of the money coming from credit cards and the sale of his car. With the support of a sponsor, Trung hopes to spend the next few years perfecting Aiko's software and increasing her range of skills -- including the ability to walk -- but not just for his own amusement.
