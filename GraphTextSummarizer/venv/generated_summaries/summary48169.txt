-- At least 12 people were killed in violent clashes between Yemeni troops and militants secessionists in the southern Yemeni province of Dhaleh on Tuesday, two Defense Ministry officials told CNN. Hadi took office as part of a internationally supported political deal that led to the ouster of former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, who departed a year after mass protests broke out. "Bullets have entered through our home windows," said Saber Jamal, a resident in Dhaleh province. The dialogue was launched one month after President Abdurabu Hadi came to power in 2012. Residents told CNN that artillery shelling started in the morning hours and continued until the evening.
