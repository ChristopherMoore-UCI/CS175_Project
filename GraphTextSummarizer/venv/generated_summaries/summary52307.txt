The military defines unwanted sexual contact as sexual crimes prohibited by military law, from rape to abusive sexual contact. An Army sergeant first class assigned to the sexual assault prevention unit at Fort Hood, Texas, is being investigated for alleged sexual assault, pandering, abusive sexual contact and maltreatment of subordinates. The military has been hit hard over the issue of sexual assault among its ranks, with the Defense Department this month releasing results of a survey that found there were an estimated 26,000 cases of unwanted sexual contact, which ranged from rape to groping, among troops in 2012. -- U.S. military leaders are "angry" and "ashamed" over sexual assaults plaguing the armed forces, President Barack Obama said Thursday after ordering top Pentagon officials to "leave no stone unturned" in the effort to stop the abuse. The president's comments came the same day legislation was introduced in Congress to ease the victims' quest for justice, a move that followed news this month of two high-profile cases involving sexual assault in the military -- allegedly by the very service members tasked with preventing such crimes.
