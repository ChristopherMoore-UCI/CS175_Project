The Rolling Stone article about Caldwell was written by Michael Hastings, the same reporter whose cover story about Gen. Stanley McChrystal cost the then-head of U.S. forces in Afghanistan his job. Lt. Gen. William Caldwell had been accused in the magazine of ordering an Army officer to conduct psychological operations to try to influence congressional members. An IG probe also cleared McChrystal of the wrongdoing alleged in Rolling Stone. -- For the second time in a year, a top U.S. general has been cleared of allegations raised in a Rolling Stone article after an investigation by the Defense Department Inspector General. However, Defense spokeswoman Lt. Col. Elizabeth Robbins said the Inspector General found no evidence to support the article's claims.
