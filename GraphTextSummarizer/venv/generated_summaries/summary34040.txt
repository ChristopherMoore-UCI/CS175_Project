-- A federal judge ordered a mental evaluation for a Texas actress charged with sending ricin-tainted letters to President Barack Obama and New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg last month. Shannon Richardson, 35, was ordered to undergo the evaluation within 30 days, according to court documents filed in U.S. District Court in Texarkana. Nathaniel Richardson filed for divorce last week. New poison letters put ricin under microscope Her husband denied involvement and claimed his wife wanted to end their marriage and leave him, the affidavit said. Richardson, also known as Shannon Rogers and Shannon Guess, initially told the FBI that her husband, Nathaniel, had sent the ricin-laced letters, but a polygraph exam found her to be "deceptive" on the matter, authorities said.
