His compatriots Juan Ignacio Chela and David Nalbandian also went through along with other seeded players in Austrian No. 11 Jurgen Melzer, France's Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and Gilles Simon, Serbia's Viktor Troicki, Russia's Mikhail Youzhny, Germany's Florian Mayer plus Spaniards Fernando Verdasco and Guillermo Garcia-Lopez. "The first rounds here at Wimbledon on Centre Court are never easy," he told the ATP Tour website. Djokovic bounced back to winning ways in his first match since his Paris disappointment, beating unseeded Frenchman Jeremy Chardy 6-4 6-1 6-1 in one hour and 20 minutes on Centre Court after Federer's match. The Serbian, seeking to reach his first Wimbledon final, won 14 of the last 16 games to set up a second-round clash with big-serving South African Kevin Anderson or Ukraine's Illya Marchenko. Former U.S. Open champion Juan Martin del Potro continued his successful comeback this year from long-term injury with a 6-1 6-4 6-3 win over Italy's Flavio Cipolla.
