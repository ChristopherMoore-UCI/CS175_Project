That Sunday, just past 2:30 a.m., an explosion left 65 miners buried who were working inside the Pasta de Conchos mine, in the Mexican state of Coahuila, in northern Mexico. "The question isn't whether Chile could and Mexico couldn't, because the answer that they will give is that it was different because that mine was mineral and this one was coal, and this one had gas and that one didn't. Grupo Mexico says that there was an explosion caused by a ball of gas -- gas that escapes from the earth at the moment of the coal extraction -- and that as a consequence, the temperature in the mine rose to more than 900 degrees Celsius (1,652 degrees Fahrenheit). Only at Pasta de Conchos they are not." One of his sons remains inside Pasta de Conchos.
