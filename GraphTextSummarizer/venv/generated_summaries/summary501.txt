Manchester City have confirmed that absent Brazilian striker Robinho will be back in time for the Premier League side's return to training next week. City manager Mark Hughes told the club's official Web site that Robinho, who cost mega-rich City a British record fee of Â£32.5 million ($45m) when he signed from Real Madrid in August, will be spoken to after not joining the rest of the squad in a Tenerife training camp this week -- choosing instead to fly to Brazil to attend to a family matter. Robinho's decision to fly to Brazil came on the same day that City announced they were pulling out of a world record transfer move for AC Milan star Kaka, a Brazilian team-mate of Robinho. Robinho had a reputation for partying prior to his British-record transfer to Manchester City last August. Robinho is no stranger to controversy and had a reputation as a party-goer prior to his move to Manchester last year.
