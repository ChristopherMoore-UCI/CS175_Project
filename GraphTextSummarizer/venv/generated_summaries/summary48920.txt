"Munch's 'The Scream' is the defining image of modernity, and it is an immense privilege for Sotheby's to be entrusted with one of the most important works of art in private hands," said Sotheby's Senior Vice President Simon Shaw. "For collectors and institutions, the opportunity to acquire such a singularly-influential masterpiece is unprecedented in recent times." Shaw said it is difficult to predict the work's value because of its rare and unique nature, but estimates it could sell for more than $80 million, based on recent sales of other masterpieces. "The Scream," created in 1895 by artist Edvard Munch, will be on display at Sotheby's starting April 27 and then go up for sale May 2. Sotheby's describes it as a "defining image of the Expressionist movement" and "a pivotal work in the history of art. This version of "The Scream" is the only one of four original compositions still in private hands, according to Sotheby's.
