-- A New Jersey school employee is under fire for enlisting an impersonator to fill in for Lady Gaga, who was slated to talk to elementary school students about the dangers of bullying, school officials said. Tenafly Public Schools administrators were alerted of the gaffe by one school-aged Lady Gaga fan who wasn't fooled by a phony autographed photo of the pop star, superintendent Lynn Trager said. According to the letter, the staff member who arranged for Lady Gaga to give an anti-bullying presentation to students via Skype claimed to have a personal relationship with the singer. School officials were tipped off to the incident by a skeptical student who wasn't convinced by the autographed photo of Lady Gaga that was distributed to students during the presentation. "We are all disappointed and surprised," said Trager, who outlined the details of the May 25 stunt in a letter sent to elementary school parents in the district last week.
