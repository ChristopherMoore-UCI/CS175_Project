The incident sparked national outcry, prompted a Justice Department investigation and raised questions about the controversial law. Since its enactment in Florida in 2006, the law has been frequently cited in cases ranging from an incident in which a man sprayed a vehicle carrying a known gang member with 14 bullets to the 2011 case of a man who was cleared under "stand your ground" after stabbing a man in the head with an ice pick during a road rage incident. The body, appointed by Florida Gov. Rick Scott, found that the "majority of Floridians favor an expansive right to self-defense." In the five years before the law's approval, Florida averaged 12 justifiable homicides a year, according to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. -- A Florida task force on Friday recommended that the state's controversial "stand your ground" law not be overturned.
