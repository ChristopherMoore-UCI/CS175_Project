One of the best ways to renew marital affection and interest is to face new challenges together, whether that means learning new skills, braving a white-water rafting trip, or traveling to a new place. Divorces after 40 years are rare, but in 2008, of people who reported divorcing recently, one-quarter had been in marriages that had lasted two decades or more. For a new book on the women of "The Greatest Generation," I interviewed women who were wives and mothers in the 1940s, 1950s, and early 1960s. The rise in divorce rates for older people, which is occurring in Great Britain, Canada and Japan, as well as the United States, results from the confluence of two new trends. The second is that if a marriage ceases to meet their needs, older people have many more alternatives than they used to.
