-- After months of bloodshed that has left the Syrian people on the brink of civil war, more than 1,000 activists gathered outside the White House on Saturday to mark the one-year anniversary of the start of the uprising in Syria. Wearing Syrian headbands and face paint, they clapped and chanted in unison, "We just want to stop the killing, freedom for Syria, God willing!" Khattab, who has met with Secretary of State Hilary Clinton, said the Obama administration hasn't stepped in to help Syria for a number of reasons, including a divided opposition. "What I feel and what I tell them, in fact, if they don't interfere, there will be civil war and there will be a big mess in Syria that will spread to all surrounding countries." "Really what we have to do is, you have to inform other people because people don't know about it," said al-Saghir, who has family living in the battered city of Homs.
