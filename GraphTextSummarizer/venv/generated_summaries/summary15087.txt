In the address before the Economic Club of New York, the fourth in a series of speeches Secretary Clinton is giving on economics and foreign policy, she will say the world's "strategic and economic center of gravity is shifting east" and the United States is focusing more on the Asia-Pacific region. " Clinton will say she is updating U.S. foreign policy priorities to include economics "every step of the way," suggesting the United States should take a cue from the leaders of emerging powers like India and Brazil who put economics at the center of their foreign policies. Economic forces, Clinton will say, are transforming foreign policy realities around the globe. "We need a sophisticated effort to integrate the region's economies, promote investment and assist in economic modernization. Increasingly, the United States is focusing on "tracking and thwarting" the financiers of terrorism, using sanctions and other economic tools to cut repressive regimes off from insurance, banking and shipping, Clinton says.
