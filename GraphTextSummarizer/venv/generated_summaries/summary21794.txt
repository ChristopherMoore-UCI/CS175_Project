Arriving off Interstate 20 onto International Drive -- I mean Washington Road, which leads to Augusta National -- the first thing to catch my eye was the ticket brokers, some with just tents, others with tents set up outside their motorhomes. No backpacks in Augusta National. Augusta National has it nailed too, but at least they don't nail you with the prices. Like Orlando's theme parks, they will get your last dollar at the souvenir stand -- they call it the golf shop at Augusta National -- and a Masters 2012 cap will set you back $24 and a polo shirt $65. My assignment here this week as part of CNN's coverage team marks the first time I've been to the tournament or Augusta National Golf Club.
