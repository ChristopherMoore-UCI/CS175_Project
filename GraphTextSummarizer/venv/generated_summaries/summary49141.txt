Avital Normal Nathman, editor of the motherhood anthology "The Good Mother Myth," said, "We can't fully take care of others, if we're not devoting time to ourselves, especially in a world that prescribes so many roles to women in particular -- worker, mother, wife, daughter, caregiver, homemaker, etc." "Of course moms need to take care of themselves first," said Cecily Kellogg, a mom of a 7-year-old who writes for Babble.com and hosts a blog at Uppercase Woman. As a single mom on a budget, there were plenty of times when she would forgo buying new clothes for herself, and sometimes eat less when food was scarce, so that her kids could be taken care of. That said, Norman Nathman and other mothers across the country said that while Gisele and other women of privilege have the means, which could include a "bevy of help," to ensure their "me time," that is not the case for most women today. But the backlash surrounding her most recent comments about parenting -- how important it is as a mother to take care of yourself -- really got our attention because the issue is a powerful one in today's parenting.
