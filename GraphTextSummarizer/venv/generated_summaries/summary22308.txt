-- A Major League Baseball player was stabbed to death Monday in the Netherlands, police said. Major League Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig issued a statement expressing his condolences to the team. Halman made his Major League debut on September 23, 2010, and went on to play 44 games with the Seattle Mariners, Major League Baseball said. " Halman was a federation member when he played baseball as a teenager for an amateur team in his hometown of Haarlem, just outside Amsterdam, before going to the United States to play, Dorrestijn said. "I only knew Greg for a brief time, but I feel lucky that I had the chance to get to know him," Mariners Manager Eric Wedge said in a statement.
