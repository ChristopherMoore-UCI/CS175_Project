" U.S. officials have not confirmed that Americans are involved in the attack, deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes said Monday. "Both the victims and the perpetrators came from Kenya, the United Kingdom, and the United States," Kenyan Foreign Minister Amina Mohamed told "PBS NewsHour." The group has released videos of some going through training camps, including one in which an American declares it "the real Disneyland," CNN affiliate WCCO reported in August. There's no question Al-Shabaab, the group behind the attack, has recruited young Americans. The United States has been tracking recruited Americans for several years "to try to get the identifying travel information, to ensure that these Americans don't come back into the United States, and if they do, they'll get picked up immediately at our airports," McCaul said.
