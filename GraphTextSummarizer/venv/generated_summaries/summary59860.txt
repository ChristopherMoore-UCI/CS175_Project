Supporters say MacLean brought to public light a TSA action that violated federal law, which mandates that the agency give priority to flights that present high security risks, specifically mentioning "nonstop, long distance flights." The case began in July of 2003, when MacLean, then based in Las Vegas, tipped off an MSNBC reporter the TSA was suspending overnight missions just days after air marshals were briefed about a new "potential plot" to hijack U.S. airliners. MacLean "admittedly knew that he was not permitted to tell anyone about (air marshal) scheduling, yet he did so anyway, and it could have created a significant security risk," the board said. A federal appeals court had earlier decided MacLean's disclosures deserve whistleblower protection. But the Washington-based federal appeals court later reversed, holding MacLean had met the threshold of being eligible for whistleblower protection.
