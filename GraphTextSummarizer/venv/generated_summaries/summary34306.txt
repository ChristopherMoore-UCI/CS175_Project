What we do have is intelligence that there are people with the intent and capability to mount attacks," Abbott said at a press conference in Canberra on Friday. David Irvine said the threat level had been building in Australia over the last year, due to the increasing influence of jihadists fighting for Islamic extremists ISIS in the Middle East who had recruited Australians to fight. Officials believe there are at least 60 Australians fighting with terror group ISIS, and as many as 100 "facilitators" still in the country. Alert levels elsewhere Australia's higher alert level follows an increase in the United Kingdom, which raised its level from "substantial" to "severe" in late August. NTAS alerts are only issued if there's "credible information about a threat."
