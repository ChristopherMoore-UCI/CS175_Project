The Towson team wore orange armbands stitched with her initials Y.L. Love's mother and sister, Sharon and Lexie Love, were present in the stands to honor the game she loved. Its lyrics: "Do you believe in life after love?" The tribute was in honor of slain teammate Yeardley Love, the 22-year-old senior found dead in her off-campus apartment on May 3. Sunday's game in the first round of the NCAA championship tournament was the first the team had played since Love's death, and the day was marked with remembrance.
