Light use in Saudi Arabian cities increased by 60% to 100% during Ramadan, NASA reported. Between the day after Thanksgiving and New Year's Day, nighttime lights in many major U.S. cities shine 20% to 50% brighter than average, according to NASA. The NASA team examined light output in 2012 and 2013 in 70 cities during a study of urban energy use. "In most suburbs and outskirts of major cities, light intensity increased by 30 (percent) to 50 percent," NASA said in a statement. -- Those lights you put up for the holidays don't just brighten your neighborhood -- they are providing NASA with new data about how cities illuminate the night.
