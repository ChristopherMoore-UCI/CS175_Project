In 2004, we opened Whole Children, a nonprofit where kids, teens and adults with disabilities can learn valuable skills to help them fully engage in the world around them. With my three sons, I moved from Philadelphia to Amherst, Massachusetts, where the schools included kids with special needs in their regular classrooms. Instead of assuming every individual who walks through the door can follow complex directions, we support them as they are and teach them skills they need to be meaningfully included in their schools and communities. We noticed that even though our kids were technically included in school, it wasn't true inclusion. I dreamed of a place for Alex and I where there was laughter and happiness, where other parents who shared similar experiences could come together.
