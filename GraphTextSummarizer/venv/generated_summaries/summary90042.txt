Under pressure from ongoing protests against his government, Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh pledged Thursday to bring a new constitution to a vote by the end of the year and transfer government power to an elected parliamentary system. The human rights monitoring group urged Yemeni authorities to put an end to "deadly night raids and other attacks on protests." Human Rights Watch, meanwhile, called on authorities to immediately investigate the apparent killing of two protesters by soldiers during a March 4 protest near the town of Harf Sufyan. Mohamed Ali Mutlak, 24, was among dozens of anti-government demonstrators wounded when security forces fired into the air and shot tear gas into a crowd of tens of thousands of protesters who had massed in front of Sanaa University, witnesses said. A medical official said a Yemeni man injured in protests Tuesday at Sanaa University died of his wounds. The supplies were intended for the thousands of anti-government demonstrators who have camped out calling for Saleh to step down.
