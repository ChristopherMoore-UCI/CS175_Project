Here is a chronological recap of last week's violence that left at least 93 people dead across the two sites, compiled from statements and interviews of police, witnesses and government officials: 3:20 p.m.: An fertilizer bomb explodes outside government offices in central Oslo, near the Norwegian parliament and the offices of Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg. Local police near Utoya request assistance from other law enforcement agents in the Norwegian capital. But they have offered a timeline as to how the bloodshed began in central Oslo and then continued 20 miles away, at a political youth camp on Utoya island. Sometime thereafter, the suspect in the bombing takes a 3/4-mile ferry ride on Tyrifjorden -- Norway's fifth-largest lake -- to Utoya island. 5:52 p.m.: Several local police arrive on the lakefront near Utoya.
