Latinos aren't about to give Obama, a former lecturer on constitutional law, much credit for recognizing the obvious: that the Arizona law is blatantly unconstitutional because it usurps federal authority over immigration law in violation of Article 1, Section 8. Now, after a year and a half in office, ICE is still conducting immigration raids, and comprehensive immigration reform isn't on the table. What they resent even more is that they feel teased every time Obama makes yet another major speech promising to deliver something he has no intention of delivering -- comprehensive immigration reform. -- Did President Obama break his promise to Latino voters that he'd deliver a comprehensive immigration reform plan in his first year? They see the passion that Obama put into an issue he really cared about -- health care  -- and they resent the fact that when it comes to immigration reform, the president seems to think that words speak louder than actions.
