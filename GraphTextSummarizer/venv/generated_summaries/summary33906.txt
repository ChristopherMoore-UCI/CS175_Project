-- The news that America now has more cell phone subscribers than people doesn't surprise documentary filmmaker Tiffany Shlain. Shlain believes her film presents technology as a next step in shaping society. Shlain seems to have a love-hate relationship with technology. "I wonder if people are going to look back on this period and say, 'I cannot believe people used their cell phones so much in every situation and there were no boundaries," she said. Thanks to smartphones, people aren't just connecting through calls anymore.
