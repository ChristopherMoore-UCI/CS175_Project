Watch more on the heart official saved by a defibrillator he pushed for Â» "When somebody stops breathing and they hit the ground, for all intents and purposes, they're dead," says Dr. Art Kellermann, noted defibrillator advocate and professor of emergency medicine  at Emory University. Gary Terry says his being saved by a public defibrillator he'd pressed for was "divine intervention." "I believe the Lord chose me to lead that group," said Terry, who lives in Hurst, Texas. Here's where the story takes an ironic twist: Gary Terry collapsed just 18 feet from an automated external defibrillator AED that he and his group -- the American Heart Association -- helped to install just eight months earlier. "A lot of people say there's a lot of circumstances in your situation that really are unique," said Terry, "and I say no, they're not unique circumstances -- they're divine intervention. "Research has shown time and time again that you win or lose in a cardiac arrest on the scene," says Dr. Kellermann.
