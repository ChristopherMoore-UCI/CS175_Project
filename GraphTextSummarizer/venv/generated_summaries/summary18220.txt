When Senator Young made her presentation, by her side was New York state Assemblyman Joe Giglio. As soon as the interview was finished, we got a call from New York state Sen. Cathy Young's office. What I never imagined was that my first 5K would be held in my honor, organized by my friends and family as a surprise, right down Main Street in my hometown of Allegany, New York. Same day, same time, same place. As race day got closer, the event got bigger and bigger.
