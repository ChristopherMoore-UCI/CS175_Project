If you want to get more education or training, you have to give up unemployment benefits. Under Obama's initiative, colleges would consider a person's current financial situation to make it possible for them to receive Pell grants, which are available for low-income students. But if you return to school, you don't qualify for federal education grants since, in most cases, your qualification is based on the previous year's income. In most cases, if you are receiving unemployment compensation, you have to be actively looking for a job. The president outlined a plan under which the Department of Education will send colleges legal guidance, encouraging them to increase financial aid packages for the unemployed so they can enroll in educational and training programs while keeping their unemployment benefits.
