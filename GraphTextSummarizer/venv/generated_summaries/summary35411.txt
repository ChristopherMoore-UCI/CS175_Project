"Colbert Super PAC SHH" (as in "hush") to funnel money to his regular "Colbert Super PAC.") But the greatest danger of Super PACs is that they may skew the legislative process in the next Congress in favor of the interests of large Super PAC contributors. Well what of the six- and seven-figure donors to Super PACs supporting federal candidates? Given the expected vast spending by presidential candidates and parties in the general election, I am not very concerned that Super PAC spending will influence the outcome of the presidential election, though it might. Candidates can even raise money under certain conditions for supportive Super PACs without violating the FEC's technical coordination rules. The main reason the Supreme Court has rejected challenges to campaign contribution limits (currently set at $2,500 per election to federal candidates) is that large contributions can create the actuality and appearance of corruption of those candidates.
