On Saturday relatives called police to say Carrera had failed to pick up her children, ages 2 and 8, police said Monday. Carrera's cousin, Sandy Lopez, told CNN affiliate WBBM the couple had been together for three years. "(I)t is important to know that this appears to be an isolated incident stemming from a domestic situation and the investigation is continuing," police said Monday, before obtaining the warrant. The newlyweds were dropped off around 4 a.m. on Saturday, and proceeded home, police said. Jimenez and Carrera were married on Friday at City Hall in Chicago, according to authorities.
