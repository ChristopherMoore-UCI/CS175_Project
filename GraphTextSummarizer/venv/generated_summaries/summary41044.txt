Hello Kitty and her mates are hugely popular the world over, nowhere more so than in Asia where Taiwanese airline EVA Air flies five Kitty-themed planes in a tie-up with Sanrio. The first of EVA Air's long range Hello Kitty jets completed its maiden flight to Los Angeles last week, drawing a litter of curious Kitty enthusiasts. The Japanese cartoon company Sanrio launched Hello Kitty, depicted as a white female cat with a red bow in its hair, in 1974. Each current Hello Kitty plane has a theme and for the Taipei-LAX flight, the new design features 19 Sanrio characters, including My Melody (Hello Kitty's BFF), Little Twin Stars' Kiki and Lala as well as rival character Kuromi, the trouble-making bunny. Sanrio and EVA Air collaborated on their first generation of Kitty-themed aircraft in 2005.
