A federal judge has just heard one case calling for revenue from TV deals to be shared with student athletes and she will likely take on two more landmark suits this year that seek something even bigger -- a free market in college sports. But if O'Bannon's side won, both sides agree it could open the door for college athletes in every sport -- not just the revenue generators of football and basketball -- to make money from endorsement deals and product branding. A recent poll by the Saint Leo University Polling Institute showed that 66% of Americans don't think athletes should be paid with more than scholarship money. Schools that did stay in D1 would likely have to cut less popular sports to afford to pay athletes, he said. "The notion that athletes are students is the great hypocrisy of intercollegiate sports," wrote Wallace Renfro, former NCAA vice president, in one e-mail.
