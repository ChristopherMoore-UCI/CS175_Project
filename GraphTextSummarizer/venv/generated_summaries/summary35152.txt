In 1992, I had the pleasure of singing at the wedding of Sen. Edward Kennedy to Victoria Reggie. Her current album is "Naked With Friends." Singer Maura O'Connell says one of Ted Kennedy's favorite songs, "A Family Tie," spoke to his love of family. Editor's note: Maura O'Connell, a native of County Clare, Ireland, records for Sugar Hill Records. On the day that we were to tour the major sites, I decided to call Kennedy's office at the Russell Senate building. He made time to come and visit us and was about as genial a host as I have ever encountered.
