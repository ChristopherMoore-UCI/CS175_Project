All Things D responded to the report with a post titled "Why Facebook Might Really Be Doing Its Own Phone, Despite What Zuck Said." As recently as two months ago, The New York Times was reporting that "employees of Facebook and several engineers" as well as (the, of course, anonymous) "people briefed on Facebook's plans" were saying the company hoped to release a phone by next year. We want to support a development ecosystem, where other apps can build on top of Facebook." "Even Apple could arguably say it doesn't manufacture phones -- Foxconn builds the phones -- and Apple is the most profitable phone maker in the world." These unnamed folks told the Times it was Facebook's third effort at phone-building, dating back to 2010.
