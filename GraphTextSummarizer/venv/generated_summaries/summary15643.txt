The recalled tires are BFGoodrich commercial tires LT 235/85 R16 120 Q LRE and LT 245/75 R16 120 Q LRE, and Uniroyal Laredo tires LT 235/85 R16 120 Q LRE and LT 245/75 R16 120 Q LRE. "This condition may increase the risk of a vehicle crash," said Mike Wischhusen, Michelin's technical director, in a letter to tire owners. "It is important that all recalled tires be removed from service as soon as possible," Wischhusen said in the letter, which urges consumers to visit their BFGoodrich retailer to have them replaced without charge. The tires typically are mounted on commercial light trucks and full-size, heavy-duty vans, though some people may have bought them as replacement tires for their personal vehicles. -- Michelin North America, Inc., announced Thursday it is voluntarily recalling about 841,000 of its BFGoodrich and Uniroyal tires because tread-belt separation may cause them to lose tread and/or deflate quickly.
