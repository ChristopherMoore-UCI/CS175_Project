-- Three Al Jazeera English journalists were convicted in Egypt on Monday of aiding the Muslim Brotherhood in a ruling that immediately outraged journalists and activists around the world. " Three other international journalists -- Sue Turton and Dominic Kane of Al Jazeera and Rena Netjes, a correspondent for Dutch newspaper Parool -- were sentenced in absentia to 10 years, reports said, adding that the journalists are expected to appeal, according to the nonprofit Committee to Protect Journalists, which advocates for media freedom worldwide. The prosecution, which has argued that channels like Al Jazeera brought down Iraq and were planning to do the same in Egypt, has been widely condemned by international correspondents, media organizations and foreign governments. On Sunday, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said he spoke "specifically about Al Jazeera journalists" during a meeting with the new Egyptian President, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. "All at CNN are dismayed at today's unjust sentencing of the Al Jazeera journalists in Egypt," the network said in a statement.
