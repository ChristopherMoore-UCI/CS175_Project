Burba Trulsson Sunset.com: Top 10 winter weekends Big Island, Hawaii Hidden Hawaii: Way up at the northern point of the Big Island, past the fancy resorts everyone has heard of, there's a lush and little-known area of former sugar towns. Reclaim winter's quiet at Tamarack Lodge, where charming cabins with fireplaces and patchwork quilts hide out among the trees just outside Mammoth's resorty core. Off the grid on the coast: At Glendeven Inn, just south of Mendocino in Little River, your cell signal obligingly vanishes when you pull in the drive, and there's not a remote control in sight. By day, share 19 miles of groomed cross-country trails with just a few solitude-loving skiers. Bonus: Targhee's 40th anniversary means $40 lift tickets and deep discounts on multi-night stays.
