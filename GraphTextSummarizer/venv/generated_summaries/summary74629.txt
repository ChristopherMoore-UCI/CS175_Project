"When more than 500 people get sick from two outbreaks associated with chicken that meets federal safety standards, it is clear that those standards are not effectively protecting public health," Sandra Eskin, director of Pew's food safety project, said in a statement. The USDA does not require poultry plants to treat the presence of salmonella as a significant risk, according to the Pew Report, and has no standards for chicken parts, which are purchased more widely than whole chickens. CDC investigators determined consumption of Foster Farms chicken was the likely source of the outbreak. He said it's important for consumers to remain diligent about food safety practices, including washing their hands and cooking food to the right temperatures. The FSIS acted as aggressively as possible under the authority they had during the Foster Farms outbreaks, said Brian Ronholm, USDA's deputy undersecretary for food safety.
