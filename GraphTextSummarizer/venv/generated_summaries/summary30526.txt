-- Track star Oscar Pistorius was a "deceitful" witness who cannot escape a murder conviction for his actions, prosecutor Gerrie Nel said Thursday, presenting his closing arguments in the athlete's trial. The state contends that Pistorius, 27, not only murdered Steenkamp, 29, but that it was premeditated. Making his final arguments, prosecutor Nel told Judge Thokozile Masipa that lawyers for Pistorius had tried to present more than one defense -- and that they did not jibe. It's now up to Pistorius' defense team to argue for the last time before the judge that the athlete mistook Steenkamp for an intruder when he fired four shots through the locked toilet door, killing her. If Masipa sees any reasonable doubt that Pistorius knew Steenkamp was behind the bathroom door, she will not convict him of murder.
