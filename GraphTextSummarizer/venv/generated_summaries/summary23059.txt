Sandra, who has been living in captivity for the past 20 years at the Buenos Aires Zoo, was considered a "nonhuman being" and she was granted basic rights, such as life, freedom and a premise of "no harm" either physically or psychologically. Argentina's Federal Chamber of Criminal Cassation ruled the primate is a subject of law, "a nonhuman being that has certain rights, and can enforce them through legal procedure," according to Andrés Gil Domínguez, Sandra's attorney. "It has been proven that Sandra and primates held in captivity have not only lost their freedom, they have lost the ability to live in a natural habitat, but it has also been proven that they are affected, that they suffer from confinement, and it is damage that is deep and serious," said Gil. Even though this is a case that sets a global precedent, specialists in this matter confirmed this type of ruling only applies to cases like Sandra's and great apes, who share 96% of their genetic identity with human beings. Argentina's Association of Professional Lawyers for Animal Rights filed a writ of habeas corpus, a resource to avoid arbitrary arrests, on Sandra's behalf.
