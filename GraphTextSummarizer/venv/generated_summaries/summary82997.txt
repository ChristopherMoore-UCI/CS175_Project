In just over an hour early Sunday, five structures -- including a single-family residence -- burned, in addition to "numerous cars," District Attorney Betsy Scheibel told a news conference that included fire and police officials and Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick. -- Local and state authorities in Northampton, Massachusetts, are investigating nine suspicious fires that have killed two people and left residents shaken, officials said Sunday. "We know this community is deeply shaken by this series of suspicious fires," Patrick said. The fires were reported between 2 a.m. and 3:15 a.m., Scheibel's office said. Two people were found dead on the first floor of a residence, Scheibel said.
