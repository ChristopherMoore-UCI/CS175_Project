Martin Nesirky, a spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, said the global body has received "several worrying reports about incidents of an unknown number of alleged rapes and looting." The United Nations mission in Congo dispatched peacekeepers to Fizi to investigate the incident. "The inability of the Democratic Republic of Congo to bring to justice members of its own army and armed groups for crimes under international law has fostered a culture of impunity, leading to attack after attack against civilians," said Erwin van der Borght, Amnesty International's director for Africa. The humanitarian group Medicins San Frontieres reported Thursday that its medical teams in the Fizi area of Sud Kivu province had treated about 100 women for rape, abuse and trauma. A five-year war in which more than 5 million people died ended in 2003, but violence is still widespread in eastern Congo. It was the latest in many such incidents that have earned Congo the ignominious title of "rape capital" of the world.
