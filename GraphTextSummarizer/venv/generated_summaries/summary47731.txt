Lake Malawi is spectacular The locals are friendly Called the "Warm Heart of Africa," in the native language, Malawi locals exude friendliness. Rehabilitated game parks and natural reserves Tour companies offer safaris in parks and reserves that include eco-friendly trips, mountain biking, horseback riding and traditional housing stays. But there's more to Malawi than animal parks, warm sands and Madonna's adoptions.
