"We want to give them the opportunity to explain work they're doing." Utah Attorney General Mark Shurtleff said on CNN's "American Morning" on Monday that he expects to launch a formal investigation into the data leak very soon. The list was anonymously distributed last week to media and government offices across the state, CNN affiliate KSTU-TV reported. -- Eight more employees from the Utah Department of Workforce Services are being questioned in connection with a leaked list containing personal information of 1,300 alleged illegal immigrants, Dave Lewis, a department spokesman, said Monday afternoon. By early Monday afternoon, the Department of Workforce Services' general counsel had been in touch with the attorney general's office to bring lawyers there up to speed, Lewis said. Utah Gov. Gary Herbert told CNN's John King on Friday night that the 1,300 people have Hispanic names.
