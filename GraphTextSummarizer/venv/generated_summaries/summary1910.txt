Tour rehearsals begin in New York in May and the tour will launch in New Zealand around the first week of June, according to the source. Simon's manager, Jeff Kramer, has asked the group's musicians to clear their calendars -- which means canceling other shows -- from late May through June, the source said. Kramer, in a statement to Rolling Stone magazine after the February show, hinted that a tour was in the works. Reunion plans apparently began after Simon and Garfunkel played three songs together during Simon's two-night gig at New York's Beacon Theatre in February. Simon and Garfunkel last reunited for their "Old Friends" tour in 2003 and 2004, which Rolling Stone estimated earned $123 million.
