President Obama personally appealed to IOC members for the 2016 summer Olympic Games to be in Chicago. " White House senior adviser David Axelrod said that although the results were "disappointing," Obama did the best he could. President Obama traveled overseas -- in the middle of debates over health care and Afghanistan -- to make his personal pitch to bring the 2016 Olympics to his hometown. Last month, when the Obamas hosted an event on the White House lawn to rally support for Chicago's bid, Obama was against making the trip. "Listen, I think it's a great idea to promote Chicago, but he's the president of the United States, not the mayor of Chicago," House Minority Leader John Boehner said, Politico reported.
