So, as a mother and a lawmaker, I stand with the fasters calling on Boehner to lead, and help pass immigration reform. My Republican colleagues must simply allow a vote and stop standing in the way of immigration reform. I challenge him to live up to the American people's expectations and to honor their wishes -- to stop listening to those in the Republican Party who oppose immigration reform and to do what is right. The fasters embody this way of life and they represent millions of people who are struggling to keep their families together and be treated with dignity. Seeing Soto's pain and the fear in her eyes, and the love and sadness in her voice as she asked me in tears: "Tell Speaker Boehner to give us a vote," overcame me with emotion.
