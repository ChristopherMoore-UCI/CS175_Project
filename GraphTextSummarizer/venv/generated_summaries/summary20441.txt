Contrite, Zhang, 62, apologized in an open letter for his "excessive children." "As a film director, it takes a lot of efforts and good movies for people to remember you, but having excessive children had ruined it all," he said, according to Xinhua, China's state news agency. China's stringent family planning rules limit most urban couples to one child and most rural couples to two, with few exceptions. JinqiuT wrote on Sina Weibo, China's Twitter-like microblogging service: "Celebrities should abide laws and rules as common people." Ironically for Zhang, his troubles come as China announced in November the decision to loosen the policy by allowing couples to have two children even if just one of them is an only child. "We will announce the result once we have all information ready." Zhang's breach of the policy has set off a firestorm, especially among netizens who resent how the rich and famous in China flout rules and policies.
