The sign language interpreter ridiculed for his incoherent translation of the Mandela memorial service has faced a multitude of criminal charges in the past, including murder, attempted murder and kidnapping, South African news network eNCA reported on Friday. Jantjie showed no facial expressions, which are key in South African sign language, and his hand signals were meaningless, Druchen said. The document also revealed that Jantjie was charged with rape, housebreaking, malicious damage to property and murder between 1994 and 2006, but the record shows that Jantjie was found not guilty of the rape and murder charges. At a news conference on Thursday, Hendrietta Bogopane-Zulu, South African deputy minister of women, children and people with disabilities, said the government was looking into the vetting of Jantjie's security clearance at the memorial. Reached by eNCA Friday, Jantjie did not deny he faced the charges, but asked how the reporters came into possession of private details and said he wasn't prepared to comment.
