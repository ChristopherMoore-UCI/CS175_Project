It's worth noting that while most of the Israeli images feature photos of people looking into the camera, few Iranian images do. Will an effort like Israel ♥ Iran force either the Netanyahu or Ahmedinejad government to listen to the voices of dissenting citizens? It offers evidence that not all Israeli citizens see Iran as an implacable enemy, and it replaces the faces of leaders with the faces of ordinary people. What do movements such as Israel ♥ Iran mean for governments and their diplomats? But it's a worthy hope, and Israel ♥ Iran is a sign of things to come.
