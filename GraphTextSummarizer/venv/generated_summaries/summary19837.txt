On Thursday, a major tech company stepped into the middle of a vicious two-month-long battle among video game fans, scholars, developers and journalists over the representation of women in games. The tension began in August when critic and academic Anita Sarkeesian released the latest episode in her YouTube show on female tropes in video games. Intel has pulled an ad campaign from popular video game news site Gamasutra. Some game players worry that activists will cause game makers to change their product to please a wider audience. The move is in response to a online protest by a group of gamers upset with a column by the site's editor-at-large, Leigh Alexander.
