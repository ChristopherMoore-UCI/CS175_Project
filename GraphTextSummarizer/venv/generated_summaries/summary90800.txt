The winner was awarded a full-time position of master model builder at the new LEGOLAND Discovery Center due to open in Atlanta in the spring. On a recent January weekend, LEGO held a job fair of sorts in the form of a contest, a two-day building contest called Brick Factor. The Atlanta contestants were narrowed down on the first day by several rounds of tasks, or builds. The master model builder for LEGOLAND Discovery Center Dallas agrees. "I know someone else is making a guitar, I guess ill have to make mine better." Sims, a mother of two and the only woman left, chose to build Wonder Woman.
