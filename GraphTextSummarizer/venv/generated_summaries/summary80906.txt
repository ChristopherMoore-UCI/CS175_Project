Marroquin, current Colombian Sen. Juan Manuel Galan, Bogota Councilman Carlos Fernando Galan and Sen. Rodrigo Lara spoke collectively to CNN en Espa√±ol about how they were brought together. Marroquin, who was born Juan Pablo Escobar, ran away from the path his father chose, changing his name once he and his mother left Colombia, after Pablo Escobar was killed in a rooftop shootout with authorities in 1993. -- "How do you write to a family that your own father hurt so much?" Sebastian Marroquin, son of the infamous Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar, posed this question in a letter to the families of two of his father's most prominent victims. Marroquin asked for forgiveness for his father's acts, for crimes that Marroquin did not commit, Lara said. Rodrigo Lara Bonilla was Colombia's justice minister in the early 1980s and one of the first to aggressively pursue cocaine traffickers.
