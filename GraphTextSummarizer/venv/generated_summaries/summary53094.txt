A delegation member who was trusted by the Free Syrian Army -- the armed opposition group, made up largely of Syrian military defectors, who had looked after the journalists -- said that he heard Syrian state television planned to film the two being put on ambulances, then government forces would stage an attack that they'd later blame on the Free Syrian Army. Yet senior U.N. official Lynn Pascoe told the Security Council last week that often over "100 civilians a day, including women and children" are being killed -- most of them the victims of what activists and witnesses have described as brutal attacks by Syrian government forces. "We just drove off, into this night, in this tunnel," he said, adding that he learned Syrian forces shot up the same tunnel some 20 minutes later. -- From his London hospital room, journalist Paul Conroy recalled Sunday his harrowing journey to hell and back from Syria -- speaking out against what he called its "murderous regime" in tribute to those, including his colleague Marie Colvin, killed in the chaos. " A short time later, after borrowing shoes and pants, Conroy said he got an injection from doctors -- "I just said put anything in, because I knew it was going to be a very painful experience" -- and got into a Free Syrian Army vehicle.
