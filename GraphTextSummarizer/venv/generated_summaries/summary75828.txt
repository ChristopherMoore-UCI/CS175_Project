-- New Zealand warmed up for their Tri-Nations decider against Australia with a 101-14 rout of Samoa in a one-off rugby union Test on Wednesday in New Plymouth, running in 15 tries. New Zealand led 47-7, seven tries to one, at halftime and added eight tries, including a penalty try, in the second spell to surpass their highest score against Samoa. Most of the players who took the field Wednesday were young and Samoa-based and playing against the All Blacks for the first time. Samoa was forced to pick a severely under-strength side because many of its leading and most-experienced players are involved with European club sides. "For some of our boys it was a big step up from playing club rugby in Samoa but, having said that, it was a big learning curve."
