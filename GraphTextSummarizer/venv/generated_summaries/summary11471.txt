-- New Jersey officially said Monday that it has "profound regret" for practicing slavery, and became the first state north of the Mason-Dixon line to pass such apologetic legislation. The legislation does not need the signature of New Jersey Gov. Jon Corzine to become official. The resolution did not need Gov. Jon Corzine's signature and will become official when filed with the secretary of state. The symbolic atonement follows apologies for slavery made in 2007 by legislators in Alabama, Maryland, North Carolina and Virginia. A committee of the New Jersey Assembly last Thursday approved the resolution, just one of several steps lawmakers had to take by Monday, the last day of the current legislative session.
