"There has been an enthusiastic uptake of mobile phone technology in indigenous communities in Australia, so the idea is to capitalize on that," says linguist Bruce Birch, coordinator of the Minjilang Endangered Languages Publication project, which developed the app. Backpackers can ditch clumsy guide books and use smartphone apps to plan their trips around Australia using The Australia Planner, a free mobile application by Tourism Australia, while those playing non-elite sports can keep up to date with the results, league tables and schedules of their teams via the SportingPulse app. Users choose their location in Australia and get alerted when UV levels there have reached dangerous levels. Iwaidja free mobile phone app is the first phone app for an Australian indigenous language and aims to prevent the extinction of the Iwaidja language -- one of Australia's 100 endangered languages. According to a Deloitte study, the market for developing apps in Australia is expected to be worth more than half a billion dollars in the next three to five years.
