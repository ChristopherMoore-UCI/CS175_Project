Muhammad Tahir ul-Qadri condemned terrorism and criticized Islamic extremists who cite their religion to justify violence. "Terrorism is terrorism," ul-Qadri said at a news conference hosted by the foundation. "Violence is violence. The foundation refers to ul-Qadri as a mainstream Muslim scholar who is a "widely recognized and respected authority on Islamic jurisprudence." It has no place in Islamic teaching, and no justification can be provided to it ..." Ul-Qadri is the founder of the Minhaj-ul-Quran, an organization with hundreds of thousands of followers in South Asia and the United Kingdom, according to the Quilliam Foundation.
