Craig Dershowitz of New York recently turned to the Internet to pay for ongoing legal costs in his battle with ex-girlfriend Sarah Brega, now living in Southern California. Brega wouldn't throw her ex a bone in any interview with ABC's "Good Morning America. In a statement to HLN, CNN's sister network, Brega said Knuckles is "incredibly healthy and happy here with me." The dog has not been in New York since October 2010 and Dershowitz waited until a year had gone by and was unsuccessful in reconciliation before filing suit, Brega argued. In the video, Dershowitz wipes his eyes when describing Knuckles' tail-wagging and snores.
