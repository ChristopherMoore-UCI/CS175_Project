As I began interviewing different people with various physical impairments and hearing their stories, I realized that some individuals seemed to have more confidence and hope than others. Tired of the way people made up their minds before getting to know him, Steel decided to photograph other people with disabilities and tell their stories. They talked about how judged they often felt because people could not understand why they weren't doing certain things that required more physical effort. What makes it difficult is that out of self-defense, we instinctively attempt to categorize people and things to avoid possible dangers. Therefore, the most effective way to eliminate negative perceptions of people with impairments is to empower them.
