McCain says Carter will have to answer questions about the administration's ISIS strategy, "but it won't impact his nomination." Carter is currently second-in-line at the Pentagon, serving as Deputy Defense Secretary under Leon Panetta and Chuck Hagel. Meet Chuck Hagel's expected replacement as Defense Secretary McCain, who will pick up the Armed Services Committee gavel in January, is likely to chair Carter's confirmation hearing, if he is nominated by President Barack Obama, which sources told CNN is expected to happen soon. Sen. John McCain agrees that Ashton Carter is "qualified" for the Defense Secretary position, but warns that he won't have much say on pressing national security issues. "I'm sure that he's been around long enough to know that he will have little to no voice in the crucial decision on national security," he told reporters Tuesday in Washington. While he thinks Carter will have a smooth hearing, he doesn't think he's the right person to lead the fight against ISIS.
