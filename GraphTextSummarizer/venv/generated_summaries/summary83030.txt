As the storm approached, the governors of Mississippi, Alabama, Florida and Louisiana declared states of emergency. "Ida has lost tropical characteristics and its winds are expected to slowly diminish during the next day or so," according to a 10 a.m. ET advisory from the Miami, Florida-based National Hurricane Center. The storm's heavy rains have flooded some roads and washed up debris in parts of Alabama and Florida, and the storm knocked out power to about 2,000 people in the western part of the Florida panhandle. The storm was about 30 miles east-southeast of Mobile, Alabama, and about 25 miles west-northwest of Pensacola, Florida, the latest advisory said. -- Ida has been downgraded from a tropical storm to a tropical depression as it lost momentum during its approach to the U.S. Gulf Coast early Tuesday.
