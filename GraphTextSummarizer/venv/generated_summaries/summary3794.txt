Israeli police and security forces say he has been charged in connection with a string of attacks and murder plots over the past 12 years against Arabs, homosexuals, leftists, messianic Jews and police forces. According to police, the long series of attacks began in 1997, when Teitel entered Israel as a tourist and managed to smuggle a handgun on board a British Airways flight to Tel Aviv. Next on Teitel's list of targets, police said, was Israel Prize laureate Zeev Sternhell. This guy was a Jewish terrorist who targeted different types of people," police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said. Teitel, 37, was arrested last month in Jerusalem after hanging posters in support of the Tel Aviv attack.
