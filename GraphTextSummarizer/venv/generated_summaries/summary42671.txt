The Health, Labor and Welfare Ministry says the number of suicides in Japan has been over 30,000 per year for 13 years in a row. " On World Suicide Prevention Day last September, the government launched a website featuring a popular soccer star, urging the country become more aware of the warning signs of suicide. -- The number of people in Japan who killed themselves last year because they couldn't find a job jumped 20%, the National Police Agency reported Thursday. The stark figures stood in contrast to the overall decrease in the number of suicides in Japan, down 3.5% to 31,690. But the suicide rate persists, in a society where a stigma surrounds mental health issues.
