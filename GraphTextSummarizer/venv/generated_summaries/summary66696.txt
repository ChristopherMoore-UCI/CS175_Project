Consider the priorities laid out in his February State of the Union Address: *A new jobs plan *Infrastructure investments targeting roads and the 70,000 American bridges he noted are deemed structurally unsound *An increase, to $9 an hour, in the federal minimum wage *A guarantee of quality pre-school education for every child in America *New background checks for gun purchases and, the President asked, for an up or down vote on new gun restrictions, including a ban on certain assault style weapons * " Also in his address: a plea to end the budgeting by brinksmanship and crisis and a hopeful call for bipartisan negotiations on tax reform and Medicare and other entitlement spending. Yes, public opinion polls suggest the government shutdown and debt ceiling crisis is more damaging to Republicans than to the President and his fellow Democrats. A welcome respite, perhaps, but the issues won't get any easier over the course of those three or four months, and the politics - believe it or not - could get even more difficult because those new deadlines are early in the midterm election year. Eight months later -- as the end of that critical first year of the presidential term comes into focus -- none of those priorities has been realized.
