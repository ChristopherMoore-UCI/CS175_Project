Far from finding state immigration laws unconstitutional -- as many legal experts once insisted -- the Supreme Court's May ruling in the Whiting v. U.S. Chamber of Commerce case endorsed the principle that states can and should play a significant role in controlling illegal immigration. The problem is that most state lawmakers respond to this clamor by intensifying state enforcement. Most support tough immigration enforcement, but they can also see the crops rotting not just in Alabama but also in Georgia, Arizona and other states. Of course, it's understandable that states are stepping in to grapple with immigration: States from Arizona to Virginia have enacted laws cracking down on illegal immigration.
