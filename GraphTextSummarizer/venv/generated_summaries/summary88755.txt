-- Lady Bird Johnson, who was first lady during the 1960s and in her later years became an advocate for beautifying public landscapes, died Wednesday, family spokesman Tom Johnson said. She used more of her mother's money and Johnson's connections to purchase a faltering Austin radio station in 1942 for $17,500. "Lady Bird Johnson embodied all that is beautiful and good about the great state of Texas," Perry said. Lady Bird Johnson traveled more than 35,000 miles during that campaign. As the Johnsons moved into the White House, Lady Bird Johnson "went around and went to all of the staff that was remaining in their jobs, told them how happy she was to have them there," said Leticia Baldridge, Jacqueline Kennedy's former social secretary.
