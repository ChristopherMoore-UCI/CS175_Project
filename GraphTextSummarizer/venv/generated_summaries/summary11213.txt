Brian Quigley, spokesman for the U.S. Consulate in Matamoros, Mexico, said Saturday that Tiffany Hartley is "fully cooperating in assisting Mexican prosecutors with their investigation." Zapata County, Texas, Sheriff Sigifredo Gonzalez Jr. has said Mexican authorities may have been trying to intimidate Tiffany Hartley during the in-depth interview Friday and scare her into not pushing them to continue the investigation. It took place the day after Mexican authorities said they were suspending the search for David Hartley. "We are going to hold them to that." Tiffany Hartley's mother, Cynthia Young, said earlier that she, Tiffany Hartley and the woman's father met with Mexican and American officials Friday, and the family was told that the Mexican government was "restrategizing" how it was handling the search for Hartley's body. Tiffany Hartley met with Rolando Armando Flores Villegas, the lead Mexican investigator in the death of her husband, days before Flores was killed.
