Some major, national CDC surveys are done door-to-door, but many state surveys rely on landline phones. The high rates of cell phone--only homes were not that surprising, said Blumberg. The CDC doesn't use cell phones for a number of reasons, said Blumberg. "It doesn't affect health per se, rather it has implications for how well the CDC and others can track the health of the nation," said Stephen Blumberg, senior scientist at the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics. The CDC often relies solely on landline phones when conducting large, state-based health surveys, conducted every year to determine sexual habits, childhood immunizations rates, and dozens of others factors related to American health.
