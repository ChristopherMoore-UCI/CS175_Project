Kirsten has appointed A.B. de Villiers as the Proteas' new captain for limited overs matches, and the batsman will be Graeme Smith's deputy for Test matches. He will be assisted by coach Russell Domingo, while former South Africa star Allan Donald will be the team's bowling coach. Kirsten, a former opening batsman for South Africa, also transformed India into the world's top-ranked team in the five-day Test format. England will be hoping to set a target and see if they can repeat the final-day demolition of the Sri Lankan batsman that earned an innings victory in the opening match in Cardiff last week. The 43-year-old decided not to renew his contract with India after leading the sub-continent team to victory in the limited overs Cricket World Cup in April.
