For a school science project, this 13-year-old used these observations to design a new type of solar panel array that's based on Fibonacci and the structure of trees. No one knows much about these processes -- well, no one except "makers" like Dominic Muren, who is creating a website to connect people who make things in the developing world with other people on the Internet who might be able to help. Aidan Dwyer, 13-year-old solar scientist Who knows what you were doing at age 13, but I'm guessing you weren't walking through the woods, looking at trees and noticing how the spiraling pattern of the branches follow a mathematical construct called the Fibonacci sequence. Increasingly, people like Muren just want to make things for themselves. He says it catches more light and produces about 20% more electricity than traditional solar panel arrangements.
