It's just luck of the draw and depends on how the plane goes in," said aviation expert John Eakin, head of Air Data Research in Helotes, Texas. Flight attendants often use shoulder harnesses when they are seated, aviation writer David Noland added. Despite his statistical evidence that the rear of the plane is safer, writer Noland doesn't seek out a back seat when he flies. Passengers in seats behind the wings had a 69 percent survival rate in crashes that included at least one fatality, Noland wrote. " Even in other types of crashes -- runway overruns, forced landings, etc. -- the plane is always going forward, so the front takes the impact, Noland said.
