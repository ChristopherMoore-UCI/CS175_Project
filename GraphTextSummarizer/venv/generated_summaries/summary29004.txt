And despite the setbacks with the future of the Cape Town stadium as well as the burden it may place on the city's taxpayers, acting executive mayor of the city Alderman Ian Neilson has assured residents that future events will take place there as planned. Eight World Cup matches were held at the 68,000-seat Green Point, one of five new stadiums built for the World Cup this summer. The Sail Stadefrance Operating Company (SSOC) -- a partnership between South African events company Sail and French consortium Stadefrance -- were due to take up a 30-year lease on Cape Town's Green Point Stadium on November 1 this year. "This country has also used sports stadiums for major political rallies, concerts and church events. "In the light of unresolved matters that affected the viability of the lease we have advised the city that SSOC would not be in a position to enter the lease," du Plessis told the official website of the city of Cape Town.
