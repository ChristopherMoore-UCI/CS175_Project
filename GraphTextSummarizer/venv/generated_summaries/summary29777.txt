The win also takes the Bavarian giants to fifth place in the German standings with 18 points after 10 games, four points adrift of Bayer Leverkusen, who were held 1-1 by Borussia Dortmund on Friday night. -- Defender turned striker Daniel van Buyten scored an 88th minute winner for Bayern Munich to give them a much-needed 2-1 victory over Eintracht Frankfurt to revive their Bundesliga title challenge. The Belgian was pushed up front by coach Louis van Gaal after Italian striker Luca Toni was substituted and he came up trumps with a late header. Bayern coach van Gaal was relieved to claim the three points after their midweek setback in Europe. Alexander Meier put the visitors in front on the hour mark at the Allianz Arena, but Dutch ace Arjen Robben, returning to first team action after injury, equalized 10 minutes later after Mario Gomez won an aerial battle to set him up to slot home.
