The National Weather Service issued a winter storm warning through 7 a.m. ET Sunday for Appalachian regions of northwest North Carolina, southwest Virginia and southeast West Virginia. In addition, expected light snow prompted the agency to issue a winter weather advisory -- effective until 1 a.m. ET -- for parts of southern and central Virgina as well as northeast North Carolina. The timing of the storm -- coming after the Friday evening rush hour, with most snow falling while people slept -- and the fact snow didn't stick to most major roads helped keep auto accidents minimal. , snow fell late Saturday from Minnesota east to Virginia, prompting a series of warnings but few major headaches. The National Weather Service has issued a warning for lake-effect snow for many of these areas from 8 p.m. Saturday through 6 a.m. Tuesday, predicting snow might fall at a rate of 1 to 3 inches an hour.
