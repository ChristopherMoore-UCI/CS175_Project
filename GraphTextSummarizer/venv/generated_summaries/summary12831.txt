In January of this year, Gallup found that more Americans picked bad government and corruption as our biggest problem than picked any other challenge, including the economy and unemployment. Gallup also did some comparative analysis using findings from its World Poll and the trends regarding Americans' views on government are even more sobering. When four out of five Americans believe government is corrupt, something is profoundly wrong. Our most trusted national institution, the unelected Supreme Court, has the confidence of almost (but not quite) one out of every three Americans. In the poll, 79% of the American people believe corruption is widespread in government.
