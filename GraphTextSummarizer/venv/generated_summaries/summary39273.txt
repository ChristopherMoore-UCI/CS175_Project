-- Apple's ambition to improve the fidelity of music downloads has diminished since the death of founder Steve Jobs, according to singer-songwriter Neil Young. "My goal is to rescue the art form that I've been practicing for about 50 years," said Young, whose Rock and Roll Hall of Fame career spans six decades, from Buffalo Springfield to his rich solo career to his work with Pearl Jam and beyond. In the interview Tuesday, Young embraced illegal music downloads. Improving the quality of digital music is a personal mission for Young, who has evangelized for it before. "Steve Jobs was a pioneer of digital music," Young said.
