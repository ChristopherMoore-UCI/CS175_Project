Most of these court rulings have been stayed -- meaning that, for now, marriage prohibitions remain in place -- until appeals courts, and possibly the Supreme Court, weigh in. Gov. Tom Corbett announced his decision in a statement Wednesday, a day after U.S. District Judge John E. Jones became the latest federal judge to declare a state's restriction of marriage to one man and one woman to be unconstitutional. "Governor Corbett is abandoning marriage with this choice," Brown said on his organization's blog. A Gallup survey released Wednesday showed that 55% of respondents support laws granting same-sex couples equal rights to traditional marriages, the highest such number since Gallup began polling on this question in 1996. But many federal judges have cited his decision on United States v. Windsor in their judgments, as well as the argument that same-sex marriage bans violate the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.
