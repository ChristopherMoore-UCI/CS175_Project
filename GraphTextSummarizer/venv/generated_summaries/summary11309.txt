"0.3% of urine tests were positive for drugs and 0.2% of both urine and breath tests were positive for alcohol. " The PJA said from 2005-11 it had recorded four positive tests for cocaine, one for cannabis and two for diuretics (water shedding drugs) -- both of which were for amateur riders. "From 2,607 in-competition urine tests and 3,697 breath tests since 2005, there is no evidence to suggest that there is a fundamental drug problem with jockeys," PJA chief executive Paul Struthers said.

" France Galop said Dettori will have to undergo further drug testing from April 20 before he is allowed to return to racing.
