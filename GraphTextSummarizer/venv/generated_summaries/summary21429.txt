Russia is following a "disturbing pattern," he said, "using military force to annex Crimea, destabilize eastern Ukraine and intimidate its neighbors" in disregard of international law. Twelve people were killed Friday in shelling in the eastern Ukraine city of Donetsk, an official with the pro-separatist City Council said, as the conflict between the military and pro-Russian separatists escalated in the past week. The conflict broke out last spring after Russia annexed Ukraine's southeastern Crimea region and as pro-Russia separatists claimed control of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions. " The government in Kiev and its Western allies accuse Russia of fueling the violence by sending troops and military equipment over the border into Ukraine. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko announced Monday that Kiev would ask the Hague tribunal to investigate alleged "crimes against humanity" in the conflict in eastern Ukraine.
