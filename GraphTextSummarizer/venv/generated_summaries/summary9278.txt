"Ms. Spears and her attorneys have every expectation that this matter will be dismissed by the courts," her statement said The filing said the harassment began after Flores was hired as a guard at her Calabasas, California home last February by Advanced Security Concepts Corporation. The suit detailed an alleged incident at a California hotel where Flores heard Spears "loudly having sexual relations while her two children were in the suite with her. Spears made "repeated unwanted sexual advances to Plaintiff, summoning Plaintiff to her room at her residence for no other purpose or reason that to expose her naked or near naked body to Plaintiff," the suit claimed. Spears allegedly "engaged in numerous sex acts in front of Plaintiff, including but not limited to sexual intercourse." " Flores claimed he saw Spears "having vigorous sexual relations" when he entered her home on two occasions.
