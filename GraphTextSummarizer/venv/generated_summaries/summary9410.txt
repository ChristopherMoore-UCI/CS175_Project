If your tastes veer more to the homegrown variety (artisanal soaps, candles, honey and breads), time your visit to coincide with Ojai's Certified Farmers' Market (300 E. Matilija St.), held on Sundays. DAY 2 Start fresh: Begin the day at the low-key Ojai Caf√© Emporium (108 S. Montgomery St.; 805/646-2723; breakfast for two $15) with just-baked blueberry muffins or decadent cinnamon-roll French toast. Get cooking: Nancy Michali trained at San Francisco's renowned Tanta Marie culinary school before opening the Ojai Culinary Studio (315 N. Montgomery St.; 805/646-1124; classes from $30) in a wood-floored house. Hit the town: Ojai's not known for its nightlife, but those looking to unwind can head to the art-filled Movino (308 E. Ojai Ave.; 805/646-1555), a sultry little wine bar where residents and visitors alike mingle over glasses of regional favorites; the 54-bottle list includes three from the Ojai valley itself.
