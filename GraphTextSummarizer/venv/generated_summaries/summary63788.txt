The death was reported in Sand Springs, a suburb of Tulsa, after the storm system ravaged a mobile home park, said Maj. Shannon Clark with the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office. The tornado warning included downtown Tulsa. Lewis said a temporary hospital was treating patients with minor injuries. One person was killed Wednesday when severe weather ripped through the Tulsa and Oklahoma City areas. "Their building did sustain a little bit of damage, but they were able to reopen once the storm passed and start taking patients in," Lewis said.
