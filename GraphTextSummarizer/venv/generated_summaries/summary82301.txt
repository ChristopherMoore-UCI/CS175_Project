"There are no grounds for the use of force against civilians and Ukrainians, and for the entry of the Russian military contingent," Former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko said that if diplomacy fails to persuade Moscow to withdraw its forces from the Ukrainian region of Crimea, the world should apply the "strongest means" on Russia. But experts say the world's need for Russian energy supplies -- and Russia's need for the revenue generated -- should ensure the taps stay open throughout the crisis. One option for defusing the crisis, mentioned by U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, would be the deployment of international monitors in the Crimea to provide the protection to Russian citizens that Moscow says its troops are providing. By Russia's account, its soldiers are protecting the human rights of worried, vulnerable Russian speakers. Some commentators have suggested that Putin has overplayed his hand by sending troops into Crimea, creating a situation that will hurt both Ukraine and Russia.
