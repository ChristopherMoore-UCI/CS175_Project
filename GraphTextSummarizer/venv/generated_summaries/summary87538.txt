When a cruise ship dumps thousands of people into Venice at once, they squeeze down jammed medieval streets where purveyors of overpriced pizza and cheap masks have replaced the shops of artists and artisans. But while I went back to Venice to do a story on rising water, instead I found a surprising drama about the rising tide of humanity. And in an age of rising seas and exploding populations, Venice is a test. But in the years since, I've heard very different stories from disappointed folks back from their first trip to La Serenissima because the city of water and love now has too much of both. His concerned bark broke the spell as my wife and I smooched and gaped, moon-eyed dorks on our first night in Venice.
