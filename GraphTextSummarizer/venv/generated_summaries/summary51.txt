For Jaspects, whose music has appeared in the movie "Hustle & Flow" and recently was featured in the CNN documentary series "Black in America," the lessons of jazz go beyond its artistic merits to questions about the ownership and control of black music in general. Brown says he's hopeful that the rise of black leadership in music will have a positive impact on the community. In his exhaustive work on the African-American experience, "Africana," Harvard University professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. writes that while black musicians were the principal innovators during this era, white musicians often reaped the fame and benefits and that "the black musicians who found greatest favor with whites were those with a happy-go-lucky air and a ready grin. "I guess when jazz [and] the Harlem Renaissance began to give birth people really felt the need to express themselves and that is similar to how hip-hop was created." As jazz started to gain popularity outside of black America in the 1940s and gained an international following, many say the music became distanced from its cultural origins. At the same time, there has been a rise of prominent black music executives such as Sean "P. Diddy" Combs, Jay-Z, Russell Simmons and Jermaine Dupri.
