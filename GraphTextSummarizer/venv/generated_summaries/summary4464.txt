-- President Obama's top economic adviser, Austan Goolsbee, is leaving the administration to return to the University of Chicago, the White House announced Monday night. In a statement announcing Goolsbee's departure, Obama called him "a close friend" and "one of America's great economic thinkers. But he said the economy was "a million miles" from its condition when Obama took office, "when the economy's losing 780,000 jobs a month and people are actively talking about will there be an end to the financial system in the United States." Sunday, Goolsbee told CNN's "State of the Union" that despite disappointing employment, manufacturing and housing price figures, the long-term trends remain positive. Goolsbee has been an outspoken defender of Obama's policies as the U.S. economy struggles to find its footing following the steep recession of 2007-09.
