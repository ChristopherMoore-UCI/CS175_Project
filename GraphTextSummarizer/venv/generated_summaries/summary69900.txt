In a video, which was sent as a YouTube link in an e-mail to the Estonian foreign ministry, one of the cyclists reads in English from a statement calling on Lebanese officials and the leaders of Saudi Arabia, Jordan and France to do anything in their power to get them back home. "The main thing now is for our seven fellow countrymen to get home to their families and loved ones as quickly as possible," Estonian Foreign Minister Urmas Paet said. They include Lebanese suspects and people of other nationalities, he said. -- Seven Estonian cyclists kidnapped in northern Lebanon in March were released Thursday, the Lebanese Army said. Lebanese Interior Minister Marwan Charbel told the LBC channel that 9 people implicated in the abduction of the Estonians have been arrested so far.
