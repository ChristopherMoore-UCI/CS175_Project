-- Metro stations get a bad reputation as dark, grimy places where travelers are as likely to catch a communicable disease as they are a train. It's claimed the city's underground rail network began life as a military facility and there are still lines and stations used exclusively by security services and government officials. Toledo (Naples, Italy) Opened in 2012, Toledo station defies its depth -- at 50 meters, one of the deepest in Naples -- with a design based around themes of light and water. Seeking to distinguish his design from the unobtrusive minimalism of other Frankfurt stations, architect Zbigniew Peter Pininski outdid himself with the fantastical entrance to Bockenheimer Warte. The driverless trains of Dubai's shiny new(ish) metro system might be mildly disconcerting, but not as much as the bizarre, but beautiful jellyfish dangling from the ceiling of the the Khalid Bin Al Waleed Station.
