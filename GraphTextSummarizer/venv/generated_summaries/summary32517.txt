China's propaganda system appears to be working hard to belittle U.S. President Barack Obama before he heads to Asia for three key multilateral meetings. Obama, of course, faces his own domestic political issues after the thumping his party received in Tuesday's midterms, and the incoming Republican Senate majority will be eager to work with the President to get tougher on China and assert U.S. power and influence in Asia. Push back over South China Sea: Obama should have the Department of Defense announce, in conjunction with Southeast Asian friends and allies, that it is implementing new moves to counter Chinese coercive moves in the South China Sea. Add in the fact that China's long and successful run of rapid investment and export-led growth is coming to an end with slack global demand and growing Chinese debt, and it's clear that Obama is arriving at a politically tense time in Beijing. During his time in Asia, Obama can begin to reverse the dangerous perception of a U.S. that is weakening while China rises.
