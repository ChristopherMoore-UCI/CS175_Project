The top GOP leaders were all re-elected: Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky will become majority leader, flanked by Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming and Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri. Firebrand Sen. Elizabeth Warren joined Senate Democratic leadership Thursday after Senate Democrats convened Thursday to assemble a leadership team for their role as the incoming minority caucus. Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi beat out Sen. Dean Heller of Nevada to lead the National Republican Senatorial Committee. And while not every Senate Democrat wants Warren, a high-profile, liberal junior senator in a leadership post, the leadership aide said "Reid will get his way." Sen. Jon Tester of Montana also joined the leadership team and will head the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee as Democrats look to reclaim the majority in 2016. To me that means changing leadership and it was just that simple.
