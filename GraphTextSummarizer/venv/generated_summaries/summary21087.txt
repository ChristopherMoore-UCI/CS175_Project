Here's another one from Siciliano: Create different passwords for every single online account. Siciliano said it's OK to link accounts sometimes, but you should try to think like a hacker when you're doing it. As a Wired writer's recent brush with hackers shows, there are plenty of ways for your cloud-based accounts -- Amazon, Apple, Google -- to be hacked. If he or she could get bank account info, reconsider. Use a bunch (maybe hundreds?) of different passwords.
