When a worker at an AT&T building in San Jose, California, took it upon herself to clean out an office refrigerator during her lunch hour Tuesday, the smell from the moldy food was so noxious that it sent seven of her co-workers to the hospital and prompted the evacuation of all 325 people in the building. -- We've all been there: reached for our food in the office refrigerator, only to recoil from the stench from the crammed containers of decomposing food. "It was like a brick wall hit you," employee Robin Leetieh told CNN affiliate KGO-TV. Barry Stallard of the San Jose fire department told the television station. She suffers from allergies, firefighters said, and had had nasal surgery.
