Cities all over the nation and all over the world are deploying these smartcard meters [and] there's a number of previously known problems with various parking meters in other cities. Scofflaws could hack the smart cards that access electronic parking meters in large cities around the United States, researchers are finding. " San Francisco launched a $35-million pilot project in 2003 to deploy smart meters around the city in an effort to thwart thieves, including parking control officers who were skimming money from the meters. To record the communication between the card and the meter, Grand purchased a smartcard shim -- an electrical connector that duplicates a smartcard's contact points -- and used an oscilloscope to record the electrical signals as the card and meter communicated. The smart cards pay for parking spots, and their programming could be easily changed to obtain unlimited free parking.
