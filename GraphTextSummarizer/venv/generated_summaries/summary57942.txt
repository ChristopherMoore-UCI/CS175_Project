Adrian Navarro-Canales was found sitting in an open-air food court near the heart of the Las Vegas Strip, close to the intersection of Las Vegas Boulevard and Tropicana Avenue, about 10:30 a.m., police spokesman Keith Paul told CNN. In the affidavit for the arrest warrant, the Clark County Coroner's Office estimated that the victims were killed the evening of September 17 in their apartment, CNN affiliate KLAS reported. Navarro-Canales was initially thought to have been a possible victim following the killing his mother and brother, but he became a suspect in the case, police said Tuesday. -- A 16-year-old Nevada boy sought in the killings of his younger brother and mother was taken into custody Wednesday morning by detectives, Henderson police said. His mother and brother were found stabbed to death in their apartment on Friday, police said earlier this week.
