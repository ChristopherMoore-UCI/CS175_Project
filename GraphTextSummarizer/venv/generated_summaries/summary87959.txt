Boehner calls for White House to release Benghazi emails An independent review of the Benghazi incident, led by Adm. Mike Mullen, a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and former ambassador Thomas R. Pickering, discovered no wrongdoing by Clinton. Soon after the hearing by the GOP-led House Oversight Committee looking into the events surrounding the death of the U.S. ambassador to Libya and three other Americans, a recently formed pro-Republican opposition research group blasted out an e-mail with the headline "Benghazi Hearing Raises Serious Questions About Clinton. But the story was given new legs thanks to the House hearing, which showcased the testimony of State Department whistleblowers who had not previously testified, including the riveting details from an official who was on the ground in Tripoli at the time of the attack in Benghazi. -- President Barack Obama's been in the bull's eye of Republicans and conservatives since 2008, but after Wednesday's hearing on last September's terror attack in Benghazi, Libya, many on the right are shifting their aim at former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. We're going to find people asleep at the switch when it comes to the State Department, including Hillary Clinton," added the South Carolina Republican, who's been a longtime critic of the administration's role in Benghazi.
