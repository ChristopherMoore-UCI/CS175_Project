-- Long Run edged outsider Captain Chris to reclaim the prestigious King George VI Chase crown at Kempton Park on Boxing Day. His half-brother, Kauto Stone, looked to keep the King George title in the family, but finished out of the placings, clearly struggling in the slow going under jockey Ruby Walsh. " Long Run joined greats such as Kauto Star and gray hero Desert Orchid in regaining the King George title after relinquishing it the year before. Long Run got up with two strides remaining to pip 16-1 shot Captain Chris, who had been given every chance by jockey Richard Johnson. The Nicky Henderson-trained winner was beaten by the now retired Kauto Star in last year's edition of the festive classic.
