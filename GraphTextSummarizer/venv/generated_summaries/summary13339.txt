He was a close associate of former Al-Shabaab leader Ahmed Abdi Godane, who was killed in a U.S. airstrike near Barawe city in September. Zakariya Ismail Ahmed Hersi, Al-Shabaab's intelligence chief, was captured in a house near the town of El Wak, Somali military commander Isack Hussein Mursal told state-run radio. Al-Shabaab has said that attack was revenge for the U.S. airstrike that killed Godane. Somali government forces on Saturday captured a top commander of the Islamist militant group Al-Shabaab, two of the country's military officials said. Somali forces captured Hersi and his driver without confrontation, officials said.
