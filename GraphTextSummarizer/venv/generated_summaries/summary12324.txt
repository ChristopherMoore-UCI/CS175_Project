North Korea upgrades space center for larger rockets A history of tunnels Four tunnels from the North have been found in all, although none since 1990. The military defector, who is not using his name as he still has family in the North, said North Koreans "usually pulled out soil and stones during the night so as not to be detected by the U.S. or South Korea. -- Gen. Hahn Sung-Chu never believed North Korea could dig a tunnel that reached Seoul -- until now. " A view from a former North Korean official But a former intelligence official from North Korea says the notion is not as far-fetched as it might sound. They dig into the ground vertically from 100 to 150 meters (328 to 492 feet) and slope upwards to South Korea so the water drains back to the North."
