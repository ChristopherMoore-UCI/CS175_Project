Come September 2015, Queen Elizabeth II will surpass Queen Victoria's record as Britain's longest reigning monarch, and if one was to think optimistically, should she live to the ripe old age of 108, she would break former King Sobhuza II of Swaziland's reign as the world's longest serving monarch. Queen Elizabeth continues to fulfill a jam-packed royal schedule and will travel to France later this week to mark the D-Day commemorations alongside her "strength and stay" Prince Philip who will celebrate his 93rd birthday next week. Due to her advancing age, Prince Charles has stepped in to represent his mother at several high profile engagements over the last year, most notably at the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in Sri Lanka last November, but this by no means indicates that he's planning a coup. In July 2013, 79-year-old Albert II of Belgium gave up his throne citing advancing age and health issues, and now comes word that King Juan Carlos of Spain, 76, has decided to abdicate after a reign that has spanned almost four decades. The popularity of the Spanish monarchy has nose-dived in recent years.
