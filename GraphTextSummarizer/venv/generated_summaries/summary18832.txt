In its European stores, Apple was offering modest discounts on products instead of gift cards. Instead of marking down prices on Macs or iPads, Apple is giving out Apple Store gift cards to purchasers of various products. -- It's a recent Thanksgiving custom as traditional as turkey, stuffing or collapsing on the couch while watching NFL football: the Apple Store's annual announcement of Black Friday discounts. Online and in its North American retail stores, Apple was offering gift cards of up to $150 for the purchase of a Mac, up to $75 for an iPad and up to $50 for an iPod. A number of items at the Microsoft Store are on sale, and the Sony Store also has a number of Black Friday deals.
