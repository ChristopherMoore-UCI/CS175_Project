Recording: 'Militants are going to come' Coulibaly was part of the same Islamic jihadist groups as Cherif and Said Kouachi, the brothers who police say committed Wednesday's massacre at the Charlie Hebdo magazine offices in Paris and were killed in a separate standoff north of Paris on Saturday, French police union spokesman Pascal Disant said. Paris police say that Coulibaly is suspected in Thursday's fatal shooting of a police officer in the Montrouge suburb, a day after the Charlie Hebdo massacre of 12 people and a day before the Friday market raid. The four hostages were killed by the gunman before police stormed the market, Paris prosecutor Francois Molins said Friday. Amedy Coulibaly apparently tried to justify himself to his hostages in a deadly standoff at a kosher market in eastern Paris -- and perhaps unbeknownst to him, a radio station was listening, a recording purportedly reveals. Officials say Coulibaly killed four hostages in the grocery store, and he was then shot and killed when police raided the store to free the hostages.
