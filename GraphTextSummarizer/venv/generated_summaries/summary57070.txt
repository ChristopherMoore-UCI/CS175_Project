The FDA panel looked at safety and efficacy data from three clinical trials: -- iPrEx, a study of men who have sex with men, found 43.8% fewer infections in men who got the drug versus those who got placebo; -- in a Truvada study carried out by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Botswana, infection rates were reduced by 63% overall in healthy men and women considered to be at high risk of infection; -- the University of Washington's Partners in PrEP study of serodiscordant couples in Kenya saw 62% fewer infections in those taking Truvada and a 73% reduction in those who took a combination of Truvada and the HIV drug tenofovir. "There is no question that, if efforts on using PrEP is widespread, condom use and other means of preventing HIV infection will decrease," said Robert Elliott, a registered nurse. Until then, PrEP is not and cannot be considered safe and effective for preventing HIV infections. "Regular HIV testing, adherence and behavioral counseling on safer sex practices, including condom use, are essential components of healthcare delivery around PrEP," he said. But, after assessing the data, they concluded that Truvada is safe for men and women and effective in preventing infection.
