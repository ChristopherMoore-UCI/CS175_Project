-- North Korea warned Friday it would launch a military strike against the South if Seoul goes ahead with live-fire drills near Yeonpyeong Island over the next five days, North Korea's state-run KCNA reported. Tensions mounted between the Koreas on November 23, when North Korea shelled the island, which lies in South Korean territory. The North has accused the South of provoking the attack because shells from a South Korean military drill landed in the North's waters. "If North Korea were to react to that in a negative way and fire back at those firing positions on the islands, that would start potentially a chain reaction of firing and counter-firing." South Korea "should take a prompt measure to stop the planned provocative maritime shelling from Yeonpyeong Island," the report said.
