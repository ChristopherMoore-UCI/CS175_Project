On Wednesday, a federal judge in Arizona entered "not guilty" pleas on behalf of Jared Lee Loughner, a 22-year-old Arizona man who faces 49 counts -- including murder and attempted murder -- related to the shooting. -- U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords plans to attend the launch of the space shuttle Endeavour next month -- a little more than three months after she was shot in the head outside a Tucson, Arizona, supermarket -- her spokesman said. Giffords has been at TIRR Memorial Hermann rehabilitation hospital in Houston -- not far from where Kelly does most of his training -- since January, when she was moved there from University Medical Center in Tucson. At the time, Giffords' spokesman C.J. Karamargin said the Arizona Democrat "fully understands" that her husband is flying the shuttle and supports his decision. According to NASA's website, the spacecraft is set to lift off at 7:48 p.m. on April 19 from Kennedy Space Center.
