In his 29 seasons, Torre has managed the Dodgers, the New York Mets, the Atlanta Braves, the St. Louis Cardinals and, most famously, the New York Yankees. In the Bronx, Torre won four World Series titles and six league crowns but left New York after 12 years when he angrily rejected the Yankees contract offer after the 2007 season. Mattingly, who was one of the most popular Yankees ever when he played, had interviewed in the past for the Yankees' position when Torre left and in the past offseason when the Indians were hiring (Manny Acta got the job). Frank McCourt, owner of the Dodgers, said to Mattingly after thanking Torre for reinstilling a winning attitude. The 70-year-old Torre will leave the Los Angeles Dodgers in the hands of his hitting coach, Don Mattingly, who has 2,318 victories fewer than his skipper.
