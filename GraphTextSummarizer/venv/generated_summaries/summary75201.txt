Stookesberry, in a dispatch published November 1 on Outside magazine's website, said team leader Coetzee offered safety advice. "The mission for the Africa kayak expedition was to run and document the unexplored whitewater of the region, while focusing on the people and clean water crisis in Central Africa," Eddie Bauer said. We would like to thank the IRC and Solidarites International, who continue to provide assistance and support to the team." Coetzee, known as Hendri, last posted an entry on his "The Great White Explorer" blog on November 26. -- A renowned South African whitewater guide and outdoorsman was apparently pulled from his kayak by a crocodile in the Democratic Republic of Congo and is presumed dead, expedition sponsor Eddie Bauer said. Hendrik Coetzee and two American kayakers, Ben Stookesberry and Chris Korbulic, were on the Lukuga River when the incident occurred Tuesday, the clothing and outdoor gear company said on its "Born Out There" blog.
