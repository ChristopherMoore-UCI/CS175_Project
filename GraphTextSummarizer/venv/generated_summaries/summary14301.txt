In the midst of a disheartening outbreak of measles and assorted other diseases we thought had been wiped out, comes another outbreak that has just gotten started: a GOP pander war. But somehow a clear issue of public health has morphed into a political debate over liberty, personal freedom and individual choice. Or that New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, looking to burnish his conservative credentials, allowed that parents "need to have some measure of choice" about vaccinating their kids (although he later tried to soften that statement by adding there's "no question" kids should be vaccinated against measles). In many ways, says Bill Galston, who was domestic policy adviser to former President Bill Clinton, "vaccines have become the black helicopter of medicine. And those parents who have apparently decided it is in their childrens' interests to forego vaccines are now smack in the middle of it, and with good reason: Outbreaks of the measles and whooping cough are back, endangering the youngest populations everywhere.
