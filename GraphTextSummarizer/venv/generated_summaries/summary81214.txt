-- The spokesman for Nigerian militant group Boko Haram has been captured after a months-long surveillance operation, a spokesman for Nigerian police said Wednesday. In 2009, Nigerian police forces moved to crack down on Boko Haram. "Boko Haram has perpetrated numerous human rights abuses and shows contempt for life, but the security forces have failed to prevent, investigate, prosecute or punish these acts and have often carried out new human rights violations with impunity," Amnesty said in a statement. Harsh police tactics led to an armed uprising and the arrest of Yusuf, who later died in police custody. Suspected Boko Haram members who have been rounded up have not been tried, and innocent women and children have been detained to gain information about male relatives suspected of offenses, the group said.
