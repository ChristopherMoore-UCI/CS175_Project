Take an infamous example of mistaken perception plucked from the news: So much of the encounter between Trayvon Martin and George Zimmerman had to do with context and perceptions, Benjamin says. It is in this way that perception often becomes the gateway to innovation and change. "I want to start with a game," says neuroscientist and artist Beau Lotto at the outset of his TED talk on perception. Echoing Frankl, Lotto says of those types of perceptions: "We are responding and not choosing. But people really need to learn to move between the "why" and the "how." Innovation and change are, at their very essence, a "why" proposition, says Jennifer Mueller, a psychologist and Wharton management professor who studies creativity.
