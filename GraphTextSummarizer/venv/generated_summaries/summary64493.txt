The statement comes after Yemen's foreign minister hinted that presidential elections could be delayed due to the rising tension in the country. Yahya al-Arasi, media officer for the vice president, told CNN that elections are essential for Yemen and the vice president has no plans to delay elections under any circumstance. He added, "If elections are delayed, Yemen will again start from step one, and the unexpected would take place. Qirbi's announcement also raised fears within opposition groups that President Ali Abdullah Saleh is again using tactics to stay in power. Abdul Jabbar said that Saleh was hoping to control Yemen indirectly after stepping down from power, but the tension between him and Hadi made that impossible.
