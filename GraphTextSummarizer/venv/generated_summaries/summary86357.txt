Following an education at the Ecole des Beaux Arts, Blanc first developed his passion for capturing the moment in equestrian events -- making a living out of depicting horses and their riders. Year after year, Joel Blanc makes the short pilgrimage from his Paris studio to the Stade Roland Garros for the tennis year's second grand slam, aiming to encapsulate the tournament's magic onto his canvas. " Blanc, who has covered other sports such as golf and rugby, thrives on the unpredictability of capturing these instant action moments. " When Blanc first put his easel on the side of a tennis court, he was unaware of the endless possibilities that were about to unfold both on court and in his mind. "I have to thank them for that as they obliged me not to be an artist just like that, they obliged me to learn anatomy at school," says Blanc, who was born in Toulon in the south of France.
