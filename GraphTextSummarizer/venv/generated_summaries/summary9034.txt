Scientists believe mad cow disease spreads when farmers feed cattle recycled meat and bones from infected animals. The government has been in crisis over a deal to resume imports of beef from the United States after a ban lasting several years due to fears of mad cow disease. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration bans the use of certain organs of cattle more than 30 months of age because they represent a greater threat for mad cow disease, but the agency considers the meat from those animals to be safe. Washington and Seoul reached an agreement in April that would clear the way for South Korea to resume importing beef from the United States, but Seoul now has reservations over the terms of the agreement, and South Korean negotiators held meetings in Washington on Wednesday to try to change the terms of the deal. The South Korean move stems from concerns that animals more than 30 months old are a greater risk for mad cow disease.
