Obama selecting Clinton as his running mate in 2008, after a sometimes biting primary season, would have rung hollow. Back in 2008, political strategists on both sides of the aisle could offer a litany of reasons why Obama defeated McCain -- from the Republican candidate being framed as an extension of George W. Bush, to Obama's charisma and an electorate excited by the opportunity to rewrite history. At this point, there is not much President Barack Obama can say that will win over conservatives, and given the current GOP field, he doesn't have to worry too much about losing liberals. Former Vice President Dick Cheney said he thought Clinton was going to win the Democratic nomination and that "she's probably the most competent person they've got in their Cabinet," and he suggested she should run against Obama in another primary. Quite a few low-profile supporters have expressed buyer's remorse -- not for picking Obama over McCain but for selecting Obama over Clinton.
