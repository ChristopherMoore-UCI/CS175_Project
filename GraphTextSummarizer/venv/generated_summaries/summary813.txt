The defense painted a picture of Hussein as a convicted felon who began working for the FBI as part of a plea bargain that kept him from jail and deportation, and paid him $100,000. The men were part of a year-long sting operation led by a paid FBI informant. Hickey described the informant, whose real name is Shaheed Hussein, as having been hired by the FBI to go to a certain mosque and listen for talk of violence against Americans. " Vincent L. Briccetti, attorney for Cromitie, called the 100 hours of videotaped conversations between the men "not a documentary but a work of fiction... a movie produced, directed, starred in, and edited by Shaheed Hussein and the FBI." Hickey further charged that Cromitie expressed his desire to "kill Jews" and make America "pay for Afghanistan and other Muslim countries," recruiting Williams and Williams -- who are not related -- along with Payen to be part of the mission to target Jewish institutions and military operations in the United States.
