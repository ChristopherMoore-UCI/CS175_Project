" Elshiekh visited Hysen Sherifi in a North Carolina jail in December, at which point Sherifi gave her a message to pass on to someone else, the criminal complaint states. A criminal complaint alleges that Elshiekh and the Sherifi brothers tried to pull off a plan to "murder and behead" three people who testified against Hysen Sherifi at his trial last year. " Prosecutors said Hysen Sherifi -- a native of Kosovo who is a U.S. legal permanent resident in North Carolina -- and as many as eight others were part of a homegrown terrorism ring between 2006 and 2009. Just nine days earlier, the man they were allegedly in collusion with -- Hysen Sherifi, who is Shkumbin Sherifi's brother -- was sentenced to 45 years in prison for being part of what prosecutors called a "violent jihad" that had conspired to kill people overseas and kill a federal officer. "During conversations ... he wants photographs taken, and provided (to) him, of the dead bodies and severed heads," an FBI special agent in charge noted after reviewing recordings between Hysen Sherifi and an informant.
