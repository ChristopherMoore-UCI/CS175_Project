President Bush walks down the White House Collonade on Tuesday as he departs for Camp David. -- President George W. Bush granted pardons Tuesday to 19 citizens charged with a variety of crimes, but none was prominent. It is unclear how many more requests Bush may grant before leaving office, although administration officials have said they do not expect any last-minute announcements, as was seen when President Bill Clinton pardoned fugitive financier Marc Rich, setting off a firestorm of controversy. Presidential pardon lists are being closely monitored in the final weeks of the Bush administration, particularly to see whether former vice presidential aide Lewis "Scooter" Libby will be granted the presidential favor. Those applying for a pardon through the Justice Department are required to wait at least five years after their conviction or release from confinement.
