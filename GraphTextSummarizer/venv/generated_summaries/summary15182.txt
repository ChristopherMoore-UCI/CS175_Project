" In a written statement issued Friday, Banco de Santander said it had planned to sell the bank to a Venezuelan private investors group, but "found afterward that the Venezuelan government was interested in [acquiring] Banco de Venezuela, and conversations are under way to that effect." -- President Hugo Chavez on Thursday ordered the nationalization of the Banco de Venezuela "to put it at the service of Venezuela" after denying approval for its sale. President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela says the banks owners aren't interested in selling but he's buying anyway. The banker had asked the Venezuelan government for permission needed to complete the deal, Chavez said. And to the Venezuelan banker: No," Chavez said.
