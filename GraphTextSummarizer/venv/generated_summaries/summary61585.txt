The families later arrived in San Francisco on Monday night, China Daily reported. "Our examination will determine whether (the death) was from the airplane crash or secondary incident," San Mateo County Coroner Robert Foucrault said. Then, with a stop in Seoul, South Korea, the flight headed for San Francisco. Instead, some members of the group are still hospitalized in San Francisco, waiting for their families, said Derek Swales, administrator for the school. Students from the group were carrying bags and blankets labeled "Salvation Army" when they arrived at a San Francisco hotel on Monday.
