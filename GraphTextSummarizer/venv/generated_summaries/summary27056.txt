-- Kentucky Senate candidate Alison Lundergan Grimes refused to say whether she voted for Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012, instead deflecting the question by insisting that her race "isn't about the President." She did, however, lend her support to another major Democratic political figure: Former President Bill Clinton. The energy-rich state is known for its coal industry, prompting Grimes to release a "Pro Coal plan" while other Democrats, including the President, have bristled at Kentucky's sky high carbon emissions. Clinton, an active campaigner for Grimes, is a decades-old friend of Grimes father, the former chairman of the Kentucky Democratic Party. On her campaign website, Grimes calls Obama's policies on coal "misguided," arguing that his efforts "harm hard-working Kentuckians and their families."
