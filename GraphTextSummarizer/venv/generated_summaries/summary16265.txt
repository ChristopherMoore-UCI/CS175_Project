Wozniacki, being supported at Flushing Meadows by golfing boyfriend Rory McIlroy, had a slightly easier task against Chinese qualifier Duan Ying-Ying. Wimbledon semifinalist and 14th seed Jerzy Janowicz was knocked out in the first round at Flushing Meadows for the second year in a row, losing in straight sets to Argentina's Maximo Gonzalez. Another former No.1, Serbia's Ana Ivanovic, also showed good early form with a straight sets win over Georgian Anna Tatishvili 6-2 6-0. Novak Djokovic made short work of his first round opponent, defeating Lithuanian Ricardas Berankis 6-1 6-2 6-2 in 81 minutes. He will play Argentina's Carlos Berlocq in the second round, with a possible quarterfinals against No.2 seed Rafael Nadal on the horizon.
