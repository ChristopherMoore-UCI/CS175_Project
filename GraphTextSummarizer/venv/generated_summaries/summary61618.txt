Haug assumed the position in 1990 and the German manufacturer has since enjoyed success in a range of motorsport disciplines, including Formula One and Touring Cars. -- German Norbert Haug is to step down as head of Mercedes-Benz Motorsport after over 20 years in the position and a plethora of titles. " Mercedes' F1 prospects for 2013 have been boosted by the arrival of 2008 world champion Lewis Hamilton from the company's partner and fellow constructor McLaren, while triple world champion Niki Lauda will liaise between the board and the team in a non-executive director role. One of Haug's biggest achievements was to oversee Mercedes' rebirth as an F1 team in 2010 after 55 years out of the sport, though the team has only won one Grand Prix over the last two years. "Norbert Haug was the face of the Mercedes-Benz Motorsport programme for more than 20 years," said Dr. Dieter Zetsche, head of Mercedes-Benz cars.
