Mahmood Al Zarooni, who worked at the world famous Godolphin stables in the English town of Newmarket, was banned from horse racing after admitting injecting his thoroughbreds with steroids.

A horse racing trainer who became engulfed in a doping scandal and was banned from the sport for eight years has appealed his sentence, the British Horseracing Authority (BHA) has confirmed.
