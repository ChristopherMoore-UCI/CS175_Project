Neil Young has filed for divorce from Pegi Young, his wife of 36 years and frequent musical collaborator. Neil first met Pegi when she was working as a waitress at a diner near his California ranch, a story he tells in the 1992 song "Unknown Legend." Pegi is the inspiration for some of Young's most enduring love songs, including "Such a Woman," "Unknown Legend" and "Once an Angel." Neil recently wrapped up a European Crazy Horse tour and is slated to play American solo acoustic dates in October. They raise funds for it every year with an all-star concert in Mountain View, California.
