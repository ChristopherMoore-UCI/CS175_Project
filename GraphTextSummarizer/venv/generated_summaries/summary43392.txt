Fernando Alonso says the reaction of his fellow drivers to Formula One's controversial new rule changes after the opening Grand Prix of the season was "hot-headed." The Spaniard claimed victory in Bahrain on his debut for Ferrari but fellow drivers Michael Schumacher, Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button were critical of 2010's new laws. " Alonso and teammate Felipe Massa gave Ferrari the perfect start to the season with a one-two in Bahrain, but the Spaniard says no-one is getting carried away. "We have to see how the tyres behave with different fuel loads and temperatures, which will be different from the ones we had during testing and in Bahrain. He said on Ferrari's official Web site: "I think that many of us have given some hot-headed comments immediately after the race in Bahrain. "We have to wait and see different races and check the situation, without being emotional.
