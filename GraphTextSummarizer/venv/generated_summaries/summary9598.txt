In October, the World Health Organization said the number of new cases in Liberia was declining, with fewer burials, plateauing lab confirmations and less-cramped hospitals. The  virus has killed about 9,365 people mostly in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, according to the World Health Organization. Liberia closed its borders with Sierra Leone and Guinea in July in response to the outbreak. In contrast, a total of 52 new cases were reported in Guinea while Sierra Leone had 74. About 3,900 of the deaths have been in Liberia, which was so badly affected, it declared a shortage of body bags last year.
