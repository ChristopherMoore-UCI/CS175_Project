Rachel Lee, 21, was sentenced for burglarizing two years ago the home of reality star Audrina Patridge of "The Hills," Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney Chris Baker said. -- A leader of the so-called "Bling Ring" that burglarized celebrity homes in Los Angeles was sentenced Tuesday to four years in prison, a prosecutor said. The ring is accused of allegedly taking more than $3 million in jewelry, designer clothes and accessories from the homes of Orlando Bloom, Paris Hilton, Brian Austin-Green and Megan Fox, Lindsay Lohan and Patridge between September 2008 and August 2009, prosecutors said. The group targeted celebrities such as actress Rachel Bilson, police said, because it was known she had a large collection of Chanel. "There's nothing to suggest that these kids were criminal masterminds -- this wasn't an 'Ocean's 11' caper," Los Angeles Police Department Officer Brett Goodkin told CNN in 2009.
