it was dire," recalled Jia-Bin Duh, who in March 1994 -- on his second day on the job as president of Microsoft China -- met his new boss, Bill Gates, off a plane in Beijing for a series of icy meetings with the Chinese leadership. Sixteen years to the day before Google's March 22 announcement on leaving China, Microsoft Chairman Gates was in Beijing preparing to meet then-China President Jiang Zemin. "It was not so pleasant," recalled Duh, a Taiwan-born technology executive who was recruited away from HP China to be on hand when Gates met Chinese government officials. They were told "China is a country with a long history -- everything has to go through several stages of development," said Duh, who left Microsoft in 1998 to head Cisco Systems China. That trip came as rancor between the U.S. and China -- and Microsoft -- was high over piracy, intellectual property rights and Beijing's fight for the renewal of its most-favored trade status with Washington, which was then under threat by the Clinton administration For Microsoft, the trip was part of a full-court press to allow Microsoft to license a Chinese version of DOS and Windows for sale in the country.
