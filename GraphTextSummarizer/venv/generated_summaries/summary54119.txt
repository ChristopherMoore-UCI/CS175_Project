-- Rafael Nadal is known as the undisputed king of clay with seven French Open titles to his name -- but the Spaniard was given an almighty scare in the quarterfinals of the Monte Carlo Masters Friday. " Dimitrov, 21, is rated as one of the most exciting prospects in world tennis and for a while looked set to become the first man to defeat Nadal in Monte Carlo since 2003. "It's an incredible challenge," Tsonga told reporters of his upcoming contest with Nadal. Nadal, who has won the past eight editions of the tournament, was made to fight all the way by Bulgaria's Grigor Dimitrov before eventually prevailing 6-2 2-6 6-4. That record had looked in doubt until his opponent began to suffer with cramp in his leg, allowing Nadal to emerge victorious.
