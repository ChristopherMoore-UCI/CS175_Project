Presented with a stark choice between bigger government and smaller government, where are voters likely to come down? The first was 1964, when Lyndon Baines Johnson was holding up the Democratic standard, calling for government to create a Great Society with a cornucopia of new federal programs. Only twice before in the lives of most voters have we seen an election offering such radically different visions about the role of government in national life. Score one for smaller government. But there should be no doubt that the two tickets stand behind radically different visions of the role of government and individuals.
