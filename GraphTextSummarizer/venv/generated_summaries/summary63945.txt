Peterson, 58, was married to Savio in 2001 when he had an affair with then-17-year-old Stacy Kales, who later became Stacy Peterson. In April, an Illinois appellate court ruled that prosecutors may use potentially incriminating statements made by Savio and Drew Peterson's still-missing wife Stacy against him, a key development in the case. Peterson also remains under investigation in the October 2007 disappearance of his fourth wife, Stacy Peterson. The ruling overturned an earlier judge's decision that forbade prosecutors from using eight statements made by Savio before her death and by Stacy Peterson before her disappearance. -- Attorneys for Drew Peterson, a former Chicago-area police officer accused of murdering his third wife, argued during opening statements Tuesday that their client spent his career protecting the public and that murder accusations are groundless.
