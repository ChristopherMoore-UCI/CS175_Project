Despite President Barack Obama's signing of a law repealing the military's "don't ask, don't tell" policy, Defense Secretary Robert Gates sent a memo to troops warning them that it remains in effect until 60 days after the government certifies that the military is ready for implementation. But Lapan said those dismissals had been approved prior to Oct. 21, when Gates tightened the rules about who in the Pentagon can dismiss a service member for violating the policy. Gates also said he now endorses all the recommendations of the Pentagon's working group on "don't ask, don't tell" as the road map for implementation. Since October, the military has dismissed at least eight service members for violations of the policy, according to Pentagon spokesman Col. David Lapan. Now, only the civilian service secretaries, in consultation with the Pentagon's top lawyer and head of personnel, can order dismissals.
