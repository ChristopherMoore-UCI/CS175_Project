The commerce clause gives Congress authority to regulate interstate commerce. But this argument relies on shifting the focus from health insurance to health care. As the lower court decision in this case explained, the government's position "amounts to an argument that the mere fact of an individual's existence substantially affects interstate commerce, and therefore Congress may regulate them at every point of their life." If Congress could use that clause to regulate mere failure to buy a product on the grounds that such inaction has an economic effect, there would be no structural limits to its power. The answer seems to be that failure to buy insurance thereby has adverse economic effects on producers.
