The three men who the FBI announced it is seeking information about could "possibly be implicated" in the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, that killed U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans, a federal law enforcement official said Wednesday. The photos came from surveillance video taken the night of the attack on a diplomatic facility and CIA annex. The FBI released pictures of the three men -- each labeled as "unknown person" -- on its website and asked people to e-mail tips to BenghaziTips@ic.fbi.gov. "This is thoroughly thought out," the federal law enforcement official told CNN, adding the first step is not to just "blast out photos. The official said the men were at the scene of the September 11 attack, and it is unclear if they were involved or just could have knowledge about what occurred that night.
