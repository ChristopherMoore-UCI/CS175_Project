-- Facebook games will have to reveal any in-app charges and will no longer be allowed to give players bonuses for "liking" their pages under new rules rolled out for developers this week. The changes were part of a new version of the platform developers use to build games and other apps and share them with Facebook users. So-called "freemium" games and other apps have become a popular choice for developers using Facebook or other platforms, like Apple's iOS and Google's Android mobile operating systems. It's not uncommon for games to offer players extra in-game items for liking their page. In most cases, they can then play a basic version of that game, but get access to new content or in-game items that help their progress by paying.
