McDaniel campaign manager and Mississippi state Sen. Melanie Sojourner saw the post at around 1 a.m. Saturday and "was alarmed that it was likely Ms. Cochran who had been photographed based on the preponderance of evidence, including the name of the rest home and the comments on the blog," said Fritsch. Donald Clark, an attorney for Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Mississippi, and his wife, Rose, told The Clarion-Ledger newspaper that the woman in question is Rose, saying the Cochrans' "privacy and dignity have been violated." Sen. McDaniel has denounced the break-in and called Sen. Cochran to extend his condolences. "I've reached out to Sen. Cochran directly to express my abhorrence for the reprehensible actions of this individual. My thoughts and prayers are with Sen. Cochran and his family," McDaniel said in a statement.
