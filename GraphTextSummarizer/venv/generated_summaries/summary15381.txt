Chrome rose 0.3 percentage points to 7.1 percent of share, said Net Applications, which monitors browser usage on a network of Web sites. Because Web usage is increasing, the absolute number of people using a browser can increase even as its fractional share of usage drops. (CNET)  -- Google's Chrome browser continued to carve away share of worldwide browser usage from rivals in May, new statistics show. Even though IE lost share overall, Microsoft can point to progress in upgrading: The various versions of IE8 accounted for 28.9 percent of usage. With the iPad now for sale internationally, usage peaked May 29 with 0.17 percent.
