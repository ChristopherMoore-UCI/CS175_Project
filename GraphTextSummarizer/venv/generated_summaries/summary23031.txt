But District Attorney John Champion would not say what led investigators to believe Jessica Chambers wasn't alone just before the fire burned her and the car Saturday night near a rural road near Courtland, Mississippi. After obtaining warrants and cracking a password, police were able to access Chambers' phone records and are following up on leads, a prosecutor said Thursday. He said Thursday that one thing struck him as odd: Chambers pumped $14 worth of gas. On Thursday, Champion spoke at a news conference, pleading for public help with the case and asking anyone with information, even if they think it's insignificant, to talk to police. Chambers' funeral will be Saturday in Batesville, a small town in northwest Mississippi.
