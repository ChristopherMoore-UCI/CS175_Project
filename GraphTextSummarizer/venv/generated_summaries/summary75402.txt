"Credit to Ireland -- they are deserved winners and it's a fitting finale and sendoff for Brian O'Driscoll, a legend of the game whom everyone in this squad respects massively," said England head coach Stuart Lancaster. -- Ireland gave Brian O'Driscoll a dramatic farewell to international rugby by clinching the Six Nations title with a tense 22-20 victory over France in Paris on Saturday. The victory margin gave Ireland the title by 10 points on differential from England, who won the two teams' encounter 13-10 at Twickenham last month. The video official missed a knock-on by Szarzewski when the hooker touched down, but the home fans were left frustrated when a late match-winning score in the corner was ruled out following several TV replays for a forward pass by Pascal Pape. and I know now why I'm packing it in because 80 minutes is a long bloody time at international level, particularly with guys like Mathieu Bastereaud running at you -- it's no fun."
