Ailing German champions Bayern Munich thrashed second-placed Bayer Leverkusen 5-1 on Sunday to boost the club's hopes of European Champions League football next season. Heynckes, who has coached Bayern on two previous occasions, is set to move to the Allianz Arena next season as a replacement for sacked Dutch coach Louis van Gaal. Van Gaal guided Bayern to a domestic league and cup double last season, also losing in the Champions League final, but the 59-year-old lost his job after last weekend's draw with Nuremberg. A neat move between Ribery and Belgium defender Daniel van Buyten led to Bayern's fifth and final goal with 15 minutes remaining. The 25-year-old scored his treble between an early Simon Rolfes own-goal and a late strike from French winger Franck Ribery, with Switzerland striker Eren Derdiyok restoring some pride for Jupp Heynckes' team.
