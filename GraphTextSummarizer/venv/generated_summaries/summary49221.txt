According to his enemies -- and there are still as many of those as there have ever been -- this is Rupert at his cynical, death-defying, manipulative worst, seeking to convince the world that his Augean Stables have been swept clean and that his commitment to tabloid newsprint remains undimmed, even as rumors abound of more imminent arrests of Sun journalists for bribing police and other public officials. Either way, realistically the ultimate strategic decision will lie in New York rather than London, within the boardrooms of News Corp. and its institutional shareholders. According to his friends -- and there are still many in journalism, even if British politicians are for once giving him a very wide berth -- this is Rupert Murdoch at his back-to-the-wall, defiant, unpredictable best: pulling rabbits out of hats, raising rock-bottom morale and announcing the launch of a new Sunday tabloid to replace the defunct News of the World. Proof, they say, that he still has newspaper ink running through his veins and -- while still committed to rooting out past criminal activity -- is intent on demonstrating that there is still a market for good, old-fashioned, raucous, tub-thumping Sunday tabloid journalism. So is the Sun on Sunday a last hurrah or a phoenix from the ashes?
