Led by "Two and a Half Men" on CBS and featuring no less than three newcomers -- CBS' "2 Broke Girls," Fox's "New Girl" and ABC's "Last Man Standing" -- sitcoms have dominated the Top 10 scripted programs in the weekly rankings (based on delivery of the advertiser-coveted 18-49 demographic). Speaking of unscripted programs, expanded editions of "The X Factor" -- coupled with Fox's commitment to post-season Major League Baseball coverage -- led the network to pull its shiny "New Girl" off the schedule until November 1. Asked how it is that "New Girl" is even growing out of "Glee," Beckman cites a good fit between the shows, as well as the 9 p.m. hour's older-skewing competition (reality juggernaut "Dancing With the Stars" included). "It's been a while since that's been the case," says Kelly Kahl, senior executive vice president of CBS Primetime. "New Girl," "Last Man Standing" (which debuted to 13 million viewers) and ABC's Emmy-adorned "Modern Family" round out the crowd.
