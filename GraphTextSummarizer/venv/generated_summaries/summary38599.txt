Bill Cosby is returning to NBC with a new sitcom, a network representative told CNN on Wednesday night. He most recently received the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor, which is awarded to performers who use comedy to influence American society. He eventually landed a pivotal co-starring role in the 1960s television series "I Spy," where he was the first-ever African-American lead in a weekly dramatic series. "The Cosby Show" portrayed an upper-middle-class African-American family, and it's credited with helping revive NBC's fortunes and blazing a path for other shows featuring African-Americans. He won three best actor Emmy Awards for the role of undercover CIA Agent Alexander Scott.
