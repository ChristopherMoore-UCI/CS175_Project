Makes and models affected by the recall are: -- 2011 to 2013 Chrysler Sebrings, Chrysler 200s and Dodge Avenger midsize cars. Chrysler took the preemptive step this week of recalling nearly half a million vehicles because of issues with the active head-restraint function found in several makes and models. Chrysler stated earlier this month that it would not comply with the demand to recall vehicles that, the government said, had a high risk of catching fire when struck from behind. Because of such defective microcontrollers in some vehicles, the active head restraints -- which are supposed to automatically move forward during some rear-impact crashes, thereby helping prevent neck injuries -- aren't working properly. Even then, the company still claimed the 2.7 million recalled vehicles -- 1993 to 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokees and 2002 to 2007 Jeep Libertys -- are safe.
