That's what happened to a 7-year-old white Arabian named William, said Santa Barbara Harbor Patrol Officer Ryan Kelly. Rescue personnel from the nearby Carpenteria Fire Department, along with state lifeguards, took to the water to search for the horse, and a helicopter was launched by Santa Barbara County's search and rescue team. The drama unfolded Tuesday about 6:30 p.m. when the horse bolted from the beach in Summerland, just south of Santa Barbara, and ran into the ocean. William was spotted more than two miles offshore in the Santa Barbara Channel, swimming toward oil rigs, according to an incident report. Photos and video taken of the rescue show Kelly and others placing a tow line under the horse's saddle and securing it to the boat.
