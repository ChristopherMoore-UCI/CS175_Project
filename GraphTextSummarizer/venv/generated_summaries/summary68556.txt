Police in Peoria, Arizona, say Almaleki struck his 20-year-old daughter, Noor Faleh Almaleki, and her friend Amal Edan Khalaf with the Jeep Laredo he was driving in a parking lot in Peoria on October 20. Almaleki was angry with his daughter "as she had become too 'Westernized' and was not living according to [the family's] traditional Iraq[i] values," Peoria police said in a statement last week. After the incident, Almaleki drove to Mexico, abandoning his vehicle in Nogales, Peoria police said in a statement Friday. -- Authorities said Friday that an Iraqi man accused of running down his daughter in Arizona because she had become "too Westernized" has been taken into custody in Atlanta, Georgia. Authorities arrested him late Thursday afternoon when he arrived at Atlanta's airport, police said, and he is awaiting extradition to Arizona.
