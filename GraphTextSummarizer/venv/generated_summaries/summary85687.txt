-- Richard Phillips, the cargo-ship captain whose capture by pirates triggered a dramatic U.S. Navy rescue off the coast of Africa, called on the federal government Thursday to provide military escorts for international shipping vessels. "The renewed threat of piracy demands a multifaceted, multinational effort, one that coordinates the world's naval powers, the United Nations, the international shipping community, and the nations that border Somalia," said Sen. John Kerry, D-Massachusetts, at the start of the committee's hearing. Phillips said the optimum situation for cargo vessels would be to have military escorts. Phillips was in command of the Maersk Alabama when it was boarded by pirates off the coast of Somalia on April 8. The official said the bodies were turned over to police authorities from Puntland, a self-declared autonomous state in northern Somalia.
