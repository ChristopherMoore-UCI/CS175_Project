"At 5 o'clock that evening, Jeff Neilson, Tracey's husband of only five months, found her dead inside their apartment at the Jamestown Square Apartments in Moore," the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation said in a statement. That's what authorities in Oklahoma are hoping in the 34-year-old murder of Tracey Neilson. The last ticket in the book is for work done at Neilson's home the morning she was murdered -- January 5, 1981. They are offering up to $11,000 for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the person who killed Neilson. During the next 34 years, dozens of OSBI agents would work on the case."
