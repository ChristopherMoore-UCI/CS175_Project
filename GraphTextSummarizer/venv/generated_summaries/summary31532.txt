CT after the pilot was alerted to a mechanical issue, airline spokeswoman Laura Masvidal said. -- Two American Airlines flights flew back to Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport early Monday because of unrelated technical issues. Masvidal did not say what the mechanical issue was. The Boeing 777-200, carrying 223 passengers and 14 crew members, turned back to have the issue checked out but did not have to make an emergency landing, Masvidal said. The second flight, AAL 997, was over the Gulf of Mexico on its way to Buenos Aires, Argentina, when a problem with pressurization turned up.
