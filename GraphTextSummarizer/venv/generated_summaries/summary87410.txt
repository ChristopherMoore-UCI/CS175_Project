A new San Francisco law goes into effect on Thursday that prevents fast-food restaurants from giving away trinkets, action figures and other toys in their kid's meals unless their food meets nutritional requirements. The current Happy Meal consisting of a hamburger, kid's-size fries and a cola would meet the calorie, calories from fat, sodium and trans fat requirements under the San Francisco law. "Our efforts are geared towards addressing childhood obesity epidemic," said San Francisco City and County Supervisor Eric Mar, who proposed the ordinance. However, the new version of the Happy Meal still does not meet the requirements of the San Francisco law. Although the San Francisco law has been criticized as legislating health and nutrition, Mar said the responsibility ultimately falls on the parents.
