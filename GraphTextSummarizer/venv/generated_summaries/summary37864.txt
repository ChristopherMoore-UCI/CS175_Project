Venezuela and Cuba maintain close military ties, and Cuba sent hundreds of military and intelligence advisers to aid Chavez while he was president. Venezuelan Vice President Nicolas Maduro, who will be sworn in as interim president later Friday, laid a replica of the sword that South American hero Simon Bolivar used on top of Chavez's flag-draped casket. "That's why today we say from our hearts, we forgive those who have defamed you." Chavez had asked Maduro and other top leaders what they would do when he died, the vice president said. Hollywood actor and Chavez friend Sean Penn was at the funeral, as was the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who offered a prayer. Chavez left behind a mixed legacy: He is credited with putting the nation's poor at the center of his policies, but also had an authoritarian streak that garnered criticism from defenders of human rights and press freedom.
