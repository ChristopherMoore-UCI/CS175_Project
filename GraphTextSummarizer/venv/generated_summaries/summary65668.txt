"I leave sad because of the pain of our people but with my head held high," a teary-eyed Bachelet said in a brief farewell address from the La Moneda presidential palace in Santiago, Chile's capital. Pinera, 60, succeeded Michelle Bachelet, a popular president who steered the country through the global economic downturn and promoted progressive social reforms. -- Sebastian Pinera was sworn in Thursday as president of Chile, taking over a country battered by a recent earthquake but with a strong economy and stable social institutions. Under Chile's constitutional term limits, Bachelet could not run for a second consecutive four-year term. Educated in Chile and at Harvard University in the United States, Pinera is an economist, investor, businessman and former senator.
