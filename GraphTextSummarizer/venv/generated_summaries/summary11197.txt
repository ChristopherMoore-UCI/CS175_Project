The April 20 explosion on the Deepwater Horizon led to the worst oil spill in U.S. history, with more than 200 million gallons of oil released into the Gulf. "Throughout this process, public health and safety has been our primary goal," said FDA Commissioner Margaret A. Hamburg. -- All federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico closed to fishing because of last year's oil spill have reopened, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said Tuesday, one day before the one-year anniversary of the disaster. At its peak in June, 37 percent of Gulf waters, or 88,522 square miles, were closed to fishing. The announcement came as the administration reopened the final 1,041 square miles of waters immediately surrounding the Deepwater Horizon wellhead, just east of Louisiana.
