Another light moment came when the prosecutor asked Weeks why he and Bulger had worn gloves while wiping down several guns, and Weeks laughed, "It's common sense among criminals." Weeks wrote a book called "Brutal: The Untold Story of my Life inside Whitey Bulger's Irish Mob," in part to compensate victims as part of a civil suit against him. " "The balloon's rising," Weeks radioed Bulger as Halloran got up from his table. Bulger imitates machine gun, talks about a killing in recorded jail visit Weeks testified that on May 11, 1982, while Halloran was at the Mullins Club, Bulger pulled up in his souped-up 1975 Chevy Malibu wearing a wig and floppy mustache to disguise himself as another crime associate. As he began to make his way out of the club, Weeks radioed Bulger, referring to Halloran as "balloon head," a nickname they used because "Halloran's head was so big. " Weeks said he saw Bulger slide across the seat of the Chevy and call out to Halloran.
