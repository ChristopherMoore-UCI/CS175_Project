Kenya claimed middle-distance victories as David Rudisha and Silas Kiplagat won the 800m and 1,500m respectively, while Britain's Mohammed Farah edged out U.S. runner Bernard Lagat in the 5,000m. Americans dominated the women's 200m, with Carmelita Jeter (22.20) heading home world champion Allyson Felix (22.32) and Shalonda Solomon (22.63) while compatriot Bianca Knight was fourth in 22.71. In the men's 400m hurdles, Olympic champion Angelo Taylor defeated fellow American Bershawn Jackson while Britain's David Greene was third. The Jamaican, who will defend three titles at the World Athletics Championships in South Korea starting at the end of next month, was far from top form as he edged out compatriot Nesta Carter. American Michael Rodgers was third in 9.96 ahead of a third Jamaican, Michael Frater, who clocked 10.01. It was 0.3s slower than his world record and 0.1s behind the 2011 leading time by fellow Jamaican Asafa Powell, who heads the series' point standings.
