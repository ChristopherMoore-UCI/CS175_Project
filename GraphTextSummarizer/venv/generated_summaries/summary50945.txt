Suleman emphasized repeatedly to Winfrey that she's determined to take care of her brood on her own, without government assistance and without turning to adoption or foster care. "That [Star magazine] photo shoot was $100,000," Suleman said on Winfrey's show via satellite from California, referring to the January cover that depicted her "bikini body. But even so, Suleman says she is constantly counting heads, making bottles or keeping a child from hurting another, as was revealed when Winfrey's camera crew spent 24 hours in her home. At the start of the interview, Winfrey made it clear that Harpo Productions, her multimedia company, didn't pay Suleman "a dime" and, in fact, Suleman approached Winfrey to tell her side of the story. "Everything that [the media] have said so far about me, and about me wanting to do this on purpose -- I never wanted to use children for fame," Suleman said, adding that her rationale for implanting eight embryos at one time stemmed from a variety of factors.
