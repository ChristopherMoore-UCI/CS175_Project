Usain Bolt will retire from athletics after the 2017 World Championships in London, he confirmed in an interview to a British tabloid published Saturday. The Jamaican sprint star -- who has won six Olympic gold medals and is the reigning world record holder over the 100 meter and 200 meter disciplines -- had previously intimated he would quit the sport after the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro. Bolt also indicated he will be looking to beat his own 100m world record of 9.58 seconds that he recorded at the 2009 World Championships in Berlin. But he still took gold in the Commonwealth Games 100m relay in Glasgow, his first Commonwealth medal. "If everything goes well this season... in my life anything is possible," he said "If I can get myself in good shape, it should be wonderful this season.
