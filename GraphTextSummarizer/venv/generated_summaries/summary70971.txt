According to the Justice Department, the agreement also requires Transocean to take steps to improve performance and avoid a repeat of the disaster, which began after the Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded nearly a mile above BP's sea-floor Macanado well, killing 11 workers on board. BP contracted Transocean to do the drilling and had BP officials on the rig. That suit, filed by a large group of states, individuals, businesses and the federal government, seeks compensation from BP, Transocean, Halliburton and other companies involved in the disaster for damages incurred from the spill. The blast and ensuing fire damaged the rig and caused 4.9 million barrels of oil to leak out into the Gulf, according to a 2011 report by the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling. In addition to the civil penalties, Transocean Deepwater pleaded guilty last week to a criminal violation of the Clean Water Act.
