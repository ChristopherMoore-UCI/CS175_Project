As with last year's original iPad and the iPhone 4, we anticipate crowds and long lines at various Apple retail stores across the United States. Tips from iLine veterans Having covered -- and waited in -- numerous iLines in the past, these are my suggestions: -- Best Buy, Target or Walmart stores near an Apple retail store are likely to be less crowded. Online or in-store With the original iPad and the iPhone 4, Apple allowed individuals to place pre-orders online or to reserve a device for in-store pickup. We imagine that at least some iPad 2 inventory will be delivered for the weekend, which means that Saturday mornings are a good time to try local stores -- and if you're brave -- the Apple Store. On Friday March 11, Apple's iPad 2 will become available for purchase online and in retail stores.
