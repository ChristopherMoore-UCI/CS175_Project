Patrick Kennedy: Brain research is the new 'moon shot' That call, as Kennedy likes to point out, came May 25, 1961 -- a half-century ago. If Kennedy has his way, 50 years from now the world will remember next week as the first step on one of the great triumphant journeys -- like the call by Patrick's uncle, President John F. Kennedy, that sent men to the moon. It was about special education, the cause championed by his aunts Eunice Kennedy Shriver, who founded the special Olympics, and Jean Kennedy Smith, who received the Presidential Medal of Freedom for promoting the artistic talents of people with disabilities. The 43-year-old Kennedy left Congress in January, after spending more than half his life in public office. Kennedy says he was tired of struggling with the stress of public office.
