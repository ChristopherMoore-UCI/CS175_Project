-- Two Egyptians allegedly tried to set themselves on fire but security guards stopped them from carrying out the acts, an Egyptian Interior Ministry official confirmed to CNN Wednesday. In an incident Monday night, Ahmed Hashem Sayed, a 25-year-old unemployed construction worker in Alexandria, Egypt, slashed his wrists, set himself on fire, and died of his injuries, the Egyptian Interior Ministry official said. In Algeria, security officials said Sunday that three people set themselves on fire. The men's attempts are the latest in a series of self-immolation incidents that began last month in restive Tunisia, when Mohamed Bouazizi, a 26-year-old unemployed college graduate, set himself on fire after police took away his fruit cart. Since then, more such incidents are being reported from other countries such as Egypt, Algeria and Mauritania -- where other people are turning to self-immolation, some for apparent social and personal reasons.
