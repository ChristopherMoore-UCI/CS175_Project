-- A Florida highway patrolman who ordered the opening of an interstate highway, despite dense fog and smoke from a nearby brush fire, had not received any formal training on opening or closing roads and was not aware of the agency's relevant policy or procedures, according to an investigation into the deadly January crashes that left 11 people dead. After Gourley reopened the highway, there were not adequate resources dedicated to monitor subsequent road conditions, the report found. Gourley cited the potential for secondary crashes as a result of prolonged road closures based on his prior experience as a reason for the decision. The report said troopers did not act with criminal intent but also "failed to adequately communicate critical information amongst themselves regarding the fire on Paynes Prairie." The report also blamed the agency for failing "to adequately create and implement effective guidelines" for its troopers to follow when dealing with poor visibility on roadways.
