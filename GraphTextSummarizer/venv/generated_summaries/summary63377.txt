Iran under Rouhani's presidency is unlikely to change the current status quo, push for regime change in Syria, ask Assad to step aside as many Western and Arab Gulf states did, or halt any political, military, intelligence and advisory assistance to Assad's ruling Alawite and socialist Bath party, due to the belief that they will be ideologically and religiously weakening their own regional influence and foreign policy leverage. Although Rouhani argues for constructive interactions with other countries and although he supports applying a softer political tone -- as opposed to the combative, controversial and provocative language that Mahmoud Ahmadinejad or other hardliners utilize -- when dealing with the international community and regional state actors in regards to Syria, Rouhani has not called for an overall sweeping shift in Iran's foreign policy. More fundamentally, because of the role the Supreme Leader plays in Iran's foreign policy objectives, it would be unrealistic to argue that Rouhani would alter Iran's current political status quo towards Assad's regime. Considering the aforementioned factors: the president's limited control over directing foreign policy compared to the Supreme Leader's more powerful role, the centrist and moderate ideologies, as well as the geopolitical, and ideological elements surrounding the issue , it is more likely that Iran will continue implementing its current strategies towards Syria to preserve Iran's regional and international balance of power, its political and economic national interests, and the survival of the ruling clerics. For instance, Rouhani has neither asked Assad to step down from power nor pressed to halt the Islamic Republic of Iran's military, intelligence, financial, and advisory support to Damascus.
