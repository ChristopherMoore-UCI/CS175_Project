Health.com: Staying healthy from head to toe may help ward off dementia Incorporating these factors into the data helped the researchers rule out the possibility that sex disparities in MCI and dementia rates are due merely to the fact that women tend to live longer, and are therefore more likely than men to live long enough to develop dementia. Although Roberts and her colleagues didn't investigate risk factors such as high blood pressure, they did take into account other factors that have been shown to affect MCI risk, such as age, educational attainment, and marital status. Health.com: Memory, mental function begin slipping as early as age 45 High blood pressure, obesity, diabetes, and other known -- and treatable -- risk factors for MCI and dementia tend to be more common in men, which may explain the higher rate of MCI, Shatz says. The fact that men appear to have higher rates of MCI but lower rates of dementia may hold important clues for preventing or delaying cognitive decline, the researchers suggest. The findings suggest also that men may be more vulnerable than women to certain risk factors for MCI, says Rhonna Shatz, D.O., director of behavioral neurology at the Henry Ford Health System, in Detroit.
