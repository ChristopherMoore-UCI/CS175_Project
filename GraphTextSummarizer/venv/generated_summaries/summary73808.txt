A lot of Americans are watching from the sidelines now because Iott, an Ohio businessman making his first attempt at elected office, has joined a growing list of candidates with surprises swirling around them. One candidate in America's upcoming Congressional elections acknowledges the satisfaction he gets from historical re-enactments, drawing attention to both a strange subculture and a surprising twist in Republican Party politics. This is a testy time in American life, with all kinds of candidates emerging to express discontent with the country's political class. They're the kind of personalities that pop up in American public life from time to time, making the U.S. seem as much an oversized circus as a super-power. Iott's adopted unit was accused of war crimes and once included infamous sadist Joseph Mengele in its ranks.
