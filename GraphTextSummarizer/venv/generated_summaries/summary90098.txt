I think more Muslim Americans should be involved in government and in their communities. I served my country in the U.S. Navy, worked as senior policy adviser in the Department of Homeland Security under President George W. Bush, was involved in my community and even ran for public office. But I am concerned that many Muslims, hearing the news of government monitoring, will say "What's the point?" On paper, the FISA procedure looks fair: An agent prepares an affidavit setting forth facts that establish probable cause that the subject is an agent of a foreign government. I hope my kids will not have to worry about their e-mails being monitored for exercising their religious freedom to be involved with organizations that support their faith, like millions of other Americans.
