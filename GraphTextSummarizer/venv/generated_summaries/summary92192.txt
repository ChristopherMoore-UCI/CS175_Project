He contradicted President Obama's contention from Saturday that delays would not affect the Syria war plan, confirming the Syrian military was adjusting to press leaks about an early plan." Years of dithering, red lines that went unanswered, and a failure to persuade our international allies and the American public to get on board with the president's nonplan plan, has resulted, not surprisingly, in a confused Congress. Lastly, it seems clear the president doesn't want ownership of his own initial plan for limited strikes in Syria merely meant to punish al-Assad. The confusion isn't merely a consequence of the complicated machinations in Syria or the fog of war. I would venture it's so that he can later claim that whatever we end up doing in Syria was largely the design of John McCain and other members of Congress.
