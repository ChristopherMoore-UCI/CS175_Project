The mission was to be the latest foray for SpaceX, a company that itself launched in 2002 "to revolutionize space technology, with the ultimate goal of enabling people to live on other planets," according to its website. It didn't go off Thursday after exhibiting what Musk -- a storied entrepreneur (thought by some to be the inspiration for Tony Stark, or Iron Man) -- described as "slower than expected thrust ramp. Rather, it was to put an SES-8 -- a 7,000-pound telecommunications satellite that will focus on the South Asia and Asia Pacific regions -- into orbit 50,000 miles (80,000 kilometers) above the Earth's surface. SpaceX so far has made two of its 12 scheduled flights to the International Space Station, beginning in spring 2012 when its Dragon capsule became the first private spacecraft to successfully reach this manned orbiter. "Likely a few days before next attempt," read a post on SpaceX's website.
