"When I was walking down the street holding my dad's hand, people would sometimes check that he wasn't sort of taking me, that he wasn't kidnapping me," says Pool, who today is a writer and journalist in the UK. Almost two decades after she left the Eritrean orphanage where she was adopted, Pool received a letter from the east African country informing her that her father was alive and well, living back home with her brothers and sister. An Eritrean-born girl adopted as an infant by a British academic, Pool found herself spending her first years in Norway before landing in the UK at the age of seven. " Pool quickly understood that her European upbringing was marking her as different in her birthplace, in a similar way that her Eritrean background was singling her out in the UK. Today, Pool proudly describes herself as British-Eritrean and says she would love to make the African country her home one day.
