As such he has to pay whatever the maximum price is." The senator praised Port Authority police on the arrest, saying that with it, "law enforcement will be able to take a closer look into how and why this incident occurred and make sure that it never happens again.

Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg, D-New Jersey, had called on the man to turn himself in to authorities. "We will use this hard lesson to reinforce the sharp focus and tight discipline at all our stations across the country and ensure we maintain the public trust," spokeswoman Ann Davis said.
