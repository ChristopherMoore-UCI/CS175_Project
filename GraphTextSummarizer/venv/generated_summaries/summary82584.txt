Under the proposal, all current Japan Airlines shares would be reduced to zero values and new airline shares would be owned by the state-backed Enterprise Turnaround Initiative Corp. The plan includes the loss of roughly 16,000 jobs; a 521.5 billion yen ($ 6.2 billion) debt waiver, mainly from financial institutions; and a 350 billion yen ($ 4.2 billion) investment in the airline by the state-backed Enterprise Turnaround Initiative Corp. of Japan. The airline -- one of Japan's largest-ever corporate failures -- proposes cutting 45 money-losing domestic and international routes from the end of September through the end of March 2011. It has chosen American Airlines as a U.S. partner and is focusing on trans-Pacific routes to boost revenue. -- Japan Airlines on Tuesday submitted its bankruptcy plans for approval, a proposal that includes slashing roughly one-third of its workforce.
