The first Anonymous hack resulted in stolen emails and credit card data from Stratfor, an Austin-based think tank that concentrates on security issues. Hacker group Anonymous began its promised week of Christmas hacks, assaulting a long list of targets. One alleged conspirator said the goal was to use that credit card data to steal a million dollars, and give the money away as Christmas donations, the AP reports. One theft victim, Alan Barr of Austin, did not know his credit card data had been stolen until an AP reporter called him for comment. Anonymous also posted images showing receipts of charitable donations made to non-profits.
