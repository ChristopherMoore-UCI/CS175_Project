Ricketts, who has kept up with Clinton since their years in Park Ridge, said Jones continued to mentor the budding politician long into her career. In an interview with Donnie Radcliffe for the 1992 book "A First Lady for Our Time," Jones said he hoped the Park Ridge kids would "become aware of life outside Park Ridge." Jones, according to the young Methodists who attend the group with Clinton, was determined to broaden their outlook on life. To people close to Clinton, including old friends from Chicago, Jones' impact on the Democratic frontrunner remains clear as she contemplates another presidential run. "He came a very important time in our lives," said Betsy Ebeling, a longtime Clinton friend who attended Jones' youth group.
