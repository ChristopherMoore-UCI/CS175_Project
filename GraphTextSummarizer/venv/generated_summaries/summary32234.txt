Salt Lake County District Attorney Sam Gill told CNN on Monday that his office is waiting for a full report from authorities to decide on whether to file charges. All the teens bonded out Sunday night for $50,000 each, said Cammie Scogg, a Salt Lake County sheriff's spokeswoman. Kendra Gill, Bryce Stone, Shanna Smith and John Reagh -- all 18 -- admitted to buying the materials for the explosives, making the devices and throwing them from a vehicle, according to a Salt Lake County Sheriff's Office probable cause statement that CNN obtained. Gill was crowned Miss Riverton in June, and was set to compete for the Miss Utah title, CNN affiliate KUTV reported. A roll of aluminum foil, toilet bowl cleaner and several water bottles containing multiple pieces of rolled-up aluminum foil were also found, the document says.
