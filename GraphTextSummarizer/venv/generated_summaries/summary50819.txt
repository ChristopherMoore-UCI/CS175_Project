The move is tied to an investigation into alleged corrupt real estate dealings involving the illegal sale of state property to the sons of former President Hosni Mubarak. The judge also referred allegations against Gamal Mubarak, two Egyptian generals and a member of the country's pilot officer's association to a criminal court for investigation. -- Prosecutors in Egypt have ordered the arrest and extradition of ex-prime minister and presidential runner-up Ahmed Shafik, along with other Mubarak-era officials, according to Egypt's state-run Middle East News Agency. Shafik, a former air force chief and the last prime minister to serve under Mubarak, lost a June presidential runoff to Mohammed Morsy. The judge ordered Shafik held in connection with the sale of 40,000 square meters (9.9 acres) of land in the lakeside city of Ismailia to Mubarak's sons, Gamal and Alaa.
