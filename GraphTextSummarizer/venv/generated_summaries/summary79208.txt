Pope Francis has accepted the invitation of Philadelphia Archbishop Charles J. Chaput to attend the World Meeting of Families in Philadelphia next year, Catholic News Service reported Friday. "While Archbishop Chaput's comments do not serve as official confirmation, they do serve to bolster our sincere hope that Philadelphia will welcome Pope Francis next September," the archdiocese added. "Pope Francis has told me that he is coming," said the archbishop as he invited his fellow Native Americans to the celebration being held in Philadelphia on September 22-27, 2015. The Vatican, which does not typically confirm papal trips until several months before their scheduled date, said the Pope has "indicated his willingness" to visit Philadelphia but has not made "concrete plans" yet. "The Hispanic population is growing in the United States, and with the vast majority being Catholic, having the first Pope from Latin America come to visit will be very exciting," said Bishop Thomas Paprocki of Springfield, Illinois.
