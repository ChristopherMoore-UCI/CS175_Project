"I think everyone appreciates the dedication he puts in," Toseland said in an interview with CNN's World Sport. " Before the race all eyes were on Marquez and whether he could beat Italian legend Giacomo Agostini's record of winning the first ten races of the 1968, 1969 and 1970 seasons. His Honda teammate Dani Pedrosa won his first race of the season in Brno, where he also won in 2012.
