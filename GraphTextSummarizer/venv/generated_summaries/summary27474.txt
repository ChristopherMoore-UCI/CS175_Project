-- You've probably seen the new Apple TV ads with actor John Malkovich having what looks like the most charming chat of his life with Siri, the voice-activated "personal assistant" on the iPhone 4S. In the eight months since she debuted in October, Siri has been "studying up and learning a lot more," Apple Senior Vice President Scott Forstall said during a presentation Monday at Apple's annual developers' conference. Disappointed iPhone users have even filed a class-action suit against Apple, claiming that Siri doesn't work as well as advertised. Instead of directing him to a Web search or maybe pulling up info on Japanese beef, Siri answered without hesitation: "LeBron James appears to be slightly taller." Jason Gilbert, writing for the Huffington Post, called this exchange "the most important thing that was said on stage" over the course of Apple's 90-minute event. "It was Siri flawlessly and quickly answering a mundane question about basketball that Apple should be most excited about: LeBron is taller, Siri is smarter, and the bewitching Apple advertising juggernaut shall parade forward," Gilbert added.
