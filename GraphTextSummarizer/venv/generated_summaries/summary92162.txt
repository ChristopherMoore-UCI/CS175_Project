A video file posted online Tuesday purports to relay a new message from Japanese ISIS hostage Kenji Goto: He and a captive Jordanian military pilot will be killed in the next 24 hours if Jordan doesn't release a convicted would-be suicide bomber. If authentic, it is the first time ISIS is publicly linking the fates of Goto and the captive Jordanian pilot, Moaz al-Kassasbeh, whom ISIS captured after his jet crashed last month in Syria. Jordan is participating in an American-led mission against ISIS, an organization seeking to establish a caliphate, or Islamic State, and has wrested territory spanning from central Syria to about 100 kilometers (62 miles) north of Baghdad. Militants say they captured al-Kassasbeh, the Jordanian pilot, after he ejected from his crashing F-16 last month, having taken part in U.S.-led coalition airstrikes near ISIS' de-facto capital, Raqqa, Syria. Over the image, a voice purporting to be Goto's restates Saturday's apparent ISIS proposal: Goto would go free if Jordan releases longtime prisoner Sajida al-Rishawi.
