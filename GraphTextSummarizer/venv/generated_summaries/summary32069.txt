"Besides a traditional wedding, the most popular is Elvis in a pink Caddy, where Elvis drives the couple down the aisle in a pink Cadillac," said general manager Brian Mills, who doubles as an Elvis impersonator. It's a fantastic day to start a new business venture or make a significant purchase, Indian numerologist Swetta Jumaani said. Despite the weddings, superstitions and inaugural papal tweet, underwhelmed Twitter users griped about all the brouhaha. That's more than 10 times the number of couples who get hitched there on a typical Wednesday in December, Mills said. But unlike the past 11 years, this will be the last such triple date for almost a century -- until January 1, 2101.
