-- The mother of Florida A&M University drum major Robert Champion said Wednesday she had been hoping more severe charges would be filed in her son's death, which authorities said was the result of hazing. She and her husband, Robert Champion Sr., were anticipating "something that was a little more harsh." Eleven individuals each face one count of third-degree felony hazing resulting in death, according to officials. We do not have a blow or a shot or a knife thrust that killed Mr. Champion. "Investigators found these two victims during the course of investigating the death of Mr. Champion." Lamar said Champion's death was "nothing short of an American tragedy." "No one could have expected that his college experience would include being pummeled to death, an event that some, early on, mistakenly called a rite of passage," he said.
