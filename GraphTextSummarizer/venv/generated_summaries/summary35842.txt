While some airlines admit to hiring women for their sex appeal, budget carrier GoAir has told The Times of India it will be hiring predominantly female flight attendants in future because they are 15-20 kilos lighter on average than men. An Indian airline has hit on possibly the worthiest excuse yet for hiring slim women as cabin crew -- it saves fuel and therefore money. Weight and its reduction is a key focus for airlines as fuel costs, comprising a third to half an airline's operating costs, continue to rise. "The potable water tanks are no longer being filled to capacity as only 35% to 40% of that water is actually used." GoAir's 130 male cabin staff (out of 330 total) will be unaffected -- the policy affects future hires only. Tell us what you think about GoAir's new recruitment policy.
