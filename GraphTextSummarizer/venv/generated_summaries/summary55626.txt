Berezovsky, a fierce critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, blamed the Kremlin for the 2006 death of former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko, who died after being poisoned by the radioactive material polonium-210. -- Investigators are searching the London area home where the body of former Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky was found for possible chemical, radiological or biological evidence, police said in a statement released early Sunday. While Berezovsky's made a good portion of his money from luxury car sales, his wealth and political influence bounded when he bought into Russian media. Berezovsky made headlines last year after losing what has been called one of the most expensive private lawsuits in history against a former friend and ally, Russian magnate Roman Abramovich. Putin has been told of Berezovsky's death, spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Russian state television.
