Tiger Woods and Lorena Ochoa pose at the Golf Writer's Association of America Awards in 2007. The world's best female golfer, Lorena Ochoa of Mexico, has exclusively revealed to CNN that a meeting with Tiger Woods in her youth inspired her to become the player she is today. The next major championship for Ochoa to set her sights on will be the McDonald's LPGA Championship on June 11-14. Ochoa overtook Annika SÃ¶renstam to become the world number one ranked golfer in 2007 and since has won two majors, including the Women's British Open and the Kraft Nabisco Championship. " Ochoa, who started playing golf aged just five-years-old, has now won 26 LPGA Tour titles but said despite the success it has been harder to sustain her number one spot than it was to attain it.
