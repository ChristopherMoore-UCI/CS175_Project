The officer initially said that he used a Taser on Scott, who, Slager said, tried to take the weapon. Witness: I nearly erased shooting video out of fear Feidin Santana, the witness who recorded the video, said he didn't see Scott grab Slager's Taser. Later in the video, when Slager approaches Scott's body, Slager appears to drop a dark object near Scott. Scott family spokesman Ryan Julison confirmed to CNN that a man was with Scott and said he is not related to the family. A bystander's cell phone video, which began after an alleged struggle on the ground between Slager and Scott, shows the five-year police veteran shooting at Scott eight times as Scott runs away.
