In 2009, he attended an alcohol-recovery program for about five months before falling off the wagon a few days shy of his graduation, said attorney Stephen Gray McFayden, who represented Earl three times in 2008 and 2009.

The center's staff was "within an inch" of getting him on the right path last year, but Earl told her, with a trademark smile on his face, "I'm not ready," she said. The Smoking Gun has become a sort of de facto repository for Earl's arrest statistics -- the site says he's logged almost 6,000 collective days in jail, for instance -- and in September 2008 corrected a local television station that aired a report stating Earl had been arrested for the 1,000th time.
