" Horrific conditions From Sinjar, Aria, her 14-year-old sister-in-law and a handful of other girls were driven 120 kilometers to the ISIS stronghold of Mosul -- Iraq's second largest city captured by militants back in June. Aria and her friend were then taken to Fallujah by two ISIS militants she calls Abu Hassan and Abu Jaffar. I have seen and been through too much." Shame Tanya Kareem, UNHCR Duhok director, explains how difficult it is for girls like Aria to talk about what has happened to them. The refugee camp, outside the town of Duhok, was created just last month by the UNHCR for the massive influx of Yazidis fleeing their homes in Sinjar from the ISIS onslaught. They heard ISIS was coming and they were desperately trying to escape from their home in Sinjar.
