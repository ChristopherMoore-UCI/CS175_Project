Christopher Plaskon appeared in Milford Superior Court, where he waived his right to a probable cause hearing and elected to be tried by a three-judge panel rather than a 12-member jury, according to clerk Linda Kautzner. Plaskon is suspected of slashing classmate Maren Sanchez, 16, at Jonathan Law High School in Milford on April 25. The state medical examiner's office concluded that Sanchez died from "stab wounds to the trunk and neck" and ruled the death a homicide. His next court appearance is July 30, Kautzner said. -- A 17-year-old Connecticut high school student pleaded not guilty Wednesday in the slashing death of a classmate in a school stairwell in April, a court official said.
