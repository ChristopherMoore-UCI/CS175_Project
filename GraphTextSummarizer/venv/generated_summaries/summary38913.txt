Specialist firearms officers stopped the pair in east London and shot out the tires of Incedal's car to prevent an escape. Police also searched a second address in west London that Incedal had failed to disclose to police at the time of his arrest. The jury also heard recordings of Incedal and Rarmoul-Bouhadjar purportedly using code words in a discussion about buying a gun. Officers searching Incedal's south London home also found a document on top of a wardrobe referring to a "Plan A" that appeared to be a checklist for an operation involving "three to four workers," "two tennis rackets," "one months' surveillance," and renting a flat nearby, Prosecutor Richard Whittam said. Prosecutors say Incedal's iPhone had a number of images on it, including an image of a YouTube page for a song called "O Islamic State" and an image of a page of titles by Anwar al-Awlaki, the radical U.S.-born cleric who was killed by an American drone strike in late September 2011 in Yemen.
