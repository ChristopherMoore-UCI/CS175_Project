-- Maria de Villota has become the first female to be involved in Formula One for 20 years after joining Russian team Marussia as a test driver. De Villota, the daughter of Spain's former F1 driver Emilio de Villota, is the first woman to be part of the elite motorsport since Italy's Giovanni Amati entered three grands prix for Brabham in 1992. so I'm looking forward to working alongside them at the first race next weekend, and this can only help my future ambition to step up to Formula One racing." Team principal John Booth welcomed De Villota to the Britain-based team, which competed as Virgin in 2010 and 2011. " De Villota is only the sixth woman to be involved in the elite division of motorsport, the first being Italy's Maria Teresa de Filippis -- who raced in three grands prix for Maserati in 1958. The best finish achieved by a woman in F1 was in 1975 when De Filippis' compatriot Lella Lombardi scored half a point for placing sixth in a shortened Spanish Grand Prix.
