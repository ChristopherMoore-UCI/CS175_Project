And we should continue to shine a spotlight on the problem of illegal poaching and the threat it poses to African elephants and other species. But today, driven by growing demand for ivory ornaments and carvings in Asia, particularly in China, elephant poaching has returned with a vengeance. It is blood ivory: Al-Shabaab, a wing of al Qaeda based in Africa that is responsible for continued instability in Somalia, is known to finance its operations through the poaching of elephants. The Lord's Resistance Army, another terrorist group infamous for forcing children to fight in its ranks, also engages in poaching and trafficking of elephant ivory. Saving elephants and other threatened species is a cause that cuts across partisan lines and international boundaries.
