"Even if the conflict comes to a swift end, Syria will emerge in ruins -- its social and civic fabric in shreds, its economy and infrastructure devastated and its population scattered throughout the country and region, potentially unable for months if not years to return to their shattered communities and resume normal life," the ICR warned in its report on Syrian refugees last week. Enterprising Syrian refugees, many of whom arrived with nothing, have set up their own retail avenue amid dusty tents and prefabricated metal shelters, providing a small source of income and -- perhaps more importantly -- something to do to stave off the boredom and discomfort of camp life. In Jordan, about 80% of refugees are trying to make their way in cities and towns, Judeh and the International Rescue Committee said. That brings the total number of refugees arriving in Jordan so far this month to 26,500 -- up 60% from December.
