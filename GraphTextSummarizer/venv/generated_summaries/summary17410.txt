It was the second trial of Egyptian ruling party member Hisham Talaat Moustafa since Tamim's body was found in her apartment in Dubai in July 2008. He also resigned as chairman of Talaat Moustafa Group -- a conglomerate with construction and real estate arms that was founded by his father, Talaat Moustafa. After Moustafa's arrest, Egyptian authorities indicted him, stripped him of his parliamentary immunity and jailed him pending trial. -- An Egyptian billionaire was sentenced to 15 years in prison for his part in the murder of Lebanese pop singer Susanne Tamim in 2008, Egypt's Interior Ministry told CNN Tuesday. Moustafa's brother, Tarek Talaat Moustafa, now chairs the company.
