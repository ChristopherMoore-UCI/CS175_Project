More than half of this year's attacks were carried out by suspected Somali pirates off the east coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden, a major shipping route between Yemen and Somalia. Pirates have been active off the east coast of Africa in the past several years, operating out of lawless Somalia. CNN's Adam S. Levine contributed to this report. International military forces are treating the case as a "potential hijacking," Lt. Ian Jones of Britain's Royal Navy told CNN. Britain's Foreign Office issued a statement saying it is "extremely concerned for their safety," while pointing out that it had not confirmed reports they were taken captive.
