" Starwood, a chain that's heavy on boutique hotels, has a history of tech innovation and employs its own digital team. A spokeswoman said the app will initially be compatible with recent iPhone models (4S and newer) and newer Android phones. That's the vision of a hotel chain that plans to send digital keys to guests' phones via an app instead of making them check in and get the traditional (and famously lose-able) plastic swipe cards. Starwood Hotels & Resorts, which owns more than 1,150 hotels in nearly 100 countries, plans to debut the system in the next three months at two of its Aloft hotels -- in the Harlem neighborhood of New York City and Cupertino, California. "We believe this will become the new standard for how people will want to enter a hotel," Frits van Paasschen, Starwood's CEO, told The Wall Street Journal.
