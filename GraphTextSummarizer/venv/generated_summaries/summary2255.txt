"We prefer games that encourage critical thinking, even if the player disagrees with our games' ideas." But most news-related games are simple Flash games that are churned out quickly to capitalize on current events. The idea to publish games based on news events was inspired in part by the success of viral videos such as JibJab's "This Land," an animated online parody that became an instant sensation during the 2004 presidential election season, said David Williams, who heads up the Nickelodeon Kids and Family Games Group. Such topical, and satirical, games speak to our need for a light-hearted break from serious news, said DigitalTrends.com publisher Scott Steinberg. Some early examples included "Cheney's Fury," inspired by the former U.S. vice president's 2006 hunting mishap, and the "Zidane Head Butt Game," which invited players to relive the startling 2006 World Cup moment in which French soccer player Zinedine Zidane went after an Italian player head first. Last December's incident at a Baghdad news conference, at which an Iraqi journalist hurled his shoes at then-U.S. President George W. Bush, inspired several games.
