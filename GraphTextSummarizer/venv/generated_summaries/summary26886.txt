To suggest that 95 percent of Americans didn't get a tax cut in President Obama's first year is just dead wrong. But it's clear that most of the folks attending Tea Party rallies are not bigots and homophobes. When I debated Tea Party leader Mark Williams on CNN's Anderson Cooper 360 show a few months ago, I was appalled when he was unwilling to say that if someone came to one of his rallies with a racist sign, he would tell them to take it down. If they oppose the policies of President Obama, and you support them, demonstrate your support for his agenda. -- An angry bunch of Americans has taken to the streets to protest government spending and the direction of the nation, and judging by the massive media coverage, it's as if we have been invaded by a foreign entity, marching on state capitals and Washington ready to lead a coup d'Ã©tat against our elected officials.
