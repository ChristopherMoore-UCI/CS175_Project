The violence erupted in the Black Sea town of Hopa, where Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan was scheduled to address a rally. Later in the day, a small group of demonstrators hurled stones at Erdogan's campaign bus as it was leaving the scene. Polls predict Erdogan's party will win another term in office in parliamentary elections scheduled for June 12. " "Bandits with stones in their hands came to Hopa and unfortunately, of course, they attacked our vehicles with stones," Erdogan said. " Two officials with Erdogan's entourage, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed that a demonstrator died in Hopa on Wednesday, though one of the officials told CNN the man died as the result of a heart attack.
