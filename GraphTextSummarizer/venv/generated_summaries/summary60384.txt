Does anyone else find it ironic that universities overflowing with liberal professors (a 2005 study revealed that 72 percent of professors view themselves that way) embrace conservative values only when it suits them? It's an industry whose members paid a grand total of zero dollars in tax on their endowments last year. I have no problem with Harvard posting an unbelievable 23 percent rate of return on their money last year. Some politicians in Massachusetts who can't stand to see so many billions dangling just out of their reach, have proposed a new tax on large university endowments. Schools with large endowments (at least $500 million) reported spending an average of 4.4 percent of their stockpiles in 2007.
