-- Rescuers have yet to find any survivors or bodies Saturday after a landslide that buried 83 workers at a gold mine in the Tibet Autonomous Region, reported Xinhua, the Chinese state-run news agency. The victims, including two Tibetans, were workers from Tibet Huatailong Mining Development Co. Ltd., a subsidiary of the China National Gold Group Corp., the news agency said. The landslide extended three kilometers (almost two miles) and was made up of about 2 million cubic meters (2.6 million cubic yards) of mud, rock and other debris, according to Xinhua. The likelihood of the miners' survival of the Friday landslide are slim, a government spokesperson was quoted in the Xinhua report. Cold temperatures falling to -3 degrees Celsius (26 degrees Fahrenheit) have hampered the sniffer dogs' sense of smell and their ability to trace the trapped miners, the news agency reported.
