Road trips by car For obvious reasons,  including comfort and time, presidents have not historically embraced long-distance travel by car, Ellis said, as railroad trips gave way to air travel. In the late 1800s, President Rutherford Hayes rode railroads to visit 30 states and six territories, earning him the nickname "The Rover," according to Willamette University Professor Richard Ellis. In "Presidential Travel: The Journey from George Washington to George W. Bush," Ellis writes about presidential road trips, some which were tainted by tragedy. A storm made trouble for President George Washington in 1791 as he and his horse and carriage crossed Chesapeake Bay, according to Ellis. -- Since the days of George Washington, U.S. presidents have carved out a long tradition of official road trips, if not by motorcade, then by railroad or horse and carriage.
