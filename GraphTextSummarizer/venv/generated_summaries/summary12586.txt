Lampedusa and Malta, both islands less than an hour's flight from the North African coast, have borne the brunt of the subsequent wave of migration. Many of the refugees are from sub-Saharan Africa, including Sierra Leone and Senegal. -- More than 400 people fleeing Libya and Tunisia arrived overnight in an Italian island on Saturday, the latest in a stream of refugees escaping volatile and unstable North Africa. More than 30,000 migrants and refugees from Tunisia and Libya have risked this dangerous journey to Lampedusa since last February. The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said the people reached the Mediterranean island of Lampedusa in two boats, one from Libya and the other from Tunisia.
