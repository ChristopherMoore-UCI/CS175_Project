Traditional home security systems aren't as accessible to home owners and have limited uses outside of the bad events they catch on video. Duffy also thinks cameras will play an integral part in the coming wave of connected homes.

Dropcam cameras are used to catch burglars, monitor cats and dogs and live-stream county fairs. People are putting them in multiple rooms around their houses and taking home security into their own hands instead of depending on alarms.
