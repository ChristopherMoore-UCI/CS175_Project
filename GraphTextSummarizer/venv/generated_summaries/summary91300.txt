I can't see the sense in not trying it." Abraham is hoping that the warmer summer months will see him, like Godwin before, clock up tallies of 300 miles per day (483 km) so he can reach his target of 80,000 miles (1287km). "This is not the sort of record that a married man would attempt," said Abraham's media spokesperson Idai Makaya. While many people are recovering from a hangover, Englishman Steve Abraham will be cycling more than 200 miles on New Year's Day. He will need to be in the saddle, riding a steel-framed Raleigh bike similar to that used by his hero Godwin, for up to 20 hours per day, surviving on minimal sleep, particularly in the more favorable summer months. The heyday for the record was in the 1930s when various cycling publications ran competitions to encourage attempts but according to the official website for Abraham's 2015 bid, the year record has never been formally sanctioned by a national cycling federation, or ratified by the Guinness Book of Records.
