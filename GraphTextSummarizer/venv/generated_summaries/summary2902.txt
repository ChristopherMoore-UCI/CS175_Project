But LaBonge, borrowing from a Harrison album title, vows "All Things Must Pass" including the lack of a George Harrison tree. "But we are going to replant a new George Harrison tree in November," said L.A. City Councilman Tom LaBonge, a local politician well known for his undying optimism and ceaseless attendance of civic events. -- A tree dedicated to the memory of Beatle George Harrison, whose solo career included the hit "What is Life," has met a grisly end to its life from the jaws of voracious bark beetles. Now, in a city park where there was once a specific wood -- a George Harrison tree -- there's a stump. City officials say the 12-foot-tall pine had to be cut down June 18, to spare nearby trees from the spread of infestation by bark beetles.
