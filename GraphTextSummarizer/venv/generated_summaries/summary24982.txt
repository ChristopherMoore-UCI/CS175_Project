"There's a lot of evidence that (sleep problems are) some of the real reasons why type two diabetes is going up quite dramatically ... weight control, depression, bipolar, anxiety, stress -- there's a lot of quite serious health issues," Littlehales says. "It's dead easy if you look at it in 90-minute cycles, which is how sleep is measured," Littlehales says. Littlehales says attitudes towards sleep in sport have changed a lot since he started working in the area, which is being recognized as one of the remaining aspects where human performance can be improved. It led to the introduction of sleep rooms at United's Carrington training ground to allow players to cope with the demands of morning and afternoon sessions, and Littlehales went on to work with the club's Premier League rival Arsenal and the England national team. While, for many of us, sleep deprivation often compounds into a seemingly neverending spiral of exhaustion, Littlehales has dedicated most of his adult life to finding the tools that break the cycle.
