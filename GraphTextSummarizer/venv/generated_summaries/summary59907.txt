Given that the private sector generally puts those resources to a more productive use, it is likely that government spending destroys more jobs over the long run than it creates. Beginning in 2015, defense spending would start rising again, in real terms, and would exceed current levels by 2019. If our economy can't survive spending cuts of that size, we truly are Greece. The rest will be cut in future years, but attributed to this year's budget. Actually, the sequester doesn't cut federal spending at all, or rather it cuts it only in the Washington sense of any reduction from projected baseline increases is a cut.
