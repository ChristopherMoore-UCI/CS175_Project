Marsha Bobb spotted Lenny Spence one day in 2005 while she was walking down the aisle of an American Airlines flight from Jamaica to Miami. After all, they were separated by thousands of miles: Marsha owned her own business in Toronto and Lenny was a long-distance truck driver based in Florida. Lenny was sitting in Marsha's window seat. For Lenny, Marsha was the "the girl that got away"; for Marsha, Lenny was a special memory. There was one time when Marsha called Lenny out of the blue and he didn't recognize her voice.
