CNN: Is this the one and only Ben Folds greatest hits album? The North Carolina native picked 15 ensembles from 250 submissions for "Ben Folds Presents: University A Cappella!" -- Ben Folds didn't realize how great his music was until he heard a bunch of college students singing it. Ben Folds spoke to CNN about his youthful-sounding new release, why being married four times isn't much of a drama and why he faked an album leak. Folds sings two a cappella tracks himself: "Boxing" from his Ben Folds Five days, and "Effington" from his 2008 solo album "Way To Normal."
