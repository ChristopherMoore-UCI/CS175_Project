Initially, traditional Tunisian media ignored clashes between security forces and peaceful protestors -- who rallied after the death of Mohamed Bouazizi by self-immolation -- in Sidi Bouzid. My blog, Facebook profile and Twitter account were blocked, before being hijacked, probably by Tunisian cyber police. I took photos of the dead and succeeded in capturing some of the atrocities and crimes of Ben Ali's regime and police against peaceful protestors. I was in front of my screen that day when I found the video showing what was going in Sidi Bouzid. I wanted to travel to Sidi Bouzid and see what was happening, but I was unable to afford it.
