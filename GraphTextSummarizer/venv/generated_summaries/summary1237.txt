While Lee and his three co-directors/producers took creative license with plot details, such as an imagined briefing between a mainland Ministry of State Security attaché and Hong Kong police, they also filmed scenes inside the same hotel where Snowden had stayed and shot a video interview with The Guardian. Hong Kong authorities have denied that China influenced Snowden's decision to leave the city. Describing a "very muted response to the Snowden affair" from Hong Kong and the Chinese central government, Lee also acknowledged an underlying political critique in invoking the Ministry of State Security attaché. "We were so intrigued as to why Snowden came to Hong Kong," Lee said, an Irish expatriate. "He's mostly the catalyst [of events] affecting all these different people around him; it's more about the vignettes," Lee said , describing the film's focus as split "50-50" between Snowden and the city of Hong Kong.
