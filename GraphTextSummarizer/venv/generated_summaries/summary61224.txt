Lawmaker Ayfan Sadoon al-Essawi was visiting a construction site on a commercial street in central Falluja on Tuesday when the bomber, disguised as a laborer, approached him, authorities said. -- A suicide bomber hugged an Iraqi lawmaker and detonated an explosive vest, killing the official and two others, police said Tuesday. He was wanted by the Islamic State of Iraq, an umbrella group of al Qaeda and other Sunni extremist groups. Al-Essawi used to be the leader of Falluja Awakening Council for several years and was also a tribal leader there. Separately, on Monday evening, Iraqi Finance Minister Rafie al-Essawi escaped an attack unharmed when a roadside bomb exploded near his convoy on the western outskirts of Baghdad, police officials there said.
