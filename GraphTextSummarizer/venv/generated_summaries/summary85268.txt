Meanwhile, Oscar Pistorius made history by becoming the first amputee athlete to compete in world championships history. Defending champion Usain Bolt was sensationally disqualified for a false start in the men's 100-meter final at the world athletics championships in Daegu, South Korea, allowing fellow-Jamaican Yohan Blake to collect an unexpected gold medal. However, the gold medal still went to Ethiopia with Ibrahim Jeilan outsprinting Briton Mo Farah in a devastating burst to the line. Despite Bolt's shock exit, it proved a good day for defending world champions, with three athletes retaining the titles they won two years ago in Berlin.
