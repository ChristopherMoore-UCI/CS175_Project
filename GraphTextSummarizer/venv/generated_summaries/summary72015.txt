Less than a month after President Barack Obama announced his executive action on immigration reform, the country's chief executive made a concerted effort to reach out the Latino community, and assure them that his policies will not be overturned under a new administration. From a political perspective, Obama echoed his State of the Union "phone and pen" rhetoric, arguing that House Speaker John Boehner's reluctance to bring immigration reform to a vote, is what caused him to act alone. " "We are going to make sure that families -- people who are working and responsible in their communities -- are not prioritized for deportation," Obama said. " Obama also acknowledged that he asked the White House Office of Legal Counsel for guidance about how much legal authority he actually had, and with that insight, stretched his executive arm as far as it could reach. A former constitutional law professor, the President detailed what gave him the legal authority to act on immigration now without Congress' approval -- a move he once said he didn't have the authority to do.
