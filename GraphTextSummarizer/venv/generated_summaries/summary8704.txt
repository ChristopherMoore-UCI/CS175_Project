Smelling fonts Hyndman recently gave a lecture at the London Design Festival that explored the complex network of associations triggered by different fonts. "Fonts form a kind of language of their own, and we are all unconsciously fluent in it," she says when I visit her studio in Hackney, north London. "We've found that rounded fonts are commonly associated with deep reds and sweet tastes," she says. This analysis is based on the cultural context of the Gill Sans font, which was created in 1926 by Eric Gill, who was inspired by Edward Johnston's iconic London Underground typeface. To illustrate, Hyndman takes out another collection of props: candy bags with different fonts pinned to the outside.
