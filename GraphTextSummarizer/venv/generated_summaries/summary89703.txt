The oneworld members are now either in bed with rival gulf carriers or hitched to rival alliance members in strategic partnerships. I predict Qantas will slowly but surely drift away from oneworld but keep one foot in the camp because of its relationship with American Airlines and U.S. routes. Ailing Qantas announces alliance with Emirates Today Akbar Al Bakar's Qatar Airways joins oneworld and comes within the fold. How on earth can a oneworld Air Berlin do a strategic tie up with the leading carrier in a rival airline and keep its loyalty to oneworld? I predict that Air Berlin will eventually leave oneworld and join Skyteam to tidy up its relationship.
