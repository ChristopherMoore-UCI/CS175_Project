The soldier opened fire with an automatic rifle in the barracks of the camp in the town of Safapora, roughly 30 kilometers (19 miles) north of the capital, Srinagar, said military spokesman Lt. Col. N.N. Joshi. Journalist Mukhtar Ahmad reported from Srinagar, and CNN's Jethro Mullen wrote from Hong Kong. An investigation into the shooting has been ordered, Joshi said. Authorities have attributed previous shootings to stress caused by long duty hours and protracted separation from families. Kashmir is a mountainous region that has long been the subject of dispute between India and Pakistan.
