The Israeli military said several Syrian rockets landed in the Mount Hermon area of the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, on the border with Syria. "Rebel fighters from the Islamic State of Iraq and Bilad al-Sham (Syria) have summarily executed three men in the middle of a square in Raqqa city," the Observatory said. At least 50 people were killed Wednesday across the country, the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said. Meanwhile, the Internet is back up in Syria after being down for more than eight hours Wednesday, according to the Renesys Corp., an Internet monitoring company. A week ago, a widespread Internet outage in Syria lasted more than 19 hours before access was restored.
