Kenya mall shooting: Dozens of families unsure if loved ones are dead or alive CNN's Nima Elbagir reported from Nairobi; CNN's Greg Botelho reported and wrote from Atlanta. -- A man who cast himself as a victim of the recent attack on a Nairobi mall gave himself away as a possible suspect when a machine-gun magazine fell out of his pocket as he was being evacuated, a Kenyan counterterrorism source said Thursday. The onslaught began when militants stormed the upscale Nairobi shopping mall on Saturday, forcing shoppers and diners to run for their lives or scramble for safe hiding spots. It was not immediately clear if this man is one of the at least 10 individuals who Kenyan officials have said are in custody on suspicion of taking part in the Westgate Mall attack. Was 'White Widow' involved in mall shooting?
