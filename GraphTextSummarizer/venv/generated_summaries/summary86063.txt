SafePoint does create awareness -- and so demand -- for AD syringes on a generic basis, and our mission is aligned with others who wish to bring about global adoption of safe injection practices.) -- Twenty-five years ago I read a newspaper article which said that one day, reused syringes would be one of the major causes of the spread of AIDS. If an injection is given safely, there is no risk of further infection and therefore there are no additional costs linked to further treatment for secondary, treatment-caused infection.

The transmission method is crude -- blood-borne viruses are transmitted from patient to patient as body fluid is transferred by reusing a needle and syringe multiple times.
