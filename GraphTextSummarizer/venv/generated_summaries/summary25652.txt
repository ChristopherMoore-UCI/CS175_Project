Teresa Gilmete Badger, a 47-year-old teacher at Matthew Turner Elementary School in Benicia, was arrested Friday afternoon on suspicion of poisoning after a six-week-long investigation, said Lt. Frank Hartig of the Benicia Police Department. "One of the partygoers was rushed to the hospital with severe reactions; she was hospitalized," Hartig told CNN affiliate KPIX. During their investigation, police said they were told that Badger had "allegedly confessed her involvement to individuals who were also in attendance at the party." Badger chose not to speak to arresting officers, Hartig said. At least one of the women tested positive for THC (Tetrahydrocannabinol), the principal intoxicant in marijuana, police said.
