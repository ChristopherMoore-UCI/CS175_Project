The Muslim Brotherhood sent its followers onto the streets after Friday prayers, the first time Egypt's large and venerable -- but illegal -- Islamic opposition called for protest during this round of demonstrations. "His time is over," the 19-year-old law student said early Saturday from Raml Square in central Alexandria. That word, yelled out in Arabic, reverberated Friday along the banks of the Nile River in Cairo -- as well as in the port city of Alexandria, near the canal in Suez, and other pockets of Egypt. And when younger Muslim Brotherhood protesters seemed ready to hurl rocks at the police in Alexandria, Egypt's second-largest city, older men put their arms around their shoulders, calming them down. "Police have always been violent, but we haven't seen it this way," Sarah Sirgany, a reporter for Daily News Egypt who has been posting regular developments on Twitter, told CNN's Piers Morgan.
