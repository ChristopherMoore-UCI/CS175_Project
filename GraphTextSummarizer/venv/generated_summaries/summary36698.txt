(PEOPLE.com) -- Kevin Bacon is not the kind of guy to look back at his past work. "Honestly, I was," says Bacon, who at the time he shot the movie was a relatively unknown off-Broadway actor, despite roles in "Animal House," "Friday the 13th" and "Diner." "It was like a weird time-travel, out-of-body type thing," Bacon, 53, told PEOPLE. Double Vision While Bacon is justifiably proud of himself and the film -- which went on to earn more than 10 times its reported $8 million budget -- he does have a few regrets. I was furious," Bacon says with a smile.
