The case has also attracted attention from transportation advocates, who say Nelson is being treated unfairly because transportation planners fail to take into account the needs of pedestrians when designing roads. Raquel Nelson of Marietta was sentenced to 12 months of probation and 40 hours of community service by Judge Kathryn Tanksley. -- A Georgia woman who potentially faced more jail time than the driver who struck and killed her son last year was spared any time behind bars Wednesday. "It's just so confusing and unreal that it would happen in this manner," said Loretta Williams, Nelson's aunt. Five weeks after the accident, investigators came to Nelson's home, Williams said.
