While battles rage on between pro-Gadhafi and rebel forces, a humanitarian crisis in Tripoli mounts. While rebels continue searching for Moammar Gadhafi, a clue came from a 17-year-old who told Sky News he saw Gadhafi on Friday in a Tripoli compound belonging to Gadhafi's son Khamis. Shwygar Mullah said Aline Gadhafi, the wife of Gadhafi's son Hannibal, poured boiling water on her. -- Libyan rebels expressed fresh optimism that Moammar Gadhafi's reign is about to crumble as a deadline looms for Gadhafi loyalists to disarm or face assault. But Gadhafi's whereabouts are still unconfirmed, 11 days after opposition forces stormed the capital and later captured his Tripoli compound.
