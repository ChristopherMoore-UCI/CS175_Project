Two days after Iraq said an Iranian "armed group" crossed the border into Iraq and seized the well, Iraqi Deputy Foreign Minister Labid Abawi said the occupation of well No. 4 in Maysan province's Fakka oil field continues. Both Iraq and Iran stood their ground Saturday over the reported seizure of a southern Iraqi oil well by Iranian forces. Aimed at increasing Iraqi oil production, deals were struck for seven of the 15 fields offered. But in a statement issued by its embassy in Iraq, Iran denied what it characterized as rumors of its forces crossing the border, and hinted that the claim was political because it comes ahead of next year's Iraqi parliamentary elections. On Friday, the Iraqi government issued a strong statement deploring the alleged seizure, after Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki headed an emergency meeting of Iraq's National Security Council to discuss the situation.
