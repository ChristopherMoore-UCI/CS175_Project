And now the Department of Homeland Security is expanding its coordination -- with Major League Baseball, Major League Soccer, the National Basketball Association, the National Football League and the National Hockey League -- by releasing a new public service announcement today to tell their millions of fans: If you see something that doesn't look right, report it to local authorities. The campaign supports the DHS belief that homeland security begins with hometown security. This kind of reporting by citizens has helped foil numerous plots, including a planned attack against a Martin Luther King, Jr. Day parade route in Washington State in 2010. DHS has expanded the program by partnering with cities, states, universities and private businesses, including the transportation, hospitality and retail sectors, to raise awareness for the "If You See Something, Say Something" campaign. And when a concerned gun store owner became suspicious of a customer's purchases in Killeen, Texas, last year, he called the authorities and helped prevent a likely attack at Fort Hood.
