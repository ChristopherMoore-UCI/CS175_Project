Cape Point is a bit of a drive away, but I find it well worth it to see where the cold Atlantic Ocean meets the warm Indian Ocean. Running the length of downtown Cape Town, Long Street is home to backpacker lodges, hip clothing boutiques, funky restaurants and amazing night life. Cape Town is known for its red and orange skies at sundown, and Table Mountain provides the perfect panoramic view. My ideal South African vacation would include a lengthy stop in Cape Town (my home town), a drive up the Garden Route and a safari. My best advice for people visiting Cape Town would be to group outings together by location.
