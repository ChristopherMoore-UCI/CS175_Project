Thus, we conclude that the total number of registered voters who lack a driver's license or personal identification card issued by (the state Department of Public Safety) could range from 603,892 to 795,955," Perez said in the letter, addressed to the director of elections for the Texas secretary of state. The landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965 gives the federal government the power to oversee any changes in voting procedures in states and jurisdictions with a  history of voter discrimination. A controversial new Texas law requiring voters to present personal identification before going to the polls has been blocked by the Obama administration. The Justice Department said Hispanic registered voters in Texas are 46.5% to 120% more likely than a non-Hispanic registered voter to lack the required identification. Texas is among eight states to require official photo identification in an effort to stop what officials say is voter fraud.
