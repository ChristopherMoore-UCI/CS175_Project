Read how the Europeans trained with al Qaeda Vinas's and Othmani's account of their time in al Qaeda training camps in Pakistan is a playbook of how the terror group survived after 9/11 and continues to operate in the remote hills of Pakistan.

They also revealed al Qaeda training programs for new forms of attack, including breaking into residences to carry out targeted assassinations.

Vinas is a young American who was arrested in Pakistan late in 2008 after allegedly training with al Qaeda in the Afghan-Pakistan border area.
