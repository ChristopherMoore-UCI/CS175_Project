Istavrioglou was detained by Homeland Security agents on Saturday and arrested by the New York police after flying from Milan, Italy, to New York's Kennedy International Airport, according to a district attorney's office media release. An undercover detective posing as an art gallery business manager had invited Istavrioglou to New York, proposing to hire the defendant as an art gallery consultant, according to the district attorney's office. "Today's indictment brings us one step closer to bringing an international art caper to a close," New York County District Attorney Cy Vance said in the statement. Cohen says his client is not facing mandatory jail time and that he plans on challenging his client's high bail. The painting was sent back to the United States anonymously and was recovered at Kennedy International Airport customs on June 28.
