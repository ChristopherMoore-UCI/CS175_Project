Victim 5 was also assaulted in Penn State showers, Kline said. -- A man who was sexually abused by former Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky has settled his civil suit against the university -- the first to do so, his lawyer said. State prosecutors allege that Spanier, former Athletic Director Tim Curley and former Senior Vice President Gary Schultz all knew about two allegations made against Sandusky in 1998 and in 2001, but lied about their knowledge when a grand jury convened several years later. " Kline called the settlement involving Victim 5 "win, win. Victim 5's lawyer, Tom Kline, said the settlement terms are bound by a confidentiality agreement with the school, but that "the compensation was fair and adequate." "My client is relieved," Kline told CNN.
