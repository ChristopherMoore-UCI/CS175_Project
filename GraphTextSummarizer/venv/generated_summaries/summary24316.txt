Buckles, the last known surviving World War I U.S. veteran, met the president of the United States and received a standing ovation at the Pentagon. Buckles' tour of Washington was part of a series of events to honor the veterans of World War I, which included the opening of a photographic display at the Pentagon on Thursday. World War I veteran Frank Buckles entered the Army at age 15. According to an autobiography the Pentagon released, Buckles was eager to join the war. But Buckles noticed the memorial is not national but built primarily to honor veterans from the District of Columbia.
