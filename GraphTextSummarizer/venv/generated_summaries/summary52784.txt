The indictment was unsealed and announced in the Southern District of New York by U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer and George Venizelos, Assistant FBI Director in New York. Justice Department and FBI officials in New York announced the indictment against a Russian, a Latvian and a Romanian who officials say caused tens of millions of dollars in losses. If convicted on the new charges, including bank fraud conspiracy, he could face up to 95 years in prison. Calovskis could receive up to 67 years in prison if convicted, and Paunescu could receive up to 60 years in prison if he is convicted in a U.S. court. U.S. authorities are seeking the extradition of both Calovskis and Paunescu.
