Race categories for New York courts come from the U.S. Census Bureau, according to Arlene Hackel, a spokeswoman for the New York State Office of Court Administration. New York courts will be following suit and discontinuing the use of the word soon, according to Hackel. It is a good thing that New York courts do this in order to ensure a fair cross-section of the community, he explained. The Census Bureau, which follows the Office of Management and Budget for definitions of race and ethnicity, discontinued use of the word "Negro" at the beginning of 2014, according to a press release. "Yes, I identify as black or African-American, but I am not a Negro," said a 25-year-old teacher from New York City.
