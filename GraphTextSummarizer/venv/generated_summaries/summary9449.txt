The riders contacted Idaho state police and their tip over the weekend sent FBI agents swarming to the camping spot outside Cascade, in central Idaho. "They just really didn't fit very well," rider Mark John said Monday on CNN's "New Day." So we was discussing the fact that they didn't fit there, that something was wrong," John told "New Day." Christa John, also interviewed on "New Day," said she was inclined to go over to the girl and see if she needed help. The horseback riders braving the rugged Idaho wilderness came upon the older man and younger female and sized them up on the spot: A pair of greenhorns, square pegs in hard country. Christa John says it's better to call law enforcement and "be wrong about the situation than not make it at all."
