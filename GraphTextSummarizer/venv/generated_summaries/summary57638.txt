I enjoy making music so much that if it doesn't come out, that's OK." Once Timberlake decided that "The 20/20 Experience" was worth sharing with the world, he and close friend and producer Timbaland agreed, he told "Rolling Stone," to make music "without all the hoopla of, like expectations. But by 2002, Justin's high-profile relationship with Britney Spears was falling apart and 'N Sync went on hiatus. One take Timberlake.'" Timberlake's writing skills were getting him noticed by other big acts, too. "I will not be the type of artist that puts out 10 to 15 albums," Timberlake recently told "Rolling Stone." In 1993, Justin was singing, dancing and acting in the Disney Channel's "The Mickey Mouse Club" alongside a group who would later become a who's-who of teenage idols, including Ryan Gosling, Cristina Aguilera, J.C. Chasez and future girlfriend Britney Spears.
