An avalanche of CNN comments raved about the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force, which is sometimes mistakenly referred to as Wright-Patterson Air Force Museum because of its location at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. This gem has three aircraft crown jewels: --An F-102 variant trainer jet called the TF-102A that was flown by a young Air National Guardsman by the name of George W. Bush, according to museum officials. It's the jet that served as Air Force One for President Kennedy's 1963 trip to Cold War Berlin, where he made his famous "Ich bin ein Berliner" speech. As a teen, XR watched aviation hall of famer Clarence "Bud" Anderson perform "the most incredible display of piloting skill and energy management that I have ever seen and probably will never see again. CNN commenter lastdomino pointed out Grissom Air Museum as an "off-the beaten path gem." Indeed you are correct, lastdomino!
