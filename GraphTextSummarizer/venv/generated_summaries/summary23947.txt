This represents a 50 percent voter turnout, a figure much lower than the 61 percent officially estimated by the electoral tribunal on election day, and lower than revised turnout figures that the Electoral Tribunal gave to CNN as recently as December 5. The official tally of last month's presidential election is almost complete, and one pivotal piece of electoral data -- voter turnout -- will be lower than officials have previously claimed. A 50 percent turnout would mean that fewer voters participated than in the last presidential race, in 2005, where turnout was 55 percent, according to TSE data. That statement, made on election day, cites a 61 percent voter turnout rate and says 2.8 million people cast votes. When CNN made its own analysis earlier this month, TSE spokesman Roberto Reyes Pineda said that about 2.6 million votes were cast.
