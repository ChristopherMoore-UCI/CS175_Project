Drew Kesse said that every Tuesday, landscapers worked at the condo complex near his daughter's parking space. We think since the landscapers didn't see her, she must not have even made it out of the hallways or stairwells of the condo complex," Drew Kesse said. Last week, on the third anniversary of Kesse's disappearance, an inmate in a Florida prison said he might have the answer. Jones said investigators have developed forensic evidence from Kesse's car that could someday match with a person of interest and identify a suspect. Police have also released a photo of a green clover tattoo on Kesse's left hip.
