-- I'm a lover of books, great ones and not-so-great ones. I was, however, more than a little shocked by the list, which crudely mixes categories, putting in a few classics, such as George Orwell's "1984" and Charles Dickens' "Great Expectations," alongside "Kitchen Confidential" by Anthony Bourdain, "Moneyball" by Michael Lewis, and "Gone Girl" by Gillian Flynn. For poetry, Amazon recommends Shel Silverstein's "Where the Sidewalk Ends" instead of the poems of Robert Frost or Walt Whitman or Emily Dickinson. The latter are fine books, but they should not crowd out Thoreau or Franklin. For a great biography, we get Robert A. Caro's admirable life of Robert Moses.
