Hollywood has fully embraced 3D technology. ESPN followed just a couple months later, closing its 3D channel down due to "limited viewer adoption of 3D services." Around a third of all cinema screens globally are now 3D and the number of 3D film releases is growing steadily. But the demand for 3D TV has not been as great as expected. BBC put its 3D TV project on hold for three years in last June, after saying the technology hadn't lived up to expectations.
