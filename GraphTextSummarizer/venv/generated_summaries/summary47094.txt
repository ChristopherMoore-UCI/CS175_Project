The Spirit Airlines flight out of O'Hare airport, en route to Fort Lauderdale Saturday morning, made an emergency landing back at O'Hare. "We are currently inspecting the aircraft and the right engine cowlings that were recovered on airport property." Passengers were booked on other flights or offered refunds. "Shortly after takeoff, a passenger observed an engine cowling on the right side had left the aircraft," said Elizabeth Cory, spokeswoman for the Federal Aviation Administration. Then, "the whole thing just tore off and flew into the air," she told CNN affiliate WLS in Chicago. "We are actively investigating to confirm the specifics of what happened and the cause," Spirit Airlines spokeswoman Misty Pinson said.
