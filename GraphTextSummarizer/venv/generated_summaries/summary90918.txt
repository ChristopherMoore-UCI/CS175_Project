"These new living spaces will raise inflight product and service standards to their highest level yet in commercial aviation and alter air travelers' expectations of inflight comfort and luxury forever," said James Hogan, Etihad Airways' president and CEO, in a statement. On both the A380 and the B787, Etihad Airways will offer new Business Studios, which it says provide 20% more personal space than its current business-class seat. Unveiled at a weekend launch to introduce Etihad's redesigned/renamed A380 and B787 cabins, "The Residence by Etihad" -- available only on the airline's A380 jets -- is a three-room VIP suite with its own living room, double bedroom and ensuite shower. One rung down on the luxury ladder, the upper deck of the new A380s -- the first of which is due for delivery in December -- will also offer nine new First Apartments, which are private suites with a separate reclining lounge seat and full-length bed.
