Former club Sao Paulo were in Munich for the Audi Cup, a preseason tournament held at Bayern's Allianz Arena, and they opened the door for Breno to return to his former club. "I think it's excellent that the prison authorities and all the authorities in Munich involved in the case have helped to open up this opportunity," said Bayern president Uli Hoeness. " Breno will be collected from the correctional facility in Stadelheim at 0830 every morning by Bayern youth director Wolfgang Dremmler and returned at 1330. Having served 13 months of his sentence, Breno is being allowed to leave prison on day release and has been given the chance to rejoin Bayern as part of the coaching staff at the club's youth academy. " Hoeness assured Breno he will receive Bayern's full backing, despite no long being under contract at the club.
