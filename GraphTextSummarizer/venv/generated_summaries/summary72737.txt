-- Pfizer is near a deal to buy rival drugmaker Wyeth for $68 billion, according to news reports late Sunday citing people familiar with the deal. Pfizer is probably also focused on Wyeth's blockbuster children's vaccine Prevnar, as well as its experimental biotech drugs, said Michael Krensavage of Krensavage Asset Management. If a deal does go through, Funtleyder warns, Wyeth staffers should brace for layoffs. "It is our policy not to comment on rumor or speculation," said Michael Lampe, a Wyeth representative. But he cautions that a merger won't be a success unless Wyeth's pipeline is successful, which remains to be seen, he said.
