Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told CNN's "State of the Union" on Sunday that he was struggling to reconcile Abbas' remarks on the Holocaust with the decision by his Fatah movement last week to seek a unity government with Hamas. " A tweet Sunday from Netanyahu's office said Abbas "is forging a pact with Holocaust deniers." Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas called the Holocaust the most heinous crime in modern human history, his office said in a statement Sunday. Abbas "can't have it both ways," by calling the Holocaust the most heinous crime in modern history while embracing Hamas, a "terrorist organization that denies the Holocaust and openly calls for a new extermination of the six million Jews of Israel," Netanyahu said. It included a photo of Abbas smiling alongside Hamas leader Khaled Mashaal.
