-- Paul Nicklen makes friends with polar wildlife, photographing seals, polar bears, narwhals and others in remarkable closeups. And Nicklen, a contributing photographer for the National Geographic, is passing along a message from the creatures he sees in the Arctic and Antarctica: They're in trouble. Nicklen, whose work has been recognized with multiple awards, tracked the rare spirit bear for a National Geographic cover story. Nicklen said that polar bears could face extinction within 50 to 100 years if ice continues to recede. From the age of 4, when his family moved to Inuit territory in Canada, Nicklen has explored the region, in later years as a biologist and a photographer.
