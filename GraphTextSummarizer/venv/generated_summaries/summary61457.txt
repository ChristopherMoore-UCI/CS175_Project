-- An anonymous tipper apparently is spreading holiday cheer in restaurants across the country, including leaving a $7,000 tip over the weekend in New York. Various media outlets have reported that the generous donor may be former PayPal executive, Jack Selby, though you do not see the tipper in any of the Instagram images. On Saturday, the anonymous tipper left a $1,000 tip on a $111 tab at Bo's Kitchen and Bar Room in New York. A person who Valleywag said is one of Selby's friends commented on the link, "Do we win if we know whom is behind @tipsforjesus?" Valleywag.gawker.com posted what appears to be a screen grab of Selby's Facebook page from November 27: an image of Selby accompanied by a link he may have posted to a story about @TipsForJesus.
