U.S. entities and people are prohibited from "providing material support or resources to, or engaging in other transactions" with the group. The State Department said in a statement the group's goal "is to carry out terrorist actions against non-Muslims in furtherance of its ultimate objective -- an Islamic Caliphate across South Asia. They include Pakistan-based Lashkar e-Tayyiba, Jaish-e-Mohammed and Harakat ul-Jihad-i-Islami. It is the Indian Mujahideen, which has "close ties to other U.S.- designated terrorist entities." -- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton designated an India-based militant group as a foreign terrorist organization Thursday.
