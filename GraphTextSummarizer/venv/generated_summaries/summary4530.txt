Earmuffs were essential, as well as big fur hats, thick gloves, insulated boots and wool socks, the works. Only those with their heads buried deep in the sand can believe that climate change is not upon us and that fossil fuels are not changing this planet in ways that will make life difficult for our children and their children. But I'm used to cold weather, having spent most of my adult life, almost four decades, in New Hampshire and Vermont. I think, for instance, of "Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening" or the ferocious "Goodbye, and Keep Cold," where he says: "Dread fifty above more than fifty below." Like Frost, I will say to my Vermont neighbors with a wry smile: "Goodbye, and Keep Cold."
