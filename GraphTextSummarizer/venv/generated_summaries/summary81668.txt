-- One of NASCAR's top drivers, Kurt Busch, is being investigated for domestic assault, Delaware police said Friday. Mike Arning, a spokesman for Busch's Stewart-Haas Racing team, said, "This is an allegation Stewart-Haas Racing takes very seriously, but we're still gathering all of the facts and are not in a position to comment in greater detail." " "We recognize the seriousness of this matter and are actively gathering information from all parties, including law enforcement authorities and Stewart-Haas Racing," NASCAR said. "This allegation is a complete fabrication by a woman who has refused to accept the end of a relationship, and Mr. Busch vehemently denies her allegations in every respect," he said in a written statement. "The department is still investigating the victim's claims and will not have any further comment on this matter in order to preserve the integrity of the case," police in the Delaware capital said.
