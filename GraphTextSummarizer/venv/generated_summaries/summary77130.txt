Last August, dozens of management agencies representing actors and singers signed an agreement with Beijing authorities, banning drug use from the entertainment industry and pledging to fire any artists who break the law. The son of kung fu movie star Jackie Chan has been released after being jailed for six months in China for drug offenses. A Beijing court sentenced him in January but took into account the time he already spent in jail since last summer. Jaycee Chan was detained in August last year after he tested positive for marijuana and police found more than 100 grams of the drug in his Beijing apartment. The Hong Kong native was arrested along with a Taiwanese actor, amid a government crackdown on celebrity drug offenders.
