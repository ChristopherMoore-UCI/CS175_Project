The race was won by hot favorite Toronado, giving trainer Richard Hannon Jr. his first Royal Ascot winner in his first season with a license having taken over from his father over the winter. The day's feature race, the St James's Palace Stakes, was billed as a rematch between the John Gosden-trained Kingman, at one time regarded as a worthy successor to Frankel for owner Khalid Abdullah, and surprise 2,000 Guineas winner Night of Thunder. The Royal Meeting kicked off today in typically grandiose style, amid a flurry of hats and horses. The traditional curtain-raiser is the Group One Queen Anne Stakes, a race won so memorably in recent years by Frankel. In the Coventry Stakes, Frankie Dettori secured his 48th victory at Ascot by riding The Wow Signal home -- his first win at the course for two years.
