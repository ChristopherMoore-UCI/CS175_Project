Because he violated Facebook's terms of service by hacking the pages of other users, Shreateh is not eligible to receive a reward under the site's White Hat program designed to find and fix bugs. Security researcher Marc Maiffret launched an online campaign Monday to pay Shreateh the money Facebook denied him and had raised more than $8,800 by early Tuesday. "I (have) no other choice to make after all the reports I sent to (the) Facebook team." Shreateh, who describes himself as an unemployed security researcher with a degree in information systems, said he found a hole in Facebook's systems that let him post to any user's page, including users not on his Friends list. On his blog, Shreateh posted a series of e-mails he said were exchanged between him and Facebook security. "Although he was frustrated by the response from Facebook's security team, Shreateh did the wrong thing by using the flaw to post a message on Mark Zuckerberg's wall."
