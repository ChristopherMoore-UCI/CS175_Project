It was the all-too-real fate suffered by brothers Connor and Noah Barthe in August 2013 at a sleepover in the home of Jean-Claude Savoie, a family friend who lived above an exotic pet store that he ran in New Brunswick, Canada. Though deemed a tragic accident from the outset, the incident nevertheless remained under investigation, and on Thursday, 18 months later, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police announced that it had "arrested an individual in connection with the deaths of Noah and Connor Barthe of Campbellton, (New Brunswick). Savoie was arrested in Montreal, where he has since relocated, some 500 miles away from his Reptile Ocean pet store, according to Matchim. It was above the living room, where Connor, 6, and Noah, 4, were sleeping, when the ceiling caved in. He remained in custody there Thursday night.
