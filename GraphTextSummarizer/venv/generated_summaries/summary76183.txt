We gathered an all-star panel of three central bank governors from Brazil, China and Nigeria, the finance minister of Mexico and the chief executives of Coca Cola and Renault-Nissan for a one hour discussion "Emerging Markets at a Crossroads" at the World Economic Forum in Davos. The IMF a day before the World Economic Forum got underway said that emerging market economies will grow 5.4%, fractionally lower than the group's forecast last October. The stumbling performance of all the BRICS minus China is what has led investors to home in on the next wave of emerging markets, especially the highly populated countries such as Nigeria, Turkey and Mexico. This implies substantial growth, justifying the half trillion dollars or more of investment for plants being set up in these emerging markets. The BRICS markets, Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, share little in terms of a common DNA but investment in these markets are still paying handsome dividends due to the size of their consumer markets.
