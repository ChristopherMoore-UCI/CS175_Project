Burns said footage of Roosevelt struggling to move is rare because the Secret Service either prohibited or confiscated cameras at the time to minimize the public's knowledge of the devastating effects that polio had had on him. A rare video showing a walking President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who was paralyzed from the waist down by polio in 1921, has been donated to the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission. What the film shows is that FDR was not hiding his disability." Robin Glass, director of Little White House in Warm Springs, Georgia, where the President retired, added: "To me it shows the public the strength and determination of FDR to live a normal lifestyle and not be limited by a crippling disease. The President attempted to conceal his disability from the public during a presidency that spanned most of the Great Depression and World War II. FDR was stricken with polio at 39.
