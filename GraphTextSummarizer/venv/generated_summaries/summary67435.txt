Conveniently for the junta, the election law specifies that a convict cannot be a member of a political party, and so Suu Kyi can not stand for election. A president, not a general, will be head of state, and another set of elections will be held in five years, when perhaps democracy may have a better chance. Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate who has spent most of the last 20 years under house arrest or in prison, says she will not vote. Each candidate has to pay a US$500 fee for running in the election -- and the fee has been criticized as an obstacle to many who would otherwise stand for election. The National Democratic Front is a splinter group of former NLD members who think it's better to participate in this election as a first step towards full democracy.
