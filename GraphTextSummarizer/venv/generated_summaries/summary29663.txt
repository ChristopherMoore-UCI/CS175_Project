Spanish authorities --- from the government to the courts to the police -- have tried to choke off support for ETA in recent years, with numerous arrests of ETA suspects, convictions at trial, restrictions on political activities of known ETA supporters and a clampdown on clandestine ETA financing. The Supreme Court's chief justice, Francisco Hernando, told reporters Wednesday that in addition to outlawing Basque Nationalist Action, the court would also immediately consider a similar ban on another leftist party, the Communist Party for Basque Lands, or PCTV as it is known locally, also for suspected links to ETA, the court's press office said. ETA is blamed for more than 800 deaths in its long fight for Basque independence and is listed as a terrorist group by the European Union and the United States. In March 2006, ETA declared a "permanent" unilateral cease-fire, raising hopes for an end to nearly 40 years of ETA violence. Spanish courts previously outlawed another political party, Batasuna, for its ties to ETA, and prosecutors and lawyers for the government argued before the Supreme Court that Basque Nationalist Action was a kind of successor to Batasuna.
