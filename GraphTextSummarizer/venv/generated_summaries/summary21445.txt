Oscar watchers, including studio executives, film journalists and fellow Oscar campaigners,Â told me that Summit spent between $3 million and $5 million for the campaign, which consisted mainly of hiring consultants to spin "Hurt Locker" and "Avatar" in a battle of good versus evil within the press. Not so for Oscar campaigns. Out in Hollywood, another kind of campaign -- one with prettier people, with better hair, but equally sharp nails -- will rage over the next three weeks for Oscar. Building momentum involves racking up accolades and awards from individual guilds and film festivals before the nomination voting in January. "Hurt Locker" actually lost out to "Avatar" in the Globes race, and that might have been a well-timed boon for the small flick.
