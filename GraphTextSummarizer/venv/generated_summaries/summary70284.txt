Since the death of Michael Brown, America has been in an intense debate over how law enforcement operates in communities of color. But nothing was more gratifying than to hear the words of encouragement I received from fellow black officers representing various police departments throughout the country. Finally, I offered what I believe could be achievable solutions to improve the relationship between law enforcement and the communities of color we serve. Like 99 percent of those in law enforcement, I did not get into this profession to disrupt or end lives; rather, I want to save the lives of so many people -- like my brother. I spoke to those who are part of our black communities and encouraged them to form relationships with local law enforcement and work with them to recruit more diverse police officers.
