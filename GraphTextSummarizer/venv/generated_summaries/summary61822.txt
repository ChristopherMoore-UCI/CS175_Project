Williams came into Friday's single match on the back off a draining doubles match with her sister Serena. There was a fairytale in New York for qualifier Mirjana Lucic-Baroni as she knocked out second seed Simona Halep 7-6 6-2. Roger Federer and Maria Sharapova, also former winners at Flushing Meadows, hope to stay the course later on Friday. The third set saw the pendulum of momentum swing between the two players. But there were cheers from the crowd on Arthur Ashe court when the 34-year-old home favorite won her first game of the match at the start of the second.
