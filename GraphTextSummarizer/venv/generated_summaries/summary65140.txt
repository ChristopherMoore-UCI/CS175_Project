-- The body of Sen. Robert Byrd, D-West Virginia, will lie in repose in the U.S. Senate chamber on Thursday, two Senate aides familiar with the plans told CNN. Manchin has ordered flags flown at half-staff at state facilities in Byrd's honor, and ordered the lights of the state Capitol dome turned off until further notice. On Monday, West Virginia Secretary of State Natalie Tennant said there will be no election this year to fill the remaining time in Byrd's term, and that the election will take place in 2012. Two elections will be held in November 2012, Tennant said -- one to fill the remaining two months of Byrd's term and one for the new six-year term in the Senate that begins in January 2013. Byrd's body will also lie in repose at the West Virginia state Capitol from 9 p.m. Thursday to 9 a.m. Friday, West Virginia Gov. Joe Manchin's office said in a statement, and "the public is invited to pay their respects.
