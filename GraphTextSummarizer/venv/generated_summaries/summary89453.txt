Weener said the agency would look into whether there was any connection between the July derailment and Sunday's crash, but both he and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo discounted the possibility. In a statement issued Monday evening, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said the data "makes clear that, as we suspected, extreme speed was a central cause of this crash. " Train crash victim was 'pure goodness,' widow says CNN's Alexandra Field reported from New York. " "For a train to be going 82 mph around that curve is just a frightening thought," said Schumer, D-New York, who appeared at a news conference with Weener. She said the train wasn't equipped with positive train control -- a high-tech system designed to slow down or stop trains to prevent crashes caused by human error.
