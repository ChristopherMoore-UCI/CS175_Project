U2 -- Adam Clayton, Bono, The Edge and Larry Mullen Jr. -- hold signs for "U2 Way" Tuesday in New York. Drummer Larry Mullen cracked that he had been hoping for something better, along the lines of Larry Mullen Circle. Bono, Adam Clayton, Larry Mullen and The Edge appeared on the southwest corner of 53rd Street and Broadway -- along with Mayor Michael Bloomberg -- to unveil the street sign "U2 Way." Guitarist The Edge said the band has a long history with New York City -- from the Mudd Club, where the band played in its early days, to Madison Square Garden, where it is expected to play several sold-out shows this summer. Avoiding traditional rock band stumbles and breakups, U2 is in its fourth decade of music, dating back to the band's formation in 1978, when the four were just a bunch of high school friends hanging out on the streets of Dublin, Ireland.
