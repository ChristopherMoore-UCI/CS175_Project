"These claims were filed in an effort to eliminate the use of impermissible pressure tactics by the union which are impeding the parties' ability to negotiate a new collective bargaining agreement," said NBA Deputy Commissioner and Chief Operating Officer Adam Silver. NBA Commissioner David Stern has argued that the last season was not profitable for most of the league's 30 owners and there was a need for some cost-cutting help from players. "This is just one more log on the fire that is threatening to consume the whole NBA season," said David Aldridge, a reporter for NBA TV. The NBA also announced Tuesday that it has filed an unfair labor practice charge with the National Labor Relations Board along with the lawsuit, which was filed in federal court in New York. Aldridge said other big issues are a fight over whether the NBA will strengthen its salary cap and a move by the owners to get a bigger share of revenues.
