A warrant was issued Friday in North Carolina for the arrest of Pettway, for violating her two-year probation sentence on attempted embezzlement charges, according to North Carolina Department of Corrections spokeswoman Pamela Walker. Carlina White has told the Post that the woman who raised her is Pettway, who she said was pregnant in 1987, but lost her baby. Federal investigators have joined local and state law enforcement in an effort to track down and prosecute Ann Pettway, who is suspected in the 1987 abduction of Carlina Renae White, according to a law enforcement source. Carlina was admitted to the hospital, and White went home to rest. The woman on the other end of the line said she was Carlina, and she sent White a picture taken in 1987.
