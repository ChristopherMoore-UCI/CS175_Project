The attack was the latest to shake the garrison city since this year's launch of strong military offensives against Taliban insurgents in the Swat Valley and South Waziristan. -- The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for Friday's bombing of a mosque in Rawalpindi and vowed to carry out more attacks, according to an e-mail message from the group. The Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan took responsibility for the action on Friday but reiterated its claim in an e-mail to CNN on Saturday because media outlets quoted analysts and some officials who doubted the group's participation. CNN's Reza Sayah and Journalist Nazar Ul Islam contributed to this report. Four militants armed with guns and grenades stormed the mosque in Rawalpindi, and most of the victims were children.
