Engine maker Pratt & Whitney worked with Air Force investigators to inspect all engines in the fleet. The limited flight clearance, approved by Navy and Air Force officials Monday, allows the aircraft to fly with an engine inspection regimen and restricted flight envelope following the fleet's grounding after an engine fire last month. The opening day brought $42 billion of orders and commitments for commercial aircraft and engines, according to a statement from the show's organizers. But its production has been controversial for its soaring cost history -- the price tag has nearly doubled from early estimates, to $135 million per unit as of last year, according to a U.S. Government Accountability Office report in March -- as well as its schedule, software and other setbacks. Richard Aboulafia, a Teal Group analyst, said earlier this month that every component of the F-35 overall "is pushing the frontiers of technology" as engineers combine extraordinary engine power with a lighter weight design.
