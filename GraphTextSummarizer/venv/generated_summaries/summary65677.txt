For several years, U.S. authorities have alleged that Hezbollah is profiting from drug trafficking from South America to Europe via west Africa. The Treasury said it had reason to believe that managers at the bank were complicit in money laundering by Ayman Joumaa, an alleged trafficker accused by U.S. authorities of shipping drugs from South America to Europe and the Middle East through west Africa. In June 2008, the U.S. Treasury Department designated two Venezuelans of Lebanese descent as Hezbollah financiers and supporters. One of the entities designated along with Joumaa was a company that runs a used car business in Benin and Congo out of southern Lebanon. -- A Lebanese bank has denied accusations by the U.S. Treasury Department that it is involved in laundering hundreds of millions of dollars on behalf of a drug kingpin -- and rejected claims it has links with Hezbollah, the Lebanon-based militia.
