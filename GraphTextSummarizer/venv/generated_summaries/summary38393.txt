Scolari, who masterminded Brazil's record fifth World Cup success in 2002, has had four draws and a win since losing 2-1 to England in London in February. It was the end of a long season for a German squad missing most of the key players who contested the European Champions League final for Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund, but it was an important preparation for the Americans -- who next take on Jamaica, Panama and Honduras in three World Cup qualifying matches. The iconic Maracana, which hosted the decisive game of the 1950 World Cup when Brazil agonizingly lost to Uruguay, has been extensively renovated since the last time England visited in 1984. England looked set for another famous win when Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney -- who also scored in February's Wembley match -- ran at the retreating defense and fired a shot that looped into the net after hitting the back of Fernando. Scolari now has one more match, against France in Porto Alegro next Sunday, before beginning the eight-nation Confederations Cup against Japan on June 15.
