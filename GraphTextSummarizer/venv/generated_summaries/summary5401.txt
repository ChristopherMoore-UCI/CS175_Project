The students' views are also a microcosm of the broader opposition nationwide to the bill, which Gov. Jan Brewer signed into law Friday, citing concerns over crime and the failure of the federal government to regulate immigration. What will Arizona immigration law do? "The law is instilling fear and limiting people from going out and doing chores, which will eventually have a direct economic impact on the community, too." Even students who support immigration reform called the law ill-conceived. At the University of Arizona this week, resistance took the form of Immigration Awareness Week, a series of programs and information sessions organized by Mejia and others that included meetings on how the law works and an open forum for students to share their struggles with immigration. The letter, which Baires and his cohorts are circulating as a petition, sums up the sentiments of many students.
