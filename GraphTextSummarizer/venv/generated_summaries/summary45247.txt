-- DNA testing to try to identify hundreds of bodies buried in a mass grave during World War I will start this week, the British and Australian ministries of defense announced Monday. The announcement comes only a week after the burial of the last British veteran of World War I still living in the United Kingdom. Harry Patch died July 25 at the age of 111, a week after fellow British World War I veteran Henry Allingham died at the age of 113. The British and Australian governments have asked people who think their relatives may have died at the site to get in touch, Francis said. As the British and the newly arrived Australians charged into battle, the Germans opened fire.
