As someone who spent many days in New Orleans, Louisiana, after Hurricane Katrina, I was taken aback listening to the president talk about the government's response. Campbell Brown says President Bush can't seem to see the failure of his administration's response to Hurricane Katrina. I remember going to see those helicopter drivers, Coast Guard drivers, to thank them for their courageous efforts to rescue people off roofs. But on one topic in particular, he seemed almost entirely disconnected from what really happened: Hurricane Katrina. New Orleans was a city for a time abandoned by the government; where people old and young were left at the New Orleans convention center for days with no water or food.
