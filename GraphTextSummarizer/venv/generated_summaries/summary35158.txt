(The Concordia didn't stop in U.S. ports carrying U.S. passengers, which means it wasn't subject to U.S. Coast Guard regulations, according to Brad Schoenwald, senior marine inspector of the U.S. Coast Guard's Cruise Ship National Center of Expertise.) AAA Travel recommends that U.S. citizens who are traveling internationally register with the U.S. Department of State's free Smart Traveler Enrollment program (STEP) at https://travelregistration.state.gov or directly at U.S. embassies or U.S. consulates, AAA spokeswoman Cynthia Brough said. Although U.S. law doesn't single out abandoning ship as a crime, it's a longtime maritime tradition that the captain be the last one off a sinking ship, according to maritime law professor Craig Allen, visiting professor of law at Yale University Law School and the U.S. Coast Guard Academy. In the event of a fire on board, the captain would sound the general emergency alarm -- seven short blasts followed by one longer blast -- to direct crew members to fight the fire and direct passengers to their specified "muster" stations, where passengers are directed during safety drills to gather in event of emergency. In light of the Concordia disaster, the new head of the International Maritime Organization -- the United Nations agency responsible for shipping safety, security and prevention of marine pollution -- has promised to look into the regulation of large passenger ships.
