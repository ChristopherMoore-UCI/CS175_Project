At least two children were killed when Carlotta slammed southern Mexico at hurricane strength, unleashing fierce winds and dumping intense rains over Oaxaca state. The storm destroyed a clay house Friday night in Pluma Hidalgo, killing a 13-year-old girl and her 7-year-old sister, said Cynthia Tobar, a spokeswoman for Mexico's civil protection agency. Carlotta is expected to leave total rainfall accumulations of 4 to 8 inches through Monday over parts of southern Mexico, with as much as 15 inches of rain in isolated areas, the hurricane center said. According to preliminary reports, Carlotta ripped off the roofs of homes and caused widespread power outages and small landslides, Tobar said. -- A storm over southwestern Mexico weakened further Saturday to a tropical depression, the National Hurricane Center said.
