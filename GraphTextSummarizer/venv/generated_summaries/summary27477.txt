-- Dominique Strauss-Kahn arrived in Paris on Sunday morning, less than two weeks after a judge dismissed sexual assault charges against him in an international scandal that altered France's political landscape. Strauss-Kahn's arrest sent shock waves through France and redefined the landscape of the country's upcoming presidential race. In July, prosecutors said Strauss-Kahn is no longer under house arrest and dropped the charges on August 23, citing the accuser's credibility issues. The diplomat and his wife have been one of France's power couples since they married in 1989. Questions arose over the credibility of the accuser, Nafissatou Diallo, prompting prosecutors to back off.
