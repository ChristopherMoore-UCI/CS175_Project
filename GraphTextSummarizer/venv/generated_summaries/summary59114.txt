Meet Chris Rock, hair expert. Rock says he tells his own daughters they're beautiful every moment he can --and has only one answer when it comes to questions of having good hair. "That was disturbing." Rock discovered the hottest hair on the market is found in India, where human hair is the number two export behind software. Stylists then delicately attach tracks of hair -- which can be simple extensions or full wigs -- to the braids. "In India, hair is considered a vanity, and removing hair is considered an act of self-sacrifice," he says.
