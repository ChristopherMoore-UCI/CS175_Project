-- Former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger was admitted to a hospital in Seoul, South Korea, on Saturday with a stomach virus, a doctor told CNN. "He is getting hydration and holding his food down," Dr. John Linton of Yonsei Severance Hospital said. The state-run Yonhap news agency reported that Kissinger, 86, arrived in the South Korean capital Wednesday for a security forum and met with President Lee Myung-bak on Friday. Kissinger, who now chairs a consulting firm, served in the 1970s under Presidents Nixon and Ford. Kissinger had triple coronary bypass surgery in 1982 and an angioplasty in New York five years ago.
