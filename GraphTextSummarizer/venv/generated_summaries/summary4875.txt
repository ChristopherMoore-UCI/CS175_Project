Is it too soon to make a horror film inspired by the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, in which a vast area of the world was radioactively contaminated following the catastrophic meltdown of a Ukrainian nuclear power plant? The "Paranormal Activity" writer-director both co-wrote and co-produced this tale of six vacationing twentysomethings who make the egregious error of signing up for an ''extreme tourism'' outing to the Chernobyl-adjacent and long abandoned town of Pripyat. If nowhere near as scary as the original "Paranormal," the result is superior to many of the low-budget terror flicks that have arrived since (yes, "The Devil Inside," we're talking about you) and benefits hugely from Dimitri Diatchenko's performance as moviedom's Worst. No, according to Oren Peli.
