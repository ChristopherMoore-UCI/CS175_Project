The first mass conflict among industrialized nations, World War I upended the way war was fought. Likewise the scale and type of physical injuries challenged the ingenuity of prosthesis designers, whose work to replace lost body parts would enable countless soldiers to return to productive civilian life, a process echoed today as soldiers from recent wars recover from the toll of roadside bombs. -- World War I began a hundred years ago this summer, but for many of us it might as well be a thousand. And it was World War I that made airpower and strategic bombing central to the success of any future war. At home and on the battlefield, World War I put new objects and words into circulation: "cooties" are something no kid wants to get, but for GIs in the trenches, they were real and they were lice; and sanitary napkins developed from the handy alternative use nurses found for cellulose bandage material produced for the war.
