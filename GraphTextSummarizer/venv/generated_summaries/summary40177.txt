During the first of two days of tapings in Austin, Texas, the panel of four judges -- Spears, Lovato, producer L.A. Reid and series creator Simon Cowell -- listened to 31 singers and groups audition for a chance at a $5 million recording contract, with the four music industry vets critiquing the performances and deciding who should advance to the next round in Los Angeles. Spears' addition to the show -- along with Lovato, she was announced as a new judge at television upfront meetings with advertisers earlier this month, with a rumored $15 million contract -- has drawn plenty of speculation about how the pop star would mesh with the other judges. While Cowell talked to Spears off microphone between many of the performances and asked her to lead off critiques several times in an apparent attempt to draw her into exchanges, the 19-year-old Lovato needed no such prodding. "It's too bad we didn't meet 10 years from now," Cowell said with a wink before Lovato drily countered, "More like 30 years. It was the first of at least three such utterances on the day that Cowell lobbed at Lovato, suggesting viewers and audiences can expect many more charged jabs between the two this season.
