Maersk Line contracts with Trident Group in accordance with U.S. Coast Guard security directives, Speers said in the statement. The 500-foot Maersk Alabama was targeted by Somali pirates in an attempted hijacking off the east coast of Africa in 2009. " Kevin N. Speers, a senior director for Maersk Line, said in a statement that the security contractors boarded the vessel on January 29, and that their deaths were "not related to vessel operations or their duties as security personnel." Another attempt by pirates to board the ship, in March 2011, was thwarted when security personnel fired warning shots. The bodies were found by a colleague who had gone to check in on one of the men in a cabin at about 4:30 p.m. Tuesday, Seychelles police said.
