Obama and congressional Democrats "made a strategic decision to put immigration on the back burner, and they now claim they can't even propose immigration legislation without a Republican," said Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas. The president urged Congress to tackle immigration reform legislation, but stressed that it would require support from both Democrats and Republicans. Obama's speech followed a highly anticipated meeting this week in which the president discussed immigration reform with grass-roots reform advocates. Eight in 10 questioned also supported a program that would allow illegal immigrants already in the United States to stay here and apply for legal residency if they had a job and paid back taxes. -- President Barack Obama renewed his push for comprehensive immigration reform Thursday, calling for bipartisan cooperation on an issue that has repeatedly proven to be a major cause of deep social and political division.
