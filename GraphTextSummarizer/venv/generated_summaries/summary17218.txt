Women must have legal protection from gender-based violence, including domestic violence and marital rape, and sexual harassment. Many women protesters were harassed, arrested, tortured and otherwise ill-treated in gender-specific ways just because they are women, defying convention and exercising their rights to freedom of expression and assembly. More specifically, women are calling for equal rights to political participation and decision-making, equal rights in law, including in relation to marriage, divorce, child custody and inheritance. Women have been badly let down by the men they stood with during demonstrations that toppled tyrants in the Middle East and North Africa. Shot at, tortured, assaulted and detained -- they were equals at the point of protest but now, as new governments extend their grip, we can see that, as citizens, women remain firmly in the second class.
