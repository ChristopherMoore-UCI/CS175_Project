Penelope Cruz, left, Scarlett Johansson and Woody Allen pose at the "Vicky Cristina Barcelona" premiere. And her role as Cristina is nothing short of anticipated -- mostly because of buzz about her steamy love scenes with co-stars Javier Bardem and Penelope Cruz. CNN talked to Johansson about why she loves working with Allen, what it was like to kiss Cruz and the public's "crazy" reaction to her Barack Obama support. The love triangle that results is classic Woody Allen. -- When Scarlett Johansson was hired by Woody Allen for the film "Match Point" in 2005, she was a last-minute replacement.
