The Duke of Edinburgh, who will turn 91 on Sunday, was taken to King Edward VII hospital Monday after falling ill during the queen's Diamond Jubilee celebrations over the weekend, including Sunday's rain-swept river pageant. He also said the Duke of Edinburgh had watched the day's proceedings on television. Prince Philip was "disappointed" not to take part in Tuesday's events, the queen's press secretary said in a statement Monday. Prince Edward, who visited Prince Philip's hospital room Tuesday, said his father was recovering but needed rest. He is likely to remain in hospital over the next few days.
