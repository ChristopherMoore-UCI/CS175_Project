On Monday, the senator said he also supported some sort of "frequent traveler" program -- so that people who travel often aren't as likely to be subject to pat-downs -- and "selective risk assessments done on people are international travelers (and) people who have ties to groups that may be terrorists." During a Senate hearing with TSA Administrator John Pistole in November, Paul argued that the TSA policy of letting children go through the full-body scanners twice -- rather then be subjected to a pat-down -- should apply to adults as well. " Rand Paul is the son of libertarian Texas Rep. Ron Paul, a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination. "When an irregularity is found during the TSA screening process, it must be resolved prior to allowing a passenger to proceed to the secure area of the airport," TSA spokesman Greg Soule said. "I don't think that's too much to ask." A TSA official said Paul was "not detained at any point" and left the checkpoint willingly.
