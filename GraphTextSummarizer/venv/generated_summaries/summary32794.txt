In his unheated city office, Murai told me in March that Kamaishi was his city, the only place he ever wanted to and hoped to live. Six months ago, I stood on a corner in Kamaishi, in northeastern Japan and believed this small city would never recover from the devastation caused by the March 11 earthquake and tsunami. The steel and fishing industries, Kamaishi's economic base, have yet to resume their operations, while many businesses and jobs have not returned. But when I asked if Kamaishi as a city would cease to exist, Murai was emphatic. I met up with Murai again recently, my first trip to Kamaishi since the immediate aftermath of the tsunami.
