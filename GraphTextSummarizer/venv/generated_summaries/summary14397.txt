The treason charge, which the MDC said was "trumped-up," stems from a document titled "The Transitional Strategy" that Biti is said to have written ahead of the March 29 election between President Robert Mugabe and MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai. The MDC has claimed that Mugabe supporters have beat, kidnapped, arrested and killed supporters of their party. Mugabe's party denied any part in the deaths, saying MDC officials hurl such accusations frequently. Tendai Biti, a leading opposition figure, is facing treason charges after returning to Zimbabwe. Magistrate Mishrod Guvamombe said the state had enough evidence to disclose an offense against Biti, a high-ranking member of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC).
