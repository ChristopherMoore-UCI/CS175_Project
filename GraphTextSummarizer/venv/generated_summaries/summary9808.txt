The Ski Train begins its round-trip journey to Winter Park at Union Station in Denver, Colorado. One time a coal train derailed in a tunnel and the Union Pacific officials told the Ski Train operators it would take two days to clear the tracks, says Ski Train media relations director Jim Bain. It runs on weekend days -- leaving Denver's Union Station at 7:15 a.m. -- and begins the return leg nine hours later. The Ski Train is a 68-year-old local favorite that shuttles about 750 people between Denver and Winter Park. The company also arranged for a few buses to come gather the remaining passengers and Bain says they were all headed back to Denver by 8:30 p.m.
