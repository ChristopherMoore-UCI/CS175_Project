The boy told police that a woman with a non-local accent called his name and asked him if anybody in his home played mahjong before taking him to the field, according to quotes attributed to his mother, Wang Wenli, in state media. The six-year-old boy, named by local media as Xiao Binbin, is still recovering in hospital after being found bloodied and in a drugged state with both eyes missing near his home in late August. -- Chinese police say the late aunt of a young boy whose eyes were gouged out is the prime suspect in the horrific attack, state media news agency Xinhua reports. Soon after the attack, state broadcaster CCTV showed images of a boy with bandages over his eyes recovering in hospital while his stricken relatives cried at his bedside. Local police immediately launched a manhunt for the suspect by offering a 100,000 yuan ($16,335) reward for information leading to the arrest of the suspect, whom they said was a woman, according to Xinhua.
