The lives they lived CNN's Yoko Wakatsuki reported from Tokyo, writing by journalist Katie Hunt in Hong Kong -- Masao Yoshida, the man in charge of Japan's stricken nuclear plant in the wake of the catastrophic March 2011 earthquake and tsunami, has died of cancer in a Tokyo hospital aged 58. He was diagnosed with esophageal cancer, which affects the throat, in late 2011 months after the tsunami struck, Tokyo Electric Power Co (TEPCO), the operator of the nuclear facility, said. On Tuesday, TEPCO reported an increase in radiation levels at the plant after a ground water sample collected from an observation well located close to the ocean was found to be contaminated with a radioactive material. "Mr. Yoshida united staff and courageously handled the accident," said Naomi Hirose, TEPCO's chief executive.
