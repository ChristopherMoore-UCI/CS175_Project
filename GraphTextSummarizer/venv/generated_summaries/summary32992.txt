In some parts of the state, as a Wall Street Journal editorial observed, recount officials have accepted Franken votes tallied on election night, even when the physical ballots were nowhere to be found for the recount. In other jurisdictions, the election night tally was thrown out and Franken got to include votes he didn't have election night but his team subsequently discovered. If a legitimate ballot is damaged and cannot be mechanically counted, Minnesota law allows election officials to create and count a duplicate, as long as the original is marked and both ballots are stapled together. Minnesota courts will soon speak on the unequal evaluation of votes that has consistently advantaged Franken. Franken has tried to claim a hasty victory with more votes than voters.
