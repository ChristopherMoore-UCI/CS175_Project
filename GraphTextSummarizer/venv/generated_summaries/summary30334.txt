"Crazy Salad" and "Scribble, Scribble" have been out-of-print as solo volumes since 1991 and 1984, respectively. "Crazy Salad," originally published in 1975, contains Ephron's famous, oft-quoted essay, "A Few Words About Breasts." They will also be available in their entirety as e-books for the first time on that date. After Ephron died in June, did you go looking for her backlist only to have trouble finding these two titles?
