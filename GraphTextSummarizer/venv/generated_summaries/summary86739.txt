Fox's smash hit series "Empire" had its season finale on Wednesday night, and the ratings once again grew. Danny Strong told Deadline that he and fellow "Empire" creator Lee Daniels have steered the series to be both socially conscious (issues of race and sexuality were central to the plot) and night-time soapy. Its soundtrack scored a rare success this week, debuting in the No. 1 spot on Billboard's top 200 album chart, topping Madonna's "Rebel Heart." Most fans were not disappointed with Wednesday night's season finale. The show about the passionate Lyon family and the drama surrounding them and their record label has been a TV phenomenon, with ratings growing weekly.
