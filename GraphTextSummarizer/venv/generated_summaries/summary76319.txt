A section of Tottenham Hotspur supporters chanted "Yid Army" and "We'll sing what we want" at the home Premier League match against London rival West Ham -- a fixture which last season saw one of the visiting fans banned for life for performing a Nazi-style salute. Tottenham dropped to sixth place, three points adrift of north London rival Arsenal -- which returned to the top on goal difference above Liverpool after being held 1-1 by West Brom. Spurs fans greeted their players' entrance onto the pitch with their customary "Yiddo" greeting, PA reported, and sang "Jermain Defoe, he's a Yiddo" for the club's former West Ham striker. -- Faced with the threat of arrest, fans of an English soccer club defied police Sunday by chanting an anti-Semitic term which they claim to have appropriated in a positive manner. Tottenham's fanbase has a large Jewish contingent, and they originally called themselves "Yid Army" in response to anti-Semitic abuse from rival supporters.
