This is important because both signal strength and network speed play important roles in the quality of voice calls and data connections. But, in reality, signal strength and network speed can vary substantially due to terrain, structures, the typical amount of data-hungry wireless devices on the network in a given location, and other factors. RootMetrics users also can view their own personal map with a history of signal strength and network speed. In addition to showing the direction and location of the tower my phone is connected to, and signal strength, it allows me to conduct network speed tests. Yes, carriers all provide coverage maps on their websites that show where their networks are supposed to reach -- theoretically, based on cell phone tower locations.
