Consistent with Francis' own witness to date and his efforts so far to renew the Curia (the Vatican bureaucracy), this appointment of carefully selected men to the Congregation for Bishops, men who share his priorities, may well be the most powerful tool available to him to effect far-reaching and sustained change -- in every parish throughout the entire world. It is bishops who determine the tenor and emphases of local church communities. The Congregation for Bishops is being peopled by a different kind of person, who will implement Francis' vision of a church governed as much by compassion as by orthodoxy. Francis has reconstituted the Congregation for Bishops beyond the replacement of two American prelates. No doubt Francis wants to guarantee that those who are appointed bishops are in accord with this perspective.
