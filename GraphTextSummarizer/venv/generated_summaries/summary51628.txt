Bethune has legal representation in Japan, said Sea Shepherd spokeswoman Traci Walter. Japan's Institute of Cetacean Research, a branch of the fisheries ministry that deals with whaling, accuses Sea Shepherd of jeopardizing the safety of fleets that are conducting research legally. Japanese authorities had called the Shonan Maru 2 incident the latest "publicity stunt" by Sea Shepherd activists. The Bethune case highlights an ongoing feud between Japanese whaling fleets and conservation agencies, especially the hardline Sea Shepherd. Two years ago, Sea Shepherd activists boarded a Japanese ship and handcuffed themselves to the vessel with plastic ties.
