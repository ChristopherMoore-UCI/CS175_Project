Google's new rules mean that in addition to tracking your activities, it can aggregate your data across its many services and platforms such as Google Maps, Gmail, search, and Gchat, for starters. In Google search, things I was looking for were now buried beneath "helpful" suggestions of things I wasn't interested in in the slightest. Clicking a link on my computer or phone automatically opened Google Maps, search, or YouTube. I deleted my YouTube account, set my search engine to Duck Duck Go (a service that doesn't track search information), and logged into AIM. Service by service, Google had convinced me that I needed it for everything, all to seduce me into giving up more of my personal data.
