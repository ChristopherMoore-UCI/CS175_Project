To boil it down into a more recognizable number, more than 50 hours was dedicated to TV commercials on Las Vegas stations in the last seven days, said Evan Tracey, CMAG's president and CNN's consultant on TV advertising. The television airwaves in Las Vegas are so saturated with political TV commercials that in the past week alone, these ads took up 180,600 seconds or 3,010 minutes, according to a new analysis of TV ads for CNN by Campaign Media Analysis Group. A snapshot of all television advertising in the past week shows that $40 million was spent on Senate races, while more than $46.6 million was dedicated to House races. "This is crunch time for politicians as they start to try and reach the all important independent and late deciding voters who will determine the outcomes of close races," Tracey said. Add in the race for governor and other state offices and the airwaves quickly become cluttered with political TV commercials.
