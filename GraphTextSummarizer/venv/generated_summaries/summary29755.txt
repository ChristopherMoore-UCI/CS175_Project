It's because as the economy recovers, there has been more demand for oil, so OPEC members produce above their assigned allocations. According to OPEC estimates, compliance by member states is running at about 57 percent, well below the 80-percent level in the spring of 2009. The year 2011 is not a great deal more promising, with OPEC saying demand will rise only 1.2 percent next year. If they can keep oil prices in the range of $70-85 a barrel, where they have been for the better part of a year, their priorities for domestic infrastructure development can be met without stifling global growth. Ministers here are talking about spare capacity -- basically the ability to produce more oil when demand justifies such action.
