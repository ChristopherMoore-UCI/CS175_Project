Among the uses of pig 05049, according to Meindertsma, are certain varieties of the following products: • Soap, shampoo, conditioner, cosmetics and toothpaste; • Dough improver, which uses proteins from pig hair; • Gelatin, which is used in low-fat foods as well as in cheesecake, vanilla pudding, chocolate mousse and tiramisu; • Beer, wine and fruit juice, which can be filtered by using a gelatin sieve to clear out impurities; • Bone china and paint, paintbrushes and sandpaper; • Collagen to remove wrinkles and pig heart valves to replace defective human valves. Companies just want to make a profit so if the demand changes they will start making other products. "If consumers would make a choice to buy products that are transparent in what they are and who made them, that could be the standard." -- At first, Dutch artist Christien Meindertsma thought she would pick one cow and document all of the uses to which it would ultimately be put. "What I learned from doing it is that the product world is more complicated then you can imagine and that we have no clue of what is in the products that surround us," she told CNN.
