As the storm neared, she rounded up candles and matches, put fresh batteries in the flashlights and huddled with her husband, Dave Fiscbach, and their dog, Barkley, a Chesapeake Bay retriever named for basketball star Charles Barkley. "It never had that opportunity because North Carolina got in the way, dry air came across over Virginia and Maryland and got in the way, and although this was very low pressure, the reason why we could never let the guard down for New York City ... was because the pressure was low enough that at any time, if this storm decided to get its act together, it could have gone from a 60-70-80 miles per hour storm -- it easily could have been a 110 (miles per hour) storm like it was in the Caribbean and like it was in the Bahamas. " Meteorologists measured pressure levels inside the storm that could have allowed it to strengthen back into a Category 3 hurricane, Myers said, but Irene's romp over land in North Carolina prevented the eye wall from spinning into a more destructive storm by the time it arrived in New York. Mass-transit systems closed in Baltimore, Boston, New York, Philadelphia and parts of New Jersey. After the storm moved north, however, people in places such as Ocean City, Maryland, were thankful that Irene had not left behind as much devastation as it could have.
