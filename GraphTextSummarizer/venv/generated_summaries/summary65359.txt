A lot of actors, by now, have learned to do a Boston accent, but Sandler gets something else: the blinkered, bellowing high dudgeon of a certain kind of in-your-face leech whom you can still find hovering in Boston sports bars. But on some level I marveled at the conviction that Adam Sandler pours into playing a character like Donny Berger, a boneheaded, loud-mouthed alcoholic loser from Boston. The more Donny disgraces himself, the more he makes the kind of cringe-worthy sexual jokes that Andrew Dice Clay would have turned up his nose at, the more everyone in Todd's circle thinks he's the life of the party. Donny takes Todd and his friends out for a bachelor party, and it's on this voyage into the night that Todd begins to lose his inhibitions and get won over to the ways of excess â€” to the Donny Way. The movie was a lot funnier when Donny and Todd were foils.
