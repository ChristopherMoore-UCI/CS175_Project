Court officials announced Wednesday work will begin next week to repair and preserve the front exterior, which is decorated with artistic friezes, ornate molding, and the words "Equal Justice Under Law." -- The Supreme Court building is getting a face-lift to its famous facade, seven years after a chunk of marble fell 100 feet onto the stairs leading to the entrance, where it broke into pieces. The court said that after an untold number of surveys, a stone conservation consultant has recommended work, including "cleaning, pointing, bird deterrent removal, stone consolidation to prevent further deterioration, and necessary repairs." The building had been undergoing an extensive interior rehabilitation at the time, but court officers had no official explanation for what caused the falling marble. The Corinthian-style building, clad in Vermont marble, was opened in 1935.
