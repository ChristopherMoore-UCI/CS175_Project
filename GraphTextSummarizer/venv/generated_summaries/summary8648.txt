-- Google is making some changes to its most well-known product: search. The tweaks, updates and beta projects are all part of Google's attempt to make searches faster and more relevant. These tweaks are the survivors of a huge number of experiments Google has done for search. In 2011, the search team conducted 58,000 experiments on search and made 530 tweaks to how search works. "The destiny of search is to become that 'Star Trek' computer," he said.
