-- Six weeks after announcing an indefinite medical leave, Apple CEO Steve Jobs surprised a lot of people when he took the stage Wednesday to unveil his company's next-generation iPad. But the health of Apple's chief, who runs the most highly valued tech company in the world, is more important to shareholders than it is to most of its customers, said Sarah Rotman Epps, a Forrester Research analyst focusing on personal computing. Some of those rumors were tempered when Jobs was photographed in February attending a private dinner with President Barack Obama and other Silicon Valley elite. Apple executives Schiller, Jony Ive and Scott Forstall were there instead. Afterward, Jobs didn't venture out to the demo room, where he sometimes greets reporters and guests who are getting a first look at new products.
