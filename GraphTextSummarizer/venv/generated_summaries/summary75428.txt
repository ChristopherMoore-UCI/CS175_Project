The accompanying text explains that, when Lu found a copy of "Xi Jinping: The Governance of China" on Zuckerberg's desk, the young billionaire told the smiling Communist Party cadre in Mandarin: "I also bought this book for my colleagues -- I want them to understand socialism with Chinese characteristics." In photos posted on China.com.cn, a government-run web portal, top Internet regulator Lu Wei is seen seated in Zuckerberg's chair at Facebook's California campus while holding a book with Chinese President Xi Jinping's portrait adorning its cover. Chinese internet users have reacted with as much surprise and amusement as ridicule and disapproval. For Hu and others, no Facebook at all is preferable to a Facebook with Chinese characteristics. Some sound sympathetic to Zuckerberg's strong desire to crack China's Internet market, the world's largest and a gaping hole in Facebook's global reach.
