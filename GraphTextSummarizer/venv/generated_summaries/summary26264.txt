He wished Snowden good luck: "He's got my love." Snowden told the British newspaper the Guardian, one of the two outlets that broke stories on the programs last week, that he left his job with an NSA contractor in Hawaii without telling either his family or Mills. The girlfriend of self-avowed National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden wrote that she was "adrift in a sea of chaos" after he spilled government secrets and decamped to Hong Kong. No sign of NSA leaker as U.S. investigation builds steam "Surely there will be villainous pirates, distracting mermaids, and tides of change in this new open water chapter of my journey. There is no evidence that Mills knew of Snowden's actions. Leaving me lost at sea without a compass," she wrote Monday, a day after American and British newspapers published Snowden's identity as the source behind their reports on the U.S. surveillance programs.
