The New York Times first reported that the Pentagon had begun flying high-altitude, unarmed drones over Mexico last month. U.S. Global Hawk unmanned aerial vehicles have been used to collect intelligence and track drug traffickers, but only under Mexican supervision, according to a statement by the technical secretariat for the Mexican National Security Council. The flights had been kept secret "because of legal restrictions in Mexico and the heated political sensitivities there about sovereignty," The New York Times reported. -- Mexico on Wednesday admitted that American unmanned drones operate over its territory, but denied that it constitutes a violation of its sovereignty. The joint operation is designed to gather intelligence that can be acted upon by Mexican authorities.
