The scales tipped dramatically for respondents when it came to youth football players and concussion; 80% of the public considers concussions sustained by middle school and high school players to be a serious problem. High schools tackle football concussions "Historically, youth football has fueled the NFL," said Keith Strudler, director of the Marist College Center for Sports Communication. The deal calls for the NFL to pay $765 million to fund medical exams, concussion-related compensation, medical research for retired NFL players and their families, and litigation expenses, according to court documents. At the heart of the lawsuit was plaintiffs' allegations that the NFL led a deliberate misinformation campaign -- primarily through its Mild Traumatic Brain Injury Committee -- to deny scientific data being presented in the medical community about concussion risks. On the topic of NFL injuries overall: About half of the public believes that something should be done about them, while the other half views them as part of the game.
