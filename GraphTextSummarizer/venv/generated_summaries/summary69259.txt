Achebe's accident happened in Awka, in southeastern Nigeria, not very far from his birthplace. If I decide to go back now, there will be so many problems -- where will I find the physical therapy and other things that I now require?" More Achebe: Father of African literature That anger -- triggered by the Biafra civil war, and crystallized by his accident, and the continued failings of Nigeria's successive governments to bring real change to the country -- defined his relationship with Nigeria. Nigeria's hospitals could not take care of him, and soon after he had to be moved to a hospital in England, where he was told he would never be able to walk again. Someone ought to let them know that the biggest tribute they can pay to Achebe would be to create the kind of Nigeria he would have been proud to receive a national honor from.
