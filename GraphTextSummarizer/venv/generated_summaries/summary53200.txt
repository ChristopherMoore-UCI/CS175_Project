U.S. Indian school's fund-raising letters sent to millions signed by fictitious kids The marketing director for St. Joseph's Indian School in Chamberlain, South Dakota told CNN that the stories were broadly true but not specific to any single student. A South Dakota boarding school that sends out more than 30 million pieces of mail every year pleading for money to help its Native American students now says it is changing the way it raises money after a CNN investigation. " St. Joseph's publicly reported raising more than $51 million last year, nearly all of that money generated by the direct-mail appeals, which include "DreamCatchers" (made in China), stickers, notepads, address labels and calendars. CNN reported that seemingly handwritten letters from a student called "Josh Little Bear" were signed by a student who was fictitious. " In his email to CNN, the school's president said: "Even the best of intentions can be misrepresented; we want to make sure that we do not misrepresent the people we serve, the Lakota Sioux of South Dakota.
