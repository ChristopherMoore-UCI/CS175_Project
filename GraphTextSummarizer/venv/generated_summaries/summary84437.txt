Gates attended Harvard until he left during his junior year to start Microsoft with Paul Allen in 1975. During Saturday's session, Gates reflected on a variety of topics, from the philanthropy he's made his life's work since stepping back from an active role at Microsoft to his company's relationship with Apple in the early days. That included buying a 6% share of Apple, which lawyers convinced Gates that Microsoft shouldn't keep for antitrust reasons. While at Harvard, he lived down the hall from current Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer. Gates defended innovation on the earliest Microsoft software though.
