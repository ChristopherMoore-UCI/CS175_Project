That's why, as election results pour in Tuesday night, Rick Santorum will be ready with a fully-charged cell phone and a spreadsheet loaded with names and numbers of Republican candidates to call as soon as their victories -- or defeats -- are announced. Beyond just being a kind gesture, Election Night calls are an opportunity to subtly remind candidates -- especially those in early-voting states such as Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina -- of their support. Florida GOP Sen. Marco Rubio went to to Iowa to promote Senate candidate Joni Ernst and others. Over the weekend, Santorum traveled to Kansas, Texas, North Carolina and Iowa, where his advocacy organization, Patriot Voices, bussed in volunteers to knock on doors for candidates in the first-in-the-nation caucus state. Kentucky GOP Sen. Rand Paul, one of the most dogged campaign travelers this cycle, will spend Tuesday night at an event in Louisville for Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and other statewide candidates.
