The child was swaddled in blankets inside a tote bag at a West Branch, Iowa, gas station, according to Town of Beloit, Wisconsin, police Chief Steven Kopp. A 6-day-old Wisconsin baby who vanished from a home early Thursday has been found safe at an Iowa gas station, authorities said Friday. The U.S. attorney in Madison, Wisconsin, has filed charges of kidnapping against Kristen R. Smith, in the case of 6-day-old Kayden Powell, who was found at an Iowa gas station Friday after going missing from the child's Wisconsin home early Thursday. When police searched her car, they found baby clothes, but no sign of the infant, Kopp said Thursday. Smith was jailed Thursday in Iowa on an unrelated fraud warrant out of Texas after police investigating Kayden's disappearance contacted her on her cell phone and asked her to report to a nearby police station, authorities said.
