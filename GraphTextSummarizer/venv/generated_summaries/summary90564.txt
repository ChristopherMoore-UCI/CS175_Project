In response, China's health authority promised to assure Kunkun with the right to medical treatment, education and a living allowance, reported China Daily. Despite China's fight against AIDS, cases such as Kunkun's suggest inconsistency with official policy. "Kunkun is diagnosed with AIDS, causing great fear among the villagers and village children. In order to ensure the safety of villagers and children, we demand that authorities quarantine Kunkun for treatment," the petition read. People living with HIV or AIDS in China face widespread discrimination and stigma, especially in rural areas where there is a lack of education about the disease.
