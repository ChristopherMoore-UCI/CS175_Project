It said al Qaeda militants in Zinjibar killed two residents and injured another in a mortar attack, and it reported the arrests of 10 al Qaeda members and five other people for firing at civilians and ransacking stores in Aden's Mansoura area. The growing unrest has affected U.S. training operations aimed at helping combat AQAP in Yemen, U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm. Mike Mullen told reporters Thursday. Armed militants took over security offices and fired rocket-propelled grenades at the central bank branch office and the compound of the judiciary on Wednesday, the official said. Government forces have been locked in conflict with al Qaeda's Yemen wing, and authorities fear that the group, called al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP, is exploiting the country's political instability. Fighting erupted for six hours Wednesday in Hawta, the capital of Lahj province, when armed Islamic militants attacked government compounds, according to a security official who asked not to be named because he's not authorized to speak to the media.
