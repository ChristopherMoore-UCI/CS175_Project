Before the virus ravaged West Africa, before the deaths soared into the thousands, before the outbreak triggered global fears, Ebola struck a toddler named Emile Ouamouno. "We noticed that with this crisis, which is almost a humanitarian catastrophe, people flee their villages and abandon their families and their children," said Fassou Isidor Lama, a UNICEF child protection officer. The village is now free of Ebola, but the lingering effects there and elsewhere will last for years. Emile's father is left with only fond memories from when before Ebola ripped apart his life. Ebola can be spread from animals to humans through infected fluids or tissue.
