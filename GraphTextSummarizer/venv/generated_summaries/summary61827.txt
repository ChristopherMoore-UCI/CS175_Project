Hundreds have been arrested, police said, including cultural leaders of rival ethnic groups in the Rwenzori Mountains region and in the oil-rich Lake Albert region bordering the Democratic Republic of Congo. He asks: "How did these people weave such a scheme without being preempted?" Museveni says altogether, there were 13 daylight attacks across three districts in the Rwenzori Mountains and Lake Albert regions. -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni says sectarian and chauvinistic cultural leaders are behind weekend attacks by people, armed mainly with machetes and spears, who killed security personnel and civilians in the western part of the country. "Most of guns were stolen at a police station and at a bank" where there are police guards and private guards, he added. Most of the dead "are attackers killed in a counterattack at a military camp in Bundibugyo district and civilians," police spokesman Fred Enanga said.
