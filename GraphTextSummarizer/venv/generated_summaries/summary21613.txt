"Achieving Mercury orbit was by far the biggest milestone since Messenger was launched more than six and a half years ago," said Messenger Project Manager Peter Bedini, of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. The primary science phase of the mission is scheduled to begin April 4. "Despite its proximity to Earth, the planet Mercury has for decades been comparatively unexplored," said Sean Solomon, Messenger principal investigator. -- NASA's Mercury probe Messenger has become the first spacecraft to go into orbit around the closest planet to the Sun. The space agency is hoping to get the first pictures back from the Messenger probe in orbit by the end of the month. "Mercury's secrets, and the implications they hold for the formation and evolution of Earth-like planets, are about to be revealed."
