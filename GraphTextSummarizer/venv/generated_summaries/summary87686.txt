The attack occurred as parishioners exited St. Charles Catholic Church following Sunday services, according to Nigerian police force spokesman Frank Mba. -- Nigerian authorities said they have five suspects in custody Sunday after a wave of attacks over the weekend in the city of Kano. Kano police spokesman Magaji Musa Majia said the bomb squad was able to successfully defuse a remote-controlled improvised explosive device discovered in its trunk. Five people were killed and eight others injured when an explosive device was lobbed over a wall in Kano's predominantly Christian Sabon Gari district. Mba said two suspects have been arrested and were being interrogated Sunday night.
