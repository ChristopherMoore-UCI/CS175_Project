Even as transgender people are no longer forced to conform to specific genders in certain countries, they are still denied acceptance in many societies. Asian countries including Nepal, Pakistan and Bangladesh have implemented policies recognizing third gender in recent years. If enacted, Thailand would join several Asian countries, including India, Pakistan and Nepal, that have recently moved to recognize third gender. There's a perception that transgender people are well accepted in Thailand, due to the availability of gender reassignment surgery. The old constitution recognizes people of different religion, age, gender -- but had not extended to transgender people.
