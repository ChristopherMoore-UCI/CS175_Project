Similar battles have also unfolded in Maryland and Washington state, where same-sex marriage opponents have pressed for referendums to counter bills that appear to enjoy growing support in their state houses. New Jersey, Illinois and Rhode Island also recognize civil unions providing state-level spousal rights to same-sex couples. A recent Quinnipiac University poll found that 52% of New Jersey voters are in favor of legalizing same-sex marriage. But Christie's Democratic opponents argue that a referendum shouldn't be used to decide civil rights issues, pointing to historic legislative and judicial decisions regarding the rights of African Americans and women. "It's abhorrent to put civil rights on the ballot," said Steven Goldstein, chairman of a gay and lesbian rights group called Garden State Equality.
