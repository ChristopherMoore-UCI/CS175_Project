-- Myanmar's ruling military junta freed democracy activist Aung San Suu Kyi from house arrest Saturday to a throng of joyous supporters who rushed toward her house once the gates were opened. Suu Kyi, a Nobel peace Prize recipient in 1991, has spent 15 of the past 21 years under house arrest for her dogged opposition to authoritarian rule in the nation formerly known as Burma. "The release of Aung San Suu Kyi is about public relations, not democratic reform," said Zoya Phan, International Coordinator at Burma Campaign UK. This was the third time the regime has released Suu Kyi from house arrest. "While the Burmese regime has gone to extraordinary lengths to isolate and silence Aung San Suu Kyi, she has continued her brave fight for democracy, peace, and change in Burma," he said in a statement Saturday.
