The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said Wednesday it is increasing its nationwide monitoring of radiation in milk, precipitation, drinking water, and other outlets in response to the ongoing nuclear crisis in Japan. At least 15 states have reported radioisotopes from Japan's crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant in air or water or both. "This morning I spoke with the chief advisers for both the EPA and the FDA and they confirmed that these levels are miniscule and are far below levels of public health concern, including for infants and children," Gregoire said in a statement. "According to them, a pint of milk at these levels would expose an individual to less radiation than would a five-hour airplane flight. Results from a screening sample of milk taken March 25 in Spokane, Washington, detected radioactive iodine at a level 5,000 times lower than the limit set by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the EPA said.
