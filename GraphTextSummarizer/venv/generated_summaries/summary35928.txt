No matter what kind of Super Bowl party you choose to throw, a quick glance at one's homeowner insurance policy is another smart step in the party planning process. Use what you have at hand to present the burgers, hot dogs, chips and dip in a creative way, said Atlanta party planner April Trigg, founder of Eventologie. A team-colored feather boa or tutu helps make Super Bowl party photos truly memorable, Furkavic said. "At the end of the day, it might not be your favorite team in that last final game, but it's more about bringing your friends and family together, honoring that tradition," said Trigg, whose Atlanta Falcons just missed out on a trip to the big game New Orleans this year. Go outside and dig up some grass to decorate your Super Bowl tabletop, Trigg recommends.
