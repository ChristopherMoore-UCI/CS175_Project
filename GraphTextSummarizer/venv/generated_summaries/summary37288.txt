First prize in the general news category was claimed by Italian photographer Alessandro Penso, with a photograph of an emergency refugee center in an abandoned school in Sofia, Bulgaria, that is housing about 800 Syrian refugees. The photo, which was shot for National Geographic magazine, also won the contemporary issues category at the annual World Press Photo contest. The image "shows African migrants on the shore of Djibouti city at night, raising their phones in an attempt to capture an inexpensive signal from neighboring Somalia -- a tenuous link to relatives abroad," the World Press Photo foundation said. A haunting image by American photographer John Stanmeyer of African migrants in Djibouti has won the prestigious World Press Photo of the Year 2013 award. The competition is the leading world contest for professional press and documentary photographers.
