"This provision is violated where a court of final instance imposes a harsher sentence that cannot be reviewed." Christof Heyns, U.N. special rapporteur on summary executions, said capital punishment "may be imposed only following a trial that complied with fair trial and due process safeguards. ... On Tuesday, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay joined the calls for a stay of execution. "The right of appeal is of particular importance in death penalty cases," said Gabriela Knaul, U.N. special rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers. Only full respect for stringent due process guarantees distinguishes capital punishment as possibly permitted under international law from a summary execution, which by definition violates human rights standards." In a statement Tuesday, Pillay called for a stay, saying the trial had not met stringent international standards for the death penalty, the U.N. said in a statement.
