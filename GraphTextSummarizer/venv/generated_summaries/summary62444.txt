And this is why McBride's death -- ruled a homicide after protests and national media attention -- draws comparisons to that of Trayvon Martin, the Florida teen shot and killed by George Zimmerman, who is of white and Latino heritage, last year. This is the same idea that says it's completely reasonable for the NYPD to continue to "stop and frisk" â€” a practice that disproportionately targets black people, despite its resulting in confiscation of a gun one-tenth of one percent of the time. Now, obviously statistics don't reveal the circumstances surrounding each shooting, but they do reinforce the narrative that black people are inherently more dangerous. Assuming black people are inherently up to no good is not just something some white people are guilty of. But statistics show the benefit of doubt granted to those who have spilled black blood is not extended as graciously when roles are reversed.
