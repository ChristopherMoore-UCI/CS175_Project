The efficiency of trans-European rail travel will be further boosted following the formation of Railteam, an alliance of high-speed rail operators across western Europe. What's more, legislation approved by the European Union last year that requires national rail systems to open up to operators from other countries by 2010, will further push development of a European network of high-speed rail. Other upcoming high-speed rail routes include the HSL Zuid between Antwerp, Belgium and Amsterdam; a number of Alta Velocidad Espa√±ola (AVE) high-speed rail links between Madrid and Spain's provincial cities; and a high-speed connection between Spain and Portugal. -- As airlines slash flights and cut spending in the wake of rising fuel prices, rail travel across Europe is entering into a period of renewal. The cost of such expansion is large, says a Network Rail spokesperson, but crucial to absorb the nation's increasing demand for rail travel.
