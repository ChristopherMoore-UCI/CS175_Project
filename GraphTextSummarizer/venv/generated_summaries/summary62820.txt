On Facebook, users expressed support for nearly twice as many Obama posts as they did Romney posts. Twitter users passed along, or retweeted, 150,106 Obama messages to their own followers, compared to 8,601 retweets of Romney posts, according to the study. The Obama campaign website and blog were updated an average of eight times a day, twice as often as Romney's, Pew found. For instance, during the June 4-17 study period, Obama's campaign posted an average of 29 messages per day compared to Romney's average of one, according to Pew. Pew said Obama had more than 18 million followers on Twitter when it last audited the account, in August, compared to 787,080 for Romney.
