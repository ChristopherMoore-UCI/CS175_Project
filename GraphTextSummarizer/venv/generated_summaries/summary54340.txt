The event left local teenagers saying things about the cops like "basically they're like us." Ultimately, police should be considered members of the community -- a notion that needs to be encouraged by police departments and neighborhoods alike. Fear and mistrust among minority communities toward police are the legacy of many decades of racism, unequal treatment, bias, subjective stereotyping and lack of opportunity. Lack of community policing is one of the shortcomings cited in the DOJ report on Ferguson. With the ongoing protests over the shooting death by police of black teenager Tony Robinson in Madison, Wisconsin, the racist chanting of fraternity members at the University of Oklahoma, and now the inexcusable shootings of two police officers in Ferguson, Missouri, it's safe to say that the always-strained race relations in this country are being pushed to the breaking point. And the point with the most stress is the delicate relationship between police forces and the minority communities that they serve.
