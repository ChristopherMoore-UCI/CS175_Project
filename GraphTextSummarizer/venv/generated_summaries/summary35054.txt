More than 90 percent of research on using stem cells to repair the human heart involves adult stem cells, Lee said. Embryonic stem cells are advantageous in research because they can be grown more easily than adult stem cells in a culture, and are pluripotent, meaning they can develop into any of the various cell types of the body, according to the National Institutes of Health. But it is not yet known whether tissues derived from embryonic stem cells would cause transplant rejection, whereas this does not seem to be a problem with adult stem cells. Crystal expressed general caution about the future of stem cell research, which is still experimental, for heart patients. -- In a field largely still in its infancy, scientists are making headway toward using stem cells to treat heart ailments.
