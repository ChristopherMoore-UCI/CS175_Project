They were the ring bearer and flower girl in the wedding of Raymond's uncle, Ron, and Helen's oldest sister, Charlotte. Thinking of the couple, knowing they each could use a companion, Charlotte suggested Raymond give Helen a call, just to talk. Helen, who says Raymond had appeared to her in a dream weeks before they reconnected, looks at the picture of him and her as ring bearer and flower girl and believes they had a spiritual connection even then. Ron and Charlotte, now living in Las Vegas, traveled back to Pennsylvania in May to celebrate their 45th wedding anniversary. The story begins in 1969, when Raymond walked down the aisle with Helen Klinger for the first time.
