The Tugend's longtime nanny, a mother figure to young Thomas, was forced to leave because of a government edict prohibiting non-Jewish Germans from working in Jewish homes. The elder Tugend had worked with them on health issues related to childhood poverty in Germany after World War I. As soon as he was able, Thomas' father sent for his family. For Thomas Tugend, there was no doubt which side he was fighting for as a young infantryman in Europe in World War II. Then, Thomas' father was told he could no longer treat non-Jewish patients. Born in Germany, Tugend lived a comfortable, upper-middle class life in Berlin.
