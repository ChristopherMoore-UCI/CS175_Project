Other highlights in the report, "America's Youngest Outcasts: State Report Card on Child Homelessness:" â€¢ 42 percent of homeless children are younger than 6. Approximately 1.16 million of homeless children today will not graduate from high school. "These numbers will grow as home foreclosures continue to rise," Ellen Bassuk, president of the center, said in a statement. The study ranked states on their performance in four areas: the extent of child homelessness, the risk for it, child well-being and the state's policy and planning efforts. Homeless children have poor health, emotional problems and low graduation rates, the study found.
