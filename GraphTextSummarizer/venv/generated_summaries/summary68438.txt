The technology to filter mercury and other toxic heavy metals from power-plant smokestacks is widely available and, in fact, some plants already have it in place. That means that every year more than 300,000 babies could be born at risk of serious disabilities caused by mercury poisoning. By far the most common exposure to mercury comes from eating contaminated fish. If just one-seventieth of a teaspoon enters a lake every year, it is enough to raise mercury levels in the fish. Under the EPA's proposed new protections, all plants would have to upgrade, and mercury emissions would be reduced by more than 90% (along with cancer-causing metals such as arsenic, chromium and nickel).
