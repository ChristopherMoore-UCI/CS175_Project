Up to 30,000 students, labor leaders, intellectuals and leftists who ran afoul of the dictatorship because of their political views disappeared or were held in secret jails and torture centers during the nation's eight-year Dirty War. Sentenced along with Menendez was former policeman Roberto Heriberto Albornoz, who was also sent to prison for life. Menendez's most recent trial stems from an army and police assault on a home in Tucuman province on May 20, 1976, according to Argentina's Center for Judicial Information. -- An Argentine Dirty War-era general has been sentenced to life in prison for the killing of five people during the dictatorship. Luciano Benjamin Menendez, former head of the Third Army Corps, was already serving a life sentence for violating the human rights of four others.
