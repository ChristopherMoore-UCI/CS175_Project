Scientists from San Francisco to Stockholm are finding evidence of what gay people know in their hearts: that sexual orientation is innate. Until the time that people accept that all of us are born into our sexual orientation and identity, LGBT citizens will still endure discrimination and selective application of the Constitution's protections. Without that federal law, a majority of our states condone job, housing and other discrimination based on sexual orientation. Even corporate America is ahead of our legislators on this issue: 87% of Fortune 500 companies have policies barring discrimination based on sexual orientation. Discrimination based on sexual orientation has no place in America today.
