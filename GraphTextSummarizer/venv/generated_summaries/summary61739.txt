Evidence recovered from the crime scene and the pattern used in the bombing point to a strong possibility that terror or crime groups operating on the southern island of Mindanao may be responsible for the attack in Makati City, Manila's financial district, according to Nicanor Bartolome, a regional police director. The death toll from a bus bombing in Manila's financial district climbed to five Wednesday as officials pointed to terror and crime groups in the country's south as a likely source of the attack. Gen. Raul Bacalso, the Philippine national police chief, said the terror angle is being looked at closely during testimony before a Senate inquiry Wednesday morning. The head of the Police Investigation Task Force, Arne De Los Santos, identified the explosive device as an 81mm mortar, which he said was triggered by a cellphone. Mindanao is a predominantly Muslim autonomous region, which was set up in the 1990s to quell armed uprisings by people seeking an independent Muslim homeland in the Philippines, a predominantly Christian country.
