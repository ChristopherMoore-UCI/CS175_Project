I felt alone, hurt and by high school, suicidal. By the time I reached high school, I was a softball super star! My parent's rules were set in stone like the Ten Commandments: no drugs, no loser friends and no dropping out of high school. Although my academic struggles still made me feel worthless, I stayed involved in school because as captain of the softball team, I was determined to see our team get to the state finals. High school musical to the rescue When softball season ended, I felt hopeless.
