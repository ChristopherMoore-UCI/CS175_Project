READ MORE: Navy owes $1.5 million for damage to reef Earlier this week, Philippine officials said they would be sending the U.S. government a $1.5 million bill for damage to the reef. Anti-Japanese demonstrations in China turned violent last September, with Japanese businesses and cars damaged, dragging relations between Asia's two largest economies to their lowest level since World War II. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hong Lei made his comments on Thursday, state-run Xinhua reported, a day after Philippine authorities formally charged 12 fishermen with poaching and attempting to "corrupt public officials," the Tubbataha management office said in a news release. The fishermen also faced administrative charges for for illegally entering Tubbataha Reefs Natural Park and for damage to the reefs.
