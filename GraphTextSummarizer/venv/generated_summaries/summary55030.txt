Owusu-Koranteng has dedicated his life to championing the rights of Ghana's poor and helping communities that are adversely affected by large scale mining activity. -- Gold mining might have become a booming industry in resource-rich Ghana, raking in billions of dollars every year, but that wealth has failed to trickle down to many of the country's rural poor who live on the land where the gold is mined from. A tireless activist, Owusu Koranteng spends a lot of time on the road, joined by his wife Hannah who is also committed to the cause. "When people have land and it's been taken away and they're not going to have anything to eat, I understand it," he adds. "Mining goes with a lot of myths, like it creates jobs, it brings development, it makes people's lives better," says Ghanaian activist and founder of the Wassa Association of Communities Affected by Mining (WACAM), Daniel Owusu-Koranteng.
