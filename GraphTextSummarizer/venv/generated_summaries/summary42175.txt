On Tuesday night, Boyd was named the winner of the seventh season of NBC's "The Voice," beating out three other finalists who were coached by Adam Levine. During Monday's episode, Damien, Jamison, McAndrew and Boyd all revealed new singles, and all four are now in the top 10 on iTunes. That song's soulful vocals show exactly why America fell hard for Boyd, who won hearts earlier in the season with his rendition of the hymn "The Old Rugged Cross." Originally from Mesquite, Texas, Boyd relocated to Nashville a little more than 10 years ago. Boyd was coached by country star Blake Shelton, who has previously led three other "Voice" champions to victory. "Probably one of the reasons that I had not had huge success in Nashville yet is because I always stuck to my guns," Boyd reflected in an interview with The Tennessean earlier in December.
