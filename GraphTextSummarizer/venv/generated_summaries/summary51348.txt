The triangles -- there are only two in the collection -- are used in swimwear for the smallest children and as a first support for young girls, even by young women who are not looking for proper support since the tops I design do not offer any. French company Jours Après Lunes has designed a line of "loungerie" -- a compromise between loungewear and lingerie -- for children between the ages of 4 and 12. In an interview with the Lingerie Trade website, Jours Après Lunes creator Sophie Morin defended her brand and the photographs included in the ad campaign. The company's mission is to be "the first designer brand dedicated to 'loungerie' for children and teenagers, comprised of loungewear and lingerie to be worn over and under, inside and outside. " Fashionista.com first broke the story, stating "What's disturbing about Jours Après Lunes is not just the fact that it's lingerie for people who probably shouldn't be old enough to even know what lingerie is, but the photographs on their website."
