Rain has come to the area in recent weeks, Fischer Liddle said, but it has caused more children to fall ill, leading to more malnutrition cases. In fact, the group said it is treating 1,300 children in north and south Galcayo, which is almost half the number of children treated for malnutrition in the area all of last year. "Hopefully, the rains all over Somalia will cause food prices to drop and help some of these families," Fischer Liddle said. " Doctors Without Borders -- widely known by its French name, Medecins Sans Frontieres -- said the brutal mix of a lengthy drought, high food prices and insecurity from violence has caused a spike in malnutrition cases. "The situation is alarming," said Karin Fischer Liddle, head of the organization's mission in Somalia.
