AppGratis, which partners with app developers as a sort of clearinghouse to help them get noticed, was first informed Friday that it was being pulled, according to CEO Simon Dawlat. Dawlat said the company has addressed the App Store issue before, apparently arguing successfully that AppGratis isn't similar to Apple's closely policed sales environment. -- An app that helps users find other apps for free has been banned from Apple's mobile store in a move some say heralds a new round of blacklisting for content the company doesn't like. Apple famously keeps tight controls on its App Store, not allowing any app in without prior approval. " Apple said the app, created in 2008, was pulled for violating a pair of its developer guidelines -- one that bars displaying apps for purchase "in a manner similar to or confusing with the App Store" and another that bans push notifications that contain advertising or "marketing of any kind."
