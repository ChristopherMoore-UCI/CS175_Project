"Mr. Aristide has chosen to remain outside of Haiti for seven years," State Department spokesman Mark Toner said. " The United States warned Monday that Aristide's presence in Haiti could disrupt Sunday's runoff vote that will decide Haiti's next leader. " "Consolidation of democracy in Haiti depends largely on the will of politicians to adopt the principles of a peaceful transfer of power and to accept election results in accordance with mechanisms provided by the electoral law," said a statement from the U.N. Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH), which has been in Haiti since Aristide's departure. He gained popularity in Haiti by giving the poor and disenfranchised a voice, but his critics accused him of corruption, greed and human rights abuses -- problems that have plagued the impoverished Caribbean nation under other leaders as well. They say the White House wants to keep Aristide out of Haiti in favor of a leader more in line with its own views.
