A Japan Railway maglev train hit 603 kilometers per hour (374 miles per hour) on an experimental track in Yamanashi Tuesday, setting a decisive new world record. " The train broke its own record from last Thursday, when it ran at 590 kilometers per hour (366 miles per hour) on a test track. Japan's maglevs don't use metal tracks â€” instead, they float nearly 10 cm (4 inches) above special guideways, allowing for frictionless movement. Unlike traditional trains, maglev trains work by using magnets to push the train away from the tracks and drive the train forward. A spokesperson said the train spent 10.8 seconds traveling above 600 kilometers per hour, during which it covered 1.8 kilometers (1.1 miles).
