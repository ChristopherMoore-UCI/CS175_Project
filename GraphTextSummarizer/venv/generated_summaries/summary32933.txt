'Multicultural London English' Another expert, Paul Kerswill, a linguistics expert at the University of York, said the accent sounded English but was one that could be described as "multicultural London English. It's very hard to tell exactly what part of London he might be from, he said, because this kind of English emerges wherever in London you get a high concentration of people speaking different languages, reflecting the various immigrant groups that have come into the country since World War II. Kerswill said it was difficult to tell the ethnicity of a young person who has grown up learning English from other people who learned it as a second language or whose parents are second-language speakers, because in this melting pot everyone starts to sound quite similar, even those whose parents are native speakers. It's not entirely him," he said, pointing to examples of non-idiomatic expressions and overly stilted, formal English. The text appears to be written in standard English, he said, so there are no clues to be found in the slang a young man might otherwise have used.
