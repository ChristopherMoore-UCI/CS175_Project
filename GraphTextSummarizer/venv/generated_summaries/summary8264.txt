AEG Live argues that Jackson chose and controlled Dr. Conrad Murray, who told investigators he gave Jackson nightly infusions of propofol to treat his insomnia. Fournier said he refused to sedate Jackson because he suspected he was lying to him about his use of drugs. Fournier, a certified nurse anesthetist, testified about an incident on June 3, 2003 in which Jackson stopped breathing while under sedation for a procedure with Beverly Hills dermatologist Dr. Arnold Klein. Every instance where Jackson was given propofol was medically justified, Fournier said. After Jackson suffered a "somewhat bizarre reaction" during the sedation, Klein told Fournier it might be because the singer had an "opioid antagonist" implant.
