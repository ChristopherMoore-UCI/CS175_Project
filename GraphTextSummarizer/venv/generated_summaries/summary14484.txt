At 80 years old, author Joan Didion was announced as the new face of CÃ©line for SS15 and is the subject of a new photography show  -  and she is not the first older woman to have been chosen by big brands. " Honey's recent exhibition at Somerset house, 100 Leading Ladies, aimed to transform the perception of what is possible for women to achieve in their lives. Young, fresh faced women were chosen as the poster girls for brands selling products to make women look and feel young again, or maintain that ever essential 'youthful glow'. " Award-winning photographer Nancy Honey has her own ideas about why its important to see images of older women: "In my own lifetime I have witnessed a profound shift: from little girls imagining their future as marriage and children to the now total belief from childhood that a woman will grow up to have a career outside the home. 100 older British women were photographed Honey in settings that inspire them and interviewed by former Times journalist Hattie Garlick, the results were all compiled into a book, published by Dewi Lewis Media which was launched in tandem with the Somerset House exhibition.
