According to Project ChildSafe, gun owners should lock unloaded weapons in a safe, vault or cabinet inaccessible to children. Among them, a 4-year-old girl killed her cousin, also 4, in Detroit while playing with a gun found under a bed last January, a 9-year-old accidentally killed a shooting instructor in August while firing a submachine gun at an Arizona range and last month a 2-year-old fatally shot his mother in an Idaho Walmart after finding a gun in her purse. The sheriff said guns are rampant in the rural community. "You know, just some gun safety could have come into play, and would have maybe, you know prevented the situation, but it's just really sad, altogether," neighbor Jessica Hutchison said. Monday's incident is the latest in a series of high-profile shootings involving children.
