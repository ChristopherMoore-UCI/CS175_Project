The law prohibits guns that don't contain enough metal to trigger screening machines commonly found in airports, courthouses and other secure areas accessible to the public. Sen. Charles Schumer, D-New York, is sponsoring a one-year extension of the law, arguing it would give lawmakers time to come up with a new measure that would tighten the rules to require metal parts in guns. Texas company makes metal gun with 3-D printer Schumer has said he'll try to get his bill passed next week. That has led to worries that plastic guns could pass through metal detectors without being flagged by simply removing the block, which isn't required for a 3-D-printed gun to operate. Plastic components have become common in popular guns, but commercial manufacturers often use metal as a permanent part of the gun to comply with the law.
