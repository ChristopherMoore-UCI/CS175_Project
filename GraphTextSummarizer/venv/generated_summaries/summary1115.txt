-- Swedish striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic has completed his 46 million euros ($65m) transfer to Barcelona from Inter Milan on a five-year contract, with Samuel Eto'o and Alexander Hleb moving to the San Siro as part of the deal. And Ibrahimovic revealed that Inter president Massimo Moratti had given him permission to leave several months ago should an offer from Barca arrive. "I'm not coming here to be Samuel Eto'o, I'm somebody else, somebody new, but I will try to achieve as much as Eto'o, or even more," he added. I don't have to say that what I want to do is score even more goals; I know I'm capable of scoring goals The Belorussian had shown some reluctance to agree to the deal, but it may end in a permanent move -- with Inter having an option to buy the player for 10million ($14m) euros after his loan deal expires next summer.
