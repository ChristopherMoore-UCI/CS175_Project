He is suspected in the abduction of Lexis Roberts, 12, of Las Vegas, Nevada. In September, Sanders was seen purchasing bullets at a local Wal-Mart in Las Vegas. -- Federal agents in Gulfport, Mississippi, arrested Sunday a 53-year old man, declared dead in 1994, on kidnapping charges. His capture is unusual because Sanders was legally declared dead in Mississippi by family members some 16 years ago. "However, we now know that he is still alive and has ties to several states across the country," the FBI said in a statement earlier this month.
