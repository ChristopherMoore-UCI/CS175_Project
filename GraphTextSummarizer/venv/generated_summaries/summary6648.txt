In December: U.S., Chinese warships come dangerously close Barbara Starr reported from Washington; Chelsea J. Carter wrote from Atlanta. -- A senior Iranian naval official says Iran is sending warships toward U.S. maritime borders to send a message, a move a U.S. defense official characterized as an announcement, not a deployment. It's not the first time Iran has made such a threat, said the U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity. "Iran's military fleet is approaching the United States' maritime borders, and this move has a message," Adm. Afshin Rezayee Haddad said, the semiofficial Fars news agency reported Saturday. They've stated this aspiration before," said the defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.
