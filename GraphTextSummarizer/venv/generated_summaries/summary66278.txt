-- France striker Nicolas Anelka has been sent home from the World Cup in South Africa following a row with national coach Raymond Domenech. "After being informed on Friday evening of the serious incident during halftime of the France-Mexico match, federation president Jean-Pierre Escalettes asked Nicolas Anelka in the presence of captain Patrice Evra to present an official apology to the French public and to express regret for his remarks to Raymond Domenech, the staff and 23 players from the France team. An opening 0-0 draw with Uruguay followed by Friday's defeat has left "Les Bleus" needing to beat hosts South Africa on Tuesday and hope that Mexico and the South Americans do not draw, in order for Domenech's team to progress to the second round. "Words spoken by Nicolas Anelka to the national coach, Raymond Domenech, are completely unacceptable to the FFF, French football and the values they defend," it said on its website. French media have speculated about dissension among the squad, with former star striker Thierry Henry reduced to a minor role as substitute and William Gallas reportedly unhappy about missing out on the captaincy, which was given to fellow defender Patrice Evra. Anelka, who plays for English champions Chelsea, has a history of controversy on the international stage, having declared in 2002 that he would no longer be available for selection after being dropped by coach Jacques Santini when he refused a call-up.
