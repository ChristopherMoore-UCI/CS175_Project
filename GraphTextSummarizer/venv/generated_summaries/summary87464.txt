Known as Las Malvinas in Argentina, the islands lie off the South American country's coast in the South Atlantic and have been under British rule since 1833. Argentina invaded the Falklands in 1982, prompting a war in which more than 600 Argentinean and 255 British military personnel died. -- Prince William is to be deployed next February to the Falkland Islands in his role as a search and rescue pilot, the British Ministry of Defence said Thursday. William will need to be back in Britain in time to help with preparations for the Queen's Diamond Jubilee -- marking 60 years since she took the throne -- to be celebrated next June. William, whose marriage in April to Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, was watched by millions around the world, qualified as a search and rescue pilot in September last year.
