" Prosecutors used audio and video recordings the newspaper made secretly last year involving Majeed, a 36-year-old businessman from London. Prosecutors accused Butt and Asif of taking part in a betting scam, allegedly arranged by Mazhar Majeed, during a match between Pakistan and England played at the Lord's cricket ground in London. One of the recordings showed the reporter handing over $140,000 in a London hotel room that had been fitted with secret cameras. Majeed is heard to give the reporter precise details of events in the match, due to start the following day, that would be rigged by the Pakistani players. The jury was then shown extended clips from the Lord's match, during which the Pakistani bowlers did exactly as Majeed had promised.
