Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad blamed the United States for the 2001 terrorist attacks, an accusation that triggered a walkout Thursday by several United Nations delegates. British Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said at the United Nations on Friday that Ahmadinejad's "bizarre" remarks were meant to distract attention from Iranian issues that generate media headlines. Mark Kornblau, a spokesman for the U.S. mission to the United Nations, issued a statement saying, "Rather than representing the aspirations and goodwill of the Iranian people, Mr. Ahmadinejad has yet again chosen to spout vile conspiracy theories and anti-Semitic slurs that are as abhorrent and delusional as they are predictable." Though incendiary statements from Ahmadinejad are nothing new, tension in the hall grew as the Iranian leader recounted various conspiracy theories about the September 11 attacks. Because someone like Ahmadinejad espouses and expresses such lies publicly, we at the National September 11 Memorial and Museum must lead the preservation and presentation of the authentic history of what occurred on 9/11," he said.
