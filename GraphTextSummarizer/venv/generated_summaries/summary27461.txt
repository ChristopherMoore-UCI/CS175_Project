The cocoa-producing West African nation was plunged into crisis when Alassane Ouattara was declared the winner of the presidential runoff election, but incumbent Laurent Gbagbo refused to leave office. U.N. spokesman Farhan Haq could not confirm any such offer from the Ouattara government and said that Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon still called for Gbagbo to step down in favor of an orderly transition. " It expressed deep concern over continued violence and human rights violations, including against U.N. peacekeepers, and "condemned deliberate attempts to impede the United Nations Operation in CÃ´te d'Ivoire from fulfilling its mandate," referring to the country by its French name. Ouattara remains holed up in the Golf Hotel under the protection of U.N. peacekeepers. "Refugees continue to tell us that in most cases they are fleeing fear of violence rather than actual violence against them," said the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.
