-- U.S. Ryder Cup captain Davis Love III plans to emulate the decision of his Presidents Cup counterpart Fred Couples and select former world number one Tiger Woods for next year's contest with Europe. LaCava left Couples this year when the 51-year-old decided to reduce his playing schedule, and worked with 2010 Ryder Cup player Dustin Johnson until the end of the PGA Tour's recent FedEx Cup playoffs. I'm hoping, for Tiger's sake, that he has a full healthy season next year and we are not in this situation. "I have known him for many years. Woods has played in six Ryder Cups since 1997, but his only experience of team victory came at Brookline, Massachusetts in 1999 after missing out due to injury three years ago.
