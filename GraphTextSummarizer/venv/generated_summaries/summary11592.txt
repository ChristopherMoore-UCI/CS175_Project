Part of his traveling "Body Works" exhibition, "The Cycle of Life," is showing at Berlin's Postbahnhof and features 200 human bodies at various life stages -- from conception to old age, including embryos and fetuses taken from historic anatomical collections. Gunther von Hagens' controversial "Body Works" shows have traveled throughout the world. On his Web site, the anatomist describes the exhibition's purpose and goal "to reveal and expose the anatomical structure of the human body and its function, in a unique lesson, and to teach us about the complexity of the human body, its anatomy, and the importance of leading a healthy way of life." Von Hagens justified his actions as "demystifying the post mortem examination," and likened the medical profession to "medieval priests who would not allow ordinary people to read the Bible," The New Scientist reported. He added that the source of the exhibition is from donors -- people, who during their lifetime, declared their willingness, by informed consent, to display their bodies at the exhibition for the "benefit of education, health and the awareness of the wide public to the different systems of the human body.
