Last week, Düsseldorf airport (DUS) introduced robot valets to take the hassle out of parking for travelers. If airport customers use the robot valet, airport officials said they would consider expanding the system. In Germany, high tech has come to airport parking. The introductory rate for robot valet parking at Düsseldorf is 29 euros ($39.59) per day or 4 euros ($5.46) per hour. "Our product is especially appealing to business travelers, who arrive at the airport shortly before the flight, seek efficient parking, and return within a few days," said Thomas Schnalke, the airport's managing director.
