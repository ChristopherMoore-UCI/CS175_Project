The pledges of unity came one day after Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez and Colombian President Alvaro Uribe got into a shouting match at a private luncheon for the heads of state. Published reports Tuesday in major newspapers in Colombia, Argentina, Spain and other nations said Uribe told Chavez to "be a man," to which the Venezuelan leader replied "go to hell," something that Chavez confirmed to Aristegui. "I think that if the table hadn't been there as an obstacle, and our friends weren't sitting right there, that President Uribe physically would've attacked me," Chavez said. Chavez also took economic and trade measures against Colombia that Uribe likened to an embargo at Monday's heated luncheon. Colombia has said Chavez's government aids Marxist guerrillas waging war on Colombia, particularly the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, known as the FARC.
