Maradona, 48, will be assisted by former Argentina coach Carlos Bilardo, who will act as general manager. " Maradona wasted little time in stamping his authority in his new job, announcing that Liverpool's Javier Mascherano would replace Javier Zanetti as captain of the Argentina side. "I'll put together the team, I'll choose the players and I'm sure Carlos will take care of a ton of other things. Maradona's well-publicized off-field antics make him a controversial appointment, despite the hero worship status he enjoys in Argentina after almost singlehandedly leading them to the 1986 World Cup in Mexico. Critics say he is inexperienced in a coaching role, having failed in brief stints with Argentine teams Deportivo Mandiy√∫ and Racing Club during the mid-90s, but Grondona defended his appointment.
