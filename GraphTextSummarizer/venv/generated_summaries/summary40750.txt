According to the office of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, in fiscal year 2013 a total of 414,397 undocumented immigrants were apprehended after crossing the border illegally into the United States. "The only thing that matters to them is money, not people." Padilla said Border Patrol agents often spot and rescue immigrants stranded in the desert, which is an important part of the agency's job. They ask foreign diplomats at consulates in the United States to spread the word in their countries about the dangers of illegal border crossings, and they try to get the word out in Spanish-language media, Padilla said. As the national debate over immigration reform heats up, border security is a top issue on many lawmakers' agendas. But from her point of view at the border, Loureiro says she doesn't think any efforts in Washington to boost border security will have much of an impact on whether people make the dangerous journey.
