The U.S. branch of the well-known British network wanted to explore a part of American history that has only been seen in "Gangs of New York. In BBC America's new prime time drama, "Copper," Irish-immigrant detective Kevin Corcoran roams from the filthy slums of Five Points to the glimmering sidewalks of Fifth Avenue -- all with a set of brass knuckles snugly resting on his fingers. The 10-part series, created by Tom Fontana (best known for "Homicide: Life on the Street" and other dramas) and produced by Barry Levinson (the acclaimed director of films like "Diner"), unfurls with Corcoran investigating a girl's death while trying to find his missing wife and solve his daughter's murder. That's life -- however dark things get, the reality of the moment is actually kind of funny, and that's something Tom The year is 1864, and the tattered remnants of an ongoing Civil War remain in New York City.
