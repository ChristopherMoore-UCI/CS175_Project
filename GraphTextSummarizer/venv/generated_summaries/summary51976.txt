Youssef shot to fame during Egypt's 2011 revolution when he mocked former Egyptian strongman Hosni Mubarak on his homemade political satire show -- shot in his laundry room and posted on YouTube. In a decision many might consider a blow to freedom of dissent in Egypt, one of the nation's most popular comedians, Bassem Youssef, announced on Monday his political satirical show will no longer air on Egyptian TV. One year later later, Youssef had his own show on Egyptian TV where he derided Mubarak's replacement, Islamist President Mohamed Morsy. Several months later, Egyptian broadcaster CBC pulled the plug on Youssef when he poked fun at the almost cult-like adoration of Abdel Fattah el-Sisi -- the former Army chief who is now Egypt's President- elect. The end of Youssef's show will likely fuel concern among international rights groups and pro-democracy activists who have increasingly accused Egyptian authorities of stifling dissent and freedom of speech.
