Cable television, which has the luxury of targeting its "reality" shows -- many of which are simply sitcoms in different guise -- at specific demographics, has opted for upscale families ("Keeping Up With the Kardashians"), heartland groups ("Duck Dynasty") or a mix of flavors ("Here Comes Honey Boo Boo"). "Bill Cosby is always going to be welcomed into people's homes because of nostalgia for the Huxtables," says Amanda McClain, a communications professor at Holy Family University in Philadelphia. Since the '80s, the dominant family shows have been "The Cosby Show" and "Family Ties," "Home Improvement" and "Everybody Loves Raymond," "Two and a Half Men" and "Modern Family." The return of Cosby coincides with other figures from the '80s and early '90s making their return to prime time in one way or another. After all, TV families have always reflected our culture, even if they've sometimes been a year or two behind the times.
