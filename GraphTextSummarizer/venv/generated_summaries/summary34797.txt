The stations were pulled from the air because they did not broadcast a speech by President Hugo Chavez, as required by national broadcast laws. "The action against RCTV is a disturbing sign of the growing censorship imposed by President Hugo Chavez. The Chavez government had already pushed RCTV off of public airwaves in 2007 for similar violations. Protesters say that the suspension of RCTV, known for its anti-Chavez slant, was provoked by the Chavez government. Many press freedom organizations, including the Committee to Protect Journalists, have urged Chavez to allow the stations back on the air right away.
