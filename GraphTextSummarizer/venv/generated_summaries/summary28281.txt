-- We're reviewing two $99 turn-by-turn navigation applications for the iPhone, TomTom and Navigon. Navigon also has the TomTom beat on features: An early update added text-to-speech, which means Navigon's app says the street you should turn on and not just "turn left. It's free for phones that run Android 2.0, and word is that they're in talks with Apple to get it on the iPhone (word that brought a big hit to the stock of both GPS giants, Garmin and TomTom). I like the look and feel of the maps better, how it switches to night view automatically and its on-screen and voice alerts. " Navigon also just released a $24.99 (intro priced at $19.99) upgrade option that will give you live traffic information.
