"The live coverage of Bo's case on Jinan Intermediate Court's Weibo feeds is awesome and a huge progress for media coverage on trials!" wrote Weibo writer Youyoulaihaiyouqu. After watching a video in which Tang detailed how he sent Bo money, Bo remarked, "I saw an ugly performance by a person who sold his soul," the court said. Once heir apparent for a place at the top of China's political elite, Bo is on trial on charges of bribery, embezzlement and abuse of power. -- One of the most dramatic developments from the trial of disgraced senior politician Bo Xilai isn't what was said in court, but that the arguments were revealed at all. "You (referring to Bo) will always remain a great secretary in the eyes of Chongqing people!" wrote Suzui.
