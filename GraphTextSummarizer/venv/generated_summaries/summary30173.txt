A simmering dispute over islands in the East China Sea began to bite into trade between China and Japan on Tuesday as Chinese protests prompted Japanese companies to suspend work there. China termed the deal "illegal" and sent six surveillance vessels into Japanese territorial waters on Friday, drawing protests from the Japanese government. Messages and photos posted on Chinese social media sites showed angry mobs in numerous cities ransacking Japanese stores and restaurants as well as smashing and burning cars of Japanese make. They sit between Okinawa and Taiwan and have been under Japanese control for more than a century, but China claims they have been a part of its territory "since ancient times." A total of 11 Chinese government ships were near the islands on Tuesday afternoon, the Japanese Coast Guard said, adding that it had warned the vessels not to enter Japanese territorial waters.
