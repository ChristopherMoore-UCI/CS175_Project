Burrell Edward Mohler Sr., 77, and his sons Burrell Edward Mohler Jr., 53; David A. Mohler, 52; Jared Leroy Mohler, 48; and Roland Neil Mohler, 47, are being held in the Lafayette County Jail with bails ranging from $30,000 to $75,000. -- Investigators are searching property that once belonged to one of five members of a Missouri family arrested on multiple child sexual abuse charges for "a body or bodies," the Lafayette County sheriff said Wednesday. All of the charges stem from those documents, Alumbaugh said, adding that he expected additional charges based on other victim statements. Six children, who are siblings, came to law enforcement authorities with stories of sexual performances, mock weddings, rape with various objects, and a forced abortion, according to court documents obtained by CNN affiliate KSHB in Kansas City. Sheriff Kerrick Alumbaugh said his department and other law enforcement agencies investigating the case are seeking witnesses and more possible victims.
