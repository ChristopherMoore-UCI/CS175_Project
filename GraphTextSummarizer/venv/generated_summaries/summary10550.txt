The U.S. Mission in Kampala, Uganda, said, "David's courageous devotion to promoting the universal human rights of members of Uganda's lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community improved the lives of minority populations in Uganda and throughout Africa, and his selfless dedication to defending human rights and speaking out against injustice served as inspiration to human rights defenders around the world. In Uganda, homosexual acts are punishable by 14 years to life in prison, according to rights activists. (They say,) 'Can you go away before my house is burned?'" Authorities in the Mukono criminal investigations department declined to comment pending further investigation. "When we called for hanging of gay people, we meant ... after they have gone through the legal process," said Giles Muhame. David had faced the increased threats to Ugandan LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) people bravely and will be sorely missed," said Maria Burnett, senior Africa researcher at Human Rights Watch.
