Lauren runs a business in the United States called Jenny Lauren Jewelry, products from which are available at Ralph Lauren stores and various select stores in California, New York and Colorado. It was also well short of the costs of the $43,158 incurred as a result of the flight diversion and inconvenience it caused to passengers and crew -- as detailed during Wednesday's court hearing in Ennis -- state broadcaster RTE said. During her appearance at Ennis Courthouse, Lauren's attorney, Sharon Curley, said her client had a number of medical conditions and was extremely sorry about the trouble she had caused, RTE added. Jennifer Lauren pleaded guilty Wednesday to a charge of "being intoxicated to such an extent as would give rise to a reasonable (possibility) that you might endanger yourself or other persons on board" an aircraft, said Susan Dermody from the Ennis Court Office. The 41-year old was arrested Monday at Shannon Airport in western Ireland after a Delta Air Lines flight from Barcelona to New York was diverted, according to RTE.
