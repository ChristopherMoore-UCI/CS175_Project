Pentagon officials have said cluster bombs save the lives of U.S. troops and have a legitimate role in its arsenal. The U.S. military will continue to use cluster bombs but will try to reduce the number of civilian casualties by redesigning them so there are fewer ordnances that detonate long after the weapon is fired, officials said Wednesday. In addition, the Department of Defense will begin disposing of excess cluster bombs in its inventory "as soon as possible," according to a Pentagon statement released Wednesday. Sen. Patrick Leahy, a Vermont Democrat who opposes cluster munitions, in June sponsored a joint resolution calling on the Bush administration to sign the Convention on Cluster Munitions treaty. The new policy requires that by 2018 the United States use only a new style of cluster bomb -- one with a 99 percent detonation rate for the hundreds of bomblets released from each of the scatter-style weapons.
