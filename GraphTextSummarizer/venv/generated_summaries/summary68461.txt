Another defendant, Patrick Abraham, 29, was convicted of two counts involving supplying materials to terrorists and terror groups, and of conspiring to destroy buildings with explosives. The six suspects were arrested in June 2006 for allegedly conspiring to blow up buildings, including the 110-story Sears Tower, the nation's tallest building, in Chicago, Illinois; the FBI's Miami office and others. The suspected ringleader, Narseal Batiste, 35, was the only defendant found guilty of all four conspiracy charges, including conspiring to incite a rebellion against the United States, supplying materials to a terror organization and terrorists, and conspiring to destroy buildings with explosives. A sticking point for the first two juries was whether the defendants were actually seriously plotting with al Qaeda as the prosecutors alleged or if they were simply struggling young men who were looking to con an FBI informant out of money, as the defense alleged. -- Five of six men accused of plotting terrorist acts with al Qaeda were convicted Tuesday by a Miami jury after six days of deliberation, authorities said.
