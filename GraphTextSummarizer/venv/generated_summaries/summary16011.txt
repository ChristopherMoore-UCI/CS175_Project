" "I'm relieved that Phillip and Nancy Garrido have finally acknowledged their guilt and confessed to their crimes against me and my family," Dugard said in a statement released by her representatives at Nancy Seltzer & Associates, Inc., in Los Angeles. -- Phillip and Nancy Garrido pleaded guilty Thursday to the kidnapping and sexual assault of Jaycee Dugard, whom they held captive from age 11 through 29, the El Dorado County, California, district attorney said. Nancy Garrido, 55, pleaded guilty to one count of kidnapping, one count of rape by force, and to California's "one strike" rape law, Pierson said. California law doesn't provide for a death penalty or a life sentence without possibility of parole for the offenses committed by the Garridos, Pierson said. Both Garridos will receive life in prison at a sentencing hearing scheduled for June 2, District Attorney Vern Pierson said in a statement.
