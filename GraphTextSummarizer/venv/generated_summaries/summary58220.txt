-- South Korean striker Ji Dong-Won, who scored four goals for his country in this year's Asian Cup, has joined English Premier League club Sunderland. Meanwhile, former Germany international Torsten Frings has left German club Werder Bremen to join Major League Soccer side Toronto FC. "I am so satisfied to be able to come to a good club, a nice club in the world's number one league," Ji told Sunderland's official web site. He follows in the footsteps of compatriot Park Ji-Sung, who has won four Premier League titles and Europe's most prestigious club competition, the Champions League, since he joined Manchester United in 2005. Ji starred for his country at January's Asian Cup in Qatar, grabbing four goals to take his tally to six in 11 appearances.
