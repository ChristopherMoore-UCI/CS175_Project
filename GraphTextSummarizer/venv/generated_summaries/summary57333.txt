"Sherlock" TV series creator and actor Mark Gatiss wrote the script, and "Game of Thrones" actor David Bradley stars as William Hartnell, the actor who played the first Doctor. Hartnell had appeared in various plays and films before being cast as the first Doctor, the role for which he is largely remembered. Actress Jenna-Louise Coleman talks 'Doctor "An Adventure in Space and Time" will premiere later this year (the air date hasn't been announced) and fictionally recounts the creation of series while exploring the team behind its first episode. To boldly go on a nerdy pilgrimage Gatiss and Bradley appeared at the recent Comic-Con in San Diego to promote the upcoming film and spoke with CNN on the red carpet for a party for "The World's End," which also stars Bradley.
