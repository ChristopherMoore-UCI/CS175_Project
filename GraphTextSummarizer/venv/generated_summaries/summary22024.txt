For those who don't know, Hello Kitty is an international superstar who was introduced to the world in 1974 by Japanese company Sanrio. As the Sanrio website clearly states, Hello Kitty is a "cheerful and happy little girl ... who lives in London with her mama (Mary White), papa (George White), and her twin sister Mimmy. The apparently shocking revelation was made in an LA Times article published Wednesday about a retrospective of Kitty paraphernalia opening next month at the Japanese American National Museum. -- Six simple words have sent Hello Kitty lovers into a spin. "Since Hello Kitty isn't a cat, wtf is My Melody?" tweeted @mrsunlawyer.
