-- California Republican gubernatorial candidate Tim Donnelly took to CNN's Spanish-language airwaves recently to deny accusations that a campaign ad he shot with Cuban-Venezuelan actress Maria Conchita Alonso is racist. " Alonso, however, said on "Directo USA" that she firmly stands by her decision to support Donnelly for two reasons: Donnelly's proposed plan to create more jobs and his desire to raise the minimum wage to $20 an hour, something the candidate has said he would do by unleashing California's natural resources. "today supports the idea of helping immigrant children who came to the U.S. at the age of 3 or 5 with their college education." However, Donnelly said in the "Directo USA" interview that the Dream Act "is an open-ended entitlement that will invite and incentive more people to come here illegally. "If I am a racist, I'm not a very good one," Donnelly said Thursday on CNN en EspaÃ±ol's "Directo USA" show. "We ought to be fracking and drilling our way to prosperity rather than sitting on an ocean of oil and importing it from our enemies," Donnelly told "Directo USA" anchor Juan Carlos Lopez, noting what occurred in North Dakota.
