"We think (Titanfall) can very much be a game-defining moment for Xbox One as a platform because of how much it has lit up the imagination of gamers everywhere and how it takes advantage of the unique features of Xbox One," said Microsoft Xbox Chief Marketing and Strategy Officer Yusuf Mehdi. With Microsoft providing that to us, that's money and resources that we really didn't have." Microsoft's Mehdi said game developers were able to store a lot of the computing that "Titanfall" uses directly onto Microsoft servers. "Where we take advantage of it really is using Microsoft's back end to do things we couldn't normally do in multiplayer games like putting all that AI (artificial intelligence) and that extra flash in those cinematic moments," he said. 'Titanfall' is certainly going to be one of those for Xbox One, no question." Now, players are getting their first shot to play as the athletic pilots of monstrously large robotic titans, stomping across highly detailed terrain in a game even the makers of the Xbox say could be one for the ages.
