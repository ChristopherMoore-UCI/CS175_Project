Rice paddies account for 55% of Japan's farmland, and about 85% of the 2.3 million farms in Japan plant rice annually. -- The disclosure Saturday by Japanese authorities that milk and spinach have shown higher-than-normal levels of radiation contamination has raised concerns about food safety and supplies in one of Japan's most heavily populated regions. The health organization says packaged food is not susceptible to radiation contamination as long as the food is sealed. The organization warned that "food contaminated with radioactive material will not appear spoiled, but consuming such food will increase the amount of radioactivity a person is exposed to and could increase the health risks associated with exposure." As of right now, Japan appears to have adequate stockpiles of staples such as rice, but getting food to some of the hardest-hit regions is proving difficult.
