Pressurized reactors aren't necessarily safer than boiling water reactors, they just employ a different technique to harness the heat generated by nuclear fission to produce steam. To be prepared for a natural hazard -- or even the possibility of an attack -- Indian Point keeps a giant plug sitting on a massive forklift nearby that plant workers can shove into place within 15 minutes to protect the reactor. Both Indian Point plants are pressurized water reactors, as opposed to the crippled Fukushima Daiichi plant in Japan, which is a boiling water reactor. As the nuclear crisis unfolds in Japan, Indian Point officials say they're hoping for details that might help operations here. -- Stepping into the containment dome of Indian Point Nuclear Power Plant No. 3 is almost surreal.
