If the school is found to be at fault, it can appeal to the NCAA's Infractions Appeals Committee. In addition, the NCAA could insist that Penn State is voluntarily a member and has contractually consented to NCAA authority. Penn State supporters have reason to insist that the NCAA lacks the jurisdiction to punish its members for off-field, nonplayer related crimes. The NCAA also knows that if the Penn State scandal been unveiled years ago, not only would some boys have avoided the horror of Sandusky, the football team probably would have faced NCAA sanctions. To bolster that its decision-making process makes sense, the NCAA could maintain that Penn State President Rodney Erickson's decision to sign a consent agreement takes any potential challenge off the table.
