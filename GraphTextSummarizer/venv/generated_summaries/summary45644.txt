"In terms of girls and boys under 15 it says very clearly any violation of the body for sexual purposes is defined as sexual abuse in the new code. According to Turkish media reports, some of the 26 defendants were acquitted, while others received jail sentences of one to four years. " Meanwhile, in a written statement released on her ministry's web-site, Family and Social Policies Minister Fatma Sahin argued the ruling violated not only the current criminal code, but also the older version which had been in force in 2002 at the time when the 26 men were accused of having sex with the 13 year old. But that decision was challenged by the Union of Turkish Bar Associations on Friday, which called the ruling "legally inappropriate. Turkey's Supreme Court of Appeals has now found itself under fire from women's rights groups, lawyers' associations, and senior government officials.
