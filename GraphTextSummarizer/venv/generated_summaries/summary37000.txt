"His body was found Sunday by his band mate at his home in Richmond, Virginia," Gwar manager Jack Flanagan said in a statement on the group's website. His heavy metal band formed in 1984, billing itself as "Earth's only openly extra-terrestrial rock band." Gwar lead singer Dave Brockie died Sunday, his manager said Monday. Brockie performed as Gwar's frontman under the persona of "Oderus Urungus." " "My main focus right now is to look after my band mates and his family," Flanagan said.
