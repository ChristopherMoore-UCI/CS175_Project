Culture says that doing what's in our job description is "good enough for government work." Obama's plan to fix the intelligence system boils down to integrate the components, clarify roles and responsibilities, add additional steps to the screening process, invest in newer technology, deploy more air marshals and work cooperatively with other governments. No amount of Obama-style fixes will make a stupid culture any smarter, and remember, culture eats strategy -- and systems -- for breakfast. Culture says it's OK to not think creatively about how a lead might connect to other information. According to the Obama administration, the fact that Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab boarded a plane for the United States with potentially exploding underwear was caused by a systemic failure in intelligence. As a consultant who logs almost as many miles as the George Clooney character in "Up In The Air" and a scholar of organizational performance, I've hoped that the Obama Administration's reaction would focus on the heart of the problem, that the agencies and organizations that we rely on have stupid workplace cultures.
