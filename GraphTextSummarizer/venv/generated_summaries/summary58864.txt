Last week, at a pledging conference in Geneva, Switzerland, other countries could only muster a commitment to take in 38,000 more refugees from Syria in 2015, despite the fact that we are currently facing the largest refugee crisis since World War II. Refugees from wartime Europe were taken in by dozens of countries across the world in the 1940s and 1950s. More than 50 million people around the world are now refugees or displaced people, robbed of life's opportunities by war, persecution and natural disasters. Similarly, victims of conflict in Vietnam, Cambodia and East Africa in the 1970s, and those from the Balkans in the 1990s, found welcoming new homes in faraway countries. It is with this pressing need for action in mind that I have been a strong supporter of the U.N.'s immediate efforts to get winter supplies to refugee camps.
