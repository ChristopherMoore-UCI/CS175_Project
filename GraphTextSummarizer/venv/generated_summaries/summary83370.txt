Farzana Ahmed testified Monday that only one of their children, Mevish, was present when she saw her husband attacking Shafilea. "In order to rid yourselves of that problem, you killed Shafilea by suffocating her in the presence of your other four children." Melissa Powner, a friend of the slain girl, told reporters the conviction "brought our friend the justice she deserves." "Your problem was that, in what you referred to as your 'community,' Shafilea's conduct was bringing shame upon you and your concern about being shamed in your community was greater than your love of your child," Evans told the couple, according to a transcript provided by court officials. The death was the final act in a long-running effort by the couple to get their daughter to conform to their beliefs, Detective Superintendent Geraint Jones told reporters.
