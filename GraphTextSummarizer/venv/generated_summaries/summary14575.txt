Covering natural disasters and politics around the world, I have seen people change political opinions. Voters discovered there was more to a good presidency than an impressive display of post-earthquake leadership. And it has put an interesting twist on the idea of privatizing emergency disaster operations. A country's leader will receive the credit or the blame for what comes during and after the event, somehow blinding many voters to all they knew about him or her before. That's why in the United States, with just a week to go before the presidential election, both camps are handling the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy with excruciating political care.
