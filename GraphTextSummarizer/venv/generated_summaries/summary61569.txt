-- Gulf state health and fisheries officials and leaders from several federal agencies will collaborate to set safety levels for seafood coming out of the Gulf of Mexico, Vice President Joe Biden said Tuesday. Representatives from NOAA, the Food and Drug Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency met last week in New Orleans with state health officers and state fisheries directors from Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas to fine-tune the plan for sampling state and federal waters and deciding when to reopen them. My mother would say, 'God love you.'" Biden later flew to Naval Air Station Pensacola in the Florida Panhandle, where he sought to reassure Gulf Coast residents of the government's long-term commitment to recovery efforts in the area. "This is important not only for consumers who need to know their food is safe to eat, but also for fishermen who need to be able to sell their products with confidence." "No single agency could adequately ensure the safety of seafood coming from the Gulf following this tragedy, but in working together, we can be sure that tainted waters are closed as appropriate, contaminated seafood is not allowed to make it to market, and that closed waters can be reopened to fishing as soon as is safe," said Eric Schwaab, NOAA assistant administrator for fisheries, in the release. The release also quoted Michael Taylor, FDA deputy commissioner for foods, saying, "We understand the devastating effects this spill has had on the Gulf states and we look forward to continuing our collaboration with state and federal partners to ensure that these important protocols are implemented efficiently, effectively and in a way that makes sense for all involved, while maintaining the No. 1 priority we all share -- protecting the health of those in the Gulf Coast and across the country.
