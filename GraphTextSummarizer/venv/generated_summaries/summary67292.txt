A receptionist at the American Civic Association called 911 at 10:31 a.m. Friday while she hid under her desk, said Binghamton Police Chief Joseph Zikuski. Jiverly Wong, 41, has been identified by police as the gunman in the Binghamton, New York, rampage. Purchasing a gun in New York takes about two weeks, Zikuski said, and Wong would return to a store during that period, "cancel that order and purchase another one." Wong came to the United States in the late 1980s and lived in Binghamton before moving to California in the early 1990s, police said. Authorities defended the timeliness of police response to Friday's massacre at an upstate New York immigration services center as funerals were set to begin Sunday for two of the 13 slain.
