So, in future, without Microsoft and Apple (and Amazon, another innovative company that has never wasted its time in Las Vegas), it's hard to avoid concluding that CES will -- like Best Buy - gradually but inevitably go out of business. At Las Vegas' palatial McCarran airport, we were greeted with a gigantic electronic billboard for Best Buy, a generous CES sponsor and the dominant consumer electronics retailer in America. Even Microsoft, a company that has historically invested millions of dollars at CES as a sponsor and participant, made news this year by announcing that this year's event would be the last that its CEO would keynote. Like Best Buy, I suspect, CES has stood still over the last 10 years while the world has radically changed. And Las Vegas is always at its most unintentionally ironic during Consumer Electronics Show (CES) week, the January extravaganza that annually draws over 150,000 techno-tourists like myself to the seductively coercive city in the Nevada desert to pay homage to the hottest new electronic products on the planet.
