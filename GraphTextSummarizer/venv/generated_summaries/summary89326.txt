An expected Republican presidential contender, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, on Wednesday demonstrated the art of present and future political messaging in his statement explaining why he voted against a resolution authorizing limited military strikes in response to what he agreed was Syria's use of banned chemical weapons. "Should Syria turn into a car wreck that lasts for years and further destabilizes what Obama's weakness has wrought in the Middle East, the president would prefer to be one of 536 decision-makers," he added, imploring House Republicans to block any vote on authorization. Another leading conservative voice, former U.S. Sen. Rick Santorum, adopted a similar stance to Rubio on Thursday, even though he had called for possible air strikes on Syria in March 2012 when he was seeking the Republican presidential nomination. " A supporter of a military response in Syria who won re-election last year, Feinstein I like to believe now after 20 years I have some skill in separating the wheat from the chaff in this thing." While the 2014 contests faced by every House member and a third of the Senate are more proximate, the machinations at work in debating and acting on the Syria issue also are heavily focused on the balloting three years from now to choose Obama's successor.
