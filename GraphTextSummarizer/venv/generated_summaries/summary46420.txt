In southern Iraq, one Iraqi was killed and five were wounded Thursday when British troops returned fire after an attack on their base in Basra, the British military said. The precise date of withdrawal and when  security would be handed over to local forces in Qadisiya, the southern Iraqi Shiite province where most Polish troops in Iraq are based, are still being determined, he said. October 31 will be the last day of the Polish presence in Iraq, Major Dariusz Kacperczyk said, speaking from Warsaw. Basra and other areas of southern Iraq have been rocked by fighting among rival Shiite militias. Troops in Mosul seized the alleged leader of an al Qaeda in Iraq suicide bombing network and two other people.
