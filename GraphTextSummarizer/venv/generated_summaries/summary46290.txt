NASA took advantage of the special filters on Hubble's camera to isolate the light of different elements, said Bob O'Connell, chair of the science oversight committee for Wide Field Camera 3. "This is a cloud of dense material which is being bombarded by intense radiation from surrounding stars," O'Connell said. The gold dots are stars like our sun, but the blue ones are extremely hot, while the red ones are cool, O'Connell said. "Let there be no doubt, this is truly Hubble's new beginning," said Ed Weiler, NASA's associate administrator, during a news conference Wednesday. "Just by looking at the color of the stars in the picture, you can sort them by temperature and evolutionary state because the temperature differences here are caused by differences in the internal structure of these stars and in the kinds of fuels they're burning deep inside of them," O'Connell said.
