Wednesday night's violence began shortly before 8 p.m. (3 p.m. ET) and lasted for about six hours, the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said. Assistant Chief Constable Duncan McCausland said Wednesday's violence involved a smaller group of people than on previous nights and included a "hardcore group" of about 12 people. McCausland said community leaders helped with the situation Wednesday night, but he urged them to do even more. "A number" of police officers were hurt but their injuries were not believed to be serious, the PSNI said. Known as The Twelfth, the holiday has previously been marred by violence and has been a source of tension between Catholics and Protestants for years.
