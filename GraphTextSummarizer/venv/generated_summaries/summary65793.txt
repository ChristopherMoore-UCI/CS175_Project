A physician was to drop acid -- under legal supervision -- into the eyes of Majid Movahedi on Sunday, according to Fars News Agency, to punish him for throwing acid in Bahrami's face. An Iranian court convicted Movahedi in 2008 of pouring a bucket of acid on Bahrami, after she had rejected his unwanted advances for two years. Bahrami had demanded at the time that the court sentence the man to suffer the same fate he had inflicted upon her, and the court agreed, citing provisions in Islamic law. She has published a book in Germany, and said she is now trying to write a book in Persian about her ordeal and women in Iranian society. Bahrami stopped the punishment minutes before it was carried out, she said, adding that Movahedi already had been given anesthetic.
