Stanley Goosby, a chief scientist with the Pacific Disaster Center in Hawaii, said Indian Ocean countries have made significant progress in tsunami preparedness. The Indian Ocean region now has new deep-water buoys -- or tsunami sensors, sirens, tide gauges and a web of communications systems to help forewarn a future catastrophe. Sanny Jegillos, program coordinator for the UNDP's regional center in Bangkok, rates the Indian Ocean early tsunami warning systems as superior to those of the Pacific in terms of earthquake monitoring and detection. By next year, the country aims to take its warning system to the next level by calculating the height and the arrival of a tsunami, said the director of Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami center, Fauzi, who like many Indonesians uses only one name. Five years ago, Rinaldi had no shelter to run to as giant waves crashed onto Indonesia's west coast, but things have changed since the tsunami left some 245,000 dead or missing in 14 countries across the Indian Ocean region.
