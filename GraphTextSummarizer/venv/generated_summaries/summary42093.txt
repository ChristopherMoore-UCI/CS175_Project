Final Corvette raised from sinkhole GM designer says: Save their 'souls' Just be careful, advised Tom Peters, GM's director of exterior design for performance cars. Even for folks who don't care about cars, the Corvette matters. Worst damaged: - 2001 custom-made, one-of-a-kind Mallett Hammer Z06 racing car - GM-owned 1993 ZR-1 Spyder; fewer than 12 were ever built Significantly damaged: - 1984 PPG Pace Car; a one-of-a-kind car for Indy Car World Series - 1993 Ruby Red 40th Anniversary model; more than 6,000 were built - 1992 '1 millionth' Corvette to come off the assembly line - 2009 '1.5 millionth' Corvette to come off the assembly line Least damaged: - 2009 ZR1 Blue Devil, among GM's fastest production cars - 1962 tuxedo black Corvette, the oldest sinkhole car Related story: GM reveals most powerful drop-top Corvette Institutional memory The black '62 poses another big question: Does GM still have enough institutional memory to best restore a car that's more than a half-century old? Although GM announced back in February that it would "oversee" restoration of the Corvettes, more options are on the table now. we didn't expect them to come out looking quite that bad," said Dana Forrester, lead Corvette restoration member of the museum's board of directors.
