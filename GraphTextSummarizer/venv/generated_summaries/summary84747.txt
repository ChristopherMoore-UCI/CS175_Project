At least 40 fighters on both sides were killed as Syrian Kurdish fighters and ISIS militants clashed in the northern Syrian city of Kobani, a monitoring group said Saturday. Clashes also erupted west of Kobani, with ISIS using tanks to advance and firing at least 110 shells on various areas of the city,  the monitoring group said Saturday. ISIS, the Sunni Muslim extremist militant group, has been fighting to take Kobani for more than two months, hoping to add it to the territory it has already captured in parts of Syria and Iraq for what it calls its new independent Islamic nation. Kurdish fighters belonging to the People's Protection Units, known as YPG, have been locked in a death struggle with ISIS fighters for the border city, in the shadow of Turkey, with 100,000 desperate Syrian Kurds fleeing to Turkish territory. Five ISIS suicide bombers blew themselves up using cars and explosive belts near the besieged Kurdish city, according to the London-based opposition group, Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
