Spain's Miguel Angel Jimenez (66) shared eighth place with Keith Horne of South Africa (68) , with European Tour money-list leader Martin Kaymer -- the 2010 U.S. PGA champion -- down in 10th after closing with 69. "You just want your game to be in good shape when you get to Augusta [the Masters] or the U.S. Open, the British Open, PGA Championship," Scott told the tournament's website after following up his 2005 and 2006 successes. It was the seventh European Tour title of the 30-year-old's career, and he will now turn his attention to claiming a maiden major title in 2011. The Australian completed a final-round 68 after the tournament went into a fifth day following weather disruptions, finishing on 17-under-par 267 -- three shots clear of Denmark's second-placed Anders Hansen. The victory, his first at Sentosa since the Asian Tour event became co-sanctioned by the European Tour last year, launched him back into the top-20 of golf's world rankings.
