Deputies who examined a computer taken from Christopher Wood's home found information that showed "severe financial difficulties," including money owed on a home in Florida that the family had been unable to sell, Frederick County Sheriff Charles Jenkins said at a news conference. Authorities said Wood left individual suicide notes to his wife and each of the three children, expressing his sorrow and love. In his sixth note, Wood described his "day-to-day stresses," Bailey said. Jenkins said the medical examiner had determined that Christopher Wood, 34, shot himself with a shotgun Friday after shooting his wife, Francie Billotti-Wood, and their three young children -- Chandler, 5; Gavin, 4; and Fiona, 2 -- with a small-caliber pistol. Jenkins said the sheriff's office had no record of domestic violence or other family disputes at the Woods' home.
