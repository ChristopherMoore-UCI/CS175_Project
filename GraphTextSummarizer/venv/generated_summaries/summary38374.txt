By banning almost all compensation to living donors, the government has ensured that only the wealthiest and their friends can afford the costs of donating, while hundreds of thousands of other Americans suffer and die. Thirty years ago, the representatives who passed the Transplant Act were unquestionably right to forbid rich Americans from exploiting people from developing countries by trafficking in organs. The law bans almost any payment to living organ donors. Now, as then, living organ donors make heroic sacrifices to give life to others. These are all patients who can be helped by living donors, and together they constitute more than 90% of Americans waiting for transplants.
