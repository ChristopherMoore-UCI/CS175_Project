"It plants hope in the hearts of these children and families," D'Angelo explained. With her son and daughter working closely by her side, the former teacher's nonprofit works to connect youth in Los Angeles shelters, who are often exposed to drug use and violence, with resources that support the "whole family. After moving to Los Angeles in 1990, D'Angelo worked as a volunteer in a shelter and met an 8-year-old boy who couldn't read. D'Angelo went on to college and became a high school Spanish and Italian teacher. Under the nonprofit's Care Through College Program, it is D'Angelo's goal to make sure that each child is prepared for college.
