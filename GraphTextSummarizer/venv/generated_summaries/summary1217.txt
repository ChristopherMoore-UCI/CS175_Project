-- Syrian security forces have summarily executed at least 101 people, including civilians, since late 2011 in attacks on cities and towns, Human Rights Watch said in a report released Monday. "In a desperate attempt to crush the uprising, Syrian forces have executed people in cold blood, civilians and opposition fighters alike," said Ole Solvang, emergencies researcher at Human Rights Watch. The report "documents the involvement of Syrian forces and pro-government shabeeha militias in summary and extrajudicial executions of defecting soldiers, opposition fighters and opposition supporters, as well as civilians who appeared to have had no part in the confrontation with the authorities other than being residents of opposition strongholds," according to the human rights organization. Human Rights Watch said it had received reports of other incidents, but only included in its report incidents where eyewitnesses were interviewed. The report raises "concerns that the army had adopted a policy, official or unofficial, of executing opposition fighters," Human Rights Watch said.
