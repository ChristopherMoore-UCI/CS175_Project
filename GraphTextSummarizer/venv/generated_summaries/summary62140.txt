The fate of the Manas Transit Center was thrown into question Wednesday when Kyrgyz President Kurmanbek Bakiev was forced to flee the capital after angry mobs seized government headquarters. The protesters say they are in control of the government, but Bakiev sent word Thursday from southern Kyrgyzstan that he is not abandoning his duties. The CIA World Factbook says concerns about Bakiev's rule, "included privatization of state-owned enterprises, negative trends in democracy and political freedoms, endemic corruption, improving interethnic relations, electricity generation and combating terrorism. The United States likely will retain use of the Manas facility even if Bakiev's opponents secure control of the government, said Alexander Cooley, a central Asia expert at Barnard College. In addition, Cooley said, Bakiev's political opponents say the United States pays about $160 million a year to buy fuel for American aircraft using the base.
