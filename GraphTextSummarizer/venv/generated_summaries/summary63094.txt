Rahatul Ashikim Khan, 23, of Round Rock, was arrested in a separate case at his home and charged with "conspiring to provide material support to terrorists." A complaint said Khan "conspired with others to recruit persons to travel overseas to support terrorist activities including committing violent jihad" during a period from early 2011 to January 2012. He "planned to travel to the Middle East to provide his services to radical groups engaged in armed conflict in Syria," according to a complaint. Wolfe allegedly discussed the activities of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), the Sunni militant group fighting in Syria and staging an offensive against Iraq. Wolfe is charged "with attempting to provide material support to terrorists." On February 2, an undercover agent met with Wolfe and his wife and they watched a YouTube video about foreign fighters in Syria, officials say.
