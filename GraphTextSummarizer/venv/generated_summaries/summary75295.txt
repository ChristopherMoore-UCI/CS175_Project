(PEOPLE.com) -- Since she decided to come out about her sexuality to help kids who have been bullied, Kristy McNichol says the response has been tremendous. "Kristy feels strongly about fighting bullying and intolerance," says her publicist Jeff Ballard. And in her own way, she wants to help others by telling people who she is. "I'm overwhelmed with the love and support of my family, friends and fans," McNichol, 49, tells PEOPLE exclusively.
