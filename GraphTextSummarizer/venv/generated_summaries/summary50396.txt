-- An ash cloud from a Chilean volcano is disrupting air travel in Australia and New Zealand once again, airlines said Wednesday. " Qantas and Jetstar suspended Wednesday flights to and from Queenstown, Christchurch and Wellington. Chile is on the so-called "Ring of Fire," an arc of volcanoes and fault lines circling the Pacific Basic that is prone to frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. The ash cloud forced the shutdown of flights in and out of several Australian cities last week. Qantas flights between Sydney and Buenos Aires are delayed.
