When I asked Occupy Wall Street organizer Jesse Myerson about the possible endgame of the movement, he replied, "That's a dumb question. Based on my conversations with participants at Occupy Wall Street, my sense is that the ultimate demand could be a radical reform to get money out of politics. Creating huge public pressure to get corrupting money out of politics would be quite a happy ending for the protesters -- and our democracy. Director and actor Orson Welles once said, "If you want a happy ending, that depends, of course, on where you stop your story." Of course, the story of Occupy Wall Street and the movement it's sparking across the nation is just beginning to be written.
