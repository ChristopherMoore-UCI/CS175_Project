-- Egyptian journalists Tawfiq Okasha and Islam Afifi will be tried for defaming and insulting President Mohamed Morsy, a spokesman said Monday. Okasha, who owns the al-Faraeen TV channel and is also a show host, faces the charge of defamation and is accused of "inciting to kill" the president, according to Adel Saeed, spokesman for the general prosecutor's office. " "There is a difference between critique and defaming someone's reputation, like he did with the president and many groups," Sawfat Allam, a professor of political media at Cairo University and head of a committee monitoring media coverage of elections, said about Okasha. " News of the upcoming trial came one day after Morsy shook up the country's powerful military leadership, replacing top generals and reasserting power the military claimed for itself before he took office. Okasha is planning a demonstration on August 24 outside the presidential palace to demand that Morsy step down and that the rule of the Muslim Brotherhood be ended.
