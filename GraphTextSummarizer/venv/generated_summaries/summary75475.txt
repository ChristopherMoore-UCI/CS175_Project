Long before we heard what happened to American hostage James Foley back in August, months before we learned that ISIS had killed hundreds of men, women and children of Iraq's Yazidi minority, burying some of them alive, the people of the Middle East had become acquainted with the mass executions, the brutal persecution of minorities, the killing of Christians, of Shiites, and of Sunnis or anyone else who posed a challenge, hesitated to follow its religious dictates, or resisted the ISIS advance in Syria and then Iraq. It's no wonder ISIS has attracted large numbers of men eager to fight, including hundreds from Europe. That cruelty is turning much of the world, including Arabs and Muslims, against ISIS. Just when you think ISIS cannot horrify any more than it has, the group sends us to a new level of disbelief. It's tempting to think this is the work of a small number within ISIS, perhaps a core of psychopaths, given free rein by the so-called Islamic State's leaders.
