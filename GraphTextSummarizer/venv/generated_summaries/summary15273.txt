The hospital would like to discharge Boatwright, but they have no place to send him, said Richard Ramhoff, a spokesman for Desert Regional Medical Center. What the future holds Now that Boatwright's story has spread to the Swedish media, several Swedes have come forth to say they knew him in the 1980s.

Today, the 61-year-old man says he has come to terms with the name "Michael Boatwright," but only because doctors told him he should.
