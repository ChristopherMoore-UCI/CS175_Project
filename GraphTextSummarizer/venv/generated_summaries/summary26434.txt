Sixty infants with complete DiGeorge syndrome have received transplants and 43, or 72%, survived, according to Duke University Hospital. Seth Petreikis, after having open heart surgery when he was about 2 1/2 weeks old, was diagnosed with complete DiGeorge syndrome, a rare disease that left him with no immune system. Seth went to Duke University Hospital to receive a thymus transplant. But Seth's family hit a roadblock when coverage for the transplant was denied by MDwise, an Indiana Medicaid administrator that was their insurer, because the surgery was considered experimental. -- A 10-month-old Indiana boy born with a fatal genetic disorder died Sunday at a North Carolina hospital where he had gone in hope of receiving a potentially life-saving organ transplant, his parents said in a Facebook post.
