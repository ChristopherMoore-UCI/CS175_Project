President Obama greets Henrietta Hughes during a town hall meeting in Fort Myers, Florida, on February 10. " "Her concern is that she doesn't want to be a freeloader," Thompson said, but Hughes and her son have helped deter vandals who have targeted vacant homes in the area. The home she lives in was donated by the wife of a Florida lawmaker, Chene Thompson, who has been trying to sell the vacant home in the Fort Myers suburb of Lavelle since 2006. Her plea to Obama came as he promoted his economic stimulus plan at a town hall meeting in southwest Florida. Obama gave Hughes a kiss on the cheek and a promise: "We're going to do everything we can to help you, but there are a lot of people like you."
