On Wednesday, Williams reported on "NBC Nightly News" that his daughter, actress Allison Williams, had been cast in the lead role of NBC's planned live telecast of "Peter Pan Live." For "Peter Pan," she joins actor Christopher Walken, who has been cast as Captain Hook. "Family members confirm she's been rehearsing for this role since the age of 3, and they look forward to seeing her fly," he said as a picture of his daughter as a little girl, dressed in a Peter Pan costume, was shown on the screen. "Peter Pan Live!" is based on the 1954 Broadway musical. The elder Williams said his daughter had long wanted to play Peter Pan, though he was coy about his sourcing.
