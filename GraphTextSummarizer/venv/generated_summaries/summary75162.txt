1,000 years of Roma discrimination Police suspicions Police say they are suspicious of the records the couple provided for the child and for other children in their care. Maria's case plays into old prejudices about them stealing children for forced labor. Video provided by the Roma and shown to the media in the Roma settlement near Larissa does appear to show Maria dancing with a woman who is believed to be the same person now charged with abducting her. Authorities asked questions about Maria because she has fair skin and blonde hair while her parents have darker complexions typical of Roma, also known as gypsies, a race descended from Indian nomads who face widespread discrimination in Europe. The Roma offered the video to demonstrate that Maria was happy and in good care.
