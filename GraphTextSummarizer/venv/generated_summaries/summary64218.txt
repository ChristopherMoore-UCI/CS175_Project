"I will not have peace until this this person is found," Elizabeth Lopez, 18, said about the killer of her younger sister Norma, who vanished last Thursday as she walked home from summer classes at Valley View High School in Moreno Valley, about 70 miles east of Los Angeles. Joe Barja of the Riverside Valley Sheriff's Department declined to reveal the cause of death or reveal any injuries Lopez may have sustained but said the department is treating the death as a homicide. The victim's father, Martin Lopez, 44, told CNN in a telephone interview that the neighborhood was generally a safe one and that Norma usually took precautions to stay safe. Police are looking for a green "SUV-type vehicle" that was seen driving from the area at the time of Lopez's disappearance. "That's what's keeping us motivated -- to get that person in custody so no other family could actually go through what we are going through," Elizabeth Lopez told HLN's "Prime."
