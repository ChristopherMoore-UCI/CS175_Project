-- Railroad ties, cement pilings and other debris reportedly mark the entrance to Marcus and Partricia Faella's rural Florida compound, situated on the edge of a wildlife management area marketed by tourism officials as a good spot for hikers, campers and bird watchers. More immediately, according to police, Faella was planning to stage provocative disruptions at the Orlando City Hall and at a Melbourne, Florida, anarchist gathering that included members of anti-racist skinhead groups. According to police, Faella's group watched videos training them in fighting and the use of AK-47s and other weapons at the compound, which the affidavit said is ringed with barbed wire and protected by pit bulls and firing positions facing the driveway. Look closer and, according to police documents, you'd see shooting slits cut into the side of the couple's trailer, maybe even some military-grade ordinance scattered around the property. On at least one occasion, a group member who also belonged to the National Guard provided training to American Front members that he had learned in the military, according to the affidavit.
