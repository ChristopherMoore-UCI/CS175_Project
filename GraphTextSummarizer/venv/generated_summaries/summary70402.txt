-- Former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay will serve three years in prison on his November conviction on money laundering and conspiracy charges, a Texas judge ruled Monday. Earlier, prosecutor Steve Brandt urged the judge to send DeLay to prison, saying the once-powerful Republican showed too much disregard for the law to warrant community service and probation. " DeLay was found guilty in November of illegally funneling corporate money to help elect Republican candidates to the Texas legislature. " DeLay was found guilty of money laundering and conspiracy to commit money laundering, after being accused of funneling $190,000 to help elect Republicans to the state House and Senate in 2002. Despite his legal troubles, DeLay found time last year to appear as a short-lived contestant on the television show "Dancing with the Stars."
