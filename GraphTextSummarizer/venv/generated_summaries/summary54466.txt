Nursing board director Debra Scott said that Rice, a nurse for four years, and Ochoa-Reyes, a nurse for 19 years, worked at Las Vegas' Sunrise Hospital, where hospital officials and police had been investigating several incidents in which catheters had been "disrupted." The incidents involved peripherally inserted central catheters, or PICC lines, Sunrise Hospital said in a statement last week. The board found that it "would be a danger to the public health, safety or welfare" for the nurses to have unrestricted licenses and that suspension of the licenses required emergency action. According to the legal summary suspension of license documents, police found that the Sunrise incidents involved "intentional patient harm." The hospital launched an internal review in February, concentrating on "product performance and staff education," the statement said, and no disruptions were reported for several weeks.
