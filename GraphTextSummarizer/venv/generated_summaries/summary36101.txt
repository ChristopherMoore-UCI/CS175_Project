Pillay called on Pakistan's government to work harder to stop such killings and protect women from violence. According to a report published in April by the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, 869 women in the country were the victims of honor killings last year. "I do not even wish to use the phrase 'honour killing': there is not the faintest vestige of honour in killing a woman in this way," U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said in a statement condemning the killing.
