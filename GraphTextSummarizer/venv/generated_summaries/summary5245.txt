At seven in the morning I was on the sidewalk outside my apartment, tweeting pictures of the marchers and police. The people's library, free clothes and gourmet soup kitchen were gone now, or reduced to shadows of their former selves. Occupy Wall Street taught many middle-class white people what poor people and people of color had already known. Many people arrested came out to a lost job, or they have to deal with nerve-damaged hands from being in cuffs for too long, or they face a society that believes they asked for it. Pointless, tedious waiting in a crowded cage with dead roaches and no running water, where officers processing you through the system laugh at your discomfort and fear.
