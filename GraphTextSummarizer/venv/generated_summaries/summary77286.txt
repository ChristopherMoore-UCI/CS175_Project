" In addition to climate change, reindeer herders also have to face a loss of pastures because of infrastructure development, such as roads, hydroelectric power dams and cabin resorts. -- Arctic reindeer herders in northern Scandinavia are getting a view from space to help them look after their herds as the region copes with climate change. " Oskal is working with SÃ¡mi reindeer herders in Finnmark, Norway, to help them maintain and develop sustainable reindeer husbandry.
