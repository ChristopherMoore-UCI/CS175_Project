Phase 6, Chan said, is meant as a signal to countries to recalibrate their strategies to minimize the harm from swine flu. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Homeland Security said those agencies have been acting for weeks as if Phase 6 were already in effect and no additional measures would be put into effect. In Chile and Australia, two countries with many flu cases, she said H1N1 appears to be the dominant strain, "crowding out" the seasonal influenza virus. Chan indicated that a major factor in the decision was surveillance from countries in the Southern Hemisphere, where flu season is under way. Health officials use the virus' clinical name -- H1N1 -- to reflect that it's actually a combination of several different types of flu and to reduce confusion about whether eating pork can spread the virus.
