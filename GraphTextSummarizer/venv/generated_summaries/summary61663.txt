The work of multimedia artist Dor Guez -- whose identity as a Palestinian Christian living in Israel makes him "a minority within a minority" -- aims to rectify this. "It's about having this voice heard among other voices." Guez, whose first solo show in the U.K., "40 Days," opens in London's Mosaic Rooms gallery on April 12, focuses on depicting the experiences of the Middle East's Palestinian Christian minorities, including his own family. Today, the majority of Palestinian Christians live outside Israel and the Palestinian territories. According to Israel's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, there are about 120,000 Christian Arabs in Israel. "I think that in the case of the Christian Palestinians, we really got stuck in between sometimes." Guez says the community had to negotiate their identity against two majority groups -- Israeli Jews and Muslim Arabs -- displaying a dual attitude towards both groups to protect their identity.
