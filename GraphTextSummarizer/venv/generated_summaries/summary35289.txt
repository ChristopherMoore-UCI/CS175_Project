Patients are often forced to sleep in plastic chairs or on floors covered in urine, feces and blood while waiting for beds, the groups allege, and often go without basic hygiene such as showers, clean linens and clean clothes. In addition, the organization said, hospital staff falsified Green's records to cover up the time she had lain there without assistance. Green, 49, is shown rolling off a waiting room chair at Kings County Hospital in Brooklyn, New York, on June 19. Surveillance video captures her lying on the floor for more than an hour as several hospital workers see her and appear to ignore her. To people around the world who have seen the video, Esmin Green is a symbol of a health-care system that seems to have failed horribly.
