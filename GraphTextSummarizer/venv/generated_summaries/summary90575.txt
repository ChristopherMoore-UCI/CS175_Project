The June 23 Movement, or M23, is named after the date of protests last summer that forced Wade to withdraw a constitutional amendment that would almost guarantee his victory in the February 26 election. Wade plans to run for re-election this year despite a constitutional mandate that limits presidents to two terms. -- Senegal remained tense Wednesday following days of violent protests over a court decision that allows the incumbent president to run for a third term. A court ruled in his favor last week after the incumbent argued he is exempt because he took office before the term limit was put into place. The court rejected their candidacies last week in the same ruling that granted Wade and 13 others spots on the February ballot.
