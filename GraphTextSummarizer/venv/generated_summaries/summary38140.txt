-- Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh, who is being treated in Saudi Arabia after an attack on his compound, will return to Yemen on Friday, senior adviser Ahmed Al-Soufi told CNN. Khaled Al-Anesi, prominent Yemeni rights activist and a leading figure in the youth revolutionary movement, said the "youth are now coordinating with the political powers here in Yemen in preparation for the post-Saleh era" and noted that it is "impossible for Saleh to come back. "Saleh's arrival back to Yemen is not a surprise; we said all along that he is traveling for medical treatment and, like any other president in the world, is expected to be back to his country and continue with the role of leadership," said Yasser Al-Yamani, a senior Saleh aide. In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said at the briefing Tuesday that she was not aware of reports that Saleh planned to return to Yemen Friday. It has a strong presence in southern Yemen.
