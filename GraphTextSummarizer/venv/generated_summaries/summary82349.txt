But all along I have also been aware of the closed nature of Apple technologies, as well as the leap of faith that has been required to accept Jobs' promise that doing things in some new way will be "fantastic." Still others will see Jobs guiding Apple technologies from production to consumption in order to stave off the content glut and create a market for professionals. Meanwhile, those who lose internal Apple battles will spin off their own companies, convinced they are the true lineage of Jobs. Without Jobs telling us to cross the chasm, will we continue to embrace each of Apple's future revolutions in hardware, software or both? Back when Jobs returned to Apple and came out with the iMac, many users were aghast at being asked to purchase a computer with no floppy drive!
