It rises out of a six-story Depression-era, Art Deco facade with landmark status. -- Two workers were rescued more than 550 feet above the streets of midtown Manhattan on Wednesday afternoon after their scaffolding buckled near the top of the Hearst Tower, the New York Fire Department said. The firefighter who helped guide them into the building, Tom Gayron, told reporters it wasn't especially windy, despite the height. The workers were doing building maintenance, another fire official said. William Seelig said firefighters cut through a double-paned window on the 45th floor and brought the workers in through the newly created hole.
