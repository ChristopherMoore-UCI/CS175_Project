Some of the features of the app, according to the church, are: Connection to Twitter and Facebook; Social networking at the service of vocations; Contact details and statistics on the 26 dioceses of Ireland; Frequently asked questions to assist a person to discern his vocation; News feed running from the national vocations website; Novel and cursory 'tests' to enable the user to reflect on vocation potential. Daly told CNN he was worried about the decreasing number of priests and the number of older priests. A statement on the website stressed more priests are needed: "The number of priests per Catholic has declined over the past 40 years. -- The Catholic Church in Ireland is going high-tech in a bid to reverse a dramatic decline in the number of priests. "The app is an original approach to assist current and future generations seeking to investigate and find information on vocations to the diocesan priesthood in Ireland," a statement issued ahead of the launch said.
