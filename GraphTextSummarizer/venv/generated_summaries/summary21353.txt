"It needs to make sure its territory is not used as a launching pad for terrorist attacks anywhere, including inside of Pakistan." Earlier, Clinton had said the United States believed several significant al Qaeda leaders, including Ayman al-Zawahiri, were on the run and living inside Pakistan. -- U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton urged Pakistan to do more in the fight against global terrorism Tuesday, saying that the latest plot in Yemen shows that extremists continue to devise more "perverse and terrible ways to kill innocent people." Clinton's remarks on Pakistan came after a meeting with Indian External Affairs Minister S.M. Krishna, who equally pressured Pakistan to act against perpetrators of terrorism in India, especially the 2008 assault on Mumbai that killed 166 people, including six Americans. Clinton said the Rewards for Justice program, aimed at obtaining information that could help convict suspected terrorists, demonstrated Washington's seriousness in going after such people. "We are intent upon going after those who are trying to keep al Qaeda operational and inspirational," Clinton said in an interview with India's NDTV.
