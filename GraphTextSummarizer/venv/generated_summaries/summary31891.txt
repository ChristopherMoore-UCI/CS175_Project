Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had called for the dissolution as he sacked two senior members of his coalition Cabinet for criticizing government policy. The call for new elections means Israel is effectively in a state of political paralysis until March. Monday's vote makes the 19th Knesset one of the shortest serving parliaments in Israel's 66-year history, according to Natan Sachs, a foreign policy fellow at the Brookings Institution's Center for Middle East Policy in Washington. He ordered letters of dismissal for Finance Minister Yair Lapid and Justice Minister Tzipi Livni, two members of his Cabinet from rival parties. Netanyahu told reporters last week that a divided government was one of Israel's problems, saying there was a lot of debate, contradictions and ultimatums.
