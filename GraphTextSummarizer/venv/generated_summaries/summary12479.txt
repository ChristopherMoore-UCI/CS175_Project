The drill being used in Plan A -- a type usually used in mining operations -- reached a depth of 171 meters (187 yards) The Plan B drill, usually used to drill water bore holes, hit a snag at 268 meters (293 yards), Sougarret said, when it struck a reinforcement beam used in the mine's operations. Sougarret said that once it begins drilling again, it could reach its target -- a workshop used by the miners -- within several days. "We do this all the over the world," Robstad said, but always for oil, never before for trapped humans. The oil platform will be part of Plan C, the third operation to drill to reach the miners.
