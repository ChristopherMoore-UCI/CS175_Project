Valuev had a massive advantage in height and weight, towering over former cruiserweight champion Haye, but the challenger fought a clever tactical fight to win the verdict of the three judges. From the first bell, Haye, who is now 23-1, looked the sharper, unsettling Valuev with smart hooks, the Russian shaking his head to say he had not been hurt. -- David overcame Goliath as Britain's David Haye claimed the WBA world heavyweight title with a majority 12-round points victory over giant Russian Nikolai Valuev in Nuremberg on Saturday night. "Ever since I was little, I said that one day I would be heavyweight champion of the world," he told ringside reporters. The flamboyant Briton reserved his best until the final round, catching the eye of the judges with a series of combinations which came close to flooring a well-beaten Valuev, who had lost just one of his previous 52 fights.
