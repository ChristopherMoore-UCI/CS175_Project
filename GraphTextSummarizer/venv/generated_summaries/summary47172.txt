According to the survey 45% of respondents say they watch Hollywood movies, but 34% say American films have content that is "harmful to morality." "These apparently contradictory findings really are not, but reflect how the Arab world is coping with globalization and still grappling to preserve local culture," Everette E. Dennis, dean and CEO of Northwestern University in Qatar, says in a statement. Only 15% say U.S.-made films are good for morality -- as opposed to 71% who feel the same about Arab movies. Yet, the Northwestern University-Doha Film Institute survey shows that 72% of Qatari residents and 68% of Emirati residents generally support banning offensive content. Hollywood films are not the only ones that ran aground in the Middle East and North Africa.
