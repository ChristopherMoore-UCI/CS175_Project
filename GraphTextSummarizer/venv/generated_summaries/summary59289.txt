St. Pauli again hit the woodwork in the second half when Tim Wiese tipped Marius Ebbers' shot onto the bar, but Almeida sealed victory in the 64th minute with his ninth league goal this season after a fine pass by Said Hsejinovic. -- Hugo Almeida scored a hat-trick and was then sent off as he helped Werder Bremen to end a miserable run of results on Sunday with a 3-0 victory at home to St. Pauli, who also ended the game with 10 men. Slovenia striker Milivoje Novakovic put Cologne ahead six minutes after halftime, scoring from close range when keeper Diego Benaglio could not hold a free-kick by Portuguese midfielder Petit. However, he was sent off with 10 minutes to go after lashing out at St. Pauli defender Carlos Zambrano, whose teammate Markus Thorandt saw red in the final minute for a foul on Torsten Frings. Mainz make ground on German leaders Relegation-threatened Cologne moved up to 16th and out of the bottom two despite conceding a late equalizer in the 1-1 draw at home to Wolfsburg.
