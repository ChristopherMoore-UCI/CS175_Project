A Colombian has officially been declared the world's shortest man by Guinness World Records officials -- but his reign looks set to be short-lived. Although Hernandez is formally recognized in the 2011 Guinness World Records book published this month, he is not expected to hold the title for long. But Hernandez is actually several centimeters shorter than Pingping, according to Craig Glenday, Editor-in-Chief of the Guinness World Records Book. Edward Nino Hernandez, who stands just 70.21 centimeters (2 ft 3.46 in) tall, inherits a title previously held by Chinese man He Pingping who died earlier this year. He likes dancing to reggaeton and salsa music, according to the Guinness World Records website.
