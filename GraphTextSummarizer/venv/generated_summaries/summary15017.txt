While beginners and more expert circuit benders tinkered in workshops, small bands of musicians were huddled in the corners, preparing their homemade instruments for an all-out exposition of exploded instruments. Last year, Motherboard went to Bent Festival , the world's premier meeting of circuit benders, music hackers, and broken Speak n' Spells. Bent Festival 2011 starts June 23rd and runs until June 25th. Their only assistance came from men in worn T-shirts and beards whose advice consisted mainly of how to solder circuits together and the best way to break open plastic cases. At night, a healthy roster of chiptune musicians and others made music with their homemade gear.
