Earlier this year a number of players -- including Brazilian star Marta, world player of the year Nadine Angerer and Team USA's all-time leading scorer Abby Wambach launched a court case against the Canadian Soccer Association (CSA) and FIFA with the Ontario Human Rights tribunal over the decision not to hold the tournament on grass pitches. Players are also concerned artificial turf leads to a higher risk of injury and greater wear and tear on their bodies. Harrison also argues trying to lay natural turf on top of artificial pitches could prove difficult -- and potentially dangerous for the players. " Mia Hamm, who scored 158 goals for Team USA and won the 1999 World Cup, told CNN that she believes the tournament should be played on grass. "The players and their representatives are prepared to discuss their proposal for funding and installing the highest quality temporary grass fields, much like the ones used in prior World Cups," said Dellinger in a letter sent to Valcke last week.
