-- Film director Feng Xiaogang may have made China's biggest box office hit, the disaster movie, "Aftershock", but he built his reputation in comedies, comparing himself to American director, Woody Allen. "We walk a very tight rope, we have to strike balance otherwise we're going to fall," he said about censors in China. But last year's "Aftershock" has elevated the 53-year-old to the position of the most bankable director in China. It took over $147 million at the box office in China making it the highest grossing film in the country's history. It will also be China's official entry into the Academy Awards this year.
