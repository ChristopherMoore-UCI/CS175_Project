Myers' widow was the first to be asked by the military, under a new policy by Defense Secretary Robert Gates, if she wished to have news media at Dover Air Force Base for her husband's final return home. Casualties: Afghanistan | Iraq The ban on media coverage of returning war dead was implemented by President George Bush in 1991 and the policy has been the subject of much debate since. The body of Phillip Myers, 30, arrived at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware on Sunday. The return of his body to the United States aboard a charter aircraft Sunday marked a solemn moment that has been repeated more than 5,000 times at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware since the start of the war in Afghanistan in late 2001. Family members would be asked if they wanted news media to cover the transfer of their loved one's body.
