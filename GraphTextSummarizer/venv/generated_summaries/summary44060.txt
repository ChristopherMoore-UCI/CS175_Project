"It's just as freakish of an accident as I have heard," said Jorge Pino of Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. The accident happened off the coast of Marathon Key, in the Florida Keys about an hour's drive south of Miami. The dead stingray lies on the deck of a boat in Florida. Pino said he had seen stingrays leap into the air, but added, "it's very rare for them to collide with objects. The species, also called a leopard ray or bonnet skate, can measure up to 8 feet in length, with an 8-foot tail, and weigh up to 500 pounds, according to the Florida Museum of Natural History's Web site.
