Chevron is dispensing 100 gift certificates for pizza and soft drinks to those in the area of Greene County where the February 11 explosion sparked a fire that burned for four days. A letter also accompanied the gift certificates, according to CNN affiliate KDKA, with the letter stating, "Chevron recognizes the effect this has had on the community. One resident who said he wished to remain anonymous because of Chevron's strong presence in the area told CNN that he received a certificate on Sunday while he and his family were out. In a statement to CNN, Chevron stated that the corporation "offered a token of appreciation" to neighbors who were affected by the events. In an update published Tuesday on its website, Chevron said the situation at the well "remains serious and teams are working around the clock to safely approach and shut the well."
