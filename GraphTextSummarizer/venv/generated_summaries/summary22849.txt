"Local council officials and security agents have been threatening people with war if Museveni does not win this election, and the purpose can only have been to intimidate and threaten the Ugandan people so that they were scared to express their desire for change," Besigye, who heads the Inter-Party Cooperation. Besigye -- who was a former doctor for Museveni -- lost presidential bids in 2001 and 2006. Parliament removed presidential term limits in Uganda five years ago, essentially allowing the incumbent to run for office indefinitely. Ugandans lined up early to cast their ballots amid heavy security in the capital and other areas. Museveni has already vowed to quash any Egypt-inspired uprisings aimed at toppling entrenched regimes.
