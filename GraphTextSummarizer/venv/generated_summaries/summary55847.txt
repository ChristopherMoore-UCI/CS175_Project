The announcement that the FDA plans to suspend U.S. sales of the drug came after an FDA study of 100 broiler chickens detected inorganic arsenic at higher levels in the livers of those treated with 3-Nitro than in those who did not get the drug. The FDA's study was carried out after other studies indicated that organic arsenic could transform into the more dangerous inorganic form, the FDA said. "The company stated that allowing sales for this period will provide time for animal producers to transition to other treatment strategies and will help ensure that animal health and welfare needs are met," the FDA said in a news release. That increase concerns "a very low but completely avoidable exposure to a carcinogen," said Michael R. Taylor, FDA deputy commissioner for foods. The drug is used primarily in broiler chickens to help control a parasitic disease called coccidiosis and "for weight gain, feed efficiency and improved pigmentation," the FDA said.
