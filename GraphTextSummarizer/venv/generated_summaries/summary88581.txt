-- Justice Sonia Sotomayor may be the most recognizable member of the current Supreme Court, the closest thing to a rock star in robes. And then just a few weeks later, we have [Republican Sen.] Lindsey Graham with a nod toward that sort of enthusiasm, saying, "Unless you have a complete meltdown, Judge Sotomayor, you're going to be confirmed." So she was always out there with this inspiring story that people were learning from the moment President Obama nominated her in May 2009. Just as Sotomayor sees herself as operating as one among nine, Justice Kagan operates trying to build coalition among those nine. And then she's on the scene in the early '90s when someone like Sen. [Daniel] Moynihan [Democrat from New York] is looking for more diverse candidates to recommend to President George H. W. Bush.
