"It's uncanny how he embodied the words 'pioneer' and 'trailblazer,'" Earl's grandson Richard Earl said on the phone last week from his home in West Palm Beach, Florida. " During his heyday spanning the 1930s to the late '50s, Earl created innovations that were decades ahead of their time: -Rear backup cameras connected to dashboard video -An automated driving system -Collision warning alarms -Cruise control -Keyless entry -Onboard computers -Rain-sensing technology Earl was the first, say experts, to meld car style with functionality â€” kind of like what Apple's Steve Jobs did with personal computers. As General Motors' top designer, Earl created iconic cars with unique, sweeping lines and features like tail fins and wraparound windshields. Harley Earl developed a reputation as an imposing workaholic who ruled his design studio "with an iron hand, demanding minute changes, ordering countless modifications," according to Gross. Standing at 6 feet, 4 inches tall, "Earl was very authoritative, he absolutely got his way," said award-winning automobile journalist Ken Gross.
