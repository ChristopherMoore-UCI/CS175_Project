Bernice King and her brothers Martin Luther King III and Dexter King will split money they have been fighting over. The settlement among Bernice King, Martin Luther King III and Dexter King was announced after 11:30 p.m. Monday, Fulton County Superior Court spokesman Don Plummer said. Bernice King and Martin Luther King III sued Dexter King in July 2008, one month after accusing him of converting "substantial funds from the estate's financial account at Bank of America" for his own use, according to the lawsuit. However, Superior Court Judge Ural D. Glanville determined that Dexter King was an authorized signatory on the checking account for his mother's estate, which is administered by Bernice King. Martin Luther King III and Bernice King hold 20 percent of its outstanding shares.
