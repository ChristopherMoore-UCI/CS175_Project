Ports of call While some are convinced that larger ships will have a huge impact on future port development, others aren't so sure. A pier 2.7 kilometers (1.68 miles) long with six separate deep-water berths ensures giant vessels like the CMA CGM Marco Polo and the recently launched Maersk Triple E class of ships -- which require deeper berths and giant high-speed cranes to reach across vast vessel decks -- will be able to dock there (although there are currently no arrangements for the Triple E to come to the UK). A knock-on effect of such policies, some industry experts claim, is that ports along the way will have to adapt their facilities (or start from scratch in the case of London Gateway) to cater for the increased importance of these giant ships. "This will be a world class port that the UK will be proud of, a national asset, " said London Gateway CEO, Simon Moore. According to London Gateway supply chain manager, Peter Ward, it is important the UK has these advanced facilities to ensure it isn't cut off or isolated from its trading partners.
