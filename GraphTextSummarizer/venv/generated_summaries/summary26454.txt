Nick and Joe released solo albums and pursued acting careers in recent years, while Kevin and his wife, Danielle, have starred in their own reality series, "Married to Jonas," which is in its second season on E!. The first of 19 shows had been scheduled for Upper Darby, Pennsylvania, on Friday, but the brothers pulled the plug, spokesman Jesse Derris said on Thursday. The trio came back together musically earlier this year, releasing singles "Pom Poms" and "First Time." "There is a deep rift within the band," Derris said. Fans who already bought tickets can get refunds from the vendor who sold them, Derris said.
