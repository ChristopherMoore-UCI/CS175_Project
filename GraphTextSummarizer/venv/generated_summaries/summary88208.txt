Hacking groups such as Anonymous and LulzSec have claimed a number of high-profile attacks in recent months, stealing information from the U.S. Senate and Arizona state police websites, as well as data from major corporations like Sony, Bank of America and Nintendo. "The arrests relate to our enquiries into a series of serious computer intrusions and online denial-of-service attacks recently suffered by a number of multinational companies, public institutions and government and law enforcement agencies in Great Britain and the United States," said Det. They've also successfully blocked access to the websites of Visa, MasterCard, the CIA and several News Corp. newspaper websites. Police in Britain, the United States and elsewhere have made a number of arrests of suspected "hacktivists" in recent months. The men, ages 24 and 20, were arrested in South Yorkshire and Wiltshire, police said.
