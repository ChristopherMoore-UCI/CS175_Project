"The rovers were designed to last in extreme conditions, and we've taken great care in how to operate them," said JPL roboticist Vandi Tompkins, one of Opportunity's former operators. 'Crazy' Mars landing coming NASA lost contact with Spirit in 2010 and wrote off the rover in May 2011, but Opportunity kept on going. The roughly 5-foot-long, 380-pound rovers were loaded with a variety of cameras and instruments used to analyze martian rocks and soil, and their findings have helped convince NASA that Mars once had water on its surface. In more than eight Earth years, NASA's unexpectedly tough Mars rover Opportunity has been stuck in a sand dune, nursed a bad shoulder and endured five brutal winters on Mars. Scientists at the space agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California planned for Opportunity to last for 90 days on Mars after its landing in 2004.
