Non-playing captain Jose Maria Olazabal, who formed an almost unbeatable partnership with Ballesteros in the Ryder Cup, is hoping his players will gain inspiration from memories of his great friend, who died of brain cancer last year. Tiger Woods was with Steve Stricker, a successful recent pairing in Ryder Cups and Presidents Cups for the Americans. Europe's players will pay tribute to Seve Ballesteros by having a special image of the golf legend emblazoned on their golf bags during this week's Ryder Cup matches against the United States in Chicago. "Davis and I, we have competed against each other quite a few times, not just in the Ryder Cup but in other events, and here we are sitting together and each one of us has a huge respect towards the other. Olazabal will be hoping to lead Europe to a fifth win in six stagings of the biennial team event, but U.S. captain Davis Love III has warned the visitors to expect an atmosphere "like nothing you've ever seen before" when the action gets underway in the three-day tournament.
