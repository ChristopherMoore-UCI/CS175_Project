That's the question being asked by U.S. intelligence officials as they analyze a recruitment video that features the jihadist, who speaks perfect English with a North American accent, orchestrating a mass execution. "Clearly ISIS had a calculated step to be able to put this guy on camera," said Frank Cilluffo, a security analyst at George Washington University. In the video titled "Flames of War," the jihadist first appears speaking Arabic in a classical dialect and with the ease of a native Arabic speaker, CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank said. If so, Cruickshank said, he would be the first North American jihadist to commit a war crime on camera. There are a number of men digging a ditch behind him.
