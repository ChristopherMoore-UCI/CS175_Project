Court papers: Grand jury in 1999 sought to indict JonBenet Ramsey's parents The district attorney decided that year, however, not to file charges against John and Patricia Ramsey, saying there was insufficient evidence. Read the documents Kolar wrote a book about JonBenet's killing and said he does not believe that there was an intruder at the Ramsey house that night, implying that the Ramsey family -- the late Patricia Ramsey, her husband John and their son Burke -- know more than they have told. Previously sealed court documents released Friday show that a Colorado grand jury voted in 1999 to indict the parents of the slain 6-year-old JonBenet on charges of child abuse resulting in death and being accessories to a crime. But attention does not necessarily translate into leads in the case, former lead investigator A. James Kolar told CNN. The former lead investigator in the JonBenet Ramsey case says that newly released documents may spark renewed interest, but they have little effect on the cold case investigation.
