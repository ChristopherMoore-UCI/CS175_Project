-- Children can't light up, but there are some who suffer the effects of nicotine exposure as they labor in U.S. tobacco fields. The chemicals would come over to us." Altria, one of the biggest cigarette makers, does not employ its own farmers but maintains strict standards on the contractors it buys tobacco from, company spokesman Jeff Caldwell said. One of the recommendations of the report is that no one under 18 be allowed to work in tobacco fields, due to the risks that such exposure can bring. Many of the children the group spoke with reported working long hours without overtime pay or enough breaks, HRW said. Altria requires that its growers follow certain guidelines that specifically include best practices for labor management when it comes to harvesting tobacco.
