Gino, as his students call him, has taught various ballet classes for the school but now focuses mostly on this one, Adaptive Dance. -- It's early on a Saturday morning, and Sarah Markowitz limbers up before her dance class begins. "Dance is something that has no limitations," Di Marco says. "They've had physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy," Cassella says of the kids in the Adaptive Dance class. "I like dance because I like Gino," Sarah says, referring to Gianni di Marco, the instructor for this class of more than a dozen very special dancers.
