As of now, cell phone dealers are supposed check this database before honoring requests to reactivate allegedly "locked-out" phones, in order to prevent people from using stolen phones. On Wednesday some U.S. wireless carriers implemented the first part of a national strategy to deter cell phone theft: a joint "blacklist" database of identifying information about cell phones reported lost or stolen. Chris Guttman-McCabe, vice president of regulatory affairs for CTIA (a global association of wireless carriers), explained: "The point of the blacklist database is to dry up the aftermarket for stolen phones. In the meantime, carriers are stepping up their efforts to get cell phone users to protect their devices. Carriers which have launched their blacklist databases are now working to educate phone dealers on how to access them.
