Then, around Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Missouri Rev. Starsky Wilson, co-chairman of the Ferguson Commission, spoke with Dartmouth faculty about "teaching Ferguson." The course came together quickly with support from college leaders and Dartmouth's African and African-American Studies Program, Neely and Bahng said. "Even though we might be sort of cloistered away in the ivory tower or something, we felt very much moved by, incited by, inspired by a lot of the activists' work following the failure to indict Darren Wilson after the events in Ferguson," said Aimee Bahng, an assistant professor of English at Dartmouth. This spring, Dartmouth College will offer a new class, "10 Weeks, 10 Professors: #BlackLivesMatter," which will examine race, violence and inequality through current events and throughout history. The 2014 deaths of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and Eric Garner in New York during confrontations with police sparked conversations on social media and protests around the world, including Dartmouth's Hanover, New Hampshire, campus.
