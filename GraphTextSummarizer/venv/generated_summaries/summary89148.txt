"This website published intimate photos of unsuspecting victims and turned their public humiliation and betrayal into a commodity with the potential to devastate lives," Attorney General Kamala D. Harris said. Kevin Bollaert, 27, of San Diego, was charged with 31 felony counts of conspiracy, identity theft and extortion, the state attorney general's office said in a written statement. Court documents allege that in December 2012 Bollaert created the website ugotposted.com, which allowed for the posting of sexually explicit photographs of people without their permission. The sexually explicit material, primarily of women, was routinely posted by angry former boyfriends and ex-husbands, authorities said. Bollaert was being held at the San Diego County jail in lieu of $50,000 bail.
