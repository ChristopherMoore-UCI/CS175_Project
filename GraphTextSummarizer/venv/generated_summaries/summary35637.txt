Up to 1 million revelers are expected to pack Times Square in New York City for this year's New Year's Eve celebration, but not without some added security to help ring in 2015. As is usual every year, thousands of police officers -- both in uniform and civilian clothing -- will be present in Times Square during the huge event, O'Neill said. Thousands of officers, including some additional personnel, will also be patrolling Times Square for the New Year's Eve ball drop, NYPD Chief of Department James O'Neill told reporters. In the following days, a law enforcement official told CNN the city would increase security around the New Year's Eve celebration due to increased threats against police officers. "New Year's Eve is a time of celebration for New Yorkers, and an increased security presence will help ensure that tonight remains a safe and festive time for all," Cuomo said.
