The Ellis Island hospital complex, used between 1902 and 1930, was where immigrants were checked before being allowed onshore. JR has taken original photographs of the patients and doctors that walked its corridors, enlarging them to life-size and pasting them on the crumbling walls, windows and doors. Janis Calella, president of the government-funded Save Ellis Island group, says the use of historic photographs and their placement through the hospital "evoke some sort of an emotion," making it easier to support the work. The first thing you notice about New York's Ellis Island hospital is its sheer scale. Ellis Island has been described as an island of hope, an island of tears -- and the two fit in the same breath.
