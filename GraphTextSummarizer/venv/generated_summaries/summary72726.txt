Some people remain convinced there will be a Casey Anthony movie, including The Hollywood Reporter's Matthew Belloni. The cable channel Lifetime would seem the logical home for an Anthony movie -- it aired the Knox, Holloway and Rockefeller films, and it's in production on a movie about murder suspect Drew Peterson (with Rob Lowe in the lead). "Anyone who pursued a movie based on these events, especially right now, will face some immediate backlash," said Matthew Belloni, news director for The Hollywood Reporter. -- Not so long ago, the idea of a Casey Anthony movie seemed like a certainty. Comedian and social commentator Alycia Cooper told CNN she could imagine a Casey Anthony movie under certain circumstances.
