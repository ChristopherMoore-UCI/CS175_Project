Peralta, a graphic artist from Cleveland, Ohio, is using his talent to complete the "Geek A Week" project: a compilation of 52 online trading cards featuring successful geeks and nerds. Thanks to his connections, Peralta has other big names in his Geek A Week stack, like Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak and filmmaker Kevin Smith, but he also includes plenty of geeks whom the general public might not know about. The fact that the trading cards are a 'collect them all' kind of deal and the number of trading cards add up to the number of cards in a deck, it's all neat as you please," he said. Actor Wil Wheaton wanted to experiment with duality on his Geek A Week card, so Peralta drew him as an evil twin, Peralta said. Beaulieu and Peralta were working together on another project, the recently published book "Silly Rhymes for Belligerent Children," when Peralta mentioned his idea for Geek A Week.
