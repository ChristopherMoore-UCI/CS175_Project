Though she put on a brave face, it seems like taking off her handcuff-inspired bracelet and watching the lights shift from naughty red to regular white might have been a relief for Couric — during a post-show Q&A, the TV vet admitted that she wouldn't let her 16 and 21-year-old daughters read James' bestsellers. " Before saying goodbye, Couric genially asked James if the interview had been painful — innuendo intended — and James joked that it hadn't been "painful in the right way." Given all this, audience members probably expected James to emerge wearing an "American Horror Story"-style rubber fetish suit — or at least to be as boisterous and open as Anastasia Steele's inner goddess. James was coy about this last query, saying only that she has three unnamed actors in mind for Christian and four in mind for Anastasia. But Katie's audience has a few casting ideas of its own: According to Facebook polls, they'd like to see Gilmore Girls alum Alexis Bledel as the naive college grad and Vampire Diaries hottie Ian Somerhalder as the handsome billionaire who sweeps her off her feet, then chains her to the wall.
