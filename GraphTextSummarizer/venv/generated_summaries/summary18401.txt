Last I checked, One Direction's fans aren't composed mainly of aging obesity victims — they're little girls who range in age from about 8-14. In that case, it seems terribly misguided (or at least ruthlessly conniving) to tap into that insecurity with "Little Things" and ask girls to find their validation in One Direction's blanket affection. -- One Direction dropped their new Ed Sheeran-penned single, "Little Things" — a followup to their hit "Live While We're Young" and the second track released from the upcoming Take Me Home — Monday, and as expected, there's nothing "little" about its online reaction. "Little Things" presupposes insecurity in order to be effective lyrically, but for all those happily naive fans that (thankfully!) aren't dealing with body image issues, One Direction literally provides insecurities for listeners to feel.
