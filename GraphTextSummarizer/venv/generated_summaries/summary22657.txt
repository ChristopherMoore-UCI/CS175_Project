Setting aside music (with its omnipresent ear buds), preferred media choices differ dramatically across generations: For children, it's television; for tweens, it's video games; for teens, it's texting and social networking; and for Net Geners and Gen Xers, it's being online. They live in their own bedroom "TechnoCocoons," where new technologies appear and penetrate society in months rather than years. Older teens and Net Geners spend more than 20 hours per day using media. From my research with 3,000 Americans, the final two generations are defined not by a letter or by their birth year but by their use of technology and media, their need and ability to multitask, their rapid acceptance of anything new and their view of the meaning of technology. By the third quarter, the number of texts had jumped to a whopping 3,146 messages per month, which equals more than 10 texts per every waking non-school hour.
