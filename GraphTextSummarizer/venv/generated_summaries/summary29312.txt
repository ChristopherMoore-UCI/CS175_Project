Among them are former South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford, who won a U.S. House seat in May four years after revealing an extramarital affair, and Weiner, who recently jumped into the race for New York mayor after resigning his House seat over sexual-tinged tweets. -- Seeking redemption after a prostitution scandal waylaid his political career, former New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer launched a petition campaign Monday in a bid to become the comptroller of New York City. If he succeeds in getting on the ballot for the September primary, Spitzer will join former U.S. Rep. Anthony Weiner -- who is seeking the city's Democratic mayoral nomination -- as disgraced New York politicians trying to revive their careers in the same election. It will be a far cry for the 54-year-old former New York attorney general whose reputation as a scourge of white-collar crime propelled him to the governor's office in 2006. In May, Weiner announced he'd be running for mayor of New York.
