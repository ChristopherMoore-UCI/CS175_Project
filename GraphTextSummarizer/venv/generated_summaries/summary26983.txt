" Johnson, who uses a wheelchair and must wear a helmet because of persistent seizures, is among 3 million Americans who live with some form of epilepsy, a brain disorder that causes recurring seizures, violent muscle spasms or, sometimes, a loss of consciousness. Arnold estimated the total value at $20,000 per dog. In the past few years, Arnold also helped train 100 seizure dogs to assist people with epilepsy. By spending time with epilepsy patients, Arnold's dogs are taught what a seizure looks like and not to be frightened. There are no estimates of how many patients are paired up with assistance dogs, and the benefits of having such an animal have not been studied to any great extent.
