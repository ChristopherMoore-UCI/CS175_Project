While three-quarters of Americans favor airstrikes against ISIS, 61% of Americans oppose putting U.S. forces in combat situations in Iraq and Syria, according to a September 8 CNN/ORC poll. Dempsey's more open position comes after President Obama has faced criticism from Republicans and military strategists for completely shutting the door on ever sending American combat troops to Iraq. the President does not believe that it would be in the best interest of our national security to deploy American ground troops in a combat role in Iraq and Syria. Dempsey also made it clear that  U.S. military advisers on the ground are currently in a "combat advisory role" and "not participating in direct combat -- and there is "no intention for them to do so." And the line separating combat troops from military advisers could become more blurred with time, said Julian Zelizer, a history and public affairs professor at Princeton University.
