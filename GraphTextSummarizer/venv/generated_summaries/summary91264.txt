"As Senator Warren has said many times, she is not running for president," Lacey J. Rose, Warren's press secretary, said on Tuesday. "This is a huge opportunity for MoveOn members, if they choose, to inspire Senator Warren as she has inspired so many of us," said Anna Galland, executive director of MoveOn.org Civic Action. In the same poll, only 13% of liberal backed Warren. The campaign includes MoveOn.org opening offices and hiring staff in Iowa and New Hampshire, two states that are critically important in the presidential nomination process, and "the assembly of a national volunteer army ready to go to work if Sen. Warren enters the race." If passed, MoveOn will also begin producing "ads and media products that call attention to how Sen. Warren has stood up and fought for the middle class and her powerful vision for our country's future.
