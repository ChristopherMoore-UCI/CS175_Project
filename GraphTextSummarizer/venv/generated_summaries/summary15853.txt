Padilha, who co-wrote "Elite Squad" with "City of God" screenwriter Braulio Mantovani and Rodrigo Pimentel, a former BOPE captain, says he wanted the film to explore the roots of police violence and corruption in Brazil. The movie, which casts light on the vicious cycle of violence in Brazil, "is basically about how the police institution turns individuals into corrupted cops or violent cops," Padilha told CNN. Jose Padilha's movie "Elite Squad" examines police violence and corruption in Brazil. " "Elite Squad" became the focus of heated debate when it was released in Brazil last October, prompting discussions about acceptable thresholds of police violence. The violent tone of Padilha's film contrasts sharply with other recent movies chronicling favela life.
