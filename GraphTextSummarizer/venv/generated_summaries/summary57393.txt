As of now, Brown faces state murder charges which carry a life sentence, but authorities could bring more charges. Between April and June, police say, Brown killed three people in Washington state, allegedly shooting them at close range late at night in quiet locations. Also in June, 19-year-old college student Brendan Tevlin was found inside an SUV in West Orange, New Jersey, dead of multiple gunshot wounds, authorities said. That is what law enforcement say Brown told a police investigator in New Jersey when he was interviewed in July. Sources tell CNN that Brown was born in the United States and has family in New Jersey.
