Dozens of camps were flooded, hundreds of families were affected and at least six people were reported missing after the rains, which began Monday evening and stretched into Tuesday morning, the report said. "The situation continues to deteriorate," Beat Rohr, director of CARE in Haiti, said Tuesday. Floodwaters from the rains swept through homes, tent cities and medical facilities, a report from the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said. The Pan American Health Organization warned the situation in Port-au-Prince continues to deteriorate and most cholera treatment centers are working at "full throttle. The death toll from flooding and landslides after torrential rains hit Haiti earlier this week climbed to 23 Wednesday, the country's civil protection department said.
