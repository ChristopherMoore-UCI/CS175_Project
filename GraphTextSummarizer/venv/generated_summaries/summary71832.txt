While the overall bloodshed has drawn rebukes and spurred some support for the opposition, it's chemical weapons allegations -- involving sarin gas, an extremely volatile and potentially lethal nerve agent -- that provoked the threat of direct international military action. Yet Syria has been equally adamant it has done no such thing, instead accusing "terrorists" -- its blanket term for opposition fighters -- of deploying chemical weapons. That won't come until after Congress weighs in, likely next week, on a measure authorizing strikes focused on degrading Syria's ability to use chemical weapons. Still, U.S. and other leaders continue to press for military action against Syria's government -- taking their arguments, through Friday, to the G20 summit in St. Petersburg, Russia. They accused Washington and others of being overzealous and bull-headed by ordering strikes without irrefutable proof Syrian leaders are responsible for using chemical weapons, something they don't publicly believe.
