Acting VA Secretary Sloan Gibson said he is frustrated and expects to have a plan in place to take "personnel actions" against employees responsible for manipulating patient wait lists at one VA medical center by the end of this week. The Veterans Health Administration has reached out to more than 160,000 veterans to get them off wait lists and into medical centers, Gibson said, but he added that the VA needs to take drastic steps to restore trust with veterans and the American public at large. About $10 billion of the requested funds would cover the costs of additional VA staff and private care for veterans while about $6 billion would pay for new clinics and medical space, Gibson said. The investigations came after months of CNN reports on deadly delays for veterans waiting for care at VA hospitals. Gibson said he believes the behavior of VA employees has begun to change across the nation, but he wants to hold accountable the individuals responsible for fraudulent practices as soon as possible.
