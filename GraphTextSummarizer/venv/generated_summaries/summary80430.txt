-- A series of explosions rocked central Kabul early Monday, the day after Afghan security forces said they repulsed a wave of insurgent attacks in the capital and three other provinces. A western official in Kabul later said the hotel had been taken over by insurgents, but was then taken back by Afghan national security forces. Meanwhile, an airbase used by U.S. troops in the eastern city of Jalalabad, in Naranghar province, also came under attack, the NATO command in Kabul reported. There was no immediate explanation, but Afghan authorities had said late Sunday that they were trying to dislodge insurgents holed up in an empty building near the headquarters of NATO's International Security Assistance Force. Kabul police said they found and detonated a van full of explosives.
