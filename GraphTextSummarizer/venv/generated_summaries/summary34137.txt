"The voices of all who are protesting peacefully must be heard -- including those who welcomed the events of earlier this week and those who supported President Morsy," spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki said. The move comes as anger grows among supporters of deposed President Mohamed Morsy -- including the Muslim Brotherhood -- who have decried the military's move to push him from power, and raised fears of widening violence. " How Morsy's supporters, who supported the deposed Islamist president's rule, react to the new government will be key for post-coup Egypt, where the military suspended the country's constitution and dissolved parliament. And on Saturday, each side was trying to present a unified front, as violence between Morsy's supporters and his opponents and the military swept across the country, leaving at least 30 dead and more than 1,400 wounded, according to state-run media. Crowds of Morsy supporters converged for a second consecutive day Saturday outside the Republican Guard complex, where Morsy was reportedly being held, according to a tweet from the party.
