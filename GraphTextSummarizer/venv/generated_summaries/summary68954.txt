The research organization emphasized on its website that an increasing number of shark attacks doesn't mean the rate of attacks is increasing. There are plenty of great white sharks in the Southern California surf, but they pose no danger to beachgoers, according to Randy Hamilton, a shark expert with California's Monterey Bay Aquarium. Shark attacks are still pretty rare, but they have increased at a steady rate since 1900, "with each decade having more attacks then the previous," according to statistics from the International Shark Attack File based in Gainesville, Florida. -- Nightmares and a panic attack haunted Steven Robles after a great white shark attacked him at a Southern California beach Saturday, but he was out of the hospital Sunday. A fisherman who used chum to attract sharks to the pier had cut it loose after hooking it but failing to land it, Robles said.
