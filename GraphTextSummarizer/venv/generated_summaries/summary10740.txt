Moussavi and former president Khatami have sent a letter to Iran's courts urging them to release arrested activists and protesters. Both are students at the University of Oxford and had been returning to the UK from Iran after attending a family wedding, just as demonstrations escalated following presidential elections earlier this month which have plunged Iran into political chaos. Shams said she and her 27-year-old husband -- both activists for the pro-reformist Third Wave campaign -- planned to leave Iran on June 17. Why should the young people who want to do something for the sake of their country and their people, why are they in prison now?" Shams said she planned to return to Iran herself if there was no change in her husband's situation in the next week or so. "Third Wave was a totally legal campaign with reformist tendencies that was trying to get young people involved in the elections," said Shams.
