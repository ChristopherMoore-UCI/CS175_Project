What made the situation complicated was that I was a Westerner and it was 2002, a time when Myanmar, which is also known as Burma, was still a pariah state and branded an "outpost of tyranny" by the government of former U.S. president George W. Bush. In Myanmar, it is perfectly normal for people to go into monasteries or nunneries for temporary periods. Chanmyay Yeiktha's forest retreat was three times larger than I remembered, and is now surrounded by beautiful gardens of flowers and fruit trees. I slept on a pillowless wooden board, and my morning began at 3.30 a.m. with an icy bucket shower and the scrape of a razor over chin and head. But when temporary monks return to their lives outside, some are suddenly far more equal than others.
