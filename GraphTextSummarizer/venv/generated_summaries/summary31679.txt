The harsh reality of life and death in Gaza is a common theme for Palestinian filmmakers. It takes six months for Palestinian doctors to treat her concerns seriously and diagnose her with breast cancer. The film breaks new ground by dealing with matters often swept under the carpet in Palestinian society. "It's very taboo to speak about the woman's body in Palestinian society, but in the film it happens and nobody criticizes and nobody says anything about it," Andoni said. The heart-wrenching tale follows Fatenah's pain and humiliation as she struggles to leave Gaza for treatment after finding few Palestinian doctors willing to help.
