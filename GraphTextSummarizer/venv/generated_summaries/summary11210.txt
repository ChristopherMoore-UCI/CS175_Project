A one-way ticket to Mars Astronauts would also be bombarded with solar energetic particles, which get accelerated close to the sun as a result of solar flares and coronal mass ejections that shoot portions of the sun into space. According to a 2010 NASA report on space radiation cancer risk projections [PDF], the average American male who is 35 can safely spend between 140 and 186 days in deep space, assuming heavy shielding, and stay below that 3% increase in cancer risk; a 35-year-old female could spend between 88 and 120 days. The private company Mars One has started its recruitment process for a one-way trip for four people to land in 2023. Anyone who spends time on Mars could be exposed to more radiation, depending on how long they stay and what the shielding conditions are like. Solar energetic particle events only contributed about 5% to the overall measured dose equivalent during the laboratory's cruise to Mars.
