President Barack Obama has heavily pushed an alternative energy agenda, his administration pouring billions of taxpayer resources into solar, wind and battery initiatives aimed at cutting dependence on foreign oil and changing how Americans view and use energy. In a new policy paper, his Republican rival for the White House, Mitt Romney, says, "President Obama has intentionally sought to shut down oil, gas, and coal production in pursuit of his own alternative energy agenda. -- Americans consume more than 19 million barrels of oil a day as well as tons of coal and natural gas, raising questions about the future availability of those resources and the environmental impact of their development and use. It is also not clear that Romney's plans would bring energy independence that much quicker, especially without a simultaneous focus on reducing consumption. Obama has, for sure, angered some oil and coal producers by steering federal money to alternative energy sources.
