In extreme cases, the bacteria can lead to blood infections (half of which are fatal, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), possible amputation and blistering skin lesions. "If someone is eating raw oysters, especially in a high-risk group, or is swimming in the ocean and notices skin lesions that are worsening quickly, it is important to get early treatment. Vibrio vulnificus, on the other hand, gets into the blood stream from either the skin or intestinal tract, and can damage organs and cause skin lesions that may appear similar to the skin damage caused by strep A, Mody says. Vibrio vulnificus is a naturally occurring bacterium that lives in warm saltwater and infects humans through the consumption of undercooked shellfish and skin wounds. In addition to avoiding raw oysters, the CDC also recommends wearing gloves when handling raw shellfish and thoroughly cooking it, and discarding closed-shell varieties that don't open after cooking.
