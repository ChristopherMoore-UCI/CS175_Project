The hottest ticket in town these days is for the Who's Quadrophenia and More Tour concert on Tuesday night at the Dunkin' Donuts Center in downtown Providence, Rhode Island. The Who show was a big to-do in little Rhode Island; the concert was a sell-out. "I think the mayor of Providence made an informed decision at the time," Who guitarist Pete Townshend said in a statement to CNN. "I wrapped up the night shift at McDonald's and ran across the street to the Civic Center Box Office," he remembered. But even though Providence was the only show to be canceled after the tragedy, Cianci still stands by his decision.
