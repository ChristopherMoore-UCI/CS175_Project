The effects of the fire reverberated worldwide; Kenya distributes a third of all flowers in Europe through the airport with a special emphasis on rose production. There were no reports of casualties in the Wednesday blaze at Nairobi's Jomo Kenyatta International Airport. The airport also offers connections to Europe, the Middle East and other African nations, with about 16,000 passengers passing through daily, officials said. The nation's president, Uhuru Kenyatta, said the blaze was not an act of terror. The fire destroyed large parts of the international terminal and brought East Africa's largest aviation hub to a standstill.
