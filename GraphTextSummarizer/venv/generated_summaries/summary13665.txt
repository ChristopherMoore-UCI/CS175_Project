After watching the Republican candidates lock the kryptonite that is the immigration issue around their necks during the Arizona debate, my bet is that President Barack Obama could win another term -- even if he loses key swing states such as Florida, Iowa, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Wisconsin -- but he must make sure he accomplishes one thing first: Connect with Latinos. Once Obama has established a deep emotional connection with Latinos, he can connect directly to the heart of Latino voters with three simple messages: 1. So how does Obama -- who has a dubious record himself on immigration -- win the Latino vote? Beyond the shared concern for economic growth, jobs, education and health care, Latinos are focused on immigration because the majority of the undocumented workers living here are from Latin America. It is clear, then, that connecting with Latino voters could very well be a tipping point for the president; the question is how to make that connection.
