Those who died alongside her were: Andrique Bennett, 14; Kirklan M. Behner, 15; Daylan Ray, 15; Brandon A. Murray, 14; and Ramone M. White, 15. The two survivors escaped by breaking the rear window in the submerged vehicle, Ohio State Highway Patrol Lt. Brian Holt said. The crash, coupled with another one in Warren, Ohio, the same day, highlight that motor vehicle wrecks continue to be the No. 1 killer of youths in the United States. The teenagers were speeding down a two-lane northeastern Ohio road, authorities say. As the SUV entered the intersection, a truck smashed into its passenger side, CNN affiliate KFDA reported, quoting authorities.
