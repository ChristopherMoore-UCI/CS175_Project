China is building a "significant presence" in disputed waters in the South China Sea through land reclamation, new analysis shows. The South China Sea is the subject of numerous rival -- often messy -- territorial claims, with China, Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam disputing sovereignty of several island chains and nearby waters. "Where it used to have a few, small concrete platforms, it now has full islands with helipads, airstrips, harbors, and facilities to support large numbers of troops," James Hardy, Jane's Asia Pacific editor, told CNN. " In November, the publication reported that China was building an "air strip capable" island at least 3,000 meters long on Fiery Cross Reef. " Hardy said that Taiwan, Vietnam and the Philippines, which also claim the disputed archipelago, are modifying existing islands but not reclaiming land on a large scale.
