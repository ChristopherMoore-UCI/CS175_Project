Assistant District Attorney Shanda Strain said in court that the number of hours of community service was based on the number of hours law enforcement officials spent investigating the case, said Joan Vollero, a spokeswoman for the district attorney's office. Jones, who did weather reports on the station's weekend newscasts, called police on November 24, 2010, saying that she had nearly been attacked while jogging in Central Park. Callan said that Jones "wished to express her sincere apologies for any problems caused by her and by this incident and she specifically apologized to the NYPD and other law enforcement agencies involved in the investigation." While sentencing is scheduled for October 26, the defendant and the district attorney's office said they have agreed on a sentence of three years probation with 350 hours of community service. Police said Jones later recanted the story as police questioned her.
