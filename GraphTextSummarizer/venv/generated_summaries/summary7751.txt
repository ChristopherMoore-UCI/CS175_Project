Dani Pedrosa kept his MotoGP title hopes alive by outpacing championship leader Jorge Lorenzo to win the Japanese round at Motegi Sunday. Italy's Andrea Dovizioso finished fourth with reigning world champion Casey Stoner of Australia in fifth on his return to the circuit after an ankle injury which has sidelined him in the last three races. Alvaro Bautista completed a Spanish sweep of the podium in third place. At the start of the race I felt had the pace to stay with Dani and Jorge and the bike was feeling pretty good. "We did what we needed to do and it's just a pity that there is no one else who can stay with us because every race I win, he's been second," he told the official MotoGP website.
