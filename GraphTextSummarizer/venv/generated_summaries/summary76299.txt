While al Qaeda and its affiliates have failed to conduct any successful attacks in the United States since 9/11, they have sought to encourage action from militant American citizens, who might be more capable of carrying out terrorist operations in the States than foreign operatives given the stringent security measures now in place. Worrisomely, around 100 Americans have traveled to fight in Syria with opposition groups, including with ISIS and the al Qaeda-affiliated Nusra Front. The difficulty al Qaeda and similar groups have had in inspiring Americans to conduct attacks at home is due to the strength of systemic security checks, such as the willingness of Muslim communities to report potential terrorist activity. Elfgeeh, a 30-year-old American citizen of Yemeni heritage who owns a pizza parlor in Rochester, New York, is accused of attempting to provide support to ISIS and planning to attack American soldiers. All of these were inspired by the propaganda of Anwar al-Awlaki, the American cleric killed in a 2011 U.S. drone strike in Yemen after he took up an operational role in al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.
