"We would like to have BBC Persian correspondents in Iran, and we continue to seek a dialogue with the Iranian authorities to get accreditation for that," said the spokesman, who asked not to be named. "Considering the BBC's history of creating chaos in Iran, and its efforts to set the various strata of Iranian society against each other, the presence of the BBC Persian TV in the Islamic Republic is deemed to be illegal," he said. Correspondents for BBC Persian do not work in Iran, he added. BBC Persian TV launched January 14, broadcasting in Farsi to Iran, Afghanistan, and Tajikistan, the BBC spokesman said. The BBC spokesman said it is against the law for the channel to report and gather news in Iran, so the news it broadcasts on the channel is gathered from abroad, using sources and contacts within Iran.
