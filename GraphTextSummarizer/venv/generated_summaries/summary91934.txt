Justin Bieber to cameo on 'The Simpsons' Notes Jean: "To give equal time, when we make fun of Fox News, we also make fun of the Fox network." (The "Simpsons," of course, has a fondness for Fox News jokes.) The episode â€” which is titled "Four Regrettings and a Funeral" and airs next fall as part of season 25 â€” also includes brief cameos from Joe Namath and Gordon Ramsay (who guested on a season 23 episode). "He wants to interview with a big cable news channel and goes to Fox News." The Oscar-winning writer and creator of HBO's "The Newsroom" will make a cameo appearance on the animated Fox comedy, EW has learned.
