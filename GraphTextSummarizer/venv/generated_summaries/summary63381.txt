The A110 will come with a Tegra 3 processor and run Android 4.1 Jelly Bean, though it will be limited to a 1024×600 display—a major fumble in a tablet world overrun by competing devices with higher resolution displays. iPad Mini The iPad now comes in a 7.9-inch "mini" flavor, which makes it one of the largest of the mini-tablets. This growing product category now has more to offer than Android devices with differing UI skins and varying components—or that BlackBerry PlayBook that's not selling too hot. Like the Kindle Fire HD, it will also come with its own skinned version of Ice Cream Sandwich, and will be best suited for committed consumers of the Barnes and Noble e-book store. It comes preloaded with Amazon's Appstore, which has limited offerings compared to the Google Play store, and it runs a custom version of Ice Cream Sandwich, an Android version behind its major competitors.
