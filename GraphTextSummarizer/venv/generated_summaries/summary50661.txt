"While almost all of the dialogue in original screenplay is echoed on screen, the Venkman character is completely improvised. That leads us to Reitman's choices on the live event's casting: Seth Rogen as Peter Venkman It's as if Bill Murray was given a mumblecore-style essay about each scene and then permitted to say whatever he wanted as long as he got the point across," Reitman tells EW. Paul Scheer will fill out the rest of the cast with such roles as the guy taking the psychic test at the beginning of the film -- and being mercilessly electrocuted by Venkman. "Every important Venkman line is back in there, and there are about 30 of those," Reitman says.
