Bentz began flying drones as a hobby, then developed a passion for yachts when he spent two years working on board the 88m-long Maltese Falcon, one of the largest private yachts in the world. He now works with Alan Karol, a 31-year-old Polish cinematographer, on larger projects -- of which there are many in a Caribbean racing season teeming with stunning yachts and proud owners. Drones have revolutionized what is possible with a camera, but rarely does the end product match this vista of superyachts and Caribbean seas. "People spend this crazy amount of money to have everyone come and race in St Barts or Antigua," says Bentz, "so they want something everyone can relate to and enjoy having." Drones are not limited to the rarefied air of the superyacht club. Justice L Bentz, 26, lives in Antigua and shoots video profiles of some of the world's most expensive private yachts.
