Birmingham went further ahead when striker Cameron Jerome nodded a cross into the path of Craig Gardner and the midfielder poked home at the second attempt. It was Roberto Mancini's first defeat of the season but his team should have escaped with at least a point after a glaring miss by Argentina striker Carlos Tevez. Everton dominated the game after they went behind but couldn't find a way past veteran American goalkeeper Brad Friedel, who made a string of excellent saves. At Anfield, a Fernando Torres goal gave Liverpool a 1-0 win over newly-promoted West Brom as they bounced back from their thrashing at City last Monday. Their comeback was completed by Robbie Blake's spectacular free kick in the 81st minute and though Jerome had a late chance to win the game, substitute keeper Adam Bogdan ensured Bolton escaped with a point.
