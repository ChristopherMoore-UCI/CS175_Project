Embryonic stem cell research differs from other kinds of stem cell research, which do not require embryos. The field of embryonic stem cell research has been highly controversial, because in most cases, the research process involves destroying the embryo, typically four or five days old, after removing stem cells. The appeals panel later reversed, concluding the plaintiffs bringing suit "are unlikely to prevail because Dickey-Wicker is ambiguous and the NIH seems reasonably to have concluded" that the law does not ban research using embryonic stem cells. Some scientists say that embryonic stem cells could help treat many diseases and disabilities because of their potential to develop into many different cell types in the body. The current case does not deal with separate research on adult stem cells, which is permissible under federal law.
