Pakistan's government had raised gasoline prices by 9.2% and increased kerosene prices by nearly 6%, blaming higher crude oil costs for the move. Gilani called for the establishment of a team that would devise a strategy to combat fluctuation in world petroleum prices and avoid harsh measures, such as the fuel price increase. It comes days after the Muttahida Qaumi Movement quit the government over fuel price increases and other complaints -- a move that cost Gilani's Pakistan People's Party its majority in the assembly. The Pakistani government has reversed a recent hike in fuel prices, an effort that could help shore up the country's crumbling governing coalition. Anwar also said the government had failed to crack down on "rampant" corruption and maintain law and order -- particularly in Karachi and the surrounding southern province of Sindh.
