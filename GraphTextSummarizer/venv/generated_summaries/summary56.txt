Erykah Badu must pay a $500 fine and serve six months on probation for her naked stroll through downtown Dallas, Texas, while making a music video last March, a city official confirmed Tuesday. Badu reached a plea deal to settle a misdemeanor disorderly conduct citation issued after she released a music video, according to Dallas spokesman Jose Torres. It wasn't until several days after the video for the song "Window Seat" was released on March 28 that anyone who witnessed the taping filed a complaint with Dallas Police. "If she violates any law at the city, state or federal level, a motion to adjudicate (seeking to revoke probation) will be filed," Torres said. The singer shed her clothes as she walked through Dealey Plaza until she was nude and then fell near where President John F. Kennedy was assassinated.
