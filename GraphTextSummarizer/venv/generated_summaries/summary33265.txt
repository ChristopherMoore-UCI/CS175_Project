Joe Amendola, Sandusky's lawyer, said the delay may still not be enough time. Amendola argued that prosecutors have been investigating the case long before Sandusky was arrested but he has had little time to prepare his case. In February, Penn State said it has incurred nearly $3.2 million in combined legal, consultant, and public relation fees pertaining to the scandal. -- The trial for Jerry Sandusky, the former Penn State assistant football coach accused of molesting several boys, has been postponed until June 5. "We don't know if we will have all the information we need and are entitled to receive prior to the new trial date, but we will do our very best to be ready to proceed to trial on June 5," Amendola said.
