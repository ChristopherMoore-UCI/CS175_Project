More than four dozen people have been arrested, including police officers, local officials and members of a drug gang. The investigation of the case has prompted speculation that Abarca was so worried that the students might disrupt his wife's speech that he ordered Flores to have police officers confront the students and stop the protest. This week, Jesus Murillo Karam, Mexico's attorney general, issued arrest warrants for three people in connection with a shocking case that has captured the attention of the entire country: the disappearance of 43 students, who went missing after being confronted by police. The leader of Guerreros Unidos told officials that, once police turned over the students, he ordered his henchmen to make them disappear. For residents of the small town of Iguala, which lies 120 miles southwest of Mexico City, the nightmare began on September 26 â€” just 10 days after the festivities celebrating Mexico's Independence Day.
