It accuses her of conspiracy to produce child pornography, production of child pornography, conspiracy to engage in child sex trafficking, and sex trafficking of children. The indictment comes a month after tips from the public led to Tucker's identification and arrest as one of two individuals allegedly involved in the production of child pornography images that were shot about 11 years ago. Tucker then took the girl to his residence, where the girl and "John Doe" engaged in sex acts, which were photographed, it adds. In or about May 2001, Tucker contacted "John Doe" and asked if he would be interested in having sex with the girl in exchange for money, it says. "The victim in this case was devastated when she learned from investigators that these sexually explicit images had been distributed over the Internet," said ICE Director John Morton.
