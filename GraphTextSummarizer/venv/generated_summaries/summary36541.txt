Carr and Stelter worked together at The Times for six years and appeared together in the 2011 documentary "Page One: Inside The New York Times." "David mentored and nurtured countless journalists, and I was so lucky to be one of them," Stelter said. Carr was "one of the most gifted journalists" to ever work at the newspaper, said Arthur Sulzberger Jr., publisher of The Times. Before joining The Times, he worked for The Atlantic Monthly and New York magazine. The New York Times' media columnist David Carr died from complications from lung cancer and heart disease, an autopsy revealed. Carr, 58, died Thursday after he collapsed at The Times office in Manhattan.
