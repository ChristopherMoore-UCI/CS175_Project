"I can't put into words just how precious she was," said Woodall, who adopted Amanda at age 4 "We will work with the district attorney's office in the prosecution of this case for justice for Amanda," said Rutherford County Sheriff Robert Arnold. After serving a 10-year sentence for aggravated child abuse of Amanda, Lane had a son, Ryan, who was abused at 3 months old, according to court documents. According to an autopsy by the state medical examiner's office, Amanda's death was a homicide, caused by complications of blunt force head injury. Amanda died last year at age 22 and on Monday, Lane, 41, was charged with first-degree murder in Amanda's death. "She was such a treasure," said Woodall-Holmes, who became Amanda's foster parent on a Christmas Eve.
