-- Inter Milan coach Andrea Stramaccioni has rejected suggestions that Wesley Sneijder has been "victimized" in his pay dispute with the Italian football club. "Clubs say that players must respect contracts, but why should that not apply in reverse?" The Nerazzurri won on Sunday thanks to a 74th-minute own goal by defender Santiago Garcia, whose struggling Palermo team is coached by Gian Piero Gasperini -- sacked by Inter last season after only five games in charge. Napoli stayed second with a 5-1 thrashing of bottom club Pescara, as Uruguay striker Edinson Cavani and Swiss midfielder Gokhan Inler scored twice each. " FIFPro says it will demand action from football's ruling bodies against clubs which seek to "blackmail" players into accepting reduced terms.
