Palfrey swam over 67 miles from Little Cayman island to Grand Cayman island. A Lycra suit will provide Palfrey some protection from the jellyfish, she said, and long cables called "shark shields" will be strung from the kayaks and boats around her to ward off larger predators. Palfrey estimated the journey would cover 103 miles (166 kilometers), much of it through shark infested waters. Palfrey, who is a mother of three and grandmother of two, said she hopes that swimming in the wake of Tropical Storm Debby will provide her with calm seas. "I got about six hours of sleep last night, which is pretty good for the night before."
