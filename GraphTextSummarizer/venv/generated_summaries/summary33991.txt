For now, the NHL is coy about any expansion plans, but a spokesman told CNN: "We have a long history of playing games in Europe and are working with the Players' Association (NHLPA) to formulate a comprehensive calendar of games and activities in Europe. "Of the four major sports in North America, the NHL is situated best to grow there, as there is great support for hockey already in Europe and we have a lot of international players in our game," he said. In North America -- ahead of Sochi's start -- the NHL went on a big marketing blitz, with outdoor matches in massive stadiums previously used for other sports. "We want to give our fans the most remarkable two months in the history of the league," NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman announced after the Toronto Maple Leafs beat the Detroit Red Wings 3-2 in the annual showdown. Some NHL franchises were opposed to allowing star players to compete for fear of midseason injury, but it has been maintained.
