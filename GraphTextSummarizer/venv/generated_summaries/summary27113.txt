-- Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh is calling for an end to the protests in that country and said he supports the creation of a national unity government to oversee upcoming parliamentary elections, the state-run news service Saba reported Wednesday. Undeterred by an attack on their sit-in a day earlier, anti-government protesters gathered at Sanaa University again on Wednesday to demand that  Saleh step down. Saleh also repeated his pledge not to run for re-election, Saba reported. According to the news service, Saleh made the statement during a meeting with an official with the non-profit National Democratic Institute. He also said he would postpone parliamentary elections scheduled for April to allow more time for discussions about reform.
