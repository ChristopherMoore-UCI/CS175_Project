One of the commission's findings was to criticize the "NSA's cautious approach to any collection of intelligence relating to activity in the United States." Years later, in his 2008 book, "The Shadow Factory," James Bamford -- a chronicler and inveterate critic of NSA activities and, it should be added, a participant in a lawsuit against the agency for its post-9/11 activities -- wrote about al-Hazmi and al-Mihdhar that "the Agency never alerted any (emphasis his) other Agency that the terrorists were in the United States and moving across the country toward Washington." To be sure, the NSA never knew they were in the United States, but a career critic of alleged NSA privacy violations (Bamford) thought the agency did and should have known these two terrorists were in (that's my emphasis) this country and the Congress of the United States believed the NSA too "cautious" about intelligence in (my emphasis again) America. From there on several occasions they called an al Qaeda safe house in the Middle East whose communications were targeted by American intelligence. Let's say that somewhere in the world American intelligence comes across an individual it has good reason to believe is an al Qaeda operative, and he has a cell phone in his possession. Instead, the data lies fallow until the NSA can put a question to it based on a predicate related to terrorism and only terrorism. The NSA intercepted a series of these calls and created intelligence reports on several of them.
