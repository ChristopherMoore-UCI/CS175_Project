The utilities that compile generation statistics view rooftop solar electricity, used on site, not as power generation but as a reduction in demand! What's significant about this about-face on nuclear by the highly regarded "Oracle of Omaha" is that Buffett instead decided to install 656 large wind turbines at a cost of $1.9 billion in Iowa, and has gone "all-in" with multibillion dollar bets on utility-scale wind and solar power and other renewable energy facilities throughout the West. According to the World Nuclear Industry Status Report 2013, in the preceding year, 45 gigawatts of wind and 32 gigawatts of solar power were installed worldwide, compared with a net addition of just 1.2 gigawatts of nuclear. Worldwide, in 2013, solar power installations grew by 38 gigawatts, from 96  to 134. As utilities find nuclear power less and less cost effective, new solar photovoltaic installations in the United States are springing up.
