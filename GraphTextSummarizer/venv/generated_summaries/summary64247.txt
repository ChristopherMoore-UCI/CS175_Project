Many helium users, from scientists to manufacturers in a number of industries, have experienced the negative impact of helium shortages and rising prices. Helium, unlike most other gases, is a minor byproduct in the production of natural gas. Those fissures and crevices that have trapped natural gas below the Earth's surface are also capable of trapping helium, although typically in small amounts. And when more than a few of those helium sources are shut down for maintenance and repair, as they have been over the last few months, helium shortages can occur. In the 1960s and 1970s, the U.S. bought and stored significant amounts of helium there.
