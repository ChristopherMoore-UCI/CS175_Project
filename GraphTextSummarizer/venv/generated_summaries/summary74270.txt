-- Federal authorities were investigating Friday the circumstances of a drone that crashed in El Paso, Texas, this week, which U.S. officials said originated in Mexico. "There is nothing to suggest that there was any kind of surveillance activity that was going on with anything used by the government of Mexico in U.S. airspace," the official said. The crash of an unmanned aerial vehicle from Mexico would be a first on U.S. soil, Cordero said. U.S. National Transportation Safety Board spokesman Keith Holloway said he believed that the drone "was owned by the government of Mexico, and I think they were the operators. " Alday said the drone malfunctioned, entered U.S. airspace and landed in El Paso.
