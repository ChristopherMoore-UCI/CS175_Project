The proliferation of printed hands began when Jon Schull at the Rochester Institute of Technology formed e-NABLE, a global, Web-based social network, to connect people who need hands with people who are interested in building them. -- Smiling children are using prosthetic hands to open windows through which we can glimpse the future of health care -- a future where outsiders and amateurs innovate along with insiders and professionals. Permissionless innovation is largely alien to health care. The question is, "Will America lead the way, as it has for a century, or will it fall behind, as it has begun to do?" My forthcoming Mercatus Center research "Fortress and Frontier in American Health Care" argues that leading requires us to abandon the partisan rancor over health insurance ("Obamacare" vs. "repeal and replace") and focus, instead, on innovating our way to better health. If such things as OnStar, GM's safety and connectivity system, or hospital connectivity fails, people can die.
