Microseconds after the Big Bang, there was a "hot soup" of particles called quarks and gluons at a temperature of around 2 trillion degrees above absolute zero, John Harris, professor of physics at Yale University, said last year. The tiny particles' lightning-fast collision promised to produce temperatures up to 100,000 times hotter than the sun, said Michael Tuts, a professor in experimental high-energy physics at New York's Columbia University and one of hundreds of scientists involved in the project. By combining more and more basic elements, scientists hope to better understand how various particles came together to create the modern-day universe and all it contains. -- Scientists say they are a step closer to recreating the conditions at the birth of the universe and to understanding life as we know it, after the successful collision of heavy lead ions in a massive machine in Europe. Many of these scientists will examine the aftereffects of this latest ion collision as they try to step back further to the universe's emergence billions of years ago.
