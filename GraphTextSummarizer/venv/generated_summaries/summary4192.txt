-- Sao Paulo has confirmed it will complete the signing of Brazil playmaker Paulo Henrique Ganso from Santos in a deal worth an estimated $12 million. And with the World Cup arriving in Brazil in 2014, Ganso will plan to show national coach Mano Menezes he is ready to lead his country's challenge on home soil. The player will now hope to kick-start his career following a number of injury problems and a dip in form which cost him a place in Brazil's Olympic squad, where he was replaced by Chelsea playmaker Oscar. Sao Paulo football director Adalberto Baptista told the club website: "Ganso showed throughout the negotiating a great willingness towards Sao Paulo. Alongside Neymar, Ganso helped Santos win the Brazilian Cup in 2010 and the Copa Libertadores in 2011.
