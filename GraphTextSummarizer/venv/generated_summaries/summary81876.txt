But it wasn't the amount on the check that angered Joseph Gibson, who had stopped at a St. Louis sports bar to chow down. Gibson, who had a soda and chicken dinner, was still offended. Domachowski explained that he made a Father's Day exception for Gibson to bring in a child even though the bar was for patrons 21 and older. Denny Domachowski, the general manager of Friendly's Sports Bar and Grill, told CNN the waitress meant it as a joke and intended to delete it before handing the bill to Gibson. He posted a picture of the receipt to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch Facebook page.
