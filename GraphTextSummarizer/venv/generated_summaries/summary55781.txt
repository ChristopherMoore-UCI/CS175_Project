Some Uyghurs have expressed resentment toward China's Han majority in recent years over what they say is harsh treatment from Chinese security forces and Han people taking the lion's share of economic opportunities in Xinjiang. East Turkestan is the name used by many Uyghur groups to refer to Xinjiang. Uyghurs are said to have faced widespread discrimination, including in employment, housing and educational opportunities, as well as curtailed religious freedom and political marginalization. Recently Xinjiang has been at the center of a spate of attacks, labeled terrorism by the authorities. -- Three people have been sentenced to death on Monday for their roles in a deadly attack in Beijing's Tiananmen Square last October, state television CCTV reported on its microblog.
