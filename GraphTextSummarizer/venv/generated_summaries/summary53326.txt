A massive fire engulfed the four-story offices of a major film company in central London on Friday, sending clouds of white smoke over the city skyline, the London fire department said. Two firefighters were taken to the hospital with minor injuries as a result of the blaze in the Future Films building on Dean Street in the city's Soho district, London ambulance services said. When reached by CNN, Future Films founder and managing director Stephen Margolis had no comment about the fire. Future Films has been involved in the production of more than 120 films since Margolis created the company in 2000, including "Bend it like Beckham" (2002), "The Importance of Being Earnest" (2002), and "Transsiberian" (2008). Streets in London were cordoned off while firefighters tackled the blaze.
