Coptic Christians base their theology on the teachings of the Apostle Mark, who introduced Christianity to Egypt, according to St. Takla Church in Alexandria, the capital of Coptic Christianity. The religion is known for its rift with other Christians in the fifth century over the definition of the divinity of Jesus Christ. Protests have broken out in Christian areas of Egypt every night since the car bombing outside the Church of the Two Saints in Alexandria. About 9 percent of Egypt's 80 million residents are Coptic Christians. -- Egyptian Muslims attended Christmas services Friday in a show of solidarity with Coptic Christians days after a bombing killed 23 congregants in the country's north.
