-- The United Nations Security Council has ended sanctions against Sierra Leone, restrictions originally imposed during the nation's brutal civil war, the Security Council announced Wednesday. It is a potential success story, not only for Sierra Leone but for the Security Council." U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Susan Rice commended the decision to end sanctions. The Council ended a 1997 arms embargo and a travel ban among other sanctions, in a move aimed at restoring confidence in the West African nation. "Sierra Leone may today no longer be one of your most critical concerns," said Michael von der Schulenburg, head of the United Nations Integrated Peacebuilding Office in Sierra Leone. "Because of the much-improved situation in Sierra Leone, including the work of its special courts and the demobilization of armed groups, the remaining sanctions can now be lifted," she said in a statement.
