The past is new again for agent 007: The next James Bond film will be called "Spectre." Director Sam Mendes announced the name of the 24th official Bond film Thursday at England's Pinewood Studios. The film's official Twitter account featured a picture of Bond's new car, a snazzy Aston Martin DB10. Mendes all but said the title was a nod to the SPECTRE terror group featured in Ian Fleming's James Bond novels and the early films. "Those of you who have some knowledge of the Bond franchise and the legend of Bond will probably have some idea of what that refers to, but I couldn't possibly comment," Mendes said. Newcomers to the franchise include Monica Bellucci, Lea Seydoux, Andrew Scott and Dave Bautista.
