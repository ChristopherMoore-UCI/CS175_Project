-- Syrian authorities have moved perhaps hundreds of detainees to military sites to hide them from Arab League monitors assessing whether the government is upholding a commitment to end its crackdown on protesters, Human Rights Watch said Tuesday. Security forces shot tear gas and bullets at protesters at Clock Square in downtown Homs, where thousands had gathered, said Loubna, a Homs resident who cited security concerns in asking that her full name not be used. Inside Syria, the carnage continued, with security forces assaulting demonstrators in the Syrian cities of Homs and Hama on Tuesday, witnesses told CNN. The observatory called the reported withdrawal of government forces a deceptive "show" for the Arab League monitors. " Alaa Shalaby, a member of the Arab League advance team, said Sudanese Lt. Gen. Mohamed Ahmed Mustafa Al-Dabi, the head of the observer mission, had returned to Damascus but 10 monitors remained in Homs.
