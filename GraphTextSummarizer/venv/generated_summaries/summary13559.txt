Alan Rosenberg, national president of SAG, calls the terms of the contract "devastatingly unsatisfactory. " Before the agreement, the two sides had been at odds mainly over the amount actors should be paid when their movies or TV shows are distributed on discs or through new media, such as mobile phones and the Internet. "The ratification vote by SAG members is good news for the entertainment industry," the alliance's Web site said. " "This decisive vote gets our members back to work with immediate pay raises and puts SAG in a strong position for the future," said David White, the group's interim national executive director. During the drawn-out process, SAG fired its executive director and named a new chief negotiator amid a bitter division among the actors over the question of calling a strike against the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers.
