That was until the final minute of normal time when Gomez turned inside the area and crossed for star man Llorente to poke home at the near post and send the San Mames stadium into raptures. The Basque side will face Atletico Madrid in the final on May 9 after their fellow Spanish team won 1-0 away at Valencia to record an impressive 5-2 aggregate victory. -- Fernando Llorente's dramatic last minute goal sealed an all-Spanish Europa League final as Athletic Bilbao booked a clash with Atletico Madrid in Bucharest. In the other semifinal, Valencia came charging out of the blocks, determined to reverse Atletico's 4-2 advantage from the first leg but striker Roberto Soldado wasted two clear cut chances. Both sides hit the woodwork in the second half, Llorente with a header and Emiliano Insua with a vicious long range strike, but the game looked destined for extra time.
