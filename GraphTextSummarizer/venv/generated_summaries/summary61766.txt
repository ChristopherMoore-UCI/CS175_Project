By Wednesday morning, the death toll from the storm's rage had topped 325: at least 246 in the Philippines, 74 in Vietnam and nine in Cambodia. CNN's Arwa Damon in Danang, Vietnam, and Dan Rivers in Manila, the Philippines, and journalist Asha Phillips in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, contributed to this report. The worst-hit country, the Philippines, began the slow process of clearing up mud and debris Wednesday. In the city of Pasig -- part of metropolitan Manila -- enterprising residents used inflatable mattresses as makeshift boats to ferry people through flooded streets. To help avoid a humanitarian catastrophe, several nations have rallied to the Philippines' side.
