Schrade started having big dreams for Orozco by the time the boy was 10. John Orozco started down the path to the Olympics when he was 7. Vitaly Marinitch, his coach at the U.S. Olympic Training Center in Colorado where he has been training for more than a year, says Orozco's combination of talent, "cat-like" moves and hard work make him a contender for a medal in London. Schrade often trained Orozco for free since there wasn't money to pay for coaching. It's rare to find the perfect balance of strength and grace in a boy, Schrade says, but on top of all that, you need discipline and drive, and he says Orozco had both.
