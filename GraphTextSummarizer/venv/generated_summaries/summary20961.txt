-- A federal jury ruled Friday that Samsung must pay $119.6 million more to Apple over patent infringements, according to court documents filed by the U.S. District Court of Northern District of California, San Jose division. And according to the court documents, Apple must pay Samsung more than $158,000 for patent infringement accusations filed by the Korean smartphone maker. Then, last November, a federal jury ordered Samsung to pay $290 million in damages on top of the $640 million in damages that Judge Koh upheld. In August 2012, Samsung was found to have violated several of Apple's patents, and a jury ruled that Samsung owed Apple more than $1 billion in damages. Apple has typically been the aggressor in alleging Samsung of "slavishly" copying aspects of its iPhone and iPad technology, though Samsung has levied a few patent infringement accusations of its own.
