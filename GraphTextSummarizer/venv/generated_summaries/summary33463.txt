AIDS-related deaths have dropped more than 25% over the last six years, and countries with some of the highest rates of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) -- which leads to AIDS -- are now seeing substantial drops in mortality rates, according to a recent report by the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS. "We can reach a point where virtually no children are born with the virus," Clinton said, adding that the plan also aims to further reduce transmission rates and increase access to medical treatment for those who are already infected. "That so many young people become infected with HIV each year is a preventable tragedy," Dr. Thomas Frieden, director of the CDC, said in the report. She was joined by Eric Goosby, U.S. global AIDS coordinator. Clinton announced the plan, officially titled the "President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) Blueprint: Creating an AIDS-free Generation," at the State Department, two days ahead of World AIDS Day.
