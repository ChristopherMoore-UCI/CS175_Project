Lisa Lavoie and the male student were found in Morgantown, West Virginia, Monday night after apparently being together for a week, Holyoke Mayor Michael Sullivan said. Officials couldn't take the pair into custody until after gathering enough evidence to obtain a warrant from the district attorney's office, said Holyoke Police Chief Anthony Scott. Lavoie wasn't reported missing until she didn't show up for school Monday. Officials said the pair were in Vermont on Thursday before showing up in West Virginia on Monday. They got the warrant Monday and asked police in Morgantown to arrest Lavoie.
