Hudson was seated beside her fiance as witnesses recalled the harrowing events of a rainy day in October 2008, when the singer's mother, Darnell Donerson, 57, and her brother Jason Hudson, 29, were shot dead. Smith also recalled how Balfour once told him that he wished he could beat up Jason Hudson but never heard of him threatening his wife, Donerson or Julian. Balfour showed him a text message from Julia Hudson, he said, that told him she didn't love him anymore. Police officer Jennifer Bryk testified that she was next to Hudson's sister, Julia, who at the time was separated from Balfour, when he called her after the attack. -- More than two dozen people filled a Chicago courtroom Tuesday, listening to testimony in the case of the murdered relatives of Grammy-winning singer Jennifer Hudson.
