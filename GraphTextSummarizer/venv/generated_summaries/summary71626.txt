Initial reports from the scene were that the drainage system at Tru-Seal Manufacturing was clogged and caused water to pool on the roof, causing a partial collapse, said Kentucky Emergency Management spokesman Buddy Rogers. No injuries or deaths were immediately reported, said Marc Breckenridge, emergency management director for Washtenaw County. A total of seven people, all adults, were checked into the Knox County Hospital, said hospital spokesman Shawn Gentry. The severe weather also affected the western and southwestern areas of Ann Arbor, said Mayor John Hieftje. Three people were taken to a hospital with non-life-threatening injuries, Rogers said.
