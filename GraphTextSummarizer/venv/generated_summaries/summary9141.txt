" The procession went on this past weekend with the president's noblemen, Robert Gibbs, David Axelrod and Paul Krugman, all taking to the Sunday shows to insist that the real grievance was not President Obama's debate performance, not that he had no clothes, but that no one is calling Mitt Romney on his lies. In the most recent Pew Research poll taken after the debate, Romney now leads Obama 49% to 45% among likely voters. In fact, Princeton economist Harvey Rosen says the Obama administration is misrepresenting his study on Romney's tax plan. As several commentators have said, Romney's brilliant debate performance obliterated $100 million in negative ads against him. In a CNN/ORC International Poll conducted right after the debate, 67% of debate watchers said Romney won.
