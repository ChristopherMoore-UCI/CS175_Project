"As a result of the meetings, the Department agrees that publishing FIO statistics going forward is necessary, and the Department is working toward personalizing interactions between officers and citizens." The report said that Boston police failed to show that its stops and frisks produced results. -- A scathing review of policing in Boston found that in a city where about a quarter of the population is African-American, two-thirds of police stops involved black residents, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. It also recommended that officers who are involved in stops wear body cameras during interactions with the public -- a practice now in place in Ferguson, Missouri, after unarmed teenager Michael Brown was shot and killed by a white police officer. The findings come in the wake of troubling incidents across the nation in which police actions disproportionately targeted African-Americans in cities like New York, where questionable police tactics have been captured on video. Segal said the findings were clear evidence of racial bias by Boston officers.
