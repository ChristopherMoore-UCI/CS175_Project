As it begins legal proceedings against Bales, the military is under the most intense scrutiny it has faced since soldiers were accused in 2004 of abusing Iraqi detainees at Abu Ghraib prison, and a squad of Marines were charged with killing two dozen civilians in Haditha, Iraq, in 2005.

Cases like these define the U.S. military for many Afghans, said Sarah Holewinski, executive director of the Washington-based Campaign for Innocent Victims in Conflict.
