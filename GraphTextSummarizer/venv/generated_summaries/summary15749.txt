-- Brazilian club Corinthians are champions of South America for the first time after a 3-1 aggregate defeat of Argentina's Boca Juniors in the final of the Copa Libertadores. "I am very happy because we know the history Boca Juniors have in worldwide football and in the Copa Libertadores," Emerson told Fox Sports. Wednesday's historic win over six-time champions Boca ensured Corinthians' qualification for December's FIFA Club World Cup in Japan. " Corinthians' undefeated campaign was powered by five goals from the 33-year-old Emerson, as well as four goals from attacking midfielder Danilo -- who won the title with Sau Paulo in 2005. After a 1-1 draw in last week's first leg in Buenos Aires, two goals from Brazil-born Qatar striker Emerson gave coach Tite's Corinthians a 2-0 second-leg win in Sao Paulo.
