The official announcement of the September 12 date confirms what several media outlets first reported five weeks ago, citing anonymous sources at Apple. The tagline says only, "It's almost here." Of course, that never stops Apple obsessives from parsing the invite for clues. iMore, the first blog to pinpoint the September 12 launch date, has also said pre-orders will begin that day and that the phone will be released nine days later, on September 21. On Tuesday, the secretive company sent e-mails to members of the media, inviting them to an "invitation-only event" in San Francisco on Wednesday, September 12. The event is widely expected to be the launch of the next iPhone, but in typically cryptic Apple fashion, the invitation reveals little about what will be announced.
