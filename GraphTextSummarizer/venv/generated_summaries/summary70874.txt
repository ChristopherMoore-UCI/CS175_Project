The faithful were ushering in Eid al-Fitr -- three days of celebrations that Muslims mark with joyous community prayers, acts of charity, visits from far-flung relatives, gift-giving and elaborate feasts. So, while most countries -- including the United States -- observed Eid on Sunday, some will begin their celebrations on Monday. On the morning of Eid, Muslims don new clothes and head to prayers that are often held in open fields to accommodate crowds too big to contain in mosques. The night before Eid, entire communities gather on rooftops, scanning the sky with giddy anticipation. It is a message that Afghanistan's president, Hamid Karzai, also shared during Eid prayers when he called on the Taliban to join the peace process in his war-weary country.
