Its detractors see the final chapter in the rise and fall of a smart but solipsistic Harvard dropout, and predict the inevitable decline of Facebook's stock will spell the end to innovation in social media. If the dot.com bubble and more recent stock market crash should have taught us anything, it's that stock prices have been uncoupled from business profitability, which has in turn been uncoupled from value creation. Yes, Facebook may have a role in that next-generation social media universe, but it will need what tech industry people like to call "a second act." It wants to become the platform on which everybody else builds social media apps. None of this has anything to do with social media, it's just gambling.
