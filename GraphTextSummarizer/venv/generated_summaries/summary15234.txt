The big chart story this week is rapper Mac Miller, whose independent debut "Blue Slide Park" sold 144,000 copies and hit Number One on the Billboard album charts. Lucky for him, holiday albums are traditional sales phenomena, as opposed to downloads -- Bubl√© is just Number Seven on this week's iTunes chart, and Bieber didn't place at all. It's up to 10.5 million views on YouTube and Ultimate Chart ranks it Number 14, up from Number 29 the previous week. Perry, in old-lady makeup, sits on her bed staring into space as she flashes back to the "younger" Perry in a goofy romance with actor Diego Luna. His "Under the Mistletoe" dropped from Number One to Number Six this week, shedding 54 percent (97,000 total this week).
