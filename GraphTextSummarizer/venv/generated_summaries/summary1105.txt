Many Catholic leaders and other religious groups strongly oppose any requirement for contraception coverage on theological grounds. Romney was quoted at the time as saying, "My personal view in my heart of hearts is that people who are subject to rape should have the option of having emergency contraception or emergency contraception information." The White House originally wanted to require hospitals and schools with religious ties to offer full contraception coverage. "Today's proposal continues to involve needless government intrusion in the internal governance of religious institutions, and to threaten government coercion of religious people and groups to violate their most deeply held convictions," the statement said. Under the new plan announced by Obama, religiously affiliated universities and hospitals will not be forced to offer contraception coverage to their employees.
