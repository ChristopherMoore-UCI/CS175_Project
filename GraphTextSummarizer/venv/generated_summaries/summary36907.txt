The EPDT's work is more important than ever as elephant and human populations have significantly increased in southern Africa in recent years, explains Osborn. The EPDT currently sells the farmed chilies through a website called 'Elephant Pepper' with a slogan: "Elephants Hate Chili... Osborn said that creating an environment where people and elephants can live in harmony is key, but that doesn't necessarily mean taking a conventional approach to conservation. Even where community-based conservation initiatives exist, and elephants generate large revenues, the money doesn't filter down to local population. According to the World Wildlife Fund, elephant numbers have reached 300,000 in sub-Saharan Africa, however, less than 20% of the elephant range is under formal protection.
