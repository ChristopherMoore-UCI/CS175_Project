-- Gidget, the 15-year-old dog best known for her Taco Bell ad campaign, died of a stroke Tuesday in Los Angeles, California, said Sue Chipperton, her trainer. "She didn't do amazing dog tricks, she didn't do stunts, she was just playing the character of a teenage boy (dog). Gidget was owned by Studio Animal Services, but lived with and was trained by Chipperton, who said she has been getting e-mails, calls and Facebook entries on Gidget's passing. Uttering the words "Yo Quiero Taco Bell," Gidget, a female dog, played a male dog in the commercials. She "acted like a big dog and had a big dog attitude," Chipperton said, adding that once she arrived on a soundstage, she had no trouble finding her way in front of the camera.
