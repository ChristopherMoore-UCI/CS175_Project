A horrible error from Spain goalkeeper Iker Casillas enabled van Persie to make it four after 72 minutes and Robben burst clear of the Spanish defense eight minutes later to round off the scoring. Barcelona star Alexis Sanchez opened the scoring after 11 minutes for La Roja, pouncing on a loose ball to place it beyond Australia goalkeeper Mathew Ryan from nine yards. Daley Blind's floated long pass was met on the run by van Persie and the striker launched a flying header that looped the ball brilliantly beyond Casillas. Jorge Valdivia then made it two just over a minute later as he curled the ball delightfully beyond Ryan with the outside of his boot from the edge of the area, having been teed up by Sanchez. The result is Spain's worst at a World Cup finals in 64 years and leaves little room for error in the 2008 and 2012 European champion's remaining group games against Chile and Australia.
