Bass said that in light of the fact that fellow band member (now solo phenom) Justin Timberlake is slated to receive the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award at the show "... of course people are automatically going to think we're going to be there performing. "It's so nice to see because when we ended things [over] ten years ago, there was no social media, there was no Twitter [fan base], but it's so cute to see how many people are supporting [us] and 'NSYNC was even trending." But take heart, fans, because Bass stopped short of a complete denial that a reunion performance might happen. Band member Lance Bass had something to say about the rumors Tuesday night on his SiriusXM show, "Dirty Pop with Lance Bass." Joey [Fatone], Chris [Kirkpatrick] and myself went to go see Justin's last show with Jay Z at the [Sun Life] Stadium last Friday, and I even took a picture of it, it's on my Instagram." Bass said he believes that's what kicked off speculation that the group, who went on hiatus in 2002, would be getting back together. "It's amazing to see the reaction out there on Twitter and social media ... of how many people are supporting 'NSYNC," he said.
