Chrysler dealer total is effective June 9; GM dealer total is estimate for end of 2010. While Chrysler dealers will be "forced out" by June 9, GM is positioning for a smoother closing of its stores, with each shutting down when it runs out of inventory. Chrysler dealers can (and likely will) protest the process by which they were chosen (sales volume, number of brands in the store, the area in which the dealership operated). Unlike Chrysler's announcement, GM's list of closing dealers will not be made public, leaving that decision to each dealer.
