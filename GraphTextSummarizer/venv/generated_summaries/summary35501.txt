After reading about Robertson's commute in a Detroit Free Press article from over the weekend, college student Evan Leedy was moved. Comments on the page from people donating money suggested that the story of Robertson's dedication to getting to work had tapped into a deep well of public feeling. With the online donations now topping $200,000, Robertson, Pollack and Leedy met together for the first time Monday night. " "We could use more men like James Robertson in this world," wrote a donor named Betty Blanchard. Leedy decided to set up an online fundraiser to buy Robertson a new car.
