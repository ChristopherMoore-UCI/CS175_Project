" Solange, Jay Z and Beyonce break their silence on elevator incident The now-infamous standoff occurred after the Met Gala on May 5, when Solange, Beyonce and Jay Z were seen leaving New York City's Standard Hotel. -- Solange Knowles still isn't saying what prompted her elevator confrontation with her brother-in-law, Shawn "Jay Z" Carter, but she will tell you one thing: She's at peace about it. Without going into detail about the brouhaha, which was caught on elevator surveillance video and dropped a bomb on Beyonce's otherwise composed and inaccessible public persona, Solange says that she's not dwelling on the past. The 28-year-old singer and younger sister of Forbes' world power Beyonce talks about the altercation in the August issue of Lucky magazine. "We've always held each other down no matter what," Knowles tells Lucky magazine.
