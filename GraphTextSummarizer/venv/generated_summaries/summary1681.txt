The win drew them level on points with Real Madrid and Atletico, but at the summit because of a superior goal difference. Argentina star Carlos Tevez put Juve two up inside 21 minutes, but second half goals from Luca Toni and substitute Juan Gomez in stoppage time, salvaged a point for the home side. More might have followed as Carlos Bacca hit the post with a header but Barca were level as Messi's free kick found Alexis Sanchez, who appeared to be in an offside position before scoring. An own goal from PSG captain Thiago Silva cost them three points after Javier Pastore put them ahead after eight minutes. Alberto Moreno had put the hosts into an early 15th minute lead as his low strike deflected past Victor Valdes.
