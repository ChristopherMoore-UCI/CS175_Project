After meeting with House Democrats on Monday, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said authorities are building additional detention centers to house adults traveling with children. The group deported Monday had recently crossed the U.S.-Mexico border and had been held in a new temporary immigrant detention facility that opened up in Artesia, New Mexico, late last month, Homeland Security officials said. "And the only thing they have are debts to pay because before leaving, they got rid of everything they had." Hernandez, who spoke as busloads of Honduran children sent back from Mexico also were expected to arrive, said she was concerned that children were being deported. Officials from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security displayed similar resolve Monday, saying the flight was a sign of future deportations. They were among a group of about 40 mothers and children deported from the United States to Honduras on a chartered flight Monday -- the first group of Central Americans sent home under stepped-up U.S. efforts to crack down on illegal immigration.
