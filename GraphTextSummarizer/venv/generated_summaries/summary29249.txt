By keeping an explosive case in a small place, the judge is already placing a lot of trust in jurors -- seven women and five men -- and they'll get clear directions on what they can and can't do, said Richard Gabriel, a jury consultant on the Casey Anthony, O.J. Simpson and Heidi Fleiss cases. Judges sometimes sequester juries while they're deliberating, and Cleland could backtrack on his decision if jurors couldn't avoid the case outside the courtroom, Hostin and Gabriel said. Jurors are from the 150,000-person county, too, as Sandusky wanted -- some of the 220 prospective jurors that reported Tuesday had ties to the case's key players, Penn State or Second Mile. Prosecutors allege the former Penn State football coach met some of his accusers through Second Mile, a charity he created for underprivileged kids. Jerry Sandusky's 'make-believe world' Sequestered jurors know they're protected from "media hordes and potential influences," which lets them focus on the evidence, instead conversations around them at the grocery store, Gabriel said.
