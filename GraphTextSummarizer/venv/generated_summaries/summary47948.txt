After nearly a decade spent learning the physical hardships that a career in the Hong Kong film industry had in-store, his first foray into film was as a stuntman on Bruce Lee films. After several attempts to translate his success in Hong Kong cinema to wider audiences in the U.S. and Europe, it was only after he made 'Rumble in the Bronx" that Hollywood took notice. His next cinematic venture to hit the screens is alongside Jet Li in "The Forbidden Kingdom," before he takes a lead role as an ambassador for the Beijing Olympics leading up to this year's Games and as one of the torch bearers when the Olympic Torch arrives in Hong Kong in May. The fact that he can now direct his own productions, however, indicates just how far he's come in a career in film that has spanned four decades. From chop socky superstar to Olympics ambassador. "You gotta change," he told Anjali Rao for Talk Asia.
