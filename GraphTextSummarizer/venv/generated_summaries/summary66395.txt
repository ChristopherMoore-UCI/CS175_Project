They are right: this gesture will curdle Japan's already sour relations with South Korea or China, and indeed has already provoked the predictable outcry. For their part, China and South Korea also remember the past in ways antagonistic to Japan. The Chinese also fear Shinzo Abe's desire to increase patriotic nationalism and to revise Japan's "peace constitution" to permit greater military assertiveness. Indeed, national remembrance in East Asia reflects that reconciliation is not a priority. China and Japan are struggling to define the rules of a region in which they are now both great powers.
