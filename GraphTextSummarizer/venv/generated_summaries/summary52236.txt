Megan Moore, a visitor program specialist at the aquarium, is excited to teach people that most sharks are not scary. Codzilla boats zip passengers around Boston's inner harbor. Out of the 900 different species of sharks and rays, Moore says, only 10 to 15 have ever been known to attack a human, mostly because they confuse people with food. Operated on amphibious vehicles from World War II, the tours take you through downtown historic Boston. -- Everyone knows Boston is a city steeped in history, but on a steamy hot summer day, one of the best places to experience the city is from the ocean or the harbor.
