"Special Agent Knapp exemplified each of the ideals of the FBI, as well as possessing those traits which define a genuine wonderful person," said Joseph Campbell, the head of the FBI's Puerto Rico Field Office. Knapp reached the 18-year-old swimmer and was assisting him, but was overcome by waves, FBI spokesman Harry Rodriguez said. -- An FBI agent drowned Thursday in Puerto Rico while trying to save a swimmer, the FBI announced Friday. The FBI says he received the 2011 FBI Director's Award for Outstanding Criminal Investigation and the 2011 Attorney General's Award for Excellence in Law Enforcement. Knapp put on his swim fins and went into the water off Playa Escondida -- Spanish for Hidden Beach -- in Fajardo, Puerto Rico.
