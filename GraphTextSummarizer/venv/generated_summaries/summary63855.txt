Slater defense attorney Daniel Horwitz said last month he was negotiating a plea deal with Queens prosecutors. " Brown initially charged Slater with reckless endangerment, criminal mischief and criminal trespass, all of which could theoretically carry a seven-year sentence in prison. -- A former JetBlue flight attendant -- who reportedly cursed a passenger over a plane's public address system, deployed the plane's emergency evacuation slide, and used it to dramatically exit a flight at JFK airport in August -- pleaded guilty to two counts of attempted criminal mischief as part of a plea deal with prosecutors. Steven Slater pleaded guilty to second-degree attempted criminal mischief, a felony, and fourth-degree attempted criminal mischief, a misdemeanor. Terms of the deal were announced and Slater entered the plea Tuesday in Queens Supreme Court.
