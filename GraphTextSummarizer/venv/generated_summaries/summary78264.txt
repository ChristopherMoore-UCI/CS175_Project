Witnesses had seen Gloria eating on the Friday and the Monday before her death in the early hours of Tuesday, January 15, the lawyer said, adding that two days without food would not have been enough for her to starve to death. -- A California couple accused in Qatar of deliberately starving their 8-year-old adopted daughter to death appeared in court Tuesday. No relatives of the Huangs' were in court Tuesday, but a handful of staff members from the U.S. Embassy in Doha were present. He said the Huangs kept Gloria locked in her room, deprived of food and water, and that a key was found on the outside of the door. He also cited testimony from one of the girl's brothers, saying the child told prosecutors that their parents used to punish Gloria for stealing food by locking her into her room.
