On Friday, Yosemite National Park in California turned heads when it announced that drones, the unmanned aircraft increasingly making their way into private hands, aren't welcome in the park, famous for its picturesque valley of towering granite cliffs, waterfalls and Giant Sequoia groves. A quick search on YouTube finds a host of of videos shot using drones at Yosemite and other national parks. "The park has experienced an increase in visitors using drones within park boundaries over the last few years," park  management said in a news release. "Drones have been witnessed filming climbers ascending climbing routes, filming views above tree-tops, and filming aerial footage of the park. The parks system says that applies to drones, though privately owned, unmanned aircraft probably weren't on anyone's mind when it was written.
