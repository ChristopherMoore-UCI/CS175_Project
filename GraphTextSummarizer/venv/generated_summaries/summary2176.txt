-- Germany captain Michael Ballack has suffered a fractured left knee cap following a heavy challenge while playing for Bayer Leverkusen against Hanover on Saturday. It is a further blow to Ballack, who missed the World Cup finals with an ankle injury and was subsequently left out of the Germany squad for this month's ties against Belgium and Azerbaijan. The visitors went into the interval with the lead courtesy of a well-taken goal from Croatian striker Srdjan Lakic. But Niko Bungert levelled after 71 minutes and Mainz collected all three points with a deflected strike from teenager Andre Schuerrle. The result means Mainz have won all their three opening matches and they stand on nine points, trailing Hoffenheim at the top only on goal difference.
