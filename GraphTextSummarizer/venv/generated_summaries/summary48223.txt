The match also saw Villa's Barca teammate Xavi Hernandez win his 100th cap for his country, becoming only the fourth Spaniard to achieve that feat after Raul, Andoni Zubizarreta and Iker Casillas. The victory was Spain's 10th in a row in competitive matches following their loss to Switzerland in their opening World Cup finals match in South Africa. David Villa has become the top scorer in Spanish international history after netting both goals as the world and European champions fought back from going a goal behind to beat the Czech Republic 2-1 in Euro 2012 Group I on Friday. But Villa levelled in the 69th minute after being put through by Andres Iniesta and he secured Spain's win from the penalty spot four minutes later after Iniesta had been fouled by Jan Rezek. Vicente Del Bosque's side have a maximum 12 points from their four group matches, with the Czechs in second place six points behind.
