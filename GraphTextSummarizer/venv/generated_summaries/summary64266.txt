Computer science is the third highest-paying bachelor degree, right behind computer engineering and chemical engineering. "Computer science is permeating every industry and every field, and its importance will only grow," said Wang. What would really help, Wang said, is if states recognized computer science as a core requirement rather than an elective. Part of the problem is that the U.S. lacks enough computer science teachers, said Wang. But even as technology becomes an integral part of most people's lives, fewer computer-science courses are being offered in high schools.
