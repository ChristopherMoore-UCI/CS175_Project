Collett said in terms of the media Hamilton's performance, friendliness, English speaking background and professionalism were key assets. "The big danger with someone like Hamilton is that he is so in demand and that he has so many sponsors it leads to brand confusion. Indeed, Schumacher set an example which Hamilton would be wise to follow. Cheliotis agreed Hamilton would earn considerably more than Schumacher, and that there would be a big gap between his earnings and that of the other drivers. Collett said Hamilton would have to be wary of bad press, but a little bit of young turk behaviour could enhance his image as long as he continued to excel.
