That may be true, but the National Association of Black Social Workers has long argued for keeping black children in black homes. In the case of a white parent adopting a black child, that might mean living in an integrated neighborhood, having pictures in the home of black heroes, seeking out other families in similar situations, attending a black church and finding role models or godparents who are black. If no white person ever adopted a black child, they'd be saying why don't white people adopt black children." But Oliver, the vice-president-elect, says when that position was written decades ago, blacks were being discounted as adoptive parents, not being given the same resources to help keep families together and thereby prevent the need for child placements, and that agencies weren't recruiting families within the community. A black child needs black parents to raise it."
