Lionel Messi's remarkable La Liga scoring streak came to an end on Sunday as Barcelona celebrated reclaiming the Spanish title with a less than convincing 2-1 win at Atletico Madrid. The victory that leaves the Catalans on course to match Real Madrid's points record from last season. "We fulfilled our objectives of winning the Ligue 1 title and going a long way in the Champions League," said Ancelotti, whose team reached the quarterfinals of Europe's top club competition before losing to Barcelona on away goals. Atletico stayed third after the defeat, but can still win a trophy this season by beating city rivals Real in next Friday's Copa del Rey final. It gave coach Carlo Ancelotti a league title in three countries, having previously won in Italy with AC Milan and in England with Chelsea, while star striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic celebrated a championship in his fifth different nation.
