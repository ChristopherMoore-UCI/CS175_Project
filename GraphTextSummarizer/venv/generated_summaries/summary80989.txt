Kokesh spent Tuesday night into Wednesday at Fairfax County Adult Detention Center in northern Virginia, U.S. Park Police spokeswoman Pamela Smith told CNN. Under Virginia law, schedule I drugs such as heroin and LSD have a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical use, and schedule II drugs such as PCP, cocaine and methamphetamine are addictive, have a high potential for abuse but have accepted medical uses. His arrest comes after authorities late Tuesday searched the suburban Washington home of Kokesh, who recently made headlines with his July Fourth video posted to YouTube in which he loaded a shotgun in the middle of the national capital's Freedom Plaza. Smith earlier told CNN that authorities had executed a search warrant on Kokesh's home in Herndon, Virginia, which is about 20 miles west of Washington. -- Iraq veteran turned pro-gun activist Adam Kokesh was arrested on two charges, including having a gun while in possession of an illicit drug, police said Wednesday.
