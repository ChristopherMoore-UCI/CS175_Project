It would still leave Greece in debt and reliant on handouts that former eurozone partners would be less willing to supply. The ECB, IMF and eurozone countries have poured money into Greece to prevent this outcome and may have to continue doing so unless another solution can be found. Many say it is impossible for Greece to drop out because the consequences would be so disastrous that eurozone economies will not allow this to happen. Bailouts of Greece, Ireland and Portugal have created backlashes in countries such as Germany where the prospect of holding up the bloc's far larger economies is economically and politically unpalatable. Greece, the country at the center of the eurozone debt crisis, pushed through a huge debt swap in March to save it from disorderly default and clear the way to receive its second bailout, worth â‚¬130 billion ($171.5 billion).
