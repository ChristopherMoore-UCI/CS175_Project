They're a mixture of innocent and malicious, and Facebook has divvied them up into three categories: duplicate accounts, misclassified accounts and "undesirable" accounts. Parents creating Facebook accounts for their young kids are violating two rules, since people under 13 are not allowed to have Facebook profiles. "On Facebook we have a really large commitment in general to finding and disabling false accounts," Facebook's chief security officer Joe Sullivan told CNN in a recent interview. Duplicate accounts make up 4.8% (45.8 million) of Facebook's total active member tally. The tallies were based on an internal sampling of accounts done by reviewers, and Facebook says the numbers may represent the actual number.
