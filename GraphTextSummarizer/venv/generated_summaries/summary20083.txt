U.S. Travel puts forward a three-pronged approach to welcoming international travelers to the United States: promoting the U.S. to international visitors, easing the process for getting visas and making the entry experience a smooth one. In an era when Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano has cautioned travelers to expect long airport security and customs lines because of worker overtime cuts and furloughs, finding the estimated $150 million to pay for those additional workers seems unlikely. Customs and Border Protection, which has developed programs in recent years to speed entry for trusted travelers who undergo prior screening, interviewed more than 25,000 travelers at U.S. airports in July and August 2012 for its second customer satisfaction survey. The U.S. Travel Association estimates that losing overseas travelers to bad experiences or word-of-mouth is costing the economy at least $95 billion in total output and more than a half million jobs across the economy. Overseas arrivals, excluding Mexico and Canada, are also up, but the United States' market share of overseas travelers has dropped from 17% in 2000 to 12% in 2011, Freeman said.
