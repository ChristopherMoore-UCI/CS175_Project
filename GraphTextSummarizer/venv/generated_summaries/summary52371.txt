In Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, Hancock County authorities ordered residents of low-lying areas to evacuate Monday evening. But he added that as of Monday afternoon, "There is nothing this storm will bring us that we are not capable of handling." Most of Katrina's nearly 1,800 deaths occurred when the protective levees around New Orleans failed, flooding the city. But New Orleans could start to feel tropical storm force winds by midnight Monday, and while Isaac may veer off its currently projected course, "It seems to be settling into a pathway and a speed that is becoming predictable," Landrieu said. New Orleans will shut its international airport after its last flight Monday night, spokesman Ryan Berni said, while smaller airports in Mississippi, Alabama and Florida also announced closures starting Tuesday. The Katina anniversary was leaving much of the Gulf Coast with "a high level of anxiety," as New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu put it Monday.
