The report, which was sent to Congress earlier this week, adds, "As a result of construction deficiencies, incomplete and undocumented design work, additional maintenance charges attributable to inadequate quality control and commissioning procedures, and unrecovered liquidated damages and interest on unauthorized advance mobilization payments, we recommend that the Department of State attempt to recover more than $132 million from First Kuwaiti." [of the embassy] in a war zone in 34 months was a significant accomplishment, considerable construction deficiencies remained because designs for the facilities had not been completed and approved and quality control and commissioning procedures were inadequate," the report says. In a report released Thursday, Acting Inspector General Harold W. Geisel lists incomplete design work, safety questions and maintenance problems that he says may continue for years. "Without a valid design and robust quality control and commissioning activities, the department cannot be assured that the NEC [new embassy compound] complies with contract and department requirements, as well as with applicable building codes," it says. -- The State Department's Inspector General's Office is criticizing both a private contractor and U.S. government officials for "considerable construction deficiencies" in the new U.S. Embassy in Iraq.
