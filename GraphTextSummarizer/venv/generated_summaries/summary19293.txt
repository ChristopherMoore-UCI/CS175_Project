The breach of privacy "is a very rare occurrence that has affected only a small number of Photobucket's users," said Photobucket spokesman David Toner. While users who post unencrypted photos on Photobucket can make their albums password protected, individual photos, even in a private album, can be shared with others through a direct web link or URL. With a Photobucket username and a list of common titles for photos, fusking software can extract images from private albums by finding patterns in the posted pictures. That may be the unfortunate lesson for those who've recently had private photos accessed and shared due to a privacy gap on the photo-sharing website Photobucket. "Privacy settings on social media sites just can't keep up with how fast technology is adapting," said Ethan Wall, a social media attorney in Miami.
