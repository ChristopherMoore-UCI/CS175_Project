Both Allegri and Milan went into the game knowing that a win was imperative after defeats in their opening games at the San Siro stadium -- against Sampdoria and Atalanta -- had led to the club's worst home start to a season in over 80 years. Having suffered a shock home defeat against Siena on Sunday, Inter responded by moving up to fourth after winning 2-0 at Chievo, thanks to goals from Alvaro Pereira and Antonio Cassano. Hamburg moved out of the bottom three after drawing 2-2 at Borussia Monchengladbach, with former Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Rafael van der Vaart opening the scoring for the visitors. There was just one game in Spain where Atletico Madrid went second in La Liga, and six points clear of city rivals Real, after winning 4-2 at Real Betis. Allegri watched from the sidelines as he served a touchline ban issued after he made heated protests to officials during Sunday's defeat at Udinese but he would have been delighted to see striker Stephan El Shaarawy grab a double -- and was further boosted by the return of Brazil's Robinho after a month-long injury.
