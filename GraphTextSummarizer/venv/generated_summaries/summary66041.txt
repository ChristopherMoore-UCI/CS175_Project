-- Iran has arrested suspects in connection with the July 2011 killing of a nuclear scientist, semiofficial media reported, citing Intelligence Minister Heidar Moslehi. His death followed bombing attacks on two other Iranian physicists in November 2010, Iranian media said. He was hanged in May. Iran has blamed spy agencies in Israel, the United States and the United Kingdom for the attacks. Ali-Mohammadi, 50, was riding his motorcycle near his Tehran home when a remote-controlled bomb planted on the bike detonated, according to Iranian media. Prosecutors accused him of working for the Mossad, Israel's national intelligence agency, and said Israel paid him $120,000 to carry out the hit.
