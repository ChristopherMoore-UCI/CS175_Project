Sure, measures such as adding lateral reinforcement to columns and adding steel reinforcements at joints between beams and columns to transfer forces will be more expensive, but they are clearly necessary. But earthquakes shake structures in two horizontal directions similar to a swinging motion, and with the slim columns and little reinforcement, the columns crumbled. There are several reasons for the widespread damage to buildings, bridges and other infrastructure. Most of the construction appears to be reinforced concrete frame but with little seismic reinforcement. A closer look at these photos shows that the amount of steel reinforcement in many cases was minimal, if it was present at all.
