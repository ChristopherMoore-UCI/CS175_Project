For Torres, it means he is now a reigning World Cup winner, European Championship winner, Champions League winner and Europa League winner -- the first for any player. But after securing Champions League football for next season and claiming the Europa League trophy, perhaps he will even be afforded a warm goodbye when he relinquishes his role after Sunday's game against Everton. There appeared little trouble when Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech threw the ball out towards Juan Mata and when he failed to take control, Fernando Torres nipped in to run at the Benfica defense and coolly slot the ball home. Benfica has now lost its past seven major European Cup finals -- all of which have come since being hit by the infamous "Bela Guttmann curse". Not even the great Eusebio, one of Benfica's most famous sons, was able to help lift the curse when he visited Guttmann's grave before Benfica's defeat in the 1990 European Cup final.
