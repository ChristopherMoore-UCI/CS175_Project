Jamie Croom, 31, was wounded in a shootout with Deputy U.S. Marshal Josie Wells. Authorities said Croom shot and killed Wells at a Baton Rouge motel. "Our deputies and law enforcement partners face untold dangers every day in the pursuit of justice in cities nationwide," said U.S. Marshals Service Director Stacia A. Hylton said in a news release. "Wells was part of a team executing arrest warrants on a fugitive wanted for double homicide in Baton Rouge," the U.S. Marshals Service said in a news release. Wells, 28, was based in Mississippi but was on temporary assignment in the Baton Rouge area, the Sun Herald newspaper said.
