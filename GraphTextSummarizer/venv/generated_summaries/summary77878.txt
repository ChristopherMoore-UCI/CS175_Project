Owner Jerry Lee created -- and patented -- his shaving machine, and more than 40 syrups are concocted in-house, in flavors ranging from standard mango to unexpected melona, a honeydew flavor. And it's definitely worth stopping by Baldwin's Sweet Shop to stock up on dried and preserved fruits flavored with li hing, a sweet-salty seasoning (98-040 Kamehameha Hwy., 808/488-0505, dried fruit from $1.50). The shrimp is harvested every morning, and there are nine variations, but the only two worth ordering are butter garlic and spicy garlic. An under-the-radar favorite is Fumi's Kahuku Shrimp Truck, about half a mile north of Kahuku (56-781 Kamehameha Hwy., fumiskahukushrimp.com, dishes from $10). The main drag of Nuuanu Avenue is now home to places like Chinatown Boardroom, an eclectic gallery and boutique (1160 Nuuanu Ave., chinatownboardroom.com).
