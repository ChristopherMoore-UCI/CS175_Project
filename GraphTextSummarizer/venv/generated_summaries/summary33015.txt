Prior to the game, former United defender Gary Neville had told United Review media that City's handsome derby victory and dramatic title had led to erroneous claims in the media. "Reports of [a power shift] misunderstood Manchester United," said the former full back. Having been crushed 6-1 at home by their long-standing rivals last season, United had been expected to not only avenge that humiliation but also confirm with a convincing display that the balance of power had definitively shifted back in their favor. Reflecting on a calmer derby in England, victorious Manchester City captain Kompany feels that his side's victory could play a pivotal role in the race for next season's English championship. Defending champions Manchester City salvaged a large chunk of pride when beating runaway Premier League leaders -- and city rivals -- Manchester United 2-1 to register consecutive wins at Old Trafford for the first time in 41 years.
