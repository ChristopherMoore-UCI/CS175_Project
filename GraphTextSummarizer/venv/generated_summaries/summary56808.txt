And facing a growing deficit and a fight to pass an income tax hike, Columbus Police on Tuesday announced massive budget cuts that could mean hundreds of layoffs. Despite optimistic national headlines on March 6, the day of the president's trip, city officials warned the influx of federal stimulus money wasn't going to be enough to end their financial crisis. They were to be laid off before their first day of patrol, victims of city budget cuts, until the stimulus money saved the class. The challenges, including a city deficit that could reach $120 million, would mean the loss of 324 officers, more than 15 percent of the force, under a budget unveiled by Chief Walter Distelzweig. "By itself, this recovery plan won't turn our economy around or solve every problem," he said then, and "this police force still faces budget challenges down the road."
