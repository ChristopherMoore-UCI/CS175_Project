When I heard Maurice Sendak had died, I pulled my copy of "Little Bear" off the shelf and I turned to the third story in the book and I looked at that picture of Little Bear in his makeshift helmet headed to the moon I was studying the third story in the book, which is titled "Little Bear Goes To The Moon," and I was staring at a picture of Little Bear, home-made space helmet atop his head, floating toward the moon. I was holding "Little Bear." The first book I read by myself was Else Holmelund Minarik's "Little Bear." I flipped through the pages and came to a picture of Little Bear floating above a village.
