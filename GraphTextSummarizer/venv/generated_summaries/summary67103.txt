" Pastor Eddie Long had planned to travel to Miami for the installation of a new pastor at Sweet Home Missionary Baptist Church this weekend, spokeswoman Beverly Rodrigues said. Parris -- a former church employee and personal assistant to Long -- filed one of four lawsuits last week accusing the Baptist televangelist of coercing young male church members into having sex with him. " Speaking from the pulpit of his New Birth Missionary Baptist Church Sunday, Long said he would fight the allegations, but did not address specific accusations. It says Parris left the church in late 2009, "disillusioned, confused and angry about his relationship with Defendant Long." Parris joined New Birth Missionary Baptist Church in 2001, when he was 14. The lawsuits accuse Long of using his power and influence within the 25,000-member church to lure young male church members into sexual relationships.
