"Michael's conduct was serious and required significant consequences," USA Swimming Executive Director Chuck Wielgus said Monday in a written statement. -- USA Swimming on Monday suspended Michael Phelps, the most decorated Olympian ever, for six months and said he won't be on next year's U.S. team at the world championships. "We are grateful that nobody was hurt and appreciate the speed at which USA Swimming and Michael took action." The organization said Phelps, who was charged with DUI last week in Maryland, had violated its code of conduct. The chief executive officer of the United States Olympic Committee said he thought the sanctions were appropriate, "And we are glad that Michael is seeking help," Scott Blackmun said in a news release.
