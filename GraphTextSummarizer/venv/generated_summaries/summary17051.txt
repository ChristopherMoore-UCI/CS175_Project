In an interview published Saturday, Prime Minister George Papandreou said the election is a high-stakes test for his ruling Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK), according to ANA, the official news agency. The Greek prime minister may call for early general elections in December if his ruling party loses local elections Sunday, the nation's official news agency said. If it defeats the ruling party in the local elections, it may undermine the economic reforms spearheaded by Papandreou and his government. The ruling party will compete with the conservative opposition party New Democracy. "All they care about is to be able to say on the night of the elections that PASOK was defeated and that, therefore, the effort we are making to extricate the country from the great impasse has been defeated.
