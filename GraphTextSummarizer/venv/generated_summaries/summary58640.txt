In P90X, there's variety in fitness with muscle confusion, and the goal is for people to get through the whole 90 days so they have real success and real results. A lot of people have friends and family and coworkers and neighbors that look different, that act different, that feel different, that have more energy, that sleep better, that are off their meds [because of P90X]. We can put the before-and-after pictures in the infomercial — and these are real people who submit their photos to us — but when it's people you know in your life and you see how different they are, how much happier they are, how much more fit they are — that's the selling point. Whether you're pleased or peeved by Mitt Romney's pick for running mate, Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan, there's no denying that the politician is a model of good health. P90X's core training technique relies on "muscle confusion," which Paul Ryan credits for its success.
