Last month in Oklahoma City a drone came within 20 feet of striking a plane, forcing the aircraft to take evasive action, according to FAA reports obtained by Sen. Diane Feinstein. " Earlier this year the FAA issued waivers to allow seven motion picture companies to use drones. "Unmanned aircraft offer a tremendous opportunity to spur innovation and economic activity by enabling many businesses to develop better products and services for their customers and the American public," Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said in a press release on Wednesday. The U.S. Government is expanding the number of commercial companies that can legally use unmanned aerial systems, often called UAVs or drones, but efforts to safely integrate them into the national airspace are not moving fast enough for some lawmakers. In a congressional hearing Wednesday lawmakers criticized the pace of the FAA's efforts to integrate the drones into the national airspace.
