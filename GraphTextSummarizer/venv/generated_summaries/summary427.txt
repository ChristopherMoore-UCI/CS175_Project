In August, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch profiled Sedlacek in an article on Lyme disease, and quoted his mother, Ruth Abernathy, as saying he began acting strangely during his junior year in high school. She said a doctor had diagnosed Sedlacek as mentally ill before a battery of tests revealed that he had Lyme disease, according to the paper. Watch Melton say they're "still very stunned" Â» Winters stopped his sermon and asked the man what he could do for him, Melton said. He also was charged with two counts of aggravated battery related to the stabbing of church members Terry Bullard and Keith Melton. A spokesman for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Monday that mental illness associated with Lyme disease is highly unusual, and the Infectious Diseases Society of America said Lyme disease "is not known to cause violent behavior."
