Southern, who is also the target of two lawsuits, has $7.7 million in assets, the complaint said, and he moved $6.5 million from his Wells Fargo bank account into an annuity account with Jackson National Life Insurance Company, Inc. Nausea, headaches, rashes Complaint: False impression Southern lied under oath, saying he had just taken on leadership responsibilities at Freedom only days before the spill, FBI Special Agent James Lafferty wrote in the complaint. A month after the spill, tap water tests in 10 homes detected MCHM still in the water supply, albeit at levels within the state's legal limit. "...Southern's goal in making the false and/or deceptive statement is to protect his assets from legal judgments that may result from lawsuits...," the complaint said. MCHM is not directly lethal but can cause nausea, vomiting, dizziness, headaches, diarrhea and skin rashes.
