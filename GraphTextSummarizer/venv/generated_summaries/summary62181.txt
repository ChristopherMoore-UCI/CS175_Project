Giant paintings of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi stare down at them from hotel walls. In March, Eman al-Obeidy, stormed the hotel in tears while journalists were having breakfast and said Gadhafi forces had raped her. But armed Gadhafi loyalists ring the hotel's perimeter and patrol its corridors, barring most journalists there from leaving. His sudden appearance, and the fact that the hotel is now being guarded so closely, has led to some speculation that Gadhafi himself is there, or that he has access to the hotel through secret tunnels from his bunker. But Chance said he and other journalists had "scoured" the hotel "from top to bottom" and had seen no evidence of tunnels.
