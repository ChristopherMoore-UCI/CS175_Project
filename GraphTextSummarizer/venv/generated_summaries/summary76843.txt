Air France offers obese passengers booking a second seat up to 33 percent off the ticket price, depending on the type of seat and availability. The Federal Aviation Administration does not regulate seat width, but it does require passengers be able to sit belted and with both arm rests down to comply with safety standards.

This makes traveling in tight spaces vexing for airlines trying to bolster profits by selling the maximum number of seats.
