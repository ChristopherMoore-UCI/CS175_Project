Nicholas Smit, 40, is being held on allegations of making a booby trap, assault with intent to murder a police officer and possession of a firearm while on bail, Hemet Police Chief Richard Dana said Saturday. Hemet is one of eight local, state and federal agencies that make up the Riverside County Gang Task Force, which was formed in 2006 to address the growth of criminal street gangs and outlaw motorcycle gangs. Authorities have not been able to directly connect the attacks to a particular gang or organized crime, Dana said, even though most of the attacks have targeted members of an organized crime task force. The arrests came after police served search warrants on the men's homes in Hemet and Homeland on Friday night, Dana said. -- Two men have been arrested in California in connection with a string of brazen attacks in the past six months thought to be targeting law enforcement.
