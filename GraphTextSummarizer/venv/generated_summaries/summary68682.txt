Watch: Neil Diamond Leads 'Sweet Caroline' Singalong at Fenway The Boston Marathon bombing was the most recent in a series of tragedies including the shootings in Aurora, Colorado, and Newtown, Connecticut. Though a native New Yorker, Neil Diamond has become an inspirational figure in the city of Boston's recovery from the bombings at the Boston Marathon last week. When we spoke to him at the end of the week he said, "I spent the whole day recording it and I will spend tomorrow recording it. "It's like an infestation, and I'm writing about the general situation, not just about this bombing in Boston, but what we're going through with all of these tragedies -- shootings and so on and so forth," he says.
