-- Sen. Barack Obama's choice for running mate will be announced to supporters in a text message Saturday morning, senior Obama campaign officials told CNN on Friday night, and a senior party official said it won't be Sen. Hillary Clinton. Other big names thought to be in the running included retired Gen. Wesley Clark, Sen. Chris Dodd of Connecticut, Sen. Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, former Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia, Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson and Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius. Watch Obama say he's made his choice Â» Clinton re-entered the running mate conversation this week after a poll indicating that nearly half of her supporters have yet to embrace Obama. Also, sources close to Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine said he has been informed he was not selected. Obama called some people on his short list for the vice presidential slot Thursday night to tell them he had not selected them as a running mate, a highly placed Democratic Party source said.
