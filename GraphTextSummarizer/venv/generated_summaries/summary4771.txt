You can still flag comments that violate our community guidelines, and moderators will take appropriate action. -- If you've been reading the comments on CNN stories, you've probably noticed that things look a little bit different. It's also easier to share comments on Twitter, Facebook and other social networks so you can see what your friends and followers have to say about a story. One thing that won't change is that CNN will be listening to what you want to tell us, whether it's in the comments, on social media or on CNN iReport. We've found that we have users who are experts on almost every imaginable topic -- from nuclear physics to grammar to where to get the best sandwich in St. Louis on a Tuesday night.
