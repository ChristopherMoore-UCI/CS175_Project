Although working conditions for many Americans have vastly improved since the 1930s and citizens can count on certain basic provisions upon their retirement, current economic conditions have created the same kind of despair captured by Chaplin in this film. Ultimately, many Americans did experience better lives when the New Deal stabilized conditions and increased government spending in World War II helped stimulate the economy. The U.S. has fallen behind in many sectors of the economy such as clean energy and is even starting to feel competition in once-dominant sectors such as science. Innovation and public-private partnerships resulted in a vibrant period for the American economy during the 1950s and 1960s, one that the historian James Patterson has characterized as an era of "Grand Expectations." Public policy, as many scholars have shown, has combined with globalization to undercut the security that many Americans had enjoyed in the post-World War II era, at the same time that income inequality has vastly increased.
