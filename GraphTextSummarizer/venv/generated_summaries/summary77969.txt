The Serie A side made hard work of the victory against Serie B opponents, despite cruising into a 2-0 lead thanks to goals from Andre Dias and Tommaso Rocchi. Jose Mourinho's side, who beat rivals Barcelona in the 2011 final, scored the only goal of the game through Karim Benzema. And in France, two-time defending League Cup champions Marseille made it through to the semifinals with a 3-0 win over Caen. Real Madrid are also enjoying success in the league and sit five points clear of European champions Barcelona. Verona pulled level through Emanuele Berrettoni and Marco D'Alessandro before Brazilian Hernanes sealed Lazio's win with a stoppage-time free-kick.
