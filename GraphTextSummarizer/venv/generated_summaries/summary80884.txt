A judge cleared the way for auction with a ruling in 2004 that Welles never signed the academy's agreement not to sell the trophy, according to Nate D. Sanders Auctions spokesman Sam Heller. An attempt to sell it at auction in 2007 failed to draw a buyer, Heller said. The academy, which aggressively challenges efforts to sell Oscar trophies, was successful three years ago in stopping the sale of two Oscars awarded to silent film star Mary Pickford. The Oscar given Orson Welles for "Citizen Kane" some 70 years ago sold for $861,542 in an online auction that ended Tuesday, a Los Angeles auction house said. Nate D. Sanders Auctions did not identify the winning bidder, but the company did reveal that illusionist David Copperfield was an unsuccessful bidder.
