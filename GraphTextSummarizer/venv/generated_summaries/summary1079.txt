Meaning "we can make it happen" in Swahili, Rajani established the non-profit organization in 2009 with the goal of empowering people through information and building an "ecosystem of change" for themselves. And that also if we are going to fully benefit from the potential we have in Africa it will need skilled people. Rajani believes that people need to focus the minds of politicians by highlighting the issues that need to be amended. "We are forced to have thoughts for ourselves, we are forced to question, we are forced to analyze what is going on, and in the end what we are also beginning to realize is that we can complain all we want and nothing much will happen or we can take responsibility in making things happen, of co-shaping life, and I think that's what's happening," says Rajani.
