Opinion: Candidates, stop vying to be debate underdog Despite all kinds of interesting experiments during the primaries, including questions from the audience via Twitter and inviting real-time feedback that moderators occasionally inserted into the live debate conversation, the commission is rolling out a quasi-interactive online tool that is bound to leave the public wanting much more. Instead of just creating an online playpen for a parallel but essentially disconnected national conversation about the debates, the commission could have built on work done during the primaries to capture and reflect public responses to the actual candidate responses, in real time. A week ago, the debate commission announced "The Voice Of...," a digital platform that will be deployed on special landing pages hosted by Google, Yahoo and AOL to "give people throughout the country the opportunity to share their voice." In the town-hall-style debate, they also agreed that "Audience members shall not ask follow-up questions or otherwise participate in the extended discussion, and the audience members' microphone shall be turned off after he or she completes asking the question."
