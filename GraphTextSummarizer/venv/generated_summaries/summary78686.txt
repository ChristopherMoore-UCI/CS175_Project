Tap the three dots below the tweet and select "Remove tag from photo." People who have their Twitter accounts set to private can only tag people who follow them, and the default privacy setting for protected accounts is to not allow people to tag them in images at all. Facebook has offered photo tagging features for a long time and Instagram added its own photo-tagging option last year. Previously, you could work around Twitter's lack of image tags by just mentioning people from the photo in the tweet itself. The default setting for the photo tagging is "Allow anyone to tag me in photos." -- Twitter announced Wednesday that it's adding new photo tagging and collage features.
