-- Fueled by a close call on a runway two years ago involving a U.S. senator, general aviation pilots will soon have increased leverage when facing FAA disciplinary action under a bill awaiting President Barack Obama's signature. Supporters of the "Pilot's Bill of Rights" say the new measure passed by the House and Senate gives general aviation pilots the ability to fight charges levied against them by FAA officials. "This bill remedies many of the most serious deficiencies in the relationship between general aviation and the FAA, and ensures that pilots are, like everyone else, treated in a fair and equitable manner by the justice system," Inhofe said after the bill passed by voice vote in the House. Previously, pilots could only appeal FAA findings to an NTSB administrative law judge. Pilots have argued that current FAA medical forms are easily misunderstood, resulting in those who are under investigation being accused of falsifying the documents.
