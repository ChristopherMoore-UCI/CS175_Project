The last three defendants prosecuted in the hazing death of Florida A&M drum major Robert Champion were convicted Friday of manslaughter and hazing with the result of death, reported CNN affiliate WFTV. A total of 15 defendants were charged originally, but most took plea deals, WFTV reported. A jury deliberated about 2Â½ hours before returning guilty verdicts against Benjamin McNamee, 25; Aaron Golson, 22; and Darryl Cearnel, 28. They will be sentenced June 26, according to Orange County, Florida, online court records. The initiation required pledges to run down the center of the bus while being punched, kicked and assaulted by senior members, band members have said.
