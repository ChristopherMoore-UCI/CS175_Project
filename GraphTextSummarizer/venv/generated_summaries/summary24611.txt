So far, 336 air missions have been flown, including 108 strikes against Libyan military targets, since Friday. The aircraft were on a mission to attack Libyan air defense systems. -- When a U.S. Air Force fighter jet crashed Monday during a mission over Libya, it quickly set off a chain of events on four continents involving at least nine aircraft and a platoon of Marines. As the pilot was being rescued, the weapons systems officer was found by Libyan anti-Gadhafi rebels. At about the same time, a KC-130 tanker took off from an air base at Sigonella, Sicily, in case the Harriers or other aircraft needed to refuel in midair during the rescue mission.
