Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano told CNN on Saturday that the plan to send the explosives has the "hallmarks of al Qaeda, the AQAP -- they are constantly trying things to test our system." Yemen has asked for outside help to thwart terror groups, but the country, the ancestral home of Osama bin Laden, is still used for operations, U.S. officials say. Believing that a Yemen affiliate of al Qaeda was involved, American and British authorities said explosive devices jammed into ink toner cartridges were powerful enough to bring down a large aircraft. The group is based in Yemen, a poor Arab nation that has emerged as a major operating base for al Qaeda and other terror groups. " Officials are checking on packages sent from Yemen over the past several weeks, King said. "The thinking is it's the same person or group of people that built the underwear bomb because of the way it's put together," said the official, who had been briefed by multiple U.S. authorities and law enforcement sources.
