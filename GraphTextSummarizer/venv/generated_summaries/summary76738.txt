The top cop in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, escaped a "sneak attack" by gunmen early Thursday while on patrol in the city, the Juarez mayor told reporters. On the job for barely three months, the new police chief of Ciudad Juarez -- the globally recognized hot spot in Mexico's drug wars -- predicted bold changes in his new border home and said confidentially during the interview: "The police will regain the city. The gunmen were carrying out extortion on a local business when Leyzaola's patrol coincidentally came across the incident, according to Juarez Mayor Hector "Teto" Murguia. As long as necessary," Leyzaola said in an interview earlier this month with CNN in Juarez. " "The municipal police is still standing ... and will continue fighting," Murguia said after the attack.
