Sheriff Lupe Trevino told CNN affiliate KRGV that his deputies are "dealing with a crime scene from hell." Gunmen opened fire at an illegal cockfighting ring in southern Texas early Thursday morning, killing three people and wounding at least eight, the Hidalgo County sheriff's office told CNN. The injured were taken to hospitals in the area, sheriff's communication supervisor Gloria Felix told CNN. CNN's Scott Thompson contributed to this report. The site, a ranch near the city of Elsa, hosted a sophisticated cockfighting operation complete with concession stands and bleachers, the sheriff told KRGV.
