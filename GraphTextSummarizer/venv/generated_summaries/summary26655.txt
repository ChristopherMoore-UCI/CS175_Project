In the past, Morsi has called for banning women and non-Muslims from running for president. -- The Egyptian uprising, launched by young liberals hoping to bring freedom, democracy and equality to their country, has finally produced a new president. He says he will preserve all international agreements, implying peace with Israel, and has made a commitment to democracy, saying "there is no such thing" as "Islamic democracy." It all sounds good, and tens of millions of Egyptians, along with millions more around the world, hope he is sincere. Morsi's words must be followed closely, but they must be matched against his actions, especially in the longer term, when the cameras leave Tahrir Square, the place where Egypt's revolution started with calls for real democracy and equality. In parliamentary elections this year, Brotherhood candidates won 10 million votes, almost 40% of the total.
