-- A suicide bomber detonated explosives outside the Mogadishu office of Somalian Prime Minister Abdi Farah Shirdon on Tuesday, his spokesman said. When he accepted the position, Shirdon told the parliament that his government will do more to ensure the security of the country and to fight against terrorism and piracy. Shirdon, an economist who used to run an import business in neighboring Kenya, was named prime minister in October. Somalia plunged into chaos after dictator Mohamed Siad Barre was overthrown 21 years ago. No one claimed responsibility for the attack and it was unclear if Shirdon was in his office during the time of the attack.
