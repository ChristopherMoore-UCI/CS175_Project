-- Football superstar David Beckham has condemned controversial comments made by Sepp Blatter, who is refusing to stand down as FIFA president despite widespread criticism. " When asked by CNN's Pedro Pinto if racism exists on the field of play, Blatter said: "I would deny it. But on Friday he insisted he would not accept demands that he resign from anti-racism campaigners, England's players' association chief Gordon Taylor and UK Prime Minister David Cameron. Former England international Ian Wright revealed on Friday that he now cannot host the prestigious FIFA Ballon D'Or awards ceremony in January due to his anger at Blatter's comments. " Blatter, in his fourth term as president after standing unopposed in July's election, has apologized for offending people.
