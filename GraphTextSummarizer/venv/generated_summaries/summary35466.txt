All four "BRIC" countries are boosting their nuclear power production, with India aiming to supply 25% and Russia 45% of their electricity from nuclear power by 2050, and Brazil planning to build five new reactors by 2030. -- It's been three years since Japan was hit with its worst-ever earthquake, causing serious damage to Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. Both France, which has the world's highest share of nuclear power for its electricity production, and the U.S., the world's largest producer, reaffirmed their positions on the power source. This was despite a national referendum in which a majority of people voted in favor of more reactors.
