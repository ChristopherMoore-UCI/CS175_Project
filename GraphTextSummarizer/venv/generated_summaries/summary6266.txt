-- A British-owned cargo ship on Monday became the latest vessel to be seized by Somali pirates in the Gulf of Aden. International naval patrols have been stepped up in the Gulf of Aden following increased pirate attacks. "There have not yet been communications from the Malaspina Castle that we are aware of, so information is limited," said Andrew Mwangura of the Seafarers' Assistance Program in quotes carried by the Telegraph. Last year, pirates attacked nearly 100 vessels and hijacked as many as 40 off Somalia, according to the International Maritime Bureau. The vessel, which is operated by an Italian company, carried a crew of 24, from Bulgaria, Ukraine, Russia and the Philippines, Britain's Telegraph newspaper reported.
