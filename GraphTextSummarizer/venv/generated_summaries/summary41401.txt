-- A suicide bomber hit an African Union Mission in Somalia convoy on Monday, killing 16 people, Lower Shabelle Gov. Adukadir Mohamed Sidi said. Al-Shabaab names successor to slain leader; Somalia on alert CNN's Faith Karimi, Jason Hanna and Michael Pearson contributed to this report. The Al-Shabaab terrorist group claimed responsibility for the attack and said Americans and South Africans were among those killed. Sidi said the explosion destroyed two buses traveling behind the military convoy, which was transporting the governor as he traveled back from Mogadishu. The group appointed a new leader last week and said Godane's death would not stop its attacks.
