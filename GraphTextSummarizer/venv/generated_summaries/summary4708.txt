The roller coaster will reopen with new safety measures in place, Six Flags Over Texas said in a statement Tuesday, including redesigned restraint bar pads, new seat belts and a coaster seat at the ride's entrance for visitors to test their fit before they get in line. "Customers of the park expect mock scares and delighted screams as they ride the Texas Giant roller-coaster, but they certainly do not expect to be placed in any real danger, whatsoever." Opinion: Death by 'amusement' Six Flags spokeswoman Sandra Daniels responded in a statement Thursday, "While our thoughts and prayers remain with Ms. Esparza's family and friends, there are a number of inaccuracies contained in the recent lawsuit and we intend to defend ourselves vigorously." Police: No foul play seen in roller coaster death Texas state officials have approved the reopening of the ride, the statement said, adding that it had undergone extensive testing. As park officials trumpeted the ride's reopening, Esparza's family filed a civil wrongful-death lawsuit Tuesday, accusing Six Flags of negligence.
