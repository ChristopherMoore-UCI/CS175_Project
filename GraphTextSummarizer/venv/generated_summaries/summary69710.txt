Shane Bauer, Sarah Shourd and Josh Fattal were detained July 31 after reportedly straying into Iran while hiking in northern Iraq. They set out to hike in northern Iraq's Kurdistan region with a fourth friend, Shon Meckfessel, who has said he had a cold and decided to stay behind that day. " An undated family photo shows Sarah Shourd, one of three U.S. hikers detained in Iran since July 31. The Americans entered northern Iraq from Turkey on July 28 during a planned five-day hike.
