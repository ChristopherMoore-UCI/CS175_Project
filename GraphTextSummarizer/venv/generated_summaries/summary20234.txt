Unlike Obama's previous India visit in 2010, Pakistan was not a focus -- at least in public statements. And maybe, just maybe, India and the U.S. may move a little closer to forming the "defining partnership" that Obama first promised in 2010. U.S. President Barack Obama became the first American chief guest at the parade. Modi announced progress had been made on negotiations over a civil nuclear deal -- a new 10-year defense cooperation agreement between the two countries was announced -- which may have far-reaching consequences for both sides on sharing intelligence and military education, and there was much talk about boosting bilateral trade from its current level of around $100 billion a year to $500 billion by 2025. But most Indians will focus on the fact that Obama is the first sitting American president to visit India twice.
