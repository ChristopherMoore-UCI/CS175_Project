Draw puts Inter into Italian Cup final Midfielder Andrea Cossu pulled a goal back before halftime, but veteran midfielder Clarence Seedorf sealed victory in the 77th minute to put Milan nine points clear of second-placed city rivals Inter. Milan wrapped up the Serie A title last weekend but were denied a place in the Coppa Italia final following a 2-1 defeat by Palermo in the second leg of the semi on Tuesday. Brazilian Hernanes scored twice in the second half after goals from Giuseppe Biava and Tommaso Rocchi to lift the Rome side a point above Udinese, who visit 12th-placed Chievo on Sunday. The Nerazzurri, whose five-year title reign is over after failing to repeat the heroics of last season's treble, travel to third-placed Napoli on Sunday. Lille, who have a four-point lead over Marseille with three matches to play in Ligue 1, then saw Mathieu Debuchy's injury-time penalty save by Gregory Coupet.
