Massoud had a reputation as a fierce nationalist who would not allow any outside group -- the Russians, Pakistan, the Taliban, even the United States -- to control Afghanistan, says Zieba Shorish-Shamley, an Afghan native and founder of the Women's Alliance for Peace and Human Rights in Afghanistan. After the Soviet army left Afghanistan, various Afghan resistance leaders cobbled together a coalition government to run the country. Today, Massoud is a national hero in Afghanistan, but he's also become something else: the prototype for the tough but enlightened leader Afghanistan desperately needs today, some Afghans say. Watch how images of Massoud are everywhere in Afghanistan Massoud had a reputation for integrity and strength, says Junger, who traveled to Afghanistan in 2000 to profile Massoud for his book, "Fire." "He would have been very hard for the warlords to intimidate," Junger says.
