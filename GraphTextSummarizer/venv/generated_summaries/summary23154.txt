However, Hillsborough County Sheriff David Gee said the investigation and information specifically led authorities to the area after they began to believe that he might be dead because of "sinister means and motives." "Our indications were it would be there," Gee said Thursday night. Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd said that when his investigation began, authorities had hoped to find Shakespeare alive "and he truly had just wanted to hide from those who were asking him for money." "As our investigation continued, the information we developed led us to believe he may very well have ended up with an untimely death," Judd said. -- Police have identified human remains found buried under recently added concrete at a home in Plant City, Florida, as missing lottery millionaire Abraham Shakespeare, police said Friday. A year later, he won a court challenge from a fellow trucker who accused Shakespeare of snatching the winning ticket out of his wallet while the two were delivering meat to Miami restaurants. Shakespeare's family reported him missing November 9, telling the Polk County sheriff's office that they hadn't seen him since April.
