However, having been diagnosed in the very early stages of the illness, the risk to others is considered extremely low." Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland's head of government, led a meeting of the Scottish Government Resilience Committee "to ensure all necessary steps are being taken," and she spoke with British Prime Minister David Cameron, NHS Scotland said. "The patient is a health care worker who was helping to combat the disease in West Africa" and returned from Sierra Leone late Sunday night, the Scottish health agency NHS Scotland said. She added, "Scotland's NHS has proved it is well able to cope with infectious diseases in the past, such as swine flu, and I am confident we will be able to respond effectively again." "Scotland has been preparing for this possibility from the beginning of the outbreak in West Africa and I am confident that we are well prepared," Sturgeon said in the statement. The patient was working with Save the Children at an Ebola treatment center in Sierra Leone, according to Michael von Bertele, humanitarian director at that organization.
