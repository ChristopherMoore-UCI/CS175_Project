Thomas Fuller describes scene in Bangkok Fuller and other journalists were interviewing the general -- better known as Seh Daeng -- in makeshift barricades that protesters have set up in downtown Bangkok. The United Front for Democracy (UDD) has turned the posh commercial center of Bangkok into a makeshift fortress, as they continue to demand that Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva dissolve the lower house of Parliament and call new elections. Send your images, video Fuller said he was just inside the barricades when he was interviewing Seh Daeng. Seh Daeng did not appear to be armed or have bodyguards but was dressed in camouflage jacket and a floppy hat, Fuller said. Seh Daeng -- or Red Commander -- is a controversial public figure, even within the protest movement, Fuller said.
