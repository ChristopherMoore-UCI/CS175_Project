Congressional Republicans have vowed to make a TRIA extension one of the first orders of business when the GOP-led Congress convenes in early January. "If we change the bill, it's gone," said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, arguing that any amendment to the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, or TRIA, would require sending the bill back to the House of Representatives, which is on vacation until January 6. In what may be his final act, retiring Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Oklahoma, insisted on changes to a bill reauthorizing a federal terrorism insurance program created after the September 11 terrorist attacks. The law was approved shortly after 9/11 to help insurance companies mitigate the costs of covering the aftermath of terrorist attacks. Called the National Association of Registered Agents and Brokers Reform Act, it would create a federal bureaucracy built to license insurance agents.
