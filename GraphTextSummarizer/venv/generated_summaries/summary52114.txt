The "Star Wars" franchise will get two spinoff movies, Disney chief executive officer Bob Iger announced Tuesday. The release of 3-D versions of "Star Wars" Episodes II and III, previously planned for next fall, have been postponed while Lucasfilm focuses on new episodes, executives announced last week. Abrams has experience with movies in blockbuster franchises. The announcement comes three months after Disney bought Lucasfilm for $4 billion and just days after it revealed that J.J. Abrams has been signed to direct the next "Star Wars" episode. The two films, if they make it out of development, will be released after Episode VII, which Iger said is on target for summer 2015.
