Shooting turns movie into surreal horror "A single individual, unaware of events in Colorado, tweeted a comment that is being completely taken out of context," NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam said in a comment issued to CNN. NRA will not have any further comment until all the facts are known." Online, Twitter users rushed to criticize the post as insensitive, since it followed the overnight shooting at a theater in Aurora, Colorado, during a showing of the new Batman movie. Weekend plans?" That tweet was posted at 9:20 a.m. ET on Friday by an account for "American Rifleman," the official NRA journal. Theater shooting unfolds in real time on social media Perhaps NRA should read news before tweeting," @ambermac wrote on Twitter.
