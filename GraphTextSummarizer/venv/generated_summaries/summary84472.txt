"The Haunting in Connecticut" is based on the true story of Sara Campbell, a mother who moves her family into an old house in Connecticut in order to be closer to the hospital where her son, Matt (Kyle Gallner), receives cancer treatment. I think horror movies are so popular because times are especially hard and I think a horror movie more than any other kind of movie is a true escape ... But Virginia Madsen, who plays Sara Campbell in the film, confessed that, while filming, fear was not just reserved for the screen. In "The Haunting in Connecticut," Virginia Madsen sees strange things happen in her old house. Madsen, 47, is probably best known for her Oscar-nominated turn in "Sideways" as Maya Randall, the restaurant waitress who gets involved in a romance with the prickly writer played by Paul Giamatti.
