David Bird, the 52-year-old twin brother of alleged shooter Derrick Bird, was found dead at his home in the English village of Lamplugh, police said. Meanwhile, a taxi driver shot in the back during Wednesday's killing spree has described how he watched Bird shoot dead another driver, Darren Rewcastle, at point blank range. Police also released a map tracing the route that suspect Derrick Bird, 52, is believed to have traveled on his rampage through the region on Wednesday. "Officers and staff are conducting forensic evidential searches and tests across the area at each location." "What happened [on Wednesday] was unthinkable and is without doubt the most horrific incident I have seen in my 25 year long policing career," said Cumbria Chief Constable Craig Mackey. Goulding noted that Bird drove a silver Citroen Picasso, which was used during Wednesday's shooting spree.
