United, who claim to have 333 million followers worldwide, will begin a new sponsorship deal with American insurance giants Aon Corporation next season that will bring in $34 million a year over four years, 50% more than its current deal with AIG. Forbes tallied income from revenue streams including broadcast deals, sponsorship and ticket sales. "The club has really established itself as one of the top brands in world sport," Peter Schwartz, a business sports writer for Forbes, said in a statement. Juventus and Olympic Marseille had the two biggest increases in value - each gaining 9% on the previous year. Reigning Spanish and European champions Barcelona were fourth, followed by the trio of Bayern Munich, Liverpool and AC Milan, who have 16 European Cups between them.
