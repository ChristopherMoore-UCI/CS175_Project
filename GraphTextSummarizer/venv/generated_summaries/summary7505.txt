Amnesty International said Dominican police interviewed by the organization denied torture allegations and argued that the number of deaths corresponds with police efforts to stop crime. Speaking to CNN before the organization released its report, National Police spokesman Col. Maximo Aybar said police in the Dominican Republic were committed to protecting the public. Tough conditions for policing are no excuse for human rights abuses, said Amnesty International, which said the nation must reform its police force to increase accountability and stop human rights violations. A spokeswoman for Amnesty International said the organization does not have comparable figures for other nations. In the Dominican Republic, the 977 people injured by police in 2010 accounted for 16.6% of violent injuries in the nation that year, according to Amnesty's report.
