"When thanked by the Ambassador for Oman's ongoing advice to Iran to work with the West, YbA offered Oman as both an organizer and a venue for any meeting the U.S. would want with Iran - if kept quiet," the cable said. That's why they feel that they can have a special relationship with Iran." Oman is separated from other Gulf states by the long and largely impenetrable Al Hajar mountain range. Sultan Qaboos, who has ruled Oman for more than 40 years, has gone to great lengths to strike a balance in relations with Iran -- Oman's neighbor across the Strait of Hormuz -- and his traditional allies in the west, especially the UK and U.S. A U.S. diplomatic cable from 2010 published by WikiLeaks described Oman's perspective this way: "Although they do not find the threat imminent, Iran is Oman's number one strategic threat; however, the GoO fundamentally believes the threat can be mitigated through careful management of the relationship." One example of that management is the recent establishment of a joint Oman-Iran investment company.
