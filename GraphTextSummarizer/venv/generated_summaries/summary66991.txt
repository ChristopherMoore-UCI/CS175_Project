Kim Jong Nam, the eldest son, is the half-brother of Kim Jong Un, the new leader of North Korea. "He wants North Korea to embrace economic reform and open its doors." Kim Jong Nam painted a picture of a father who was strict but was often warm-hearted to his eldest son, Gomi said, especially on special occasions. Those three reasons are why he thinks he'll fail." Kim Jong Nam is the most public of Kim Jong Il's sons, known primarily for his blunders and semi-exile from North Korea. Kim Jong Nam believes his brother won't have the power to push through reforms, Gomi said. "He spoke out against his father's 'military first' policy," says Gomi, countering widely held notions that the Disneyland debacle caused Kim Jong Nam to fall out of favor with his father.
