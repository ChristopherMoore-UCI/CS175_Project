The safety board said it is concerned about the repeatability of tests that induce thermal runaways in batteries, and said researchers have found that current test methods "might not reliably produce failure effects as severe as those observed" in the real-world failures. Boeing announces changes to Dreamliner battery system Aviation authorities find no big problems at Dreamliner's battery maker Thermal runaways typically result in smoke, a known concern when the FAA approved the Dreamliner battery. In the first incident, a maintenance worker entered the aft electronics bay of Japan Airlines Dreamliner parked at Boston Logan airport on January 7, 2013, and found heavy smoke and a small 3-inch flame coming from the battery housing. Batteries should be tested in conditions that closely resemble the conditions on planes, the safety board said.
