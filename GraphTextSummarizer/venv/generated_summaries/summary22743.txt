Then came along the DNI (Director of National Intelligence) in 2005 --  a product of intelligence reform following the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the failure to find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Initially, Panetta said he reported to the DNI and performed the tasks assigned to him by the DNI, but then he added: "we are an operational arm, just like the [National Security Agency], just like the [National Reconnaissance Office], and I believe the role of the DNI is to coordinate all our activities..." Well, the NSA and the NRO are part of the Defense Department and report directly to the Defense Secretary, not the DNI. Outgoing CIA Director Mike Hayden recently told reporters there is natural tension between the CIA and DNI, but it's "not a bad structure." Dennis Blair, left, was picked to be director of national intelligence and Leon Panetta to head the CIA. Sen. Carl Levin, D-Michigan, wanted to know Panetta's understanding of the relationship between the CIA and the DNI.
