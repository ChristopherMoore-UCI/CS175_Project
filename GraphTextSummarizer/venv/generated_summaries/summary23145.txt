Last month, the parents of a woman killed in the shooting filed a lawsuit accusing online retailers who allegedly sold Holmes ammunition, body armor, tear gas and other equipment of negligence. His attorneys had asked for a longer delay in the trial, Arapahoe County District Judge Carlos A. Samour Jr. said in his order. Holmes' attorneys argued in a motion filed last year that their client "suffers from severe mental illness and was in the throes of a psychotic episode when he committed acts that resulted in the tragic loss of life." The delay gives Holmes' defense team more time to review a court-ordered sanity examination and prepare for the trial. Jury selection will begin January 20, and attorneys should be prepared to make opening statements on June 3, Samour said.
