Three Bayern goals in four minutes soon after the break added to Stuttgart's misery with Mario Mandzukic, Mueller and Bastian Schweinsteiger scoring. His German international teammate Toni Kroos added a second with Luis Gustavo scoring the third before the break. Visiting striker Vedad Ibisevic was shown red for headbutting Bayern's Jerome Boateng before new home signing Javi Martinez came on for the last 13 minutes having transferred from Athletic Bilbao for 40 million euros ($50.3m) Thursday. Tunisia defender Karim Haggui put Hannover ahead after only 10 minutes before Poland's Artur Sobiech added the second on 26 minutes. Dane Leon Andreasen and Sobiech with his second made it 4-0 before Knoche departed for a second yellow card.
