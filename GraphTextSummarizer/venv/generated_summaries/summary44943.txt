In a letter to embattled Gov. David Paterson, Pedro Perez denied his resignation was connected to the ethics scandals embroiling Albany. -- New York state's top police official announced Wednesday he was quitting, the second acting superintendent to step down in as many weeks. " Separately, the New York State Commission on Public Integrity on March 3 accused Paterson of an ethics violation for allegedly accepting free tickets to the first game of last year's World Series. The commission has asked Cuomo, the state's attorney general, and the Albany County district attorney to investigate. The governor could face up to an $80,000 fine for violating the state's gift ban for public officials, and up to $10,000 if he is found to have used his official position to secure unwarranted privileges.
