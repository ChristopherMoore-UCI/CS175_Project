French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve told reporters in Montpellier on Saturday that French officials believe Nemmouche "could have been the jailer of hostages, including our hostages. A suspected jihadist accused of a deadly shooting at Belgium's Jewish Museum also guarded Western hostages while fighting with ISIS in Syria, according to a French journalist and former captive. But a report Saturday by French newspaper Le Monde that made public Nemmouche's alleged involvement in hostage-taking forced its hand. Portrayal of lost, perverse young man Le Monde reports that the French internal security directorate, the DGSI, passed information to the counterterrorism section of the Paris prosecutor's office on Nemmouche's suspected role based on testimony from former hostages. Pepiezep confirmed his client was questioned by French authorities this summer, but was not asked about that period in Syria.
