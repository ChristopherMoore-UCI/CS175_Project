The result only looked briefly in doubt when Giorgios Samaras brought Greece level for six minutes in the second half, while Dimitris Salpingidis made the Greek deficit respectable with a late penalty. The first was a sumptuous pass from Georgios Fotakis into the path of Salpingidis, who burst down the right and delivered a wicked low cross for Samaras to slide the ball home from close range. Germany's third goal was as soft as their second was brilliant, Klose nodding home from Ozil's corner after the hapless Greek goalkeeper Michalis Sifakis recklessly tried to claim the ball. Germany's win vindicated a pre-match selection gamble from their manager Joachim Low, who surprisingly rested his three main attackers Mario Gomez, Thomas Mueller and Lukas Podolski. Reus then added a fourth with a blistering volley after Sifakis parried a Klose strike into his teammate's path.
