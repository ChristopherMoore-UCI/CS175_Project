Although many schools have crisis response plans, most have not taken time to personally work with their local law enforcement agencies to co-develop plans and practice drills. Most school safety experts advise campuses to practice such drills at least once per semester with teachers and school staff also drilling during in-service training days. Over the last decade, many states have mandated that schools have crisis response plans. But because they were mandated, many schools have simply copied generic plans provided by the state or another school district in order to meet their legal requirements. Does your campus regularly practice school safety drills?
