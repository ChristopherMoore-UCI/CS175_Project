In this season of holiday parties and gift-giving, CNN Heroes offers ways to give from your heart -- without having to reach into your wallet -- and help a Hero help others. Breathe new life into literature with Sheltering Books  Make space for new gifts by donating the books you've already enjoyed to children and women living in shelters across the United States. Kathryn Hall-Trujillo, a 2010 CNN Hero, started Birthing Project USA to battle high infant-mortality rates. Jude Ndambuki, a 2009 CNN Hero, wipes and restores donated computer systems and ships them for free to qualifying schools in Kenya. Your lightly used car seats, strollers, baby clothes and toys can help a mom keep babies bouncing this holiday.
