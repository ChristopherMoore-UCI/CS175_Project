Ryan Coogler's independent drama chronicling the true story of Bay Area resident Oscar Grant's last day won the Grand Jury Prize and the Audience Award at this year's Sundance Film Festival. Check back in next weekend for more summer box office. But the big story is that Universal's $76 million sequel has passed the $300 million mark after 26 days in theaters, and can now boast a domestic profit of about $306.4 million and a worldwide total of $660.9 million. Amazingly, it's still only Sandler's 15th-highest-grossing moving, but it has been in theaters for just three weeks, so there's room to grow. Finally, Woody Allen's latest, Blue Jasmine, opened in six theaters in New York and Los Angeles and brought in $613K, with a stunning $102K per-theater average.
