The book looks at how obesity is altering sexual development, dating, marriage and sexual function; how weight loss can make or break a relationship; and even the lure of plus-size porn. During her 2Â½ years of research, Varney found that obesity can have a chilling effect on sexual relationships, from physical barriers to intimacy to attitudinal shifts with weight gain and even loss. Weight loss didn't solve her sexual roadblocks; therapy that addressed body image as a whole and marriage counseling did. " Englehardt pops up later in the book after undergoing bariatric surgery for weight loss and encounters an interesting twist: Varney says it took a lot of work to gain the trust of her subjects, many of whom she met through weight loss counselors.
