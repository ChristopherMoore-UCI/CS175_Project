Snowe's announcement follows Nebraska Sen. Ben Nelson's decision to not run for re-election after being attacked for compiling a record as the most conservative Democrat left in the Senate. The Maine Republican's comments echoed Indiana Democrat Evan Bayh's statement when he announced he wouldn't seek re-election in 2010: In 2006, Lieberman found himself under attack from the left for his post-9/11 support of the Bush War on Terror and won re-election as an independent after a lifetime as a centrist Democrat. North Carolina's Heath Shuler, who worked across the aisle most recently to try to achieve a grand bargain with a $4 trillion deficit reduction, won't run for re-election. It has gotten so bad that Sen. Olympia Snowe is throwing in the towel on her three-term career in disgust: "I do find it frustrating," she said, "that an atmosphere of polarization and 'my way or the highway' ideologies has become pervasive in campaigns and in our governing institutions."
