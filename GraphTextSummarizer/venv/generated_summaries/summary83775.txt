The Methodist church says it welcomes members regardless of sexual orientation, but same-sex marriages cannot be performed in Methodist churches or by ordained ministers under church policy. "It is a victory for the LGBT movement...if trials are part of the reason why things are changing now in the United Methodist church, it will have been worth my sacrifice," Schaefer said. Ogletree released a statement Monday relinquishing his right to the trial and accepting McLee's intention to "approach the matter of marriage equality in a non-juridical manner." "On first blush it doesn't seem fair," Schaefer said on Monday, "two United Methodist Ministers are charged with the exact same 'crime' of officiating at their son's same sex weddings -- one is defrocked, the other one's case is dropped without conditions.
