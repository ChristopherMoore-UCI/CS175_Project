Bolivian President Evo Morales apologized for the humiliation suffered by indigenous peoples at the hands of the police over the weekend,  and said his government did not mandate the attacks, state media reported late Wednesday. "Evo Morales' government does not respect human rights," said indigenous leader Barradas. Bolivian indigenous leaders have vowed to keep fighting the project even though Morales said Monday he would suspend construction pending a national dialogue. Indigenous leaders, who maintain the marchers were unarmed, expressed their skepticism Tuesday over Morales' statement. Police efforts were thwarted, though, when local indigenous people shut down two airports and freed many of those who had been apprehended by police.
