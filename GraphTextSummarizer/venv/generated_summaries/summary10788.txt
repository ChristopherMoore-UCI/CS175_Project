In Wednesday's plea hearing, the prosecution said evidence shows that Hadley had been using drugs and was upset about his parents' plans to put him into a "day treatment program." After killing his parents, Hadley used "books, files, towels, anything that he could find inside the home to cover the bodies" in the bedroom, Port St. Lucie police spokesman Tom Nichols said at the time. Authorities said Hadley beat his parents near and in the master bedroom of their Port St. Lucie home on July 16, 2011. The move by Tyler Hadley, who previously pleaded not guilty, came less than a month before he was to stand trial for the July 2011 deaths of Blake and Mary Jo Hadley. St. Lucie Circuit Judge Robert Makemson then asked Hadley whether he wanted to change his mind about the plea. A judge in Florida's St. Lucie County will hold a mitigation hearing to determine whether Hadley's youth or other factors should lead to a lesser sentence.
