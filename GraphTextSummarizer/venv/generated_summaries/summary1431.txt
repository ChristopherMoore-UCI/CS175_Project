The Honda rider, second in last year's MotoGP world championship, had the plate inserted last October after suffering a double fracture to his collarbone in the Japanese Grand Prix. Pedrosa, who moved up to MotoGP class in 2006, is currently second in the standings after two races thanks to his second-place finish last weekend in Jerez. -- Spanish motorcycling star Dani Pedrosa has had successful surgery to remove a titanium plate from his shoulder, it was announced on Wednesday. "Dani Pedrosa has undergone successful surgery at Teknon Medical Center, in Barcelona, to decompress his left subclavian artery and is expected to recover satisfactorily," the official MotoGP website reported. The next race in the elite division's season is not until May 1 in Portugal because this year's race in Japan was canceled due to the devastation caused by last month's earthquake and tsunami.
