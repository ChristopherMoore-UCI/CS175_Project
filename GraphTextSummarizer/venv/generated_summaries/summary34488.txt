Rebekah Carmichael, a spokeswoman for Fishman, said that "we can neither confirm nor deny any specific investigative actions." Sheridan said the subpoenas involve investigations of whether top Christie appointees orchestrated traffic gridlock around the George Washington Bridge in Fort Lee over several days last September in an apparent bid to punish that town's mayor, Mark Sokolich, for not endorsing their boss for reelection. The U.S. Attorney's office and state legislative investigators are also looking at allegations top New Jersey government officials pressured another local mayor, Dawn Zimmer of Hoboken, to back a redevelopment project favored by Christie as a condition of receiving Superstorm Sandy relief funds for her city. -- Federal prosecutors in New Jersey have subpoenaed documents from political groups linked to Gov. Chris Christie over an unfolding scandal involving suggestions senior state government appointees abused their authority to punish a local mayor politically, according to a law firm involved in the case. Christie denies any knowledge of the alleged scheme, but he fired one aide at the center of it and three others whose names have surfaced in e-mails around the scandal have also left their jobs. The scandal has heated up with Christie taking the oath of office for a second term this week.
