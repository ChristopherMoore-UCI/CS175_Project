"In the areas they already control, these groups are imposing draconian restrictions on human rights and religious freedom and engaging in brutal acts against individuals, particularly women and local police, who refused to accede to their repressive policies." A CPC designation gives Secretary of State Hillary Clinton "a range of specific policy options to address serious violations of religious freedom." -- A U.S. government panel listed 13 countries Friday as "egregious" violators of religious freedom. It requires the secretary "to enter into direct consultations with a government to find ways to bring about improvements in the respect for religious freedom." "While sanctions are a possible policy option, the secretary may decide to develop a binding agreement with the CPC government on specific actions that it will take to end the violations that gave rise to the designation or take a commensurate action," the commission said.
