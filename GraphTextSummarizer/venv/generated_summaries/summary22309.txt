Ralph called his two-bedroom apartment "the safe house" because, in this particularly tough area of the Bronx, it was a place that friends and family and neighborhood kids could come and always feel secure. Witnessing Ralph with his granddaughter, Kayla, as he lovingly took her to the park or for a stroll to the corner deli, was inspiring. Ralph agreed to be in the film because he wanted to be remembered and because of how important he understood fatherhood to be in the lives of our kids. And that's how I met Ralph Benitez, the man who would eventually become the heart of my fatherhood documentary, "The Evolution of Dad." And then there were the kids in the neighborhood who all looked up to him, many lacking dads of their own.
