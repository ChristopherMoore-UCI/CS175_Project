Without mentioning Maryam al-Khawaja by name, the statement said the "accused person" had an outstanding warrant and was arrested upon arriving in Bahrain, according to Abdullah al-Dossary, district attorney for al-Muharraq province. "The thing about Bahrain is that nobody really knows what's going on there because there's not much media coverage," al-Khawaja said last year. Bahraini authorities released a statement Monday citing a "case that was presented to them from the Bahrain airport police." Abdulhadi al-Khawaja was sentenced to life in prison in 2011 on charges related to participating in anti-government demonstrations and plotting to overthrow the Gulf nation's royal family. "To be clear, I'm officially under arrest on unknown charges," al-Khawaja tweeted Saturday.
