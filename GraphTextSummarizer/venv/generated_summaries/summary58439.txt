Fritzl's lawyer revealed Thursday that Elisabeth had been in court Tuesday, the second day of the trial. Prosecutors said Fritzl closeted Elisabeth in the specially designed cellar in 1984, when she was 18, telling other family members that she had run away to join a cult. Both sides accepted Thursday's verdict and Josef Fritzl refused the option to appeal, court officials said. Josef Fritzl arrives for sentencing at the courthouse in St. Poelten on Thursday. It was the maximum sentence for the most serious charge Fritzl faced: one count of murder, for allowing one of the babies he fathered with his daughter to die shortly after birth.
