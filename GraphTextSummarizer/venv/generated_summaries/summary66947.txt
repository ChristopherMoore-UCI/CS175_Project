The unsolved mystery of lost 19th century 'ghost ships' As Lord Nelson's flagship, HMS Victory served at the front of the battle on the Spanish coast. Despite having fewer ships than the Franco-Spanish fleet, Nelson managed to lead the British to triumph. He believes even nowadays ship builders would struggle to replicate parts of HMS Victory. O'Sullivan hopes that throughout the project they'll be able to train up new apprentices so that the art of repairing these types of ships is not lost. "It's a massive task," says project manager John O'Sullivan of BAE Systems, which has been contracted to carry out the works for five years with an option to extend that for a further five.
