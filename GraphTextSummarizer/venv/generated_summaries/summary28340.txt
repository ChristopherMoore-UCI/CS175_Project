READ MORE: What one gay Russian model thinks of law Is our nation making a statement on Russia's anti-gay propaganda law by sending gay men and women to represent us in Sochi? As Brian Boitano said in a recent interview, "I think the statement is already being made by us being on the delegation â€” Billie Jean and Caitlin â€” and us standing together, united as gay people showing that there is freedom of speech and we are successful human beings and athletes. Our real role in going to Sochi is not to demonstrate or disrupt the Olympics, but to support the men and women of Team USA. I want the LGBT community living in Russia to know they are not alone and I hope others realize this is not only a gay rights issue, but a global concern for human rights and equality. The delegation is an impressive collection of athletes and world leaders and it just so happens some of us are gay.
