The words "kindergarten graduation" usually evoke images of tearful parents taking pictures of cute kids in pint-sized graduation caps and gowns. "That something as good as a graduation ceremony, a promotion ceremony, is marred by the actions of a few." Drummond said the school was put on lockdown to "make sure the kids were OK.
