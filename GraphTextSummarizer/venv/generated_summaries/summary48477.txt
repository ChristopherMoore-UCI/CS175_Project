So imagine my surprise when, at a recent debate, Texas Gov. Rick Perry turned to Mitt Romney and, with a certain amount of disdain, sniffed, "Mitt has had six years to be working on a plan. They may like Perry's new optional flat tax, but cringe at his more liberal views on immigration that allow the children of illegal immigrants to get in-state tuition in Texas. So, is it really a bad thing that Romney spent years working on ideas -- changing some, obviously -- to prepare for another presidential run? Neither did Bill Clinton, who did have a 'Putting People First' plan, which contained ideas on welfare reform and education that he had spoken about for years. Cain has a tax plan that catapulted him to the lead, then Perry tries out another catchy plan to regain the lead.
