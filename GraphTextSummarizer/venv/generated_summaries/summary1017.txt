Although there's been talk about an investigation by the state department of Education or by federal authorities, Gillum said this inquiry by the attorney general is the first time Fisher, his mom or Gillum have been contacted by investigators about the actions of school administrators. In the past year, Pennsylvania Attorney General Kathleen Kane has launched a case-wide review of the Sandusky investigation because of numerous criticisms about the two-year gap between Fisher's report and Sandusky's arrest, plus allegations that charges weren't filed against others who might have known about Sandusky's abuse for months. The co-author of Fisher's book, Mike Gillum, told CNN that he and Fisher's mother have been approached by investigators with the Pennsylvania Attorney General's office about the actions of administrators at Central Mountain High School in 2008. Fisher's mother has repeatedly said that the high school principal told her to wait and think about the implications of accusing Sandusky before calling authorities. Sandusky was a volunteer football coach and would often take Fisher from class without his mother's permission.
