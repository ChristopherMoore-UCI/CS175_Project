Feds still hunting for missing FBI agent who vanished in Iran The Levinson family says Robert was working as a private investigator looking into cigarette smuggling in Iran when he went missing. Last year, the Iranian government said it would make inquiries about Levinson but did not know what happened to him. In a so-called "proof of life" video released last year but apparently made two years ago, Levinson appears about 50 to 60 pounds lighter. "Every day I miss him," said Christine Levinson, his wife of 38 years.
