-- Hundreds of Michael Jackson fans gathered in London on Monday to pay tribute to the tragic pop star on the night when he was supposed to be opening his 50-night residency in the city. On Monday fans laid flowers and memorabilia, wrote messages to the star on a wall and sang Jackson songs. Items are being pushed out to try to beat bootleggers who are already producing Jackson mementos to cash in on demand from fans. The decision by fans to stage their own farewell to Michael Jackson at the O2 follows the absence of an official plan to commemorate the singer's life in London. The O2 arena in southeast London, where Jackson's "This is It" shows were due to be staged, had been the site of an unofficial shrine to the performer since his death last month.
