In a written statement, his office said that the government has taken steps to disarm prisoners and instituted other security measures at prisons nationwide.

At the time, analysts said prison overcrowding likely contributed to the massive death toll of the February 2012 fire in Comayagua, Honduras, which claimed more than 360 lives.
