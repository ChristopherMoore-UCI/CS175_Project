" Palestinian officials hope the tests will clear up questions over whether Arafat's death eight years ago was the result of poisoning by the radioactive element polonium. The body of former Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat will be exhumed Tuesday and samples taken to be tested for poisoning as part of an inquiry into his 2004 death, an official said Saturday. This is necessary to reach the truth in the death of President Yasser Arafat. " Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas subsequently approved the exhumation of Arafat's body from his mausoleum, which is in the Palestinian presidential compound in Ramallah. French authorities opened a murder inquiry into Arafat's death this year after high levels of the radioactive substance were found on some of his personal belongings by a Swiss doctor.
