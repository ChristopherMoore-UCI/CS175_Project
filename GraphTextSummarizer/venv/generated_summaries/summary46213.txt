"Brazil are too dependent on Neymar," former Brazil midfielder Juninho told CNN following the group stages. -- Four days after Neymar was kneed in the back, Brazil face the real possibility of being booted out of their own World Cup when they take on Germany in the semifinal at Belo Horizonte on Tuesday. "We're all sad that Neymar can't play, it's always better when the opponent has all their best players on the pitch," Germany midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger told FIFA.com. A member of Brazil's last World Cup-winning squad in 2002, Juninho also queried whether the current side have the experience to sustain their challenge. In 2002, Germany were runners up to Brazil -- the only World Cup meeting between the teams -- before losing at the semifinal stage to eventual winners Italy and Spain in 2006 and 2010 respectively.
