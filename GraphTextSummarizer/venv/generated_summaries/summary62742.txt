A three-year CNN investigation into Quadriga Art and its profiteering off donations made to U.S. veterans has led to a fine that New York regulators say is precedent-setting. Quadriga president and CEO Mark Schulhof said in a statement that he has "taken responsibility for the mistakes that were made" in its dealings with the veterans charity. State Attorney: Actions were 'pretty despicable' "To take the money that people are trying to spend to help disabled veterans just to feed your own overhead and to pay off your executives as Quadriga did here is pretty despicable," Schneiderman told CNN. The total settlement prevents Quadriga from engaging in what it calls a "funded model" of beginning new charities -- paying all of the start-up costs and fundraising costs in advance in hopes of profit down the road. The New York state investigation found that for all intents and purposes, the charity was a front for Quadriga.
