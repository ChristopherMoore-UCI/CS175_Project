Transatlantic flights set to be bumpier Last month, a United Airlines flight returned to Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey after turbulence injured five flight attendants. -- Three crew members and two passengers were injured Monday when a United Airlines flight encountered severe turbulence, a spokeswoman for the airline said. The plane hit "severe turbulence" about 45 minutes into the Beijing-bound United Flight 89, said Ron Marsico, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the airport. The captain declared an emergency on United Flight 1676, which was flying from Denver, Colorado, to Billings, Montana, said United's Christen Davis. There were 114 passengers and five crew members onboard, including passenger Bill Dahlin.
