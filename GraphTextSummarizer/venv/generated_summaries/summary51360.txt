In an early test of Santos' diplomatic skills, his inauguration was attended by the foreign minister of Venezuela, which is at odds with Colombia over accusations that Colombian rebels have found refuge in Venezuela. Venezuela broke off diplomatic ties with Colombia last month after Colombian officials said they had photographic evidence of guerrilla camps in Venezuela. Some of the strongest strikes against the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, came under Santos' leadership as minister of defense, including the high-profile hostage rescue of former presidential candidate Ingrid Betancourt in 2008. "It is possible to have a peaceful Colombia, a Colombia with no guerrillas, and we will prove that by reason or by force," Santos said in Bogota in his first televised remarks as head of state. "We would like to deliver -- that's what President Hugo Chavez specifically indicated -- a message of love and solidarity to all of the people of Colombia; a message for the future and for hope," Maduro said.
