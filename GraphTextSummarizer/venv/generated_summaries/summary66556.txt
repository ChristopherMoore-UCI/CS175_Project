In Draper's plan, the other five states that don't get to be Silicon Valley would be known as Jefferson, North California, Central California, West California, and South California. In a perfect world, I suppose California would be divided into two states -- Northern California and Steve. His major argument is that, currently, California isn't represented properly in Washington -- that two senators simply cannot speak for the massive population of the entire state. Draper wants to turn California into six separate states. And then we would combine North and South Dakota into just Dakota.
