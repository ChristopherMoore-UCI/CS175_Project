"The use-it-or-lose-it rule that Apel proposes would frustrate the administration of military facilities and raise difficult questions for judges, who are not expert in military operations. The justices unanimously ruled against Dennis Apel, a longtime critic of U.S. military policy who for 17 years has protested around Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. "We decline Apel's invitation to require civilian judges to examine U. S. military sites around the world, parcel by parcel, to determine which have roads, which have fences, and which have a sufficiently important, persistent military purpose," said Roberts. The court's reading of federal law "reaches all property within the defined boundaries of a military place that is under the command of a military officer," said Chief Justice John Roberts. -- The commander of a military base has broad jurisdiction over the facility, including public roads and a special protest zone located on it, the Supreme Court decided Wednesday.
