Madrid told Nancy Grace of CNN's sister network HLN that Coronado looked blankly at the ground. As of Wednesday evening, online records didn't indicate that Coronado was officially an inmate in the county, and it wasn't known whether she had a lawyer. "She (said) she loved being a mother," Ashley Madrid said of Coronado, her neighbor. Madrid had known Coronado since the latter moved into the neighborhood four to five years ago. In that time, Madrid and Coronado would talk at the grocery store or across the fence about their children.
