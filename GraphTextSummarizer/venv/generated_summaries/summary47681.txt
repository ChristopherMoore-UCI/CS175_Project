In an eerily similar story, police say a 26-year-old North Carolina woman had no idea she was sexually assaulted during a party in September until pictures of her assault were later posted on social media. Last year, there were several instances in which sexual assaults were documented on social media by the alleged perpetrators. In November, several high school students in New Mexico allegedly sexually assaulted a young girl and posted pictures of their crime on social media. There's no evidence that incidents of rape and sexual assault are increasing because of social media. But is social media, which allows for limitless self-absorption, exacerbating hatred and violence when mixed with seeming anonymity?
