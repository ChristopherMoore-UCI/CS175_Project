" Chasson said Secret Service agents will testify they kept an eye on Hinckley in Williamsburg during the short periods of time earlier this year when he was allowed free time on his own. The judge may then take some period of time to review the testimony before issuing his ruling on the hospital's plan to gradually allow Hinckley greater freedom. Dr. Tyler Jones, the facility's director of psychiatry, said Hinckley had given the woman "multiple rings." Jones said Hinckley had told him he'd explained to CB he planned to spend more time visiting his mother's home in Virginia and would be spending less time with her. The doctor said Hinckley's "treatment team" wants him to spend more time in Williamsburg and thinks he'll be able to fit into the community much better. Both she and Dr. Jones said Hinckley represents a low risk of engaging in violence if granted permission to spend more time away from his mental hospital.
