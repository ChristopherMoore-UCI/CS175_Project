'The Shining' by the numbers Podesta, who also designed the Kubrick exhibit at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, offers a number of reasons for the film's ongoing appeal. "I had some research on Kubrick and knew that he had a tendency in his films to refer to eagles as a symbol of state power, and so it seemed to me that this typewriter was significant. This year alone has seen several examples of its persistent hold on the imagination including the release of "Room 237," a documentary exploring claims by a variety of theorists that Kubrick deliberately inserted coded symbols and meanings into his film; a major exhibit on Kubrick at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art featuring a unique gallery devoted to "The Shining"; and the public display of an elaborate recreation of "The Shining" by sculptor Howard Senft. King's agent says Warner Bros. owns the movie rights to the sequel, just as it did the original film directed by the late Stanley Kubrick. One reason "The Shining" continues to hold power over audiences is that it rewards multiple viewings, says artist and set designer Patti Podesta.
