-- Mariam Yehya Ibrahim, the Sudanese Christian woman sentenced to death in Sudan because of her faith, arrived in Rome on Thursday, the Italian Foreign Ministry said. Italy has good relations with Khartoum and offered to help the U.S. Embassy there to speed up the process of getting U.S. passports for Ibrahim and her family to leave the country, the minister said. 'Day for celebration' Ibrahim and her family were earlier greeted at the airport in Rome by Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi. They were trying to fly to the United States with their baby daughter, who was born while Ibrahim was in prison, and toddler son. It is unclear how long Ibrahim will stay in Rome before flying on to the United States, he said, adding that it had to do with passport procedures.
