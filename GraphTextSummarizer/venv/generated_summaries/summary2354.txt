What really gets Arizonans fired up are three things: the feeling that they're under siege by spillover violence from Mexican drug cartels, the concern that the U.S. government isn't doing enough to protect them, and indignation that people in other states are judging them for responding to a reality most of us can't imagine. One of the arguments floating about -- advanced by Brewer -- is that most illegal immigrants act as drug mules for the cartels. Arizona Sen. John McCain said he doesn't believe that most illegal immigrants are used as drug mules. That makes absolutely no sense, just as it makes no sense for Arizona to crack down on illegal immigrants in the hopes that it will somehow get rid of drug dealers. Unless, of course, the real objective all along has been something much sneakier: to use the fear of drug dealers to get rid of illegal immigrants.
