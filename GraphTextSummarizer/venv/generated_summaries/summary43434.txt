Their son and daughter -- two children from Rucker's first marriage -- came to visit often, and Annita Rucker found herself entertaining the young kids while her husband remained stationary. Rucker wants to become a motivational speaker, to be that inspiration for others that Mills was for him. "I realized that if I kept doing it, I would significantly shorten my life." Rucker took Mills' dieting hints to heart and cut out sugary drinks. In January 2011, he reconnected with an old elementary school friend, Anita Mills, and the two began talking on Facebook, discussing Mills' 240-pound weight loss. Since February 2011, Rucker has run his first 5K, his first 10K, his first half-marathon and his first marathon.
