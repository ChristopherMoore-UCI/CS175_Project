-- For much of the last century, people in the small town of Libby, Montana, were surrounded by toxic asbestos. The defense also says the government had "vast information" about asbestos in Libby before the EPA came along in 1999 to launch an investigation. In response to questions from CNN, W.R. Grace said at the time that it was acting as a good corporate citizen and had voluntarily paid millions of dollars in medical bills for 900 Libby residents. W.R. Grace followed a "plan" that was in no way "hush hush," and was subject to government inspection, defense attorney David Bernick told the jury, according to KPAX. Some residents say the town was kept in the dark about asbestos dangers.
