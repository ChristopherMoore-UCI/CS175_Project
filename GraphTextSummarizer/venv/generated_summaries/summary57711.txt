"For football fans to use Holocaust imagery and chants glorifying Adolf Hitler is grossly offensive to the Jewish community and is a stain upon the character of British football. "There is a hardcore of racist and anti-Semitic fans in British football who really don't seem to have any regard for common sense or decency," Peter Herbert, the chairman of the association of black lawyers, a group which has threatened to take legal against Spurs fans who continue to use the term "Yid", told CNN. It has been an annus horribilis in football's fight against discrimination with Chelsea and Liverpool notably dragged through the mud, but Sunday's game against West Ham at Spurs' White Hart Lane stadium -- as fans made Nazi salutes -- gave the impression English football had reached a new low. -- Violent attacks, the chanting of Adolf Hitler's name and anti-Semitic abuse -- not dark memories of the 1930s but four days in the life of English Premier Leage club Tottenham Hotspur. "The idea that Spurs fans are reclaiming the Y-word and are entitled to because so many of them are Jewish is simply not true," said Baddiel, who is Jewish and a Chelsea fan, recently writing in the Daily Mail.
