One reason cited for the drop in current coverage -- businesses no longer offering private coverage -- would contradict the president's promise to allow Americans to keep their current coverage, if they like it. We pledge to make quality health care coverage more available and less expensive, including those with pre-existing health conditions. While the House bill remains unscored by the Congressional Budget Office, health overhaul plans being crafted by Senate Democrats will likely cost more than $1 trillion over 10 years and could fail to cover millions of Americans. Leaders need to compromise, negotiate with members of both parties and ideologies, and reform health care the right way -- by developing a strong plan that encompasses the needs of all Americans. As a doctor, I know there is a better way to help all Americans achieve meaningful health care access.
