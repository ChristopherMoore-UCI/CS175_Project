The weather dealt Dyche and his schooner an ill-fated hand, after they left the port of Opua in northern New Zealand, with his wife and their teenage son. The Nina went incommunicado while running from raging seas, 400 miles north-northwest of New Zealand. "Records show that conditions at the last known position for the vessel, on 4 June, were very rough," Maritime New Zealand said. Nail-biting wait Family members alerted maritime authorities in New Zealand in mid-June that the Nina was missing, after wondering for days why they had not heard anything from Dyche. "While we have grave concerns for the crew on board Nina, we have not given up hope of finding survivors," mission controller Neville Blakemore said Friday.
