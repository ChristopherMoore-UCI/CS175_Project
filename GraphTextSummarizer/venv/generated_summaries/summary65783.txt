April, the cruelest month: Time for tax deadlines and tax policy follies. History shows that marginal tax rates were raised on the very highest bracket to 94% in the midst of World War II. The really, really rich in America don't pay high taxes because they don't report high incomes. Named after Warren Buffett, who said it was an outrage that he pays a lower tax rate than his secretary, the proposal is designed to ensure that the really rich -- those with annual reported taxable incomes of more than $1 million -- pay an "effective tax rate" of 30%. And if history is any guide, any form of tax increase, on anyone, will not bring votes to any person or party in November, so there are no political points to score here.
