Still, there is the potential for more sludge to enter the water supply through waste runoff. The ash that gives sludge its thick, pudding-like consistency in this case is known as fly ash, which results from the combustion of coal.

Francis said Environmental Protection Agency officials were on the scene and estimated the cleanup could take four to six weeks.
