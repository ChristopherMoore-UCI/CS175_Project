Anthony Sowell, who served 15 years after pleading guilty to attempted rape in a 1989 case, was arrested last week, two days after police discovered the first bodies at his home. He faces five counts of aggravated murder, rape, felonious assault and kidnapping, police said, and was denied bond at a hearing Wednesday. Previously, the coroner's office said it had identified the bodies of Nancy Cobbs, 43; Tonia Carmichael, 52; Telacia Fortson, 31; and Tishana Culver, 31. A man described as her boyfriend -- Sowell -- told police the same story. In another court document filed shortly before his release and obtained by CNN, handwritten notes state Sowell "would be likely to re-offend because he still denies the rape."
