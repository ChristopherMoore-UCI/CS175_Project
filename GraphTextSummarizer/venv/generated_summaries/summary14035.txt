If the group, Created Equal, can project bloody, allegedly aborted fetuses on a 10-by-12-foot screen next to Philadelphia's Liberty Bell to try and prove that abortion is murder, then why shouldn't women who have abortions use extreme methods to try and prove it's not? After that, while abortion was not exactly taboo, it certainly was, shall we say, a decision no TV character made without dire consequences. Not only are some TV shows, like "Parenthood," portraying abortion without shame, but activists are too. And 39 states now require that abortions be performed by a licensed physician. After Texas passed a law this summer requiring, among other things, doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 13 miles of the clinic where an abortion is performed, clinics were initially forced to close.
