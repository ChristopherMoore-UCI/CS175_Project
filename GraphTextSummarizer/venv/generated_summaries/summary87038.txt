The U.S. ice cream industry generates more than $21 billion in annual sales, and about  9 percent of all the milk produced by U.S. dairy farmers is used to produce ice cream, according to the International Dairy Foods Association. The company, which has thousands of outlets around the globe, is replacing some old flavors with new ones to celebrate National Ice Cream Day in the U.S. on Sunday, and Baskin-Robbin's 65th anniversary. Srinivas Kumar, chief brand officer at the company, said "over the decades we have retired some of our iconic flavors into our deep freeze -- like 'Miami Ice' from the 1980s and 'Beatlenut' in the 1960s -- but never before have five flavors gone into the deep freeze at one time." And it's ice cream lovers in the United States who'll likely miss the flavors most. The Illinois-based National Ice Cream Retailer's Association says the U.S is the world's top ice cream-consuming nation.
