" Best friends Another theory Big Boi finds himself dealing with is the status of OutKast and his relationship with Andre 3000. If you were to ask the music critics, Big Boi just released his most complete work to date and the closest fans will get (for now) to an OutKast album in terms of it's boldness in sound and creative risks.

Through marketing and promotion, Big Boi was cast as the bad boy, while Andre was the thoughtful, creative one.
