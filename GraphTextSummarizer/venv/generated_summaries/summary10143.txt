The visit of Vice President Tariq al-Hashimi, who has been living in Kurdistan since Iraqi authorities issued an arrest warrant for him on terrorism charges, drew sharp criticism from Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki. -- Iraq's vice president arrived in Qatar Sunday to meet with leaders of the Gulf nation, despite an Iraqi government order banning him from international travel. The vice president's trip comes several days after Qatar's foreign minister said his country had sent a low-ranking representative to last week's Arab League summit in Baghdad in order to send a message over "factionalism in Iraq," the state-run Qatar News Agency reported. "Following the visits, the vice president will return to his place of residence in Iraqi Kurdistan Region." And Al-Maliki has demanded that Kurdish lawmakers hand over al-Hashimi, who refuses to return to Baghdad from northern Iraq.
