Amid heightened tensions with North Korea, the United States and South Korea on Sunday began joint military exercises, according to a spokesman for U.S. Forces Korea. The carrier USS George Washington and South Korean carrier Dokdo will lead the naval aspects of Invincible Spirit on the eastern coast of South Korea, said U.S. Army Col. Jonathan Withington of USFK. North Korea "will legitimately counter with [its] powerful nuclear deterrence the largest-ever nuclear war exercises to be staged by the U.S. and the South Korean puppet forces," KCNA reported. An international inquiry found North Korea culpable for the March attack that killed 46 South Korean sailors. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton reiterated U.S. support for South Korea on Friday.
