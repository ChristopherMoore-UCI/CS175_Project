No players have been arrested over the allegations, but the three questioned by police -- teenage cricket star Mohammad Amir, Mohammad Asif, and team captain Salman Butt -- were provisionally suspended by the sport's governing body and charged with various offenses under the International Cricket Council's anti-corruption code. The betting scandal has rocked the cricket world, with allegations that members of the Pakistan national team were involved in "spot-fixing" during Pakistan's Test series with England late last month. All three were interviewed by police last week under caution, meaning police believed they may have committed a crime. Their team is continuing a two-month tour of England without them. -- The three Pakistani cricket players at the center of betting allegations in London left the United Kingdom on Friday.
