That prompted a series of lawsuits and appeals from a coalition of civil rights groups and University of Michigan faculty and students, who counter the law actually burdens state residents, denying them the opportunity to persuade state and college officials to apply affirmative action. The Supreme Court on Tuesday will confront its biggest case of the term so far, another high-profile challenge to affirmative action in college admissions. The Brown v. Board of Education high court ruling in 1954 ended segregation of public schools, but sparked nationwide protests and disobedience by states that initially refused to integrate. The Michigan ban also prohibits the state from considering race and gender in public hiring and public contracting decisions. The justices are being asked to decide the constitutionality of a voter referendum in Michigan banning race- and sex-based discrimination or preferential treatment in public university admission decisions.
