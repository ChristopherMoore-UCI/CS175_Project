But what do sponsors get out of Formula 1? Johnnie Walker, a Scotch whisky brand of Diageo, is in its third season of sponsoring the McLaren Mercedes team. " With such a global presence, Johnnie Walker doesn't need Formula 1 to grab brand awareness. Key to the brand message that Johnnie Walker -- and Diageo -- is trying to get across is responsible drinking. The Johnnie Walker classic has run in Asia for 17 years now and Johnnie Walker also sponsors the Championship at Gleneagles in Scotland (Gleneagles is also a Diageo property). But Mika is still a hero amongst many young people it really does resonate with them and it changes their behavior and their attitude to something which is critical to Johnnie Walker, to Diageo and to me."
