They isolated three key qualities for success in corporate life: gravitas, communication and appearance. Yoda told me a story about one of the young leaders at managing director (MD) level. Each time the MD calmly and confidently held his ground, swinging the discussion round to his point of view. Later that day the MD got a call from the CEO of the organization, who'd watched this exchange of views in the board meeting: "We've got 10 new jobs going in the management restructure, which one do you want?" By staying present and steady the MD had communicated his ideas without creating an argument and without caving in. Yoda transforms the people he works with -- from having jerky, twitchy faces and voices and the knee-jerk reactions of people trying to cope with unsustainable workloads and stressful demands, they take on a far more grounded, centered presence; they seem wiser, more resourceful; and they get results -- big time.
