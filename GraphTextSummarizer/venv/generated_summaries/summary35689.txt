In her first visit to South by Southwest Interactive, the tech-themed conference underway here, former first daughter Chelsea Clinton devoted the bulk of her prepared talk Tuesday to the admirable work of her family's foundation in improving global health care. Wearing jeans and a black jacket, Clinton gave a rather stiff, scripted 25-minute speech, followed by a more relaxed Q&A session with Fast Company editor Robert Safian. That was around the time her father, then-President Bill Clinton, sent the first presidential e-mail, to astronaut John Glenn in space -- a fact she said her dad was "ridiculously" proud of. Clinton did urge the coders, designers and other tech professionals in the audience to devote their careers to making the world a better place. " Clinton, 34, said she got her first computer, a Commodore, "from Santa Claus" as a child and sent her first e-mail while in high school in the mid-1990s.
