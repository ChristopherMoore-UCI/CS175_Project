The number of English and Irish fans also seemed high Saturday night in Germany, where UK tourists swarmed Dusseldorf's arena, showing patriotism with the kind of colorful clothing usually reserved for soccer matches. Saturday evening, Azerbaijan won the 2011 running of the annual competition, with a sweet pop song that Europe slowly fell in love with during the course of the contest, titled "Running Scared," by Eldar and Nikki (also known as Ell/Nikki). Ratings for Saturday's grand finale fared well around Europe, but within Germany, semifinal viewership was down this year, with some German newspapers citing "Lena fatigue" as one reason fewer Germans seemed excited in 2011 for the annual pop music contest. But the true victors Saturday were Azerbaijan's Eldar and Nikki, who seemed stunned yet ecstatic just after the ceremony. "Satellite" wowed crowds last year, making Lena a star in Germany seen often on TV and on billboards.
