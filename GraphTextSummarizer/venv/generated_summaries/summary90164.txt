Hong Kong still hasn't got its act together when it comes to electric vehicles (EVs), according to the chief executive of MyCar's manufacturer, EuAuto Technology, Chung Sin-ling. " Hong Kongers are not familiar with EVs he says, and are concerned about the technology so they need to be shown that EVs are just as good as petrol cars. Hong Kong is arguably an ideal destination for electric cars. "In London they have government incentives to get people to switch from gasoline to electric vehicles," explains Chung, citing the waiver of the congestion charge and free parking for EVs in London as an example. Hong Kong is not without EVs though.
