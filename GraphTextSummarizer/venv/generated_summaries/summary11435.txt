The British physicist also embodies the idea of empowering people with ALS to live life to the fullest, said Dr. Lucie Bruijn, scientific director for the ALS Association, in an e-mail. There have been other rare cases of people living long lives with ALS, although none as famous as Hawking. Most people with ALS become dependent on a wheelchair -- sometimes within six to eight months, but the time frame varies, Matland said. Barry said she knows of a man in Ireland who has lived with the disease for 30 years -- but only about 5 percent of people with ALS live longer than 10 years. ALS affects 350,000 people worldwide and up to 30,000 people in the United States, the ALS Association estimates.
