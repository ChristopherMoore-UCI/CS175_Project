Hong Kong University professor Danny Gittings said the announcement marked a significant step toward normalizing relations between China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau. The new office will operate in a similar fashion to Hong Kong's economic offices in mainland China and facilitate "trade between Hong Kong and Taiwan, investment promotion and enhancing cultural exchanges between the two places," the Hong Kong government said in a statement. "The formal setting up of Hong Kong's multi-functional office in Taiwan signifies that the development of Hong Kong-Taiwan relations has entered a new phase," Hong Kong's Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau told CNN in a statement. The decision to rename Taipei's hub in Hong Kong delineates a warming of relations between Beijing and Taipei, said Joseph Cheng, a professor of political science at Hong Kong City University. Functioning in Hong Kong under the moniker of the "Chung Hwa Travel Service" since the 1966 Chinese Cultural Revolution, the office has often been mistaken as a private travel company because of its title, said James Shi Chu, Taiwan's Director General of Hong Kong & Macau Affairs.
