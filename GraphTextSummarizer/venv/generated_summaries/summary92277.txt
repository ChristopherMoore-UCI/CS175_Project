Ponta dos Ganchos, Santa Catarina, Brazil This exclusive resort in southern Brazil is so out of the way, it's not uncommon for guests (ages 18 and up) to arrive via private helicopters, landing on the on-site helipad. Guests who opt to book one of these exclusive retreats for two have their own Jacuzzis, private beach beds, butler service and pools and restaurants to choose from, plus access to the amenities next door. El Dorado Casitas Royale, Riviera Maya, Mexico Adjacent to Karisma Hotels' El Dorado Royale -- an adults-only beachside complex -- is an uber-luxury sister resort called El Dorado Casitas Royale, where private casitas sit right on the beach. Most of the 20 guestrooms (you can choose from suites or cottages) are spread out, so it's entirely possible to avoid other guests altogether. This country retreat 50 miles from New York City is strictly for the over 18 crowd, including both of its fine dining restaurants, which are open to nonhotel guests.
