Democracy for America urged its members to call the White House and say no to the Weiss nomination -- not just because Weiss was too friendly with Wall Street, but because blocking his nomination was an important mission for Warren. If this was a remarkable defeat for the Obama administration, it was a moment of glowing achievement for some of Warren's fiercest backers, including Wall Street reform advocates and progressive grassroots leaders who aggressively criticized Weiss's work at Lazard. "Sen. Warren is leading the charge against the nomination of Antonio Weiss," the group said. Progressive groups didn't just call on supporters to oppose Weiss; instead, they insisted that protesting his nomination was a way of showing solidarity with Warren. "Stand with Elizabeth Warren and say no to a Wall Street banker for Treasury undersecretary," read a MoveOn petition against Weiss's nomination, which garnered more than 30,000 signatures.
