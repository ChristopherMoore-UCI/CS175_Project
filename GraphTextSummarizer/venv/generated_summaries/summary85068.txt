All of the co-conspirators who Faal knew were of Gambian descent, though only some of them lived in Gambia. Despite repeated references to a coup in U.S. government documents, Jammeh told his Cabinet last week that the plot was a "terrorist attack" perpetrated by "Gambian dissidents in the U.S., Germany and UK." Cherno Njie, 57, a U.S. businessman of Gambian descent living in Austin, Texas, and Papa Faal, 46, a dual U.S.-Gambian citizen from Brooklyn Center, Minnesota, were charged "for their role in a recent attempted coup" that happened on December 30, the Justice Department said in a statement. "On Dec. 30, 2014, a number of the co-conspirators, including Faal, met in the woods near the State House in Banjul, which is the home of the Gambian president, and split into two assault teams," the Justice Department news release states. Njie, who the criminal complaint says was expected to become Gambia's interim leader if the coup had prevailed, and Faal both traveled to the West African nation in December to overthrow the government, according to the criminal complaint.
