The goal looked to have been enough for Mali, who defended stoutly against an Ivory Coast team featuring the likes of Manchester City's Yaya Toure and Wilfried Bony. Mali had taken an early lead after striker Bakary Sako, who plays for Wolverhampton Wanderers in the English Championship, superbly powered home a right foot volley from close range. Despite the late goal, Ivory Coast's French coach Herve Renard, a previous winner of the tournament as coach of Zambia, was not happy with some of the officiating, especially a first half penalty appeal for a foul on Wilfried Bony. A late goal saved Ivory Coast's blushes as they secured a draw against Mali in the Africa Cup of Nations Saturday, keeping them on course for the a place in the quarter finals. Cameroon took the lead rather fortuitously when a Benjamin Moukandjo corner went straight in before a goal by the highly rate Ibrahima Traore before half time leveled the match.
