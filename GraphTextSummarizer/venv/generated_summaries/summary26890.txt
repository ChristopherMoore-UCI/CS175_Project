Usher won primary custody of the couple's two children, Usher V and 4-year-old Naviyd, last year after a bitter court fight in which Foster Raymond accused the singer of being an absentee father. Usher Raymond V was rescued and resuscitated by a sound tech worker who dove into the pool to free the child from a drain at the music mogul's Atlanta home on August 5, according to police. Foster Raymond testified that she does not trust the childcare of Raymond's aunt. " Foster Raymond also said Usher does not keep her informed about what is going on in the children's lives. Usher's former stepson, also Foster Raymond's son, died in a watercraft accident on a north Georgia lake last year.
