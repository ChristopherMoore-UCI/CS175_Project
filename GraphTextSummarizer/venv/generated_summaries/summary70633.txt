-- It is 100 years since British explorer Captain Robert Falcon Scott set off on his ill-fated journey to be the first man to reach the South Pole. It also includes pictures taken by photographer Herbert Ponting, showing scenes of ice caves, frolicking penguins and the men relaxing at their camp, Cape Evans, in preparation for the assault ahead. Entitled "These Rough Notes: Captain Scott's Last Expedition," the exhibition includes fragile journals and letters written by the men who set out to traverse the Antarctic wastes, and features the last journal Captain Scott ever wrote, as well as his final letter to his wife. " Heart-rending photographs of the team finding rival Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen's tent already at the South Pole complement the written details of their arduous journey there -- and cast a shadow on their harrowing and ill-fated journey back. Cape Evans still stands today, preserved almost exactly as Scott and his men left it a century ago.
