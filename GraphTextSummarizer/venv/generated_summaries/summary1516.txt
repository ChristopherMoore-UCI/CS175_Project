On Tuesday, Bulger's lawyer, Hank Brennan, tried to reverse the image and portray Flemmi as a man who knew how to kill people independently of Bulger. Lawyers for Bulger, who is charged with 19 murders, extortion and racketeering, also questioned Flemmi about the murder of Flemmi's girlfriend, Debbie Davis. And he tried pointing out inconsistencies in Flemmi's prior testimony about exactly where the woman died in the house she had been lured to, upstairs or after Flemmi and Bulger carried her to the basement. She was dead," said Flemmi, who testified earlier that Bulger strangled Davis upstairs. In the course of three days on the witness stand in Bulger's federal trial, Flemmi has described in great detail the murders he says he witnessed Bulger commit and he has portrayed himself as a lackey following orders and getting rid of physical evidence -- pulling victims' teeth to avoid identification and disposing of bodies.
