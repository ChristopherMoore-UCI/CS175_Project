Meanwhile, Pakistani authorities have detained a second U.S. citizen, identified as Aaron Mark DeHaven, in Peshawar, according to a statement Friday by the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad. Davis told the judge that he should be released from jail because he has diplomatic immunity, the same argument other U.S. officials have used since Davis' arrest. U.S. officials originally said Davis was a diplomat and later revealed he is a CIA contractor, intensifying the already highly charged situation. The case has strained relations between the United States and Pakistan, a key ally in the war against al Qaeda and the Taliban in neighboring Afghanistan, and the shooting deaths have outraged many Pakistanis. -- Raymond Davis, the American accused of killing two Pakistani men, appeared Friday in a Pakistani court, where he was handed documents that detailed the case against him.
