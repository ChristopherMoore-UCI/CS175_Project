" Chile midfielder Arturo Vidal scored the goal that clinched title, netting from the penalty spot after an hour following a foul by Massimo Donati on striker Mirko Vucinic. Edinson Cavani netted a hat-trick to pass 100 goals for Napoli and extend his league-leading tally to 26 this season, while eighth-placed Inter look likely to miss out on European football next season. We've achieved extraordinary things over the past few years, but you always need to raise the bar in football, taking into account the economic difficulties that Italian football is experiencing. "It wasn't easy for us to reclaim our title this year," said coach Antonio Conte after the 1-0 win over Palermo that ended the hopes of second-placed Napoli and prompted Juve fans to invade the pitch at the Alps stadium to get keepsakes of the day, with some even cutting up the goal nets. The "Calciopoli" match-fixing scandal which saw the club stripped of its 2005 and 2006 scudettos and relegated to Serie B still looms large in the history of the "Old Lady" of Turin, but successes in the last two seasons have restored Juve's fortunes as Italy's top football team.
