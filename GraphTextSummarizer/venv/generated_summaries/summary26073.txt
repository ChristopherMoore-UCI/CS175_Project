-- A third minute goal from Gonzalo Higuain gave Real Madrid a 1-0 victory over Valencia, coach Juande Ramos' first Primera Liga win since taking charge of the Spanish champions. The win ended Madrid's run of three straight league defeats and moved them up to 29 points, nine behind leaders Barcelona -- who visit Villarreal on Sunday. The defeat, only Valencia's second of the season after also going down to Barcelona, leaves them on 30 points, just one above Madrid. Gonzalo Higuain is congratulated after scoring Real Madrid's only goal against Valencia. Valencia almost fell two goals behind in the 16th minute when Rafael van der Vaart struck the post with a curling drive.
