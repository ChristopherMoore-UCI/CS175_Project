Cryptographer Karsten Nohl of Security Research Labs in Germany says he discovered the bug after spending three years figuring out how to hack SIM cards, those tiny removable plastic cards found in cell phones and other mobile devices. Physically replacing millions of compromised SIM cards around the world would have been a huge and costly undertaking for carriers -- and a security concern for phone owners. SIM cards can identify the phone's owner and store some sensitive personal data, such as payment information. They could run up charges on a phone bill, intercept phone calls, remotely control phones, track the location of devices and even access financial information. While phones are known to be susceptible to a range of security issues and attacks, the old dependable SIM card was considered safe.
