Rutte's government had depended on the support of Geert Wilders' Party for Freedom, which came in third in parliamentary elections two years ago. The movie, which he released online in March 2008 to international outcry, features disturbing images of terrorist acts superimposed over verses from the Quran in an apparent attempt to paint Islam as a threat to Western society. Queen Beatrix asked Rutte and his ministers to stay in their positions until new elections. No party won enough seats to govern alone in 2010, so Rutte cobbled together a coalition with another center-right party. Wilders himself has been in and out of court for years, accused of inciting hatred against Muslims with his controversial film "Fitna."
