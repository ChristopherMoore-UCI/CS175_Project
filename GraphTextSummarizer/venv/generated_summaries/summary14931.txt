-- Tree houses -- from the luxurious and modern to the basic and cubbyhole-like -- sum up one of the best things about a vacation: getting away from it all. Red Kite Tree Tent, near Builth Wells, Powys, Wales Suspended from trees within a 32-hectare private wood and reached via a small bridge, this wool-insulated orb makes for a romantic retreat-for-two. Tree Top Hut, Brumunddal, Norway These three cabins located eight meters up in the Ringsaker woods 90 minutes north of Oslo are named Spruce, Pine and Larch -- a helpful botanical reminder if you can't identify the kind of tree you're in. Deep in the Guilleries Forest, 80 kilometers north of Barcelona, are 10 individually designed tree houses, suspended up to eight meters high in the trunks of Douglas firs and beech trees. Decked out in simple furnishings, each room sleeps between two and four people -- each also has its own wooden terrace, a transparent roof for star gazing and compost toilet at ground level.
