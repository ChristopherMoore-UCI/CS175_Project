My son is a prisoner of war, and wars end with reconciliation and negotiations with the enemy, and prisoners of war should be part of that dialogue, and I insist that it will be," Bergdahl told the UK news outlet. His son's upbringing in mountainous Hailey may have helped the young man during captivity, Bergdahl told Time magazine in an interview two years ago. In the half-decade that he and wife crusaded for their son's release -- finally won this past weekend -- Bergdahl journeyed deep into the meaning of his son's captivity and war itself, according to media accounts. Can we push this forward and make this happen?" Bergdahl then spoke in English, delivering a message to his only son that revealed a mutual trial of the spirit. "I wake up each morning, and my first thought is, my son is still a prisoner of war in Afghanistan, and I need to do something about that," the father told the Guardian.
