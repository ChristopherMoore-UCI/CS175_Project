NATO's role in Libya highlights the need for more democracy and accountability, Simbarashe Mumbengegwi said late Tuesday at a celebration to mark the anniversary of the United Nations. -- Zimbabwe's foreign minister is calling for reform of the United Nations Security Council following the "extrajudicial" killing of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi. "The past nine months (in Libya) have demonstrated how a few countries ... can easily treat the Security Council and its resolutions with utter contempt and render that important organ of the United Nations most impotent," he said. The resolution calls for NATO to "take all necessary measures" -- without using an occupation force -- to protect civilians and population centers under the threat of attack in Libya. Gadhafi's "brutal extrajudicial killing" shows the Security Council is not accountable to member states of the U.N. General Assembly , he said.
