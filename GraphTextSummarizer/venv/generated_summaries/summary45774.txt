The day's activities included a private drinks reception and three-course luncheon prepared by chef Giada De Laurentiis, who's also the granddaughter of film producer Dino De Laurentiis. The event will recognize 42 emerging British artists working in film, television and video games and promote relationships between Hollywood and the United Kingdom. "A major misconception is it is only something princes play," Ebe Sievwright, a player and coach with the California Polo Club who said he has played with Prince William, said in an interview with CNN. As in American pro sports, polo has its share of "polo wives," and that would include Catherine, William's wife, who will be enjoying the game from the viewing stands. "I think Kate would enjoy polo because if she didn't, she may not have stuck around," Sievwright said.
