The FBI says Mohamed is accused of providing material support to Al Shabaab, the Somali-based group that's linked to al Qaeda. "Not only did he choose to go to Somalia and fight with Al Shabaab, he took a prominent role in trying to recruit people to fight for Al Shabaab," said Carl Ghatas, special agent in charge of the counterterrorism division at the FBI's Washington field office. Mohamed left the United States in the summer of 2012 attempting to join Al Shabaab, the FBI said. In under three years Liban Haji Mohamed has gone from driving a cab in Washington, D.C., to a spot on the FBI's Most Wanted Terrorists list. The bureau on Thursday announced Mohamed's addition to the list as well as a $50,000 reward for any information on the 29-year-old Somali-born U.S. citizen.
