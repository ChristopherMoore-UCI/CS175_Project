Chris Christie is building his own political brand around a persona of strident rejection of the seductions of being an object of political eroticism (he is the anti-Clinton in that regard.) If political parties are essentially brands -- and they are -- then contemporary political conventions should be occasions when those brands are both strengthened and nuanced. Successful brands -- those that are both enduring and changing below the surface -- have a strong hand at the controls. There were a few moments of strong Republican branding last night; I thought the best single line came from Chris Christie, when he said "I believe we have become paralyzed by our desire to be loved." The 2008 Democratic Party, despite a bitter primary battle between Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, was an exception.
