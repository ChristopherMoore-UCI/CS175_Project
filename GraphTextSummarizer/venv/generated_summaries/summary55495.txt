Rambuss says this rather wonderfully, concluding that he wants to think of Crashaw as an "early modern proto-gay man -- or a prototype of a certain kind of gay man -- one profoundly enmeshed in various male cultures and forms of male camaraderie, but who is also in love... with his divas -- real divas, heavenly female figures the likes of Teresa, Mary Magdalene and the Madonna. His button-scattering fervor allowed the heroine to enjoy sexual pleasure, but without having to explicitly agree to sexual acts, a stance that feminist scholars since then have tied to 1980s mores about women's erotic behavior. It refers to romance novels published in the 1980s, novels in which the hero, overcome by lusty passion, quite literally ripped the heroine's blouse, the better to expose her bodacious breasts. What fascinated me about this paper -- and others at the conference -- was its move toward talking freely about depictions and explorations of historical sex as always being predicated on the present. When I'm not being a university professor of Shakespeare studies, I write historical romance novels as Eloisa James.
