"This fight is truly unbelievable," Mayweather, who briefly unseated Tiger Woods as Forbes' best-paid athlete, in 2012, told CNN. " Alvarez, promoted by one of Mayweather's past arch-rivals, Oscar De La Hoya, is the latest challenger to attempt to end the 36-year-old's unblemished record. The 23-year-old has registered more knockouts than Mayweather, 30 to 26, although the Mexican's foes are generally considered inferior. -- "Unbelievable" and an "explosion" is how Floyd Mayweather is selling his tangle with Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez in Las Vegas. Whether Mayweather's ambitious billing of the bout will transpire remains to be seen, but what is not in doubt is the fight will generate the biggest purse in boxing history -- $41.5 million for Mayweather, already one of the world's highest-paid athletes.
