Wayne Coldiron and Leonard Patrick Gonzalez Jr. are facing murder charges in the Thursday night shooting deaths of Byrd and Melanie Billings, said Sheriff David Morgan of Escambia County. Coldiron, 41, surrendered to investigators Sunday and Gonzalez was arrested in neighboring Santa Rosa County on Sunday evening, Morgan said. Morgan said the investigation has become "a window into something bigger," with multiple motives and multiple suspects. In addition, Gonzalez's father, Leonard Patrick Gonzalez Sr., 56, has been arrested on evidence-tampering charges. -- Three suspects are in custody, including two who face murder charges, in what the local sheriff called a "multifaceted"  investigation into the killings of a Gulf Coast couple known for adopting special-needs children.
