"We took a hit 11 months before 9/11, and we came back resilient, a strong force," Farrell says, "like the men and women of New York." "We're so closely connected to the men and women of New York," says Farrell, a native of Boca Raton, Florida. A few months later, on October 12, 2000, a pair of suicide bombers associated with al Qaeda nearly sank the Cole as it refueled in Aden harbor in Yemen. The destroyer -- also known as DDG 67 -- left New York on Tuesday at the close of Fleet Week 2014. Dennis Farrell keeps in his cabin a memento of the last time the storied Navy destroyer cruised into New York Harbor.
