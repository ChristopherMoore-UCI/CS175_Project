Immigration authorities and police raided the Defenders of Christ group in Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, the migration institute said Tuesday night. Authorities released the name of only one of those involved with the group, Jose Arenas Losanger Segovia, a Venezuelan identified as the leader of the organization, which "was characterized by its recruiting of people at the national level. The Defenders of Christ are not officially registered as a religious organization under Mexican law. " The accusations that the cult victims network gathered paint a picture of a man who forced people into labor without pay or threatened to deny food. Garcia called Gonzalez "very dangerous because he manipulates the minds of people to satisfy his whims.
