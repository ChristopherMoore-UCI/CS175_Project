Rivers, 81, died last Thursday in New York's Mount Sinai Hospital, where she was rushed a week earlier after she stopped breathing and her heart stopped beating during treatment at Yorkville Endoscopy. "Yorkville Endoscopy has all necessary airway equipment, including a fiber optic scope available for emergency intubation," it said. "Yorkville Endoscopy has strict policies in place for the criteria of who gets treated in this center versus in a hospital," the statement said. A spokesman for the Yorkville Endoscopy clinic gave CNN its first public statement since Rivers fell ill during a procedure. " "A biopsy of the vocal cords has never been performed at Yorkville Endoscopy," the clinic's statement said.
