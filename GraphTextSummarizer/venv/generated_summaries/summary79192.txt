-- Argentina striker Sergio Aguero may have scored two goals as a second-half substitute on his Manchester City debut, but the club's manager Roberto Mancini maintained the 23-year-old has yet to regain his full fitness. Italian coach Mancini said Aguero, who joined City from Atletico Madrid for a club-record fee in July, was short of peak fitness because of his appearances for Argentina at the recent Copa America. The 2011 FA Cup winners City will play their first away match of the season at Bolton Wanderers on Sunday. Aguero double in Manchester City debut City opened their English Premier League campaign on Monday with a 4-0 victory over top-flight newcomers Swansea City, with Aguero netting a brace after replacing Nigel de Jong on 60 minutes.
