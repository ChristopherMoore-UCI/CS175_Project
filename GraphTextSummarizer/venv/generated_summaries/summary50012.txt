Tonto National Monument Visitors who reach the farthest point along the Apache Trail loop from the entrance at Lost Dutchman State Park will be rewarded with the sight of Tonto National Monument. Apache Lake Like Canyon Lake, Apache Lake was formed by a dam erected along the Salt River. Today, the site offers intimate coves, hiking trails, fishing, boating and water skiing opportunities. Today, those in search of a fortune continue to traverse Lost Dutchman State Park in search of the mine. For travelers wanting a shorter journey, it takes approximately 90 minutes to drive the loop from Lost Dutchman State Park to Tortilla Flat and back.
