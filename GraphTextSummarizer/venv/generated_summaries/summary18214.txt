After hearing some positive things about my local MS Society chapter, I also reached out to it for information and found a mentor who has grown into a lifelong friend. I realized then that things can be replaced, but life and good health are invaluable. I can't say life is a piece of cake. At that point, I decided to accept that MS is part of who I am, and that I needed to learn how to manage it in order to continue living my dreams. I was determined to show this disease who was boss and that I would not let MS define my life's journey!
