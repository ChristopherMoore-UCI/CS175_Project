Tensions run high between Azerbaijan and Armenia over the disputed breakaway region Nagorno-Karabakh, as well as Armenia's military occupation of adjacent Azerbaijani territory. The video surfaced a week after Ismayilova received a threatening letter by mail "containing photos of a personal nature," according to a news release from Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, a democracy advocacy organization that broadcasts her shows and publishes articles that she writes. Presidential spokesman Elnur Aslanov declined to comment on Ismayilova's stories, but he condemned the video a day after it surfaced, blaming it on "subversive forces who try to violate the stability in Azerbaijan." Creating the impression that Ismayilova is connected to Armenia can easily stoke additional passions against her with the Azerbaijani public. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty receives funding from the U.S. government to practice critical journalism in countries where it is perceived to be less free.
