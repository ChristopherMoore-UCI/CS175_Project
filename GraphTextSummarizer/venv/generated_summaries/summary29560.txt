"Iron Man 3" continues to do well at the box office in spite of the new competition from "Star Trek Into Darkness," making an estimated $35.2 million in its third weekend in theaters. The first film stayed in theaters for 21 weeks, ultimately grossing $257.7 million for Paramount.

Check back next weekend for some powerhouse face-offs, with Universal's "Fast & Furious 6," Warner Bros.
