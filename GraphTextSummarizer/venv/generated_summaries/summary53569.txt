Bhattarai, who has a degree in architecture and a doctorate in regional planning, was able to get the crucial support of the regional Madhesi parties from southern Nepal. Nepal also faces the challenge of preparing a republican constitution and political parties have twice extended the deadline to prepare the constitution. Earlier this month Jhalanath Khanal resigned as prime minister after he was unable to persuade the former Maoist rebels to demobilize and reintegrate their fighters in a deal that was agreeable to the other political parties. The Maoists became the biggest party in the 2008 elections and their chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal was prime minister for nine months. The new deadline expires on Wednesday and political parties look likely to have to come to an agreement to extend the deadline a third time.
