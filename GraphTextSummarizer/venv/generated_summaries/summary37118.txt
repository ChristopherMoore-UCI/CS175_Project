Taliban militants kidnapped Farrell and Afghan journalist, Sultan Munadi, on Saturday. "At no point did we see a single NATO soldier, Afghan policeman, soldier or any check to the Taliban's ability to move at will." Farrell said he and Munadi were "paraded" around by their captors. During a pre-dawn raid Wednesday, NATO's International Security Assistance Force plucked Farrell to safety, but did not retrieve the body of Munadi, who died during a fierce firefight between troops and Taliban militants. "I could hear Taliban voices shouting and shooting from trees to our left, I thought," Farrell wrote. Then, on the next night, the aerial activity increased and their Taliban captors grabbed their weapons and headed outside -- leaving Farrell and Munadi behind.
