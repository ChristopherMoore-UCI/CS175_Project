-- Vacation rental site Airbnb apologized Monday in the wake of recent highly publicized rental horror stories and announced new property protections and safety measures for site users. Last month, a San Francisco blogger identifying herself only as "EJ" wrote that her apartment had been ransacked by a person who rented her home via Airbnb. Meanwhile, the incident involving EJ, the San Francisco blogger, took another twist late last week when she wrote that one of the co-founders of Airbnb asked her to shut down her blog or limit its access because of the "potentially negative impact it could have on his company's growth and current round of funding." Brian Chesky, CEO and co-founder of the site, called the days since reports of theft and damage to one host's San Francisco home surfaced "a crash course in crisis management" in a blog post on Airbnb. HLN money expert Clark Howard has said Airbnb is not for everybody, calling it an option for "extra-thrifty" and adventurous travelers.
