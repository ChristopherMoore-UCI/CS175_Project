Gary Go uses iPhone apps to help him compose new material -- and provide instant accompaniment. He says applications such as Chordica and Beatmaker allow him to compose material and provide instant accompaniment for those spontaneous moments when he feels the need for a good sing (during the interview, Go broke into song every five minutes). These days, British singer Gary Go might reach for his iPhone before his keyboard when hammering out a tune. While the iPhone might be a handy tool for musicians (a couple of months ago, I watched as rock 'n' roller Rhett Miller tuned his guitar using an app called Power Tuner), Go says he's still a fan of old-school methods. Because the piece was offered up as a charity song to aid the British Heart Foundation last month, there won't be royalties.
