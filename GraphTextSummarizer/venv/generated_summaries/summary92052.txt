After more than nine years of traveling through the solar system, NASA's New Horizons spacecraft has sent back its first color image of Pluto. New Horizons will use its array of cameras and other instruments to study Pluto's surface and atmosphere, as well as its moons, which number at least five. But scientists have since revised that view because of Pluto's size and location, demoting it to the status of "dwarf planet": a planet that's too small to clear other objects out of its way. By discovering more about Pluto and its moons, New Horizons will shed light on a little-known third zone of the solar system, beyond the rocky planets and the gas giants. The area, known as the Kuiper Belt, contains "mysterious small planets and planetary building blocks," according to NASA.
