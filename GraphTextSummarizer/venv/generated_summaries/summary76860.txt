"He gave up the presidency orally to former vice-president Omar Suleiman without signing any official document, which is not legal by the constitution," lawyer Farid El Deeb said. The trial was adjourned until Monday, when lawyers will start their defense of the former interior minister, who faces charges with Mubarak and his sons. -- Hosni Mubarak should be tried by a special tribunal because he is still president of Egypt and did not sign an official resignation, his lawyer said Sunday. Last week, El Deeb called for Mubarak to be tried in a military court, saying military law dictates that he is still the head of the Egyptian air force. The court proceedings were recounted to CNN by civil rights lawyer Khaled Abu Bakr, who attended the hearing.
