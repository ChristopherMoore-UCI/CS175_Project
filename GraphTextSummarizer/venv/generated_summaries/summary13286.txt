But for Vegalta Sendai who finished in that position in last season's J-League -- Japan's top soccer competition - fourth place was truly a miracle. Despite only ever being a minor footnote in Japan's soccer history, Vegalta Sendai went on an incredible 11 game unbeaten run and sat at the top of the league table. Vegalta Sendai started as they ended last season with a 1-0 win against Kashima Antlers. "What Vegalta and Nadeshiko Japan [Japan's women's national soccer team] show is how not to give up," said Takao. Yet in March last year Vegalta Sendai was looking forward with optimism to a rare season in Japan's top flight.
