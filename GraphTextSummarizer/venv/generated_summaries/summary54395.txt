"Jerry and I worked closely for years to develop and implement training programs that provide local Afghan women with basic health education and skills to provide critical health services and best practices in their communities," said Evan A. Russell, a medical student at Johns Hopkins University and co-founder of Empowerment Health, a nonprofit group focusing on Afghan women and children. "Just this morning, he expressed how excited he was that, after years of development with our Afghan partners, we were already on to our second day of training." More attacks on foreigners Afghanistan has seen a spate of deadly attacks against foreigners in recent weeks. The police guard opened fire on the pediatrician and four others with him at the CURE Hospital's gates, Kabul police said, in violence not unlike the "green-on-blue" attacks in which Afghan security forces fire upon coalition troops. Umanos worked at the Kabul hospital as well as at a community health center, the only two training programs for Afghan doctors in the country, according to his biography at Lawndale's website, which noted that he "felt called" to go to Afghanistan nearly a decade ago. Two of those killed Thursday were a father and son, said Suraya Dalil, Afghan minister of public health.
