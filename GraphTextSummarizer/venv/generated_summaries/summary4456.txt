Inspired by the judo exploits of his father, Ricardo Blas, who became Guam's first Olympian in 1988, Blas Jr has been a judo player since the age of five. "It's simple, keep away from the distractions and get from point A to point B as quick as possible, that's it, period, that's what I learned in Beijing." Both Forbes and Hyman plan to practice what they preach and bring home a medal at some point during their careers, but even without such tangible tokens of success surely Blas Jr, and the Cayman Island challengers represent what the Games is all about: the challenge of taking part. And London will live long in the memory because, unlike in Beijing -- where Blas Jr lost in two visits to the mat and exited the tournament -- here, he won his first round bout against Facinet Keita of Guinea. Underdogs like Ricardo Blas Jr, a 218 kg judokan from the small Pacific island-nation of Guam. His childhood friend and teammate is Kemur Hyman, a 100m sprinter who aged 22, and just a few weeks before the 2012 Olympics, became the first Cayman Island runner to complete his distance in under 10 seconds.
