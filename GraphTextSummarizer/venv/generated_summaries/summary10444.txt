In recent months, the Islamic militant group Boko Haram has made significant territorial gains in northeast Nigeria, but a recent offensive by Nigeria and neighboring countries, Chad and Niger, hopes to roll back these advances. However, on Amanpour, the opposition candidate Buhari dismissed such claims and blamed the government for repeated military setbacks: "The misappropriation of resources provided by the government for weapons means the Nigerian military is unable to beat Boko Haram. "In six weeks, serious advances will be made but I'm not saying we will wipe out Boko Haram," said President Jonathan when asked a question about one of the most pressing issues for many Nigerians -- national security. Voting day was postponed after the Nigerian military said they could not provide security for the elections due to the ongoing offensive against Boko Haram in the north. " Nigeria's upcoming election is set to be the closest since the country returned to democracy in 1999.
