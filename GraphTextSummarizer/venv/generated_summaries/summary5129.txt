The 26-year-old will face European Ryder Cup teammate Luke Donald in Sunday's final at Dove Mountain's Ritz-Carlton course after the Englishman made light work of his matches against Americans Ryan Moore and Matt Kuchar. Donald then thrashed U.S. Ryder Cup player and 2010 PGA Tour money list champion Kuchar 6 & 5 in the first semifinal to be completed. Kaymer was pegged back three times by Watson -- who earlier beat compatriot J.B. Holmes at the first extra hole of their quarterfinal -- but won 15 and 16 before the left-hander birdied 17. The German toppled Englishman Lee Westwood as he first beat Spanish veteran Miguel Angel Jimenez in the quarterfinals and then ended the hopes of American Bubba Watson. Watson struggled to find the green at 18, and Kaymer sank an eight-foot par putt to seal victory.
