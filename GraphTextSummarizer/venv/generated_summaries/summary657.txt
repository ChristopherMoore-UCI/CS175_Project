-- Sen. Barack Obama on Thursday criticized a recent vote by Democratic presidential rival Sen. Hillary Clinton as helping to give President Bush a "blank check" to take military action against Iran. Sen. Barack Obama says Sen. Hillary Clinton has shown "flawed" judgment. Clinton's 2002 vote shows a clear difference in judgment between the two of them, Obama said. "I think Sen. Clinton is a very capable person," he said. Obama said Clinton also had shown "flawed" judgment during the vote to authorize the Iraq war five years ago.
