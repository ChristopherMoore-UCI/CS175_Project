Mercado was found at about 10:30 a.m., said Danilo Rosales Diaz, deputy permanent representative of Nicaragua to the United States. The consul of Nicaragua in New York, Cesar Mercado, 34, was found by his driver, said Police Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne. Mercado had lived in the United States for eight years and had been consul the entire time, Rosales said. Mercado's driver may have been picking him up to take him to meet with the Nicaraguan delegation attending the United Nations General Assembly, police said. A knife was found at the scene, Browne said.
