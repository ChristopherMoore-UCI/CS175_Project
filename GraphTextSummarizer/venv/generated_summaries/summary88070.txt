Chadwick also says the bumper television revenue afforded to clubs in modern football has created a tiered Premier League in which few teams outside the established giants can realistically expect to compete at the top end. "It's easy to succumb to fan pressure and results but there's a particular culture in football generally -- obviously inside clubs as well -- and I'm not sure American owners are in tune with that," he said. "Whilst the Premier League would argue it's a progressive system in the sense that the collective deal does allocate finances to clubs that perhaps those in Spain don't have, even so, such is the magnitude of the payments made to the achieving clubs its almost inevitable you will get the likes of Manchester United, Arsenal and the rest dominating. "So they are making decisions that are not entirely culturally consistent with their experiences and the experiences of English football clubs." And he suggests the approach of Short and Lerner proves American owners still don't fully understand the dynamic of English football as well as they perhaps should.
