Rosie O'Donell: Lohan's not right for Liz Taylor role Angel Alger, a Taylor fan, bought the pink, lavishly-decorated 38-foot travel trailer for $50,000, her life savings, in June. "Liz & Dick," set to air on the Lifetime channel on November 3, chronicles the relationship and two marriages of Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton. But Lohan's publicist said there was no way Lohan, who he said worshiped Taylor, would ever destroy anything connected to her. Photos show cigarette burns on fabric, furniture and even a portrait of Taylor.
