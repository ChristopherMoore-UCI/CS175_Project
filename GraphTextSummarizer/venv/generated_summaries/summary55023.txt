In June 2013, attorneys representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson sued the Lowndes County Sheriff's Office to get access to the department's full investigative file and a copy of school surveillance video recorded around the time Johnson disappeared. In a rare order Thursday, all seven judges in Georgia's Southern Judicial Circuit have recused themselves from the lawsuit filed by the parents of Kendrick Johnson against the Lowndes County Sheriff's Office and a second action, filed by CNN against Lowndes County Schools. In November 2014, CNN filed a lawsuit against Lowndes County Schools to get access to clones of hard drives containing the original recordings of surveillance video given to sheriff's investigators. Johnson's parents, Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, said they never believed investigators' conclusion that their 17-year-old son died while struggling to reach for a shoe at the center of the mat. The recusals come less than a week before the two-year anniversary of the discovery of Johnson's body in the center of a rolled gym mat in the old gym at Lowndes High School on January 11, 2013.
