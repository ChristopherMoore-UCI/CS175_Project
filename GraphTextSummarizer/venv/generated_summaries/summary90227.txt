The online contest's goal is to promote the United Nations Foundation's missions and drum up support for international activism and the U.N. itself. Girl Up encourage American girls to get involved raising awareness of the issues girls face around the world, and the U.N. programs addressing them. The newest prize, announced on Friday morning in San Francisco, is the chance to ride along as a guest during an America's Cup practice run with champion yachtsman James Spithill. How about fun online games and the chance to win fabulous prizes, like backstage passes to meet Lady Gaga? Current prized include the America's Cup ride-along, two VIP tickets and backstage passes to a Lady Gaga show, tickets to see Stevie Wonder at the U.N. Day concert, and a chance to go to the MTV Video Music Awards.
