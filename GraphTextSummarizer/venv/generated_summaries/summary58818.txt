In the interview published last week, Juarez reportedly denied killing Anjelica, saying he was forced by detectives to make a false confession. According to New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly, Juarez, who was 30 at the time of the crime, said he went to an apartment in Queens shared by seven of his relatives and saw Anjelica in the hallway. -- A Manhattan grand jury has indicted Conrado Juarez, who was arrested earlier this month in connection with the 1991 murder of 4-year-old Anjelica Castillo, known for decades only as "Baby Hope." Juarez, 52, did not appear in court for the procedural hearing on Tuesday at his attorney's request. Outside the court on Tuesday, Juarez's attorney cast doubt on the confession, which he said took place after 12 to 14 hours of questioning. The tip led detectives to Anjelica's sister, now an adult; from there, they identified the woman believed to be the girl's mother.
