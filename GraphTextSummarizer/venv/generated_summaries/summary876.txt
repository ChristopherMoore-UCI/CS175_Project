But lawyers for Susan Miller say Delta "uniformly and systematically" ignores this rule and often tells passengers they are only entitled to $25 to $50 a day in expenses. The U.S. Department of Transportation requires airlines to pay up to $3,300 per passenger if bags are "lost, damaged, delayed or pilfered" on a domestic flight. "What happened to (Miller) happens every day to Delta passengers whose bags are delayed," the complaint alleges. " Miller is suing on behalf of herself and other Delta passengers who have found themselves in a similar situation. DOT spokesman Bill Mosley declined to comment on this specific case, but said in general, carriers are not supposed to limit compensation when passengers are forced to buy essentials after their bags are delayed.
