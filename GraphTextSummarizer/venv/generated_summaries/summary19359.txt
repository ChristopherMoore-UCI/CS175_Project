A New Yorker in the fitness business asked to send Aesha workout clothes -- with the hope that someday she might interview Aesha for a program she calls "Celebrity Sweat." To support Aesha in her surgical journey, CNN iReport is asking people who have undergone reconstructive surgery to share their stories. -- Nearly two years after arriving in America with the promise of a new nose and ears, Aesha Mohammadzai has finally begun the process of reconstructive surgery. After nearly six hours, the first of about six anticipated surgeries -- which will be performed over the course of up to two years -- is now complete, said Mati Arsala, who along with his wife has been caring for Aesha. Aesha and the Frederick, Maryland, couple caring for her, Mati Arsala and Jamila Rasouli-Arsala, need the well wishes and good vibes now more than ever.
