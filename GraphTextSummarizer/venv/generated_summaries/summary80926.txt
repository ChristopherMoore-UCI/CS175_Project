In a statement on Saturday, Canada's Prime Minister Stephen Harper condemned the military intervention as "a clear violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity" and in violation of Russia's obligations under international law. Canada supports the deployment to Ukraine of international monitors from the United Nations and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, Harper said. Hague said Britain will join other countries in pulling out of preparatory talks for the next G8 summit of industrialized nations, which is to be held in Sochi, Russia, in June, "and then we will keep our approach to further G8 meetings under review. "Military action against Ukraine by forces of the Russian Federation is a breach of international law, it contravenes the principles of the NATO-Russia Council and the Partnership for Peace. And we believe that our Western partners and the entire global community will support the territorial integrity and unity of Ukraine and will do everything we can to stop the military conflict provoked by the Russian Federation in Europe.
