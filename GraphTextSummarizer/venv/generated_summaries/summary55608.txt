" The incident, during which Chisora claimed Haye hit him over the head with a bottle, is still being investigated by Munich police, although police spokesman Gottfried Schlicht said: "Until we speak to David Haye, nothing more can happen. Haye -- who retired from boxing following his defeat to Klitschko's younger brother Wladimir last year and is therefore not under the jurisdiction of the BBBC -- had appeared at the press conference to take issue with Vitali's management, who he claims have reneged on a deal to fight him later this year. Despite Chisora issuing an apology for the fracas, which occured after his points defeat to WBC champion Vitali Klitschko in Munich, the BBBC has released a statement saying that a hearing has been arranged for March 14. -- Heavyweight Dereck Chisora faces being sanctioned by the British Boxing Board of Control, after being called to a hearing next month following his brawl with fellow-Briton David Haye at a press conference on Saturday. Board secretary Robert Smith said: "Dereck Chisora has been called to appear before the stewards of the British Boxing Board of Control on Wednesday, 14th March under Regulation 25 (misconduct), with regard to his behavior prior, during and after his contest for the World Boxing Council heavyweight championship against Vitali Klitschko on Saturday, 18th February in Munich."
