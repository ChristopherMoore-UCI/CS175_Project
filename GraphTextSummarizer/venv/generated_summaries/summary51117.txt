"By abandoning jihad, may Allah protect us from that, Islam is destroyed and Muslims fall into inferior positions. "I will take revenge on their behalf, inshallah, and I really wish that the hearts of the Muslims will be pleased with this attack inshallah." He said the "revenge attack" will be carried out "in the name of all the mujahedeen, the fighters and the weak and the oppressed Muslims," he said, mentioning Baitullah Mehsud and Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, and Muslims and Arabs who have been martyred. "Eight years have passed with the war in Afghanistan and you will see that the war of the Muslims has just started, and we will show you how Islam will spread throughout the whole world." And Muslims are gonna do that."
