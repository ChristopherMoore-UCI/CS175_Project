Let's see whether Republican voters really want a moderate of Romney's stripe to lead them. He won a narrow victory in Ohio and in his home state of Michigan because of moderate Republican voters in urban and suburban areas. He finished respectably in Oklahoma (27%) and Tennessee (23%), but still badly trailed Santorum -- and even Mitt Romney -- in these conservative states where he would have had the best chance to garner support. It seems fairly certain that without Gingrich, Santorum would now be the clear front-runner and some people would be calling for Romney to depart the race. While it has not always been the case, Republican moderates often lose.
