According to supermarket tracking services, Portland leads the United States in percentage of craft beer sales with nearly 40% of beer purchases being craft beer. There are no fewer than four places to get Portland-brewed beers at a Trail Blazers NBA home game; Widmer and Lompoc Brewing each make special beers for the Portland Timbers soccer team and BridgePort brews a special beer for the Hillsboro Hops minor league baseball team. We keep finding new places to serve beer, such as growler-fill stations, which have opened in major grocery stores, as stand-alone establishments and in a Southeast Portland mini-mart that anywhere else would sell fried chicken and half-racks of Milwaukee's Best. Speaking of growlers (large, re-fillable bottles that allow you to take large amounts of freshly tapped beer to go), the Portland-designed, Steampunk-styled uKeg keeps beer cold and carbonated and people love the idea: Growlerwerks LLC hoped to raise $75,000 in its Kickstarter campaign and so far nearly 5,000 people have donated $665,000 -- with about three weeks to go. Plus, Widmer's Collaborator program brews homebrewers' winning recipes on a commercial scale, giving Oregonians beers that'd otherwise never make it to market and donating part of the profit to an Oregon Brew Crew scholarship fund.
