The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) announced Monday the final Medicare Advantage rates for 2014. About 25% of the 47 million Americans on Medicare pay more to have Medicare Advantage. The plans vary, but they offer the elderly more than they would get with regular Medicare. All the plans cap a person's out-of-pocket expenses, while regular Medicare does not. Ads from the America's Health Insurance Plans' Coalition for Medicare Choices called the proposal "drastic" and "too much" and featured seniors saying they can't afford to pay more for health care.
