Government officials have argued that the new labor reforms will reduce unemployment and give workers more rights, such as an annual 20-hour paid leave for training. We think unemployment will increase because these reforms directly attack workers," said Ismael Cabrera, a protester. Protesters packed the streets of Madrid, marching against measures they said will make it cheaper and easier to fire workers. -- Spain's largest unions carried out mass protests across the country Sunday in response to labor-market changes announced by the government. Sunday's demonstrations were the first major union protests against Spain's new conservative government, which took office two months ago.
