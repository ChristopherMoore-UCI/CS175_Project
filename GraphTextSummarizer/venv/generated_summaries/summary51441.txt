"Contrary to media reports, U.S. forces were not involved in any operations involving Ansar al Sharia leader Abu Iyadh today in Libya," Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John F. Kirby told CNN. But the United States denied any involvement in the reported arrest of Seifallah Ben Hussein Mokni, who is also known as Abu Iyadh and heads Ansar al Sharia in Tunisia. Ansar al Sharia in Libya, another Islamist militia group, was believed to be involved in the 2012 U.S. Consulate attack that killed four Americans in Benghazi, Libya. Ansar al Sharia in Tunisia denied through its official Twitter account that its leader had been arrested in Libya. The Tunisian state media report accused Ansar al Sharia in Tunisia of ties to political assassinations in the country.
