The problem of collisions involving space debris is not a new one. They contacted Kelso because CSSI operates a service that looks for close satellite approaches, he said. The last major space debris collision was in 2009 between Iridium 33, an operational U.S. communications satellite, and Cosmos 2251, a decommissioned Russian satellite, Kelso said. "There has been a piece of debris catalogued by U.S. Strategic Command as a result of that collision," Kelso said. U.S. tracking sensors determined the missile collision created hundreds of pieces of space debris, according to a U.S. official at the time.
