Singapore's Ministry of Manpower says it's conducting an "ongoing" review of domestic workers rights and the responsibilities of employers, including the "suggestion" of legislated rest days. "What's really striking is that Singapore has done a good job of addressing cases of physical and sexual abuse against domestic workers... but they have really fallen behind the norm in terms of not including these workers under the labor law and considering them as workers," says Nisha Varia from Human Rights Watch. " "Tamarind," as she's known, lists the rules on her blog, which is advertised as "primarily for employers who have suffered at the hands of bad maids." While the standard contract asks parties to nominate one day off a month (to be paid in lieu, if the maid chooses to forgo it), the Act only requires employers to provide "adequate rest. Human Rights Watch says no matter what the review reveals, the government has a moral duty to legislate days off.
