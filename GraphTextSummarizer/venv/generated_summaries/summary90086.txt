A: The eruption will continue for a while, but the activity will become less and less explosive, said volcanologist Simon Day of University College London. Disruption to air travel as a result of volcanoes happens frequently in the northern Pacific, along the Alaska-to-Japan route, where four to five days a year ash levels force flights to be diverted, Day said. When under-glacier eruptions occur, like this one in Iceland, the volcanoes tend to produce finer particles of ash, which stay in the air longer, Day said. They are made up of rocks, minerals, and volcanic glass, which together form volcanic ash, the WMO said. A: The whiteness of the plume suggests it contains mainly steam and little ash, the WMO said.
