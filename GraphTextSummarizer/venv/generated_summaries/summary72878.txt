Meanwhile, Iran's Intelligence Ministry, the government body that keeps tabs on political dissenters, warned the media against revealing what it called "classified data" after reports Monday that Ahmadinejad had purged four senior intelligence officials, according to Press TV. Ali Larijani said that a special parliamentary panel "had carried out investigations into the situation in [Iranian] jails and the treatment of detainees and it should also look into whether jail rape allegations are true or false," Press TV reported, citing Tabnak, a Web site associated with opposition politician Mohsen Rezaie. Iran's influential parliament speaker has called for an investigation into allegations that post-election detainees were raped while in custody, state-run media said. In the aftermath of the election, the media has repeatedly reported on the shuffles within the Intelligence Ministry, including Ahmadinejad's firing of former Minister Gholam Hossein Mohseni Ejei, which drew the ire of Iran's conservatives. Iran has put on trial some 100 politicians, journalists and activists accused of involvement in the alleged post-election revolution while the treatment of detainees in Iran's prisons has become an increasingly high-profile issue, with human-rights groups accusing guards of conducting harsh interrogations, beatings, sleep deprivation, and threats of torture to coerce false confessions.
