The technology could even be used to develop "zero-power" architectures "where power consumption is so low that we could power entire digital devices off solar energy, or off the energy that surrounds us every day", like vibrations or movements, ambient wireless signals or solar power. NTV could find itself in a host of applications ranging from processors and mobile devices to embedded devices, appliances and automobiles. So far, Intel has had some difficulties finding its way into mobile devices because of power consumption issues. It's heat-sink free, and rather than operating at those super low thresholds all the time, it switches into NTV mode (under 10 mW in power consumption) when its workload is light. The chip -- codenamed "Claremont" -- is known as a near-threshold voltage processor, which allows transistors to operate at super-low, near "threshold" voltages to increase efficiency and decrease energy consumption.
