-- At 14, while attending the U.S. Naval Sea Cadet camp in Florida, Kaylee Marie Radzyminski asked one question to troops returning from overseas military service. In addition to Tunes 4 the Troops, Radzyminski also runs track, maintains a 4.0 GPA, and works night shifts at a restaurant, admitting that life can get "a bit stressful sometimes." Kaylee Marie Radzyminski, center in black shirt, spends her Saturdays sorting CDs and DVDs for troops overseas. "They sacrifice so much for us, why can't I do a little bit to give back to them?" Reaching out to friends, classmates and community members for donated discs of all kinds, Radzyminski's own community joined her cause.
