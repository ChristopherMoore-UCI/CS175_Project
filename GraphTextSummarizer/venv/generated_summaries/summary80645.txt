-- When Ashton Kutcher posed for a photo with a high school student at a University of Iowa football game on September 11, it was "unintentional and accidental," not a violation of college athletic recruiting rules, the NCAA decided Monday. The NCAA bans boosters, such as Kutcher, from meeting with potential recruits because of the influence they could have on a student's choice of schools, school spokesman Steve Roe said. The NCAA informed Iowa's athletics department Monday afternoon that it accepted the school's response. "As part of that decision, the NCAA has fully cleared the recruits involved, and has determined the UI's actions to be of a 'secondary' nature in terms of violation of NCAA policy," the university said in a written statement Monday. Kutcher said in his own tweet, sent the same day from Iowa's Kinnick Stadium during the Iowa-Iowa State game.
