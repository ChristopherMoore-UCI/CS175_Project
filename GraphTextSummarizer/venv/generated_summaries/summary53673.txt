-- Swiss scientists say levels of polonium-210 measured in the personal effects and body tissues of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat "moderately" support a proposition that he died of polonium poisoning. "These results imply that, at the time of his death, Mr. Arafat had an amount of polonium-210 present in his system that would be significantly detrimental to his health." French authorities -- responding to a request from Arafat's widow -- opened a murder inquiry into his death in 2012 after high levels of polonium-210 were detected on Arafat's toothbrush, clothing and his keffiyeh, the trademark black-and-white headscarf he often wore. The "chain of custody" of Arafat's personal effects -- from the time he died and when the center began to study them in 2012 -- is unclear, it said. Paddy Regan, a professor of radionuclide metrology in the physics department at the University of Surrey in Guildford, England, agreed that the years that have elapsed since Arafat's death make it more difficult to estimate how much isotope was there originally.
