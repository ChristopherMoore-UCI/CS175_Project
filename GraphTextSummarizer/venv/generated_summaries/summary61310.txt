" Rebel fighters linked to Chechnya have used bombs to target passenger trains in the past. Sixty passengers and train crew were injured in the derailment, and 38 of them were admitted to hospital, a spokeswoman for rail operator Russian Railways said. Russia launched a terrorism investigation on Tuesday after a bomb derailed an express train traveling from Moscow to St Petersburg, overturning carriages and injuring dozens of passengers. Rescuers work at the site of train derailment near the Malaya Vishera village caused by an apparent explosion. The head of Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB), Nikolai Patrushev, linked the bombing to an insurgency in the south of the country around Chechnya, where Moscow has been fighting a long rebellion against its rule.
