Hundreds of snipers were stationed on the roofs of several buildings and security forces were shelling the city with mortars and anti-aircraft weapons, a witness said. The announcement came late in a day during which Syrian tanks and security forces swooped down hard on the restive city of Daraa, witnesses said. Human Rights Watch said army troops and other security forces have killed more than 300 protesters since March 16. People protested the arrests, security forces greeted the demonstrators harshly, and that emboldened more rallies. The unrest began in Daraa in March after teens were arrested for scribbling anti-government graffiti.
