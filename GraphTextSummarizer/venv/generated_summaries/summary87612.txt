Hearing about your story, I felt it was important to share with you my journey to healing and recovery from kidnapping. -- Dear Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight, My name is Ronique Laquette Smith, and I, too, am a survivor of a kidnapping. Peace, love and many blessings, Ronique Laquette Smith The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ronique Laquette Smith. In 1974, at the age of 4, I was forced to live like a fugitive on the run, from cheap motel to cheap motel -- sometimes sleeping in cars. I also went to the Jaycee Dugard foundation for intensive reunification healing with my family last summer in 2012.
