Some have described "Deep Throat" as the first porno film that attempted to tell a story, albeit a ludicrous one. " 'Deep Throat' had a plot," said Darwin Porter, author of "Inside Linda Lovelace's Deep Throat: Degradation, Porno Chic and the Rise of Feminism." " Flynt said Traynor prostituted Lovelace, forcing her to make adult films. " But not everyone sees the matter as that black and white, including actor Chris Noth, who plays "Deep Throat" producer Anthony Romano in "Lovelace." The author says Lovelace demonstrated considerably more free will during the three years after "Deep Throat," during which, he says, the actress capitalized on her fame to run with a celebrity crowd. " Lovelace eventually renounced "Deep Throat" and Hollywood.
