Meanwhile, Iraq's government submitted a revised draft budget to members of parliament Sunday, boosting projected public spending amid rising oil prices and slight decreases in the country's expected oil exports, according to government spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh. The news comes two days after al-Maliki said he would cut his salary in half amid growing unrest over poor public services and water shortages. Thousands have rallied across the country in the past week, railing against rampant poverty, a 45% national unemployment rate and shortages of food, electricity and water, including several hundred in three different parts of Baghdad on Friday. The budget is based on an average oil price of $76.5 per barrel and projected exports of 2.2 million barrels of oil per day, including 100,000 daily barrel exports from Iraq's autonomous Kurdish region. Protesters around Iraq have said popular uprisings in both Egypt and Tunisia inspired their weeklong demonstrations for improvements in government services and their quality of life.
