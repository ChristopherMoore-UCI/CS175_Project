-- RadarOnline on Wednesday released another audio recording of an explosive argument purportedly between actor Mel Gibson and his ex-girlfriend, Oksana Grigorieva, in which the man can be heard threatening to burn their house down. An attorney for Gibson's ex-wife, Robyn, told CNN Tuesday that she also would not be commenting on the recordings. Grigorieva filed a restraining order against Gibson alleging that he struck her in the face, according to her spokesman, Stephen Jaffe. Longtime friend and former "Maverick" co-star Jodie Foster and Danny Glover, Gibson's co-star in the popular "Lethal Weapon" film series, declined to comment on the allegations, according to the Los Angeles Times. Grigorieva, 40, has acknowledged that the female voice on the recordings is hers and that the other voice is Gibson's.
