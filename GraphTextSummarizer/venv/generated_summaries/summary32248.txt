MLB rule committee votes to impose rule eliminating home plate collisions I went to a Detroit vs. Boston game on a June night in 1983. Runner smashes into catcher, who must "tag" him with the ball (and not drop it) before that runner can step on home plate. Bochy, Mike Scioscia (Angels), Joe Girardi (Yankees), Joe Maddon (Rays), Mike Matheny (Cardinals), Ned Yost (Royals), Bob Melvin (A's), Fredi Gonzalez (Braves), John Gibbons (Blue Jays), Mike Redmond (Marlins). Is the "collision at home plate" such a key element of a centuries-old sport that the show must go on? "Collisions at home plate."
