" Osteen is describing a sort of faith healing or at least the power of prayer, and it is an issue that deeply divides the medical community. It turns out that truly understanding optimism and relying on it to help you during tough times requires practicing it on a daily basis, and that may be the most important message Joel Osteen gives us this holiday season. While I know many people who have difficulty maintaining eye contact, that wasn't the case for Osteen. He started by telling the story of his own mother, Dodie Osteen, who was diagnosed with terminal cancer back in 1981. At its worst, they say, people may rely solely on prayer instead of proven, effective treatments.
