The speaker-elect said he will  recommend to the Republican Steering Committee that Thornberry be appointed the  vice chairman of the powerful Armed Services Committee. -- Rep.  Mike Rogers, a former FBI agent and vocal critic of the Obama administration's  dealing with terrorists, will head the House Intelligence Committee when  Republicans take control of the House next year. Rogers wants terror suspects to be considered enemy combatants who would not be read their Miranda rights and would be put on trial before military tribunals held at Guantanamo. Rep. Pete Hoekstra, R-Michigan, said "intelligence is at the tip of the  spear in the fight against terrorists and America's foreign adversaries, and Mike is a  strong leader to conduct oversight of such a critical issue to the  U.S." Since the Intelligence  Committee is considered a select committee, the speaker has the sole  responsibility of appointing its chairman. In a prepared statement,  Boehner said, "Mike Rogers' experience and expertise has proven invaluable  throughout his tenure on the Intelligence  Committee."
