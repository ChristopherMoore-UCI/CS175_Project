Before the mine collapse, Ticona promised Segovia he would be in the room when she gave birth. "Immediately it gave all the miners there a lot of excitement," Hector Ticona said. The day after the birth, Hector Ticona carried Chilean newspapers he was saving for his son with front-page photos of Elizabeth holding the new baby. Hector Ticona recalled. "I have been talking to her and telling her Daddy's OK," Segovia told CNN a few weeks before she gave birth.
