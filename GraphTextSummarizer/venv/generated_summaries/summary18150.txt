"We've found that stories people choose to explicitly share from third party apps are typically more interesting and get more engagement in News Feed than stories shared from third party apps without explicit action," Facebook's Peter Yang wrote in a post on the company's blog for developers. They include a new tool that lets app users share their activity directly in Messenger chats (say, with all your friends who still play "FarmVille?") and the ability to add the "Like" button, already appearing on more than 10 million Web pages, to mobile apps.

" Yang said that app creators will have to start specifically request that actions from their app be automatically shared. The social-media giant has announced it will be giving those posts less clout in its News Feed algorithm -- the tool that decides which posts you're mostly likely to want to see -- while giving extra emphasis to actions your friends choose to share.
