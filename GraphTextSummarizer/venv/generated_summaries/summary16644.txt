"Sen. Hagel has no intention of getting involved in any of the campaigns, and is not planning to endorse either candidate," Hagel spokesman Jordan Stark said. Tuesday, after endorsing Obama, former Rep. Jim Leach of Iowa, a Republican, said he hoped the Illinois senator would consider Hagel as his running mate or for "a serious position in an Obama administration." The announcement came just hours after a former GOP congressman suggested Hagel as a possible running mate for Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama, one of Hagel's Senate colleagues. -- Sen. Chuck Hagel, a leading Republican voice on international affairs and an outspoken critic of the war in Iraq, won't endorse either major-party presidential candidate in 2008, a spokesman said Tuesday. Hagel is a longtime friend of Sen. John McCain, the presumptive GOP presidential nominee, and briefly mulled a 2008 presidential bid of his own.
