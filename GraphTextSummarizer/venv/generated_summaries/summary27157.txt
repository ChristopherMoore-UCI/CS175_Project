The man accused of trying to blow up a commercial flight with a bomb hidden in his underwear entered court Tuesday shouting anti-American statements and claiming that Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S. citizen and accused terrorist who was killed in a drone attack in Yemen, is still alive. "The mujahideen will wipe out the U.S., the cancer!" Jury selection began Tuesday in the trial of Umar Farouq AbdulMutallab, the Nigerian man who is accused of trying to detonate an explosive device aboard a Christmas Day 2009 flight to Detroit. Wearing a white prison T-shirt and a black cap, AbdulMutallab said he had instead wanted to wear "a Yemeni belt with a dagger" when asked by U.S. District Judge Nancy Edmunds why he wasn't dressed more appropriately. U.S. officials say the terror group al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula was behind the alleged bombing attempt. He was a passenger on Northwest Airlines Flight 253 en route from the Netherlands to Detroit on Christmas Day 2009.
