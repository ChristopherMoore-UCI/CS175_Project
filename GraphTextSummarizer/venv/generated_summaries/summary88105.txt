As a modern royal couple in a modern royal family, William and Kate will start their married life in the most ancient of royal buildings, stepping into the future with one foot firmly in the past and an obliging nod to those kings and queens buried there. -- The choice of Westminster Abbey as location for the most eagerly awaited royal wedding in 30 years has taken most royal experts by surprise; their consensus of opinion over the past week suggested that St. Paul's would oversee the marriage of Prince William and Catherine Middleton. When William brought Kate out to face the world's press last week, standing together as equals, so obviously in love, you could see how successful Charles and Diana have been. But inevitably, in the modern world, Westminster Abbey is inextricably linked to the funeral of Princess Diana, and this is the reason many considered it an inappropriate venue for William and Kate's wedding. The marriage of William and Kate at Westminster Abbey will be just the tonic a jaded Great Britain needs.
