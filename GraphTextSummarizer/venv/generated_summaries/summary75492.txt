"The safety of my fans has always been my top priority and had I known that there was any distress putting people in jeopardy within the venue I would have ended my show immediately," Aoki said in the statement, adding that he was canceling a subsequent show in Bilbao, Spain, "out of respect for those who lost their lives and those who are injured." Aoki released a statement Thursday saying he was "devastated" by the deaths and injuries. -- Three young women are dead and two are in serious condition after being crushed by a crowd at a Halloween party in Madrid early Thursday, police said. The women were among thousands of attendees at "Thriller Music Park," an event at Madrid Arena that featured electronic music artists and a costume contest. Thousands of partygoers were unaware of the stampede until after police arrived and began moving people out slowly.
