California's Nancy Pelosi, the House minority leader, stuck to her party's main legislative focus Thursday -- "Medicare, Medicare, Medicare." It was Breitbart who posted the heavily edited and incomplete video of a speech by U.S. Agriculture Department employee Shirley Sherrod last year. -- Top Democrats in the House are giving no credence to those looking for a real scandal over a lewd picture that appeared on the Twitter account of New York Congressman Anthony Weiner. Andrew Breitbart runs the conservative website biggovernment.com, which first reported the photo on Weiner's Twitter account. Weiner has insisted that he did not post the photo, which shows the lower body of a man wearing underwear.
