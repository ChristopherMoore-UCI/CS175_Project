Officials estimate the death toll between 1,500 and 1,600, but Kapadia says he thinks the numbers could skyrocket as water recedes and more bodies and animals surface. Mobs of hundreds have pounced on aid workers delivering food or water. "Everywhere we go we see eight to 10 feet of water," said Kapadia, who traveled through inundated villages between Shikarpur and Sukkur. Kapadia said he can't shake the image in his mind of young children chasing him as he tossed water from a moving truck. He didn't expect to use his off-roading skills to deliver life-saving supplies to flood victims across nearly impassible terrain and waters.
