Her disappearance prompted a massive ground and aerial search, Dyer County Sheriff Jeff Box noted in early November. "It's very emotional for Mr. Swift and the family," Timothy Naifeh, a lawyer for the woman's husband, David Swift, said in a statement. Her car, a 2004 white Nissan Murano, was recovered soon thereafter on a main road in northern Dyer County with a flat tire, according to police. "We're doing everything we can to be together right now," Preston Swift, an older son of Swift, added November 22 to HLN's Jane Velez-Mitchell. Box said in an e-mail Monday that the body, later identified as Swift, was found "concealed ... by undergrowth and vegetation for some time" around 1:30 p.m. Saturday off Harness Road.
