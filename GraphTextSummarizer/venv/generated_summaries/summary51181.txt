-- Olympic athlete Oscar Pistorius will be served with an indictment in court next week following the completion of the investigation into the killing of his girlfriend, South African police said. August 19 -- when he appears in court -- would have been Steenkamp's 30th birthday. Following his court appearance Monday, the case is likely to be postponed while the prosecution and defense agree on a trial date, police said in a statement. The athlete's family said in June that he would resume running using his blade-shaped prosthetic legs. The police investigation team "is convinced that the accused has a charge to answer," the police statement said.
