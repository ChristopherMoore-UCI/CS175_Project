Chastain's other entry, "Zero Dark Thirty," fell only 28 percent in its sophomore weekend of wide release to $17.6 million, which brought the Osama Bin Laden huntdown's total to $55.9 million. Not only did the red-headed Oscar nominee win a Golden Globe last weekend for her work in "Zero Dark Thirty," which forced her to take a night off from her Broadway run â€” Both films played primarily to older male audiences (who are also seeing "Zero Dark Thirty" and "Gangster Squad"), and they may have cannibalized each other over their first three days. If they had opened "Silver Linings Playbook" in wide release, as planned, we almost certainly wouldn't be talking about it 10 weeks later.) Still, "Gangster Squad's" second weekend was better than the debuts of new releases "Broken City" and "The Last Stand," which both flopped out of the gate.
