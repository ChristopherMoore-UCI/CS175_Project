The full statement delivered by Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak concerning Malaysia Airlines MH370 Monday: "This evening I was briefed by representatives from the UK Air Accidents Investigation Branch -- or AAIB. "It is therefore with deep sadness and regret that I must inform you that, according to this new data, flight MH370 ended in the southern Indian Ocean. "Based on their new analysis, Inmarsat and the AAIB have concluded that MH370 flew along the southern corridor, and that its last position was in the middle of the Indian Ocean, west of Perth. Using a type of analysis never before used in an investigation of this sort, they have been able to shed more light on MH370's flight path. They informed me that Inmarsat, the UK company that provided the satellite data which indicated the northern and southern corridors, has been performing further calculations on the data.
