For now, American F1 fans can look forward to seeing a homegrown racer in action at next month's U.S. Grand Prix. At this year's Canadian Grand Prix, Rossi reacquainted himself with an F1 car by competing in first practice. Home fans at next month's United States Grand Prix in Texas will have an American driver to cheer on for the first time. Rossi is the only American racer involved in F1 and the first to hit the track since Scott Speed in 2007. " Speed was the last American to compete in F1 but it's been six years since he lost his Toro Rosso seat to reigning triple world champion Sebastian Vettel.
