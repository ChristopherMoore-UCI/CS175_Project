"President Reagan, Mastermind" (season 12, 1986) To his critics, Ronald Reagan was an infuriatingly disengaged president -- but, as "SNL" producer Lorne Michaels has observed, he was a hard president to criticize because he was so sunny and optimistic. Finally, Jim Downey and Franken came up with this sketch, with a cutting Phil Hartman as Reagan. Dan Aykroyd was at his Nixonesque best as the 37th president, a paranoid figure taking his anger out on Henry Kissinger (John Belushi) and the paintings of presidents on the White House walls. And sorry to disappoint you, but "More Cowbell" isn't among them: "The Final Days" (first season, 1976) -- "Saturday Night Live" will begin its 40th season Saturday, and in its first 39 years it's produced at least 39 hilarious sketches.
