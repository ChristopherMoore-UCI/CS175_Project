Before I'd heard these and the other horrifying details of this attack against one of the Arab world's most notable artists, I asked Ferzat -- an Arab-Santa-looking character with a smile that could cheer up Tilda Swinton -- if he was sure his hands were broken to stop him from drawing cartoons critical of Syria's leader, Bashar al-Assad. That's why Ferzat's hands became some of the most feared objects in Syria. Ferzat drew al-Assad standing on the side of the road with his thumb in the air, ready to hitchhike out of Syria. Using a newspaper contact in Kuwait, Ferzat arranged to leave Syria and seek treatment in a hospital there. SANA, the Syrian state news agency, reported Ferzat "was attacked by veiled people" and that "authorities concerned are conducting an investigation."
