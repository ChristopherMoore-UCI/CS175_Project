Harriet Nicholson was pronounced dead at approximately 3:22 a.m. Sunday at Bellevue Hospital, said Ellen Borakove from the office of the chief medical examiner. Nicholson was among those on board a Bell 206 Jet Ranger that plunged into the water on October 4, moments after pilot Paul Dudley had radioed that his aircraft was experiencing problems, National Transportation Safety Board member Mark Rosekind said last month. -- A 60-year-old woman on Sunday became the third person to die as a result of a helicopter crash last month in New York's East River, said a spokeswoman for the city's medical examiner's office. Marra was trapped in the craft's back seat as it sank, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said. U.S. Rep. Carolyn Maloney, who represents Manhattan's East Side in Congress, said in a previous statement that she was "saddened and deeply concerned" about the crash.
