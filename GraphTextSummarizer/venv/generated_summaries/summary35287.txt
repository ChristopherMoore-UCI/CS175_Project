Lohan will remain free on bond while her lawyer appeals the jail sentence for the probation violation, but she must immediately start serving 480 hours of community service, Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Stephanie Sautner said. "It's undisputed that Ms. Lohan walked out of the store with the necklace on," Holley said. The community service, includes 360 hours at a downtown Los Angeles women's center, which Judge Sautner suggested might cause Lohan to behave better after seeing "how truly needy women and women who have fallen on real hard times have to live. Lohan has been in court nine times in the past year, mostly for hearings related to probation violations for her 2007 drunk driving case. Sautner did not buy the defense argument that Lohan accidentally walked out of a Venice, California, jewelry store wearing a necklace that later appeared around her neck in photographs taken five days later.
