Five of the abducted are French nationals, French foreign ministry spokesman Bernard Valero has told reporters. -- Al Qaeda's North African wing, known as al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, said it is responsible for last week's kidnapping of five French nationals in Niger, the Arabic-language news network Al-Jazeera reported Tuesday. " Seven people linked to a French nuclear energy company were kidnapped in the West African nation of Niger last week. It was not immediately clear Tuesday whether AQIM was also claiming responsibility for the other two hostages. "Even though security was tight in the location and the security guards were many, the soldiers of Islam took control of all security and kidnapped five French nuclear experts that work at the company Areva.
