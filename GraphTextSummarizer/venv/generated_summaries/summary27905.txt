A Fort Hood official, who insisted on anonymity because of the ongoing criminal investigation into the shootings, said, "Since this matter was raised during the Article 32 hearing, it is for the Article 32 hearing officer to decide whether to make further inquiries to the soldier's chain of command for additional information." Aviles also testified that he saw the gunman stop to reload and considered rushing him. Lance Aviles spoke of the video as he testified on the third day of the Article 32 military hearing for Maj. Aviles said he was told by a non-commissioned officer, who Aviles said was acting on the orders of an officer, to delete the video on the same day of the shooting. Megan Martin, speaking via video from Kandahar, Afghanistan, said she constantly relives the events of the day. The shooting at Fort Hood was captured on video by a soldier using his cell phone camera as he hid from the shooter, but he was ordered to erase it, the soldier said Friday.
