Mukundan said sustained anti-piracy efforts by Indonesian authorities have resulted in declines every year. Nigeria ranks second in world piracy with 40 reported incidents last year, including five hijackings and 39 crew members kidnapped. "The 2008 statistics surpass all figures recorded by the PRC since it began its worldwide reporting function in 1991," said IMB Director Captain Pottengal Mukundan. More than 121 attacks were reported there in 2003 but only 28 were reported last year, most of which were opportunistic, low-level attacks, Mukundan said. While 2008 appeared to be a bad year for piracy, the report noted declines in other areas of the world, especially in Indonesia.
