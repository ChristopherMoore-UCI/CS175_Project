In a statement Saturday, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry reiterated his own country's "serious concern about the limits on freedom of peaceful assembly and expression in Egypt." Rights groups have expressed concern about what they call an increasingly repressive environment in Egypt, where more than 2,200 people have been killed since the ouster of Morsy, who had replaced strongman Hosni Mubarak after he stepped aside in February 2011 amid the massive anti-government demonstrations that were part of the Arab Spring. Egyptian voters who went to the polls this week have overwhelmingly approved a new constitution, a spokesman for Egypt's electoral commission announced Saturday in a national broadcast. "As Egypt's transition proceeds, the United States urges the interim Egyptian government to fully implement those rights and freedoms that are guaranteed in the new constitution for the benefit of the Egyptian people, and to take steps toward reconciliation." "It's what comes next that will shape Egypt's political, economic and social framework for generations," Kerry said.
