Many Nigerians view the subsidy as the only benefit of living in an oil-producing country that has little infrastructure, poor roads, high unemployment and intermittent electric power. The unions were comparing President Goodluck Jonathan to former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, who is accused of ordering security forces to fire on protesters in Egypt last year. Other violence erupted in northern Nigeria Tuesday and Wednesday, although it was unclear whether the incidents were related to the strike. -- Two Nigerian trade unions accused the country's president of using "armed thugs" to attack protesters, and urged demonstrators to continue their nationwide strike against high fuel prices on Wednesday and beyond. "In a Mubarak-style response to the peoples' protests, the Jonathan administration brought into Abuja, thugs armed with various weapons including guns," the Nigeria Labour Congress and the Trade Union Congress of Nigeria said in a joint statement late Tuesday night.
