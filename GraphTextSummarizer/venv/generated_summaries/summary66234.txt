Ojukwu said the ethnic backgrounds of those arrested are mixed, but they are all from the area near Jos. Human Rights Watch said the attacks by Muslims with guns, machetes and knives apparently were in retaliation for the previous attacks against Islamic communities and the theft of cattle from herdsmen. -- More than 160 people have been arrested in connection with the massacre earlier this month of scores of people in central Nigeria Choji Gyang, special adviser on religious affairs to the governor of the Nigerian state of Plateau, has said the attackers were Muslim herdsmen, some dressed in military uniforms. But John Onaiyekan, Roman Catholic archbishop of Abuja, Nigeria, and former Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo have said that the violence is fueled more by other factors: ethnic, social and economic problems. The region lies on a faith-based fault line between Muslim-dominated northern Nigeria and the mainly Christian south.
