Thailand says the dispute arose from the fact that the Cambodian government used a map drawn during the French occupation of Cambodia - a map that places the temple and surrounding area in Cambodian territory. The Cambodian prime minister Hun Sen called for calm ahead of the court decision this week, saying that Thailand and Cambodia intended to abide by the court's decision. In a televised address, Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra said that Thailand would hold talks with Cambodia to finally resolve the 51-year-old dispute. The two countries differ on whether some territory around the temple forms part of Thailand or Cambodia. The 11th century Hindu temple sits atop a cliff on Cambodian soil but has its most accessible entrance on the Thai side.
