Justice Brian DeJoseph of the Onondaga County Supreme Court ruled Friday that the initial statements made to media outlets by Boeheim "were likely to be an opinion -- a biased, passionate, and defensive point of view of a basketball coach -- rather than objective fact. Boeheim initially supported Fine, a longtime friend and colleague, accusing Mike Lang and his stepbrother, Bobby Davis, of fabricating their accusations of Fine's alleged misconduct. -- A New York State Supreme Court justice dismissed Friday a defamation lawsuit against Syracuse University and its longtime head basketball coach, Jim Boeheim. The suit was filed in December by two former ball boys for the basketball team, who have accused Bernie Fine, a former assistant coach, of repeated sexual abuse when they were children. Thus, plaintiff's defamation claim against Boeheim fails as a matter of law.
