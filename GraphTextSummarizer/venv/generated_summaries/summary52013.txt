Women who can choose when to have children and how many they will have are more likely to complete their education, start small businesses and participate actively in society. Our girls, 15- and 16-year-olds, are having children themselves; they should be going to school, and we must support them and provide them with family planning education. This is why efforts to improve the lives of women and children reinforce efforts to strengthen our economy and reduce poverty. When we empower women with education and access to reproductive health services, we can lift an entire nation. After the speeches of the world leaders are over, the U.N. General Assembly will come together to determine how it will tackle poverty and set benchmarks to measure progress in economic development.
