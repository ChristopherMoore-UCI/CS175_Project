Congress, finish the job on Brady background checks With great strength and perseverance, Jim survived a gunshot wound to his head. James Brady, former Reagan press secretary, gun-control advocate, dies I'd like to think Jim and I had a few things in common. But I don't look at Jim as a colleague or a fellow warrior who survived the verbal battle that is the White House briefing room. Although I could not have predicted it at the time, it was not the last time I'd hear about Jim Brady. But it didn't take long for me to tell them the heroic story of Jim Brady.
