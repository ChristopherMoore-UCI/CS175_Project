Hezbollah claimed responsibility for sending the drone, which Israeli officials at the time said appeared to have originated in Lebanon. By the numbers: Drones Thursday's incident marked the second time an unmanned aircraft had been intercepted in Israeli airspace within the past seven months, the IDF said. In October 2012, Israeli warplanes tracked and eventually shot down a drone over the country's northern Negev Desert. That drone did not carry any weapons or explosives, Israeli officials said at the time. It went down five nautical miles off the coast of Haifa, and Israeli naval forces were searching the area while an investigation was initiated, the Israeli military said.
