On Sunday, Pope John Paul II and Pope John XXIII were canonized as saints of the Roman Catholic Church. If the canonizations of Popes John XXIII and John Paul II can inspire more of us, as individuals, to find a moral purpose and take risks, our lives will be better for it. " Robert Ellsberg, author of several popular books about saints, suggested that by linking the canonizations, Francis is trying to start a new narrative. They reveal something very important about the aspirations of Pope Francis for the role of the Catholic Church in the world. If the canonizations can help lead the Catholic Church away from bitter division and toward taking powerful moral positions on the world stage, especially following Francis' focus on poverty and inequality, we'll all be better for it.
