-- Naoki Matsuda, a former Japan defender who played for his country when they co-hosted the 2002 World Cup, has died after suffering a suspected heart attack during a training session on Tuesday. " Japan Football Association technical director Hiromi Hara added: "I have managed or coached teams playing against him many times and know what a big presence he had." Matsuda's death comes weeks after Japan celebrated their women's team becoming world champions for the first time in Germany. "Matsuda was a kind of loyal soldier," remarked French coach Philippe Troussier, who was in charge of the Japan team which reached the second round of the 2002 World Cup. "I can't believe it," said former teammate Shunsuke Nakamura, according to AFP. The right-back fell into a coma before being placed on life-support and did not regain consciousness after being taken ill on Tuesday.
