"We are sending the infiltrators, migrants, back to their homes like all countries in the West, in Europe, in the USA act when dealing with migrants," Interior Minister Eli Yishai said on Tuesday. " Most of the immigrants come from Eritrea, Sudan and South Sudan. Some of them have refugee status and hold temporary permits to remain in the country, but Israel does not recognize the status of most of them and says it is looking for ways to send them back to their home countries. The issue of illegal African migrants has been of growing concern in the country in recent months. "Israel is acting according to international law and international charters dealing with infiltrators and migrants that come into the country against the law," he said.
