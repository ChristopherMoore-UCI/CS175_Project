The move comes in the wake of the death of Mick Jagger's longtime girlfriend, fashion designer L'Wren Scott. " Another admirer of Scott's work, Johanna Fuentes, tweeted, "L'Wren Scott was a renowned designer, successful model and stylist. "She was so tall and so glamorous, so unlike anyone else you'd ever seen," Amy Larocca of New York magazine wrote. " A representative for the New York Police Department said the New York medical examiner will determine the cause of death as the investigation continues into what led up to it. Scott was beloved for her designs as well as her personal fashion that she honed as a model for designer Thierry Mugler in the 1980s before she began a steady climb, first as a stylist, and later with her own label.
