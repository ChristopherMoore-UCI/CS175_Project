Jones was being held in Smith County, Mississippi, on drug and child endangerment charges and is awaiting extradition to South Carolina for prosecution. It's still unclear how or why Jones allegedly killed his children, but acting Sheriff Lewis McCarty of Lexington County told reporters that Jones drove for several days with their decomposing bodies in the back of his SUV. " In a statement, South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley called the deaths of the five children and Monday's shooting of two Charleston County deputies, one fatally, in an unrelated incident "moments that truly shock our conscience. Child welfare investigation Child welfare authorities said they had received an abuse complaint involving at least one of the children on August 7 but interviews with Jones, the children and neighbors determined there was no imminent danger, said Jackie Swindler, a representative of the South Carolina Department of Social Services. " McCarty said Jones, who allegedly was in possession of synthetic marijuana and a drug called "bath salts," faces five counts of murder when he's returned to South Carolina.
