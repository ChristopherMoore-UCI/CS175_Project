-- Attempts to purge Muslims from parts of the war-torn Central African Republic have prompted "a Muslim exodus of historic proportions," rights group Amnesty International warned Wednesday. "In many towns, Muslim groups are isolated and threatened by anti-balaka forces while tens of thousands of Muslims have already left the country into exile in Chad or Cameroon. " The African Union also raised concerns over violence toward Muslim civilians and Chadian nationals. The Amnesty International report said international peacekeepers in the country must do more to protect Muslim communities and rein in the anti-balaka militias. They have since been forced out of power, but Christian militias, known as the anti-balaka, which translates as "anti-machete," have been allowed to fill the power vacuum, Amnesty International said, with dire consequences for Muslim civilians.
