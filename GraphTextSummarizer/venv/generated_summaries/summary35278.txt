" When the Grizzlies won game 6 in Memphis to capture the Spurs' series, the fans spilled from FedExForum onto Beale Street for an all-night party. Whatever happens Friday night, whether the Grizzlies win and go back to Oklahoma City for game 7, or lose to end the season, what has occurred the last four weeks has turned around the franchise. "You can't fool these fans, because they know bad basketball when they see it," said Shane Battier, who was the Grizzlies' first first-round draft pick in '01 as they moved to Memphis, "They were going to show up to watch a winning team. Former Grizzlies coach Hubie Brown, who guided Memphis to its first playoff berth ever in 2004 when he was named the league's Coach of the Year, said he's never forgotten how much the city loved a winner and a team that played as a team. "But we feel good that at the end of the day, they've been able to come down to Beale Street, catch a game and put a rough time behind them." Granted, the Grizzlies haven't had much time to think about the plight of their city.
