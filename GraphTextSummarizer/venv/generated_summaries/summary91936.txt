Multiple passengers aboard the Carnival Dream have contacted CNN, telling stories of power outages and overflowing toilets, all while docked in port at Philipsburg, St. Maarten, in the eastern Caribbean. The U.S. Coast Guard said there were no reports of an incident, adding cruise lines typically give a courtesy call even when they're experiencing minor problems. When told of the complaints, Carnival representative Vance Gulliksen said late Wednesday night he wasn't aware of a problem. An announcement over the ship's public address system said they were trying to fix the problem and were working on the generators, according to Stark. Gregg Stark, who is traveling with his wife and two young children, told a similar story.
