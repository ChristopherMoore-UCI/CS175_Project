Special agents with the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives arrested Richard Sandberg, 35, on Thursday morning as he was heading to work, said Jeffrey Dorschner, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Colorado. The undercover agent told Sandberg he was going out of town to pick up illicit drugs, then met up with him Tuesday evening at the suspect's house in Jefferson County, about 15 miles southwest of the Colorado capital. Swarms of law enforcement agents, including three bomb squads, descended on Sandberg's residence -- which sported a Marine flag in the yard and a "Fire Obama" sign in a window. The informant had gone to Sandberg's house and saw "numerous hand firearms and hand grenades" the suspect "wanted to trade ... for cocaine," according to the affidavit. Once there, Sandberg detailed his military background as a demolition expert who'd served in Iraq, Somalia and Pakistan, and had been trained "to build bombs and kill people," the affidavit states.
