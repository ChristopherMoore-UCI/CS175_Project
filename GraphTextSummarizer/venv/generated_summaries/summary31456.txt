But The Words' $5 million bow is the lowest ever for a wide release from the studio, as is its cold $1,767 per theater average. The last frame to notch worse overall ticket sales was Sept. 21-23, 2001 — two weekends after the 9/11 attacks — when only one new wide release entered theaters: Mariah Carey's infamous bomb Glitter. (Keep in mind, as final weekend results come in on Monday, things could change. The fledgling studio, which began releasing films in 2010, only has one real hit to its name: The Woman in Black, which grossed $54.3 million earlier this year. The film, which earned a "B" CinemaScore grade last week, enjoyed a better than expected hold (it dropped 46 percent) — especially since its debut results were inflated by it bowing on a holiday weekend.
