Along with Aiken, who has yet to win on the European Tour, Larrazabal will have to fend off challenges from the Dane Anders Hansen -- who shot a three-under par 69 on Saturday to tie for second place -- and France's Romain Wattel and Scotland's Scott Jamieson who are also tied for second. Spain's golfing maestro remembered Pablo Larrazabal is currently tied for second place on six-under par and the highest placed Spaniard in an event which Ballesteros won three times during his career. Among the many players paying their respects to Ballesteros were his long-standing friends and Ryder Cup allies Jose Maria Olazabal and Miguel Angel Jimenez. The South African who led at the halfway stage shot an even-par round of 72 on a day that was inevitably overshadowed by the death of Seve Ballesteros, who lost his three-year battle with cancer in the early hours of Saturday morning. "Since I heard the news this morning I couldn't get it out of my head," Larrazabal said, EuropeanTour.com reported.
