It says that Simone Gbagbo, wife of Laurent Gbagbo, is wanted "for her individual criminal responsibility as regards the crimes against humanity of murder, rape and other forms of sexual violence, persecution and other inhumane acts committed during the post-election crisis" beginning November 28, 2010. "Moreover, Ms. Gbagbo played a key role in recruiting, arming and integrating thousands of volunteers and enlisting them into the FDS chain of command," the warrant said, referring to the Ivorian Defense and Security Forces. Simone Gbagbo, 63, was arrested in Ivory Coast at the same time as her husband. "The (ICC) judges have decided, it is now up to the Ivorian authorities to surrender Mrs. Simone Gbagbo to the court," said a statement from ICC prosecutor's office.
