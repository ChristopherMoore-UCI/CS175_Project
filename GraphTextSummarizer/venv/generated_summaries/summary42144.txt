I'd go to preaching workshops at his beloved Craddock Center, a non-profit ministry that served needy children in North Georgia, Tennessee and North Carolina. Craddock faces his toughest convert Preachers studied classic Craddock sermons such as "Have You Heard John Preach?" and "Grace and Disgrace," much like aspiring jazz musicians listened to saxophonist John Coltrane and amateur boxers studied tapes of Sugar Ray Robinson -- for clues to greatness and inspiration. Craddock, who redefined the art of preaching, died Friday in Blue Ridge, Georgia. " Craddock, who taught preaching at  the Candler School of Theology until his retirement, was selected as one of the 12 most effective preachers in the English-speaking world in a poll of 341 seminary professors and editors of religious periodicals in 1996. Craddock's funeral will be held at 2 p.m. Monday at Cherry Log Christian Church in Blue Ridge, Georgia.
