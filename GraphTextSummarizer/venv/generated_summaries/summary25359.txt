-- President Barack Obama said Wednesday that he and outgoing Attorney General Eric Holder are "not going to let up" in the effort to solve the problem of racial tensions that exists between law enforcement officers and minorities in communities nationwide. Obama said he had just spoken to Attorney General Eric Holder and "we are not going to let up until we see a strengthening of the trust and a strengthening of accountability that exists between our communities and law enforcement." Obama also said law enforcement must improve training and become more accountable in order to strengthen relations within local communities. The Justice Department is investigating the circumstances surrounding Garner's death and whether civil rights were violated, law enforcement sources tell CNN. Obama's remarks came soon after a grand jury decided not to indict a white police officer in the July chokehold death of Eric Garner, an unarmed black man.
