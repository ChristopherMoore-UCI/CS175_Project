A local resident told BFM the community was angered Sunday when police carried out an "aggressive" traffic stop as a funeral was being held for a young man killed in a road accident last week. -- Seventeen police officers were injured in violent clashes with young people in the city of Amiens in northern France overnight, Interior Minister Manuel Valls said Tuesday. France has been shaken by unrest in poorer urban areas on several occasions in recent years, notably in 2005, when the deaths of two young men of North African descent sparked weeks of rioting. Speaking at a news conference in Amiens, Valls said that the violence shown toward police was "unacceptable" and that law and order must be restored. Amiens Mayor Gilles Demailly told BFM that the damage amounted to millions of euros.
