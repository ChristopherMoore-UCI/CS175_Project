The film's storyline has Will Smith's Agent J traveling back in time to 1969 to prevent an alien baddie named Boris (played by Jemaine Clement) from assassinating Jones' Agent K -- and the critical job of playing that younger incarnation of K fell to Brolin. Whatever their resemblance, the prospect of going from a casual impression of Jones to a full-fledged performance as young K was terrifying, Brolin says. But co-star Josh Brolin had his own personal slice of misery to contend with in the making of "MiB3": honing his impression of Tommy Lee Jones. Brolin had worked with Jones twice before -- in the 2007 films In the Valley of Elah and "No Country for Old Men" -- and gotten a chance to study the actor's very specific and sometimes, shall we say, prickly vibe up close. But what was Jones' own take on Brolin's performance?
