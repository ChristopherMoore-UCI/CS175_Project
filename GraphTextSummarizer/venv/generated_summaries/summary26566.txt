The attack took place while the militants met at the camp in Garbarahey in Somalia's western Gedo region near the border with Kenya, the Kenya Defence Forces said on its official Twitter feed. Al-Shabaab, an al Qaeda-linked organization that the U.S. government calls a terrorist group, was behind the deadly siege last September of a shopping mall in Nairobi, Kenya. The radical Islamist group, which controls parts of Somalia, hopes to topple the leadership and turn the country into a fundamentalist Islamist state. Scores of others escaped with multiple injuries, the military said, and vehicles and other assets were destroyed in the raid. -- Kenyan fighter jets hit an Al-Shabaab camp in Somalia on Friday, killing at least 30 militants
