According to Girls Not Brides, a global partnership to end child marriage, a girl who receives seven or more years of schooling will marry an average of four years later. Even if husbands and their families permit the girl to go to school, the immediate push to have children makes girls much more likely to drop out. In Mozambique, around 60% of girls without an education are married by 18, compared with 10% who complete secondary schooling. When girls become brides, on the other hand, schooling is often not an option. Pregnancy is the leading cause of death worldwide for girls ages 15 to 19.
