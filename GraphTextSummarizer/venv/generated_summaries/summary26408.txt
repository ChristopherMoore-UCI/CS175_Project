Yup, you're trapped in "I'm being polite, but I hate you" limbo, dear friend, and it's time to go on to the next world: one in which only friends dawdle in the sweet groves of amity. In the event of a passive-aggressive Facebooker There are more than 650 million people on Facebook, and unless you're a solid adherent to Dunbar's Number and have carefully restricted those friend requests, you're probably "friends" with a couple of people you wouldn't actually call "friend" in real life. We've seen some pretty intense examples in the realm of the celebrity (Kanye West, Courtney Love and various and sundry reality stars are repeat offenders), and, on a less buzzed-about scale, between friends and acquaintances. You know: high school classmates/tormentors, exes, former friends with whom you've had a falling out. On Facebook, some do the virtual equivalent: They block your access to photos and wall posts, (likely) remove you from their news feed and immediately toss out a "Not Attending" four seconds after you send them an invite to your "Sock Puppet Sock Hop."
