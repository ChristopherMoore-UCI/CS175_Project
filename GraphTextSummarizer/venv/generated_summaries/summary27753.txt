-- Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, walked back her comments Thursday invoking images of domestic abuse when talking about Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin. She made the remarks while in Wisconsin campaigning for Democratic gubernatorial candidate Mary Burke, who is trying to unseat Walker, the incumbent Republican. " Wasserman Schultz has been heavily criticized in social media and in conservative media for saying Wednesday that Walker "has given women the back of his hand" because of his policies impacting women. In the latest response by Adams, Wasserman Schultz slammed the congressional Republicans who opposed the latest version of the Violence Against Women Act, which gives legal protections for domestic violence victims. But that shouldn't detract from the broader point that I was making that Scott Walker's policies have been bad for Wisconsin women, whether it's mandating ultrasounds, repealing an equal pay law or rejecting federal funding for preventative health care.
