The Northern Irishman was joined on three-under-par by Americans Robert Garrigus and Zach Johnson after both players hit rounds of 69. Woods and Rose share first round lead But Tiger Woods, who shot an opening round 66 to share the lead with Rose, struggled to produce a repeat performance. Last year's money list winner Luke Donald of England shot a 69 to finish level par at the halfway stage, while his compatriot Lee Westwood was 28th out of 30 on five-over-par following a disappointing round of 73. Masters champion Bubba Watson moved into contention on five-under-par alongside Bo Van Pelt, with Matt Kuchar and Dustin Johnson a shot further back. England's Justin Rose shot a 68 to move into second place on six-under-par.
