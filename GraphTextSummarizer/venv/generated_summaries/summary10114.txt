After Saturday's show, drummer Tommy Lee told Rolling Stone the band is still working out the logistics. There were, of course, many of the expected hits, from "Live Wire," "Wild Side" and "Shout at the Devil" to "Kickstart My Heart," "Dr. Feelgood" and the closing "Home Sweet Home," which began with Lee on a piano that descended from the ceiling. Another new aspect of the performance was the inclusion of a narrator, Genocide, who worked his way through the crowd and stage, introducing the band members and providing occasional levity between songs. For the Saturday night performance, the Cr√ºe turned three songs, starting with "On With the Show" and wrapping with "Don't Go Away Mad (Just Go Away)," into acoustic numbers. "We're doing production s**t right up until doors open, f****** crazy," Lee said.
