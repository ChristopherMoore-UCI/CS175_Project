"If we continue to have cases in Texas at the rate we've had them so far this year, we'll have more cases than has been reported for the last 50 years," said Dr. Carol J. Baker, professor of pediatrics at Baylor College of Medicine and executive director of the Center for Vaccine Awareness in Research at Texas Children's Hospital in Houston. That's because increased public awareness and improved diagnostic tests appear to have led to more cases being identified, he said. Though more than 90% of children nationwide get the first three doses, the number who get boosters is far lower, said Baker, who served from 2008 to 2010 as chair of the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which sets U.S. policy on vaccines. But Washington state declared an epidemic last year, and California did so in 2010. "We do not keep a comprehensive list of pertussis outbreaks since states only alert CDC to those if they need assistance," said Jason McDonald in an e-mail.
