The two main candidates -- 59-year-old Henry Tang, son of a well connected tycoon, and 58-year-old C Y Leung, of more humble origins, but impeccable pro-Beijing credentials -- were supposed to conduct gentlemanly campaigns, culminating in Tang's eventual victory as the favorite of China's leaders and Hong Kong's tycoons. But despite his problems, Leung continues to show a consistent lead over Tang in public opinion polls. The pro-business Liberal Party, controlling 28 votes, says it cannot vote for Leung, while leaving it to individuals members whether they vote for Tang or not. Tang's clumsy response, first denying, then blaming his wife for the work drew widespread condemnation. Meanwhile C Y Leung ran into his own troubles.
