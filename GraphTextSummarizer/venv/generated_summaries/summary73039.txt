An Academy committee meets on June 14 to again decide if a new Oscar category will be created for best stunt coordinator in a movie, which GoldDerby.com editor Tom O'Neil says is "one of many areas the Oscars overlook and shouldn't. " When the Academy governors voted five years ago against a stunt Oscar, it appeared that the development of computer-generated imagery (CGI) would reduce demand for live stunt performers in movie production, Gill said. Despite the support of Hollywood A-listers such as Steven Spielberg, James Cameron, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Martin Scorsese, Jessica Lange and others, the politics are against the campaign for adding an Academy Award for best stunt coordinator, according to O'Neil, a journalist who has closely covered the issue. O'Neil said the category has been "warmly received." Gill, who was recently set on fire for an episode of TV's "True Blood," said he's hoping the Academy governors will also see the light and see that "without a stunt coordinator most of these big films would never be made." "I worked very hard on 'Fast Five' trying to make those physical stunts look real, and I think it paid off in what the audience came and saw, and I'd really like to be a part of the Oscar ceremony next year," he said. Even movies without crashes, blasts and falls need stunt coordinators to "keep actors safe and to make sure that all the action works," he said.
