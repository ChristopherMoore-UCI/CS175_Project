Starfield said Virgin America employees guided her and several others into a small room, where they barricaded the door by moving a copy machine in front of it. Police, guns drawn Actor Tim Daly was inside the Virgin America first class lounge waiting to board a flight to Philadelphia when he heard the initial shots. "He said, 'TSA?'" Passenger Leon Saryan was reaching for his shoes and belt that he had taken off to clear the TSA security checkpoint when he heard shots. Starfield told CNN affiliate KCBS. Less than a minute later, LAPD officers with guns drawn burst into the lounge, said Daly, best known for roles on the TV shows "Wings" and "Private Practice." "That was pretty frightening when they burst in" because at first no one knew who they were, Daly told CNN by telephone.
