" Conservatives: issue will dominate election Some social conservative leaders, including Ralph Reed of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, vowed that same-sex marriage would dominate the midterms. Sure, vulnerable Southern Democrats -- like Sen. Mary Landrieu in Louisiana and Kay Hagan in North Carolina -- may be wary of letting social issues become a prominent force in the midterms, as they tend to galvanize conservative bases. Hagan was part of the surge of Senate Democrats who endorsed same-sex marriage last year, but North Carolina passed its same-sex marriage ban as recently as 2012 -- an effort that Tillis, speaker of the North Carolina House, helped push. Warner, his opponent, endorsed same-sex marriage last year along with several other Senate Democrats. "For candidates running in 2014 and those who run for president in 2016, there will be no avoiding this issue," Reed said in a statement, taking issue with what many critics described as judicial activism by the courts.
