The U.S. Coast Guard is unable to provide specific numbers of how many people go missing from boating accidents like this past weekend's, but officials say that since last fall there have been three people who have not been found after triggering Coast Guard searches. Any one could put a boater in the kind of peril that befell two NFL players and their two friends off the coast of Florida last weekend, Coast Guard officials say. The NFL players' boat capsized off Florida in waves up to 10 feet high while being buffeted by winds up to 45 miles per hour, Coast Guard officials said. To remain safe on any body of water, Coast Guard officials stress having the proper safety equipment and being wary of changes in the weather. Schuyler, who was rescued on Monday, was easier to find because he was near the boat, Coast Guard officials say.
