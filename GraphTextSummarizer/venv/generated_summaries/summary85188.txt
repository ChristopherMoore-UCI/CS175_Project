-- A Somali Islamist militant movement on Monday claimed responsibility for a trio of bombings that killed at least 74 people Sunday at two venues in the Ugandan capital, Kampala, where crowds had gathered to watch the World Cup final. Earlier Monday, Sheikh Abu Al Zubeir, identified as "the emir of Al-Shabaab in Somalia," said in an Arabic website posting, "My message to the Ugandan and Burundian nations is that you will be the target for our retribution to the massacres perpetrated against the Somali men, women and children in Mogadishu by your forces." Islamic militants battling Somalia's U.N.-backed transitional government had previously threatened attacks on Uganda and Burundi. In a post on its website, the organization Invisible Children said Henn was in the country working with Ugandan students. Suspicion had centered on Somali Islamist groups shortly after the explosions in Kampala.
