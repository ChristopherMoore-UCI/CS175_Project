Though the deal was hailed by opposition parties in Yemen, youth protesters and international rights groups called the immunity a violation of international law. Yemen's parliament approved a controversial law Saturday that ensures President Ali Abdullah Saleh complete immunity from prosecution. The law was delayed for weeks as Saleh insisted on specific changes guaranteeing his aides partial protection from legal actions. The United Nations' envoy to Yemen, Jamal Benomar, arrived in the country last week to ease the tension after fears grew that the deal would collapse. Blood that Saleh spilt will not be forgiven, and we will continue demanding his prosecution until our demands are met.
