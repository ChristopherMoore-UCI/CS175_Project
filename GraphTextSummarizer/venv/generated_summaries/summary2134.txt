"We need people to come forward, people who are willing to be assessed to be live liver donors," Johanne Wagner told CBC News on Sunday. "When we went to Vietnam, before we went, we knew that they were very ill, and we knew it was liver-related," Michael Wagner told CBC News. The pair are afflicted with Alagille syndrome, a genetic disorder that causes liver damage because of bile duct abnormalities, according to the National Institutes of Health's Genetics Home Reference. If things take a turn for the worse, the twins' doctor Dr. Binita Kamath told CBC News, the girl who will receive Michael Wagner's liver will be chosen based on immediate need. Wagner and his wife, Johanne, have taken their search for a second donor to social media, establishing a Facebook page, Liver Transplants for our Vietnamese Twin Girls, which has garnered more than 5,000 likes as of Monday afternoon.
