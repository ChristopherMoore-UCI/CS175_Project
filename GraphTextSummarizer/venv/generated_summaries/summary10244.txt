Construction in the E1 would be an expansion of Ma'ale Adumim, one of Israel's largest West Bank settlements which already has about 40,000 people. Israel defies international criticism of settlement plans The Palestinians' chief negotiator Saeb Erakat said such a settlement will dash any hopes of a "two-state solution" -- with Israel and an independent Palestinian nation, living together in peace. "We are taking back this area, that is private Palestinian land, and building our own village," said activist Irene Nasser. In recent weeks, Israel has signaled its intention to construct settlements in the area. The protest camp -- consisting of chanting activists and tents dotting an otherwise barren hilltop -- sprung up due to Israel's recently announced plans to build 3,000 housing units in East Jerusalem and the West Bank.
