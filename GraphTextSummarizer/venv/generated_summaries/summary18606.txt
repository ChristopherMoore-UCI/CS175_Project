"I don't think there's going to be a flood of Guatemalan women applying for asylum tomorrow," Johnson said. -- An appeals court ruling has raised the possibility that Guatemalan women will be able to seek asylum in the United States because of the high rates of femicide in that country. A key issue in the case is whether Guatemalan women are too broad of a group to be considered a protected "particular social group" eligible for asylum. Perdomo, who lives in Reno, Nevada, and works as a Medicaid account executive at a medical facility there, is not assured asylum, but the decision gives her and countless other Guatemalan women the possibility of remaining in the United States. "This is part of a trend among U.S. courts to ensure women are afforded protection under asylum laws."
