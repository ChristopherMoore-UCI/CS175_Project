" Still, despite the day's success, rescue workers continue to face tough decisions and hard work to get the men out of the mine. " Miners who are healthy enough will be allowed to visit briefly with family members in a reunion area before being taken to the hospital, Manalich said. He spoke hours after anxious family members and exhausted rescue workers reveled in joyful relief after a drill pierced the roof of an underground mine in Chile where the men have been trapped since August 5. The first of the 33 miners trapped underground for more than two months could be hoisted to safety as early as Wednesday, Chilean Mining Minister Laurence Golborne said Saturday. " Rescue crews have been drilling three separate wider holes to send down the rescue capsule and hoist the men to the surface.
