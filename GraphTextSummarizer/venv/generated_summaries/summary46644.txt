Italy under Berlusconi has failed to "grasp the nettle of economic reform" to tackle low growth over a sustained period, Begg said. Unlike McWilliams, Begg believes Italy is highly unlikely to default on its huge debt -- but its situation is nonetheless "precarious" if it wants to avoid years of low growth. Italy has one of the lowest growth rates in the world and among the highest public debts, warned Domenico Lombardi, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and former International Monetary Fund executive board member. But other elements, like the new debt deals agreed for Greece, Ireland and Portugal, have paradoxically pushed up borrowing costs for Italy to record levels -- with bond yields, or interest rates on government debt, reaching 6% -- and put it under greater pressure, he said. He said the roots of Italy's troubles lie in its huge public debt and low growth rate.
