Todd Hardy, Josh's father, said he got the call from Chimerix president Kenneth Moch about a half hour before the public announcement was made. The world has heard you and because of you Josh and many others will have the opportunity to receive CMX001 (Brincidofovir) the life saving antiviral drug made by Chimerix." But pharmaceutical companies often say no, as Chimerix did at first to Josh Hardy. CNN told Josh's story Sunday night, describing his parents' desperate pleas for help from Chimerix. "I'm happy for Josh and I'm happy for many patients," Moch said.
