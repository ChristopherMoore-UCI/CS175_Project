Learn more about the Kon-Tiki's historic voyage Two of Heyerdahl's grandchildren, Olav Heyerdahl and Josian Heyerdahl, will be aboard during various legs of the Plastiki voyage. To underscore his message, he and collaborators designed a boat made almost entirely of plastic bottles and recycled plastic. En route to Australia, Plastiki will sail through the infamous North Pacific Gyre, now home to "The Great Garbage Patch," named due to the high levels of waste that have been drawn there by ocean currents. "I was astounded to hear that that there are places in our oceans where the ratio between plastic and plankton is 6-to-1," de Rothschild told CNN, referring to the area. "Even if Plastiki gets damaged or does not make it, the message will still be there," de Rothschild told CNN.
