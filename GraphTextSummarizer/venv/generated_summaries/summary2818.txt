The world No. 1 breezed into the third round of Wimbledon Thursday with a 6-1 6-1 victory over South African Chanelle Scheepers. " Roger Federer cantered into the third round after his match with Gilles Muller was interrupted to close the roof on Centre Court as a late evening shower washed London. The Russian fifth seed won her first grand slam of the grass of Wimbledon in 2004 as a 17-year-old and returns to London in ominous form as the French Open champion. Australian Open champion Stan Wawrinka dropped a set against Taiwan's Yen-Hsun Lu on his way to a third round encounter against Uzbekistan's Denis Istomin. It's nice to get those wins but better keep working hard and try to be consistent."
