Similarly, Chinese President Xi Jinping also had a good tour, starting with his own climate change initiatives announced at the APEC summit in Beijing, several new trade deals and a historic handshake with regional rival, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Trade deals and new climate change initiatives flowed from the U.S. camp, with the president clearly enjoying his trip, not to mention his rock-star treatment by students in Queensland and in Myanmar. Putin had been a verbal punching bag for many of the G20 leaders, critical of Russia's reported movement of new troops and weapons into independent Ukraine. European leaders, led by Britain's David Cameron also had words for Putin, as did U.S. President Barack Obama. But Putin put on a happy face when he met Tony Abbott in front of the cameras on Saturday, despite the Australian leader's comments only a few days previously -- accusing him, in person, of trying to "relive past glories of the Soviet Union" in Beijing at the APEC summit a few days earlier.
