-- More than 115,000 volunteers have joined the crowdsourcing search for the missing Malaysia Airlines plane by going to their computers and reviewing satellite photos of the open ocean to find signs of the aircraft, a sponsor said Wednesday. "We can see from space all the boats and the infrastructure that's in place" for the open sea hunt, said Har-Noy, also a senior director for geospatial big data for DigitalGlobe, which acquired tomnod.com last year. The disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 has become such an international mystery that Internet do-gooders have mobilized a "crowdsourcing campaign" poring over DigitalGlobe's satellite photos -- all in the effort to find any trace of a plane floating in the Gulf of Thailand. In fact, scores of volunteers have posted their findings from tomnod.com on their CNN iReport pages, which is CNN's own version of crowdsourcing, sometimes used in the news outlet's coverage of world events. However, search experts were examining Wednesday the findings of a Chinese satellite that "observed a suspected crash area at sea," a Chinese government agency said.
