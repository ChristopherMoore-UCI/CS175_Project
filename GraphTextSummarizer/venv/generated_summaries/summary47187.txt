The problems have also prompted one U.S. lawmaker to propose a "Cruise Ship Passenger Bill of Rights." Sen. Charles Schumer, D-New York, said he was asking the cruise industry to voluntarily sign on to a list of guidelines, including the right to backup power if generators fail and the right to disembark a docked ship "if basic provisions cannot adequately be provided on board." He also called on the International Maritime Organization to investigate whether cruise lines are following existing guidelines, and whether existing standards are being enforced by countries where cruise ships that serve U.S. passengers are based. In addition to repairs, workers will increase the number of systems and services that the Triumph and other Carnival ships can run on backup power. Tugboats will remain next to ship as as precaution, Carnival said. The cruise line has offered affected passengers refunds and discounts on future cruises. Will Carnival keep its customers?
