As NBC celebrates ratings success with the Summer Games -- and weathers the shouts of #NBCfail from the critical -- it's also staring down the onset of fall TV season, that post-Labor Day flood of returning prime-time staples and new programming. "CBS is a very well-defined identity, with basically the same show on every night, and people love that type of show. "We are so committed to looking at this as a sampling opportunity that we're running it without commercials," said Vernon Sanders, NBC's executive vice president of current programming. It's no secret that in its post-"Friends" and "ER" years, NBC acquired a rep for dismal programming, and was unable to find anything that stuck, said Susan Young, a TV critic and former president of the Television Critics Association. When you're competing with four other networks and there's 15 new shows all premiering within one week, it becomes very difficult to get attention and, in some cases, convince people to check out your show, whether it's a new show or a show that they're loyal to.
