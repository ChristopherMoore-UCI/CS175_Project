No one else had the absolute authority to program the individual's life; he or she made that decision, moment by moment. The introduction of national television meant that for the first time in history, people in every corner of the country -- people in small towns, in huge cities, in farm communities, in remote villages -- were watching exactly the same thing at exactly the same moment. The old-time television executives no longer had as firm a grip on how citizens would spend their time; now the individual at his or her computer terminal was given the power to decide how he or she would be informed, entertained or infuriated at a given moment. It was no coincidence that it was initially referred to as the information superhighway: Seemingly overnight, the knowledge (and trivia and gossip) of the world was available to anyone with a keyboard and a modem; people who had never met and would never meet could communicate as if they were lifelong friends. Each of the three, it can be argued, had certain drawbacks and tradeoffs that we should not ignore: The interstates let us roam at will but weakened our sense of place; television brought us together, but somehow, in relieving the old sense of forced isolation, it paradoxically introduced a new kind of voluntary isolation as it lured us to stay increasingly within the confines of our walls; the Internet gave us access to the whole planet but locked our attention on a small sheet of plastic or glass.
