Attendance figures from museums in Australia and Canada were used in compiling the report, but they did not make the top 20 worldwide, said John Robinett, AECOM's senior vice president of economics. He said attendance numbers from museums in Africa, Central America and South America were not included because they are difficult to obtain, and this is the first year museums were included in the report. China wants to build 1,000 new museums in the next decade and projects museum attendance to reach 1 billion by 2020, according to the report. The list is part of the recently released Themed Entertainment Association (TEA) and AECOM global attractions attendance report. Based on attendance figures compiled by AECOM, the index lists the 20 most visited museums worldwide.
