Previous leaders Manchester United had to sit out the action as their game at promoted Blackpool fell victim to the cold snap in England leaving Arsenal and Chelsea the chance to lead the standings. Arsenal were grateful for two inspired moments from French international midfielder Nasri, who fired them ahead at the Emirates after 14 minutes as he fooled two defenders before shooting high into the net, having been played in by Russian star Andrey Arshavin. But Nasri put Arsenal ahead again with 15 minutes left as he took advantage of a layoff from Robin van Persie to beat a defender and then visiting goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer with another flash of individual brilliance. In other games, Blackburn beat Wolves, who are now bottom, 3-0 to bounce back from their 7-1 defeat last weekend to Manchester United. Arsenal have 32 points from 16 games, one clear of United, who have played a game less, and two ahead of faltering Chelsea.
