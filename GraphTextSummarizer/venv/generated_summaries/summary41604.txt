Its planned meeting comes as Kenyan deputy president, William Ruto, is undergoing trial at the court on charges related to postelection violence in 2007. Her husband, former president Laurent Gbagbo, is in the custody of the Hague-based court awaiting trial over similar charges. The standoff sparked months of violence between supporters of the two sides, leaving thousands dead. Gbagbo is accused of crimes against humanity following postelection violence in 2010. The ICC warrant issued last year alleges that as a member of the president's inner circle, his wife was an "indirect co-perpetrator."
