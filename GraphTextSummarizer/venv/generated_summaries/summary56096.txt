In the letter, Gadhafi said he was praying for Chavez's health and decried what he called a global conspiracy against Libya. Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez appeared on state television with a shaved head Monday, telling viewers it is a sign that his cancer treatment is working. The Venezuelan leader has spoken out numerous times since unrest erupted in Libya, accusing the United States and other countries of blowing the situation out of proportion to justify an invasion. Chavez and Gadhafi have a close relationship, having bonded partly over shared opposition to the United States' global influence. Chavez also reiterated his support for Moammar Gadhafi, reading a letter he recently received from the embattled Libyan leader.
