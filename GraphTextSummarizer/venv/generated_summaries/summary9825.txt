Hundreds of Latinas and women of all backgrounds descended on Capitol Hill to let legislators know that they can not play politics with our reproductive health care and to advocate for abortion care coverage as a part of health care reform. The legacy of health care reform should not be to send women back into the shadows. Opponents argue that more women will be covered under overall health care reform, as if that should satisfy us. We were told that women could use their own money to buy an abortion rider in advance: Women would have to plan for an unplanned pregnancy. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi allowed the amendment to move forward in the House health care bill out of fear that opponents would use abortion politics to tank health care reform.
