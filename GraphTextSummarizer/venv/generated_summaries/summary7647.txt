Turkey has been going on the offensive against Kurdish separatists based across its border in northern Iraq with bombings and incursions. The general staff statement released Thursday said the military had received intelligence that militants were planning to attack border outposts following recent action against Kurdish separatists. Erdal dismissed comments made by the Turkish military general staff Thursday, however, as having "nothing to do with reality," saying the attack occurred inside Turkey, not in northern Iraq as the general staff said. Earlier this month, Turkish police detained dozens of people in a wave of raids focused on pro-Kurdish media organizations. The general staff statement said the airstrike late Wednesday was in the Sinat-Haftanin area of northern Iraq, where many militant training camps are situated and there are no civilian settlements.
