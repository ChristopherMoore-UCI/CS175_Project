Authorities are preparing to step up security to guarantee Noriega's safety in prison, Foreign Minister Roberto Henriquez said Wednesday. -- Panamanian officials are preparing for the return of former dictator Manuel Noriega, who is scheduled to be extradited from France this weekend, Panama's foreign minister told CNN en EspaÃ±ol. Noriega inspires very big emotions, and Noriega's life could very well be at risk in Panama," Henriquez said. Judicial officials in Panama will determine whether Noriega can stand trial, Henriquez said. Noriega and his attorneys had argued the United States was violating the Geneva Convention by not sending him back to Panama, where he was seized by U.S. troops after the United States invaded that country in 1989 in Operation Nifty Package.
