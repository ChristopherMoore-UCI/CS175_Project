An eventual ruling in the case of Chafin v. Chafin could establish an important precedent on the discretion of U.S. courts to decide where children caught in custody fights should stay. " Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said to the father's lawyer that the purpose of the international treaty was to eliminate "shuttling of children" across courts in different nations, a process she said could take years. And I think most appellate courts would appreciate the benefit of that." Justice Stephen Breyer said just because the child is in Scotland, does not mean federal courts in the United States still have no role to play. Lynne Chafin and her lawyers say the purpose of the Hague Convention treaty was to stop children like her 5-year-old daughter, Eris, from bouncing back and forth between countries over custody. Roberts -- the only justice with young children -- suggested the father was not given a proper time or opportunity to appeal once the initial removal order was signed by the federal judge in Alabama.
