A murder weapon isn't the only thing missing as prosecutors try to convince jurors that former New England Patriot Aaron Hernandez orchestrated the  execution of Odin Lloyd. Yet, it wasn't until almost a year and a half later, when investigators were making final trial preparations last November, that they "noted" the three pairs of shoes in photographs and realized they could still be at Hernandez's home, a search warrant affidavit states. Wallace and Ortiz are seen on home security video entering the house and going into the basement after getting out of a car minutes after Lloyd was fatally shot in a nearby industrial park. Authorities say the "outsole pattern," of the Air Jordan XI Retro Low's allegedly worn by Hernandez is "similar to and consistent with the unidentified shoe impression... in close proximity to the body of Odin Lloyd," according to the affidavit. The shoes prosecutors say Hernandez was wearing at the industrial park where Lloyd was killed also have seemingly vanished into thin air.
