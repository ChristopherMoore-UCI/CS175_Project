Shortly after France's World Cup lineup was announced Tuesday, Anara Atanes -- the girlfriend of player Samir Nasri -- took to social media to express her displeasure that he wasn't on the roster. Deschamps defended his decision to leave the 26-year-old midfielder off the squad, telling reporters this week that Nasri "is a quality player, but his performance on the French national team is not at the same level as that at (his English club) " But coach Didier Deschamps filed a civil lawsuit against her Friday, charging that she publicly insulted him. " Nasri was handed a three-match ban after swearing at a reporter following France's loss to Spain in the 2012 European Championship. A French footballer's girlfriend could face a fine for her furious Twitter tirade filled with the f-word.
