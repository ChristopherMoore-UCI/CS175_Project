The low pressure systems sweeping in off the Atlantic have had surfers chasing the so-called "Black Swell," with world class athletes travelling to the west coast of France to ride the waves blooming off the famous Belharra reef in Basque Country. On the west coast of Ireland, stormy weather and whopper waves attracted a huddle of surfers to sweet surf spot Mullaghmore Head. American Shane Dorian packed his bags and hopped on a jet from Hawaii to join some of Europe's top surfers, including Justine Dupont and Benjamin Sanchis, for a once in a lifetime chance to master the big Belharra swell. Although the waters peaked during the night, Dorian and his cohorts were still able to enjoy a surf session at a spot where surfers normally need to be towed out to the colossal waves by jet skis. -- When the eye of the storm closes in most people head home -- but for surfers intent on riding out the waves of the winter storms it's a different story.
