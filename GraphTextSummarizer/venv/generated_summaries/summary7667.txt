Goals from Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie gave Louis van Gaal's side only their second league win of the season. -- It's a landmark that most players can only dream of, but for Lionel Messi it was just a matter of time. Two points behind are last year's champions Atletico Madrid who also romped to victory on Saturday. Former Chelsea man Frank Lampard was on target again for his new club as Manchester City beat Hull City 4-2. Barcelona's win puts them top of the table with 16 points and a very healthy +17 goal difference -- a stat helped not only by recent high-scoring wins but also by clean sheets in their opening six league games.
