Rice was charged with third-degree aggravated assault, a crime that carries a potential penalty of three to five years' imprisonment, according to Acting Atlantic County Prosecutor Jim McClain. Baltimore Ravens star running back Ray Rice was indicted Thursday on an aggravated assault charge stemming from an altercation with his fianc√©e at an Atlantic City, New Jersey, casino last month, prosecutors said. Police were called to the Revel Casino and Hotel in the early morning hours of February 15 to respond to a domestic dispute between the Pro-Bowl running back and his girlfriend, Janay Palmer. "After reviewing surveillance footage it appeared both parties were involved in a physical altercation," read the Atlantic City Police report. Shortly after the incident, TMZ.com posted surveillance video of a man it said was Rice dragging an apparently unconscious woman from an elevator at the Revel Casino. The simple assault against Palmer was dismissed, according to McClain.
