The new indictment -- which supersedes an earlier one, which had fewer charges -- adds murder charges connected to the deaths of John M. Roll, a federal district judge, and Gabriel M. Zimmerman, a staff member for Giffords. -- Federal prosecutors are pushing to force the Arizona man accused of fatally gunning down six people and wounding 13 others, including U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, to submit a handwriting sample -- a request that he, thus far, has refused. The 22-year-old Tucson man was indicted on three counts of attempted murder, including one alleging that he tried to kill Giffords with a Glock semiautomatic handgun during the event she was hosting for constituents. Last Thursday, a federal grand jury returned a new indictment against Loughner in which he is charged on 49 counts -- including murder and attempted murder -- related to the shooting outside a Tucson supermarket in January. Loughner also faces charges in the deaths of Dorothy J. Morris, Phyllis C. Schneck, Dorwan C. Stoddard, and a child, referred to in the indictment as C-T G. Nine-year-old Christina-Taylor Green was among those killed in the shooting.
