-- A late Frank Lampard penalty handed Chelsea a vital 2-1 win over English Premier League leaders Manchester United to breath new life into the title race. Elsewhere, Reading, who play in the second tier of English football, knocked Premier League Everton out of the FA Cup. Alex Ferguson's side had taken the lead in the first half thanks to a thunderous strike from England forward Wayne Rooney but Brazil defender David Luiz drew Chelsea level. Chelsea's victory keeps alive their faint title hopes and moves them into the Champions League places in fourth but they still trail United by 12 points. Carlo Ancelotti admitted Luiz may have been "lucky" but said United were still "too far ahead" for Chelsea to have any realistic chance of retaining their title.
