The row between India's Harbhajan Singh (left) and Australia's Andrew Symonds has turned the spotlight on "sledging" in cricket. Indian player Harbhajan Singh allegedly called Australia's Andrew Symonds "big monkey" -- an allegation the Indians did not take lightly. Have you say "There are two types of sledging," points out former cricket player, Imran Khan. What the incident did, though, is turn the spotlight on "sledging" in cricket -- which until then, was a sport known for its tolerance and civil on-the-field behaviour. Some question whether cricket still deserves that reputation -- after an incident on the cricket pitch in January escalated into a bitter racial row between India and Australia.
