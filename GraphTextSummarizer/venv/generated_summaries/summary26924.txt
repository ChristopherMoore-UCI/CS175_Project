" Sitanggang said the baby has already developed a robust appetite, requiring instant milk as well as breast milk. I thought it was twins," said Binsar Sitanggang, the lead doctor in the cesarean-section delivery at Abdul Manan Hospital in North Sumatra. The world's heaviest baby was born in 1879 in Ohio and weighed 23.8 pounds (10.8 kg), but the baby died 11 hours later, according to Guinness World Records. "We can compare this giant baby with a 9- to 10-month-old baby," Sitanggang said. Muhammad Akbar Risuddin, born Monday, is thought to be the heaviest baby born to date in Indonesia.
