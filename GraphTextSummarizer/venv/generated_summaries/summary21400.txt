Tuesday's incident comes more than two months after three people were wounded in a shooting at a different Lone Star College campus -- the North Harris campus in Houston. " By 2 p.m. (3 p.m. ET), students and staff were allowed to leave campus, Sviland said. -- The 20-year-old student accused in a stabbing rampage at a Texas college campus told investigators he had fantasies of killing people and had planned the attack, sheriff's officials said late Tuesday. Garcia said a call came in to 911 Tuesday morning describing a "male on the loose stabbing people" at the school. The school was on lockdown Tuesday afternoon while authorities combed the campus to ensure no other injured people or attackers were there, Harris County sheriff's spokesman Alan Bernstein said.
