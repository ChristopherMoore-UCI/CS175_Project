She joins 10 others who have reported to jails throughout Florida after being charged with felony hazing in the death of 26-year-old Robert Champion. -- The last of 11 people facing felony hazing charges tied to a Florida A&M University band member's death turned herself in on Sunday, four days after prosecutors announced the charges, the state said. Among those facing felony hazing charges is Aaron Golson, who was also charged in December with hazing and felony battery, after another FAMU band member, Bria Hunter, said she had suffered a cracked femur, deep bone bruise and blood clots after being beaten repeatedly on the thighs. Some university band members have said Champion died after taking part in an annual rite of passage called "Crossing Bus C," an initiation process in which pledges attempt to run down the center aisle from the front door of the bus to the back while being punched, kicked and otherwise assaulted by senior members. As to Champion's case, the victim's mother, Pam Champion, has said her family is disappointed the suspects didn't face more serious charges.
