It's 250 meters long, it's made up of 40 by 40-millimeter sections, five or six meters in length, of Siberian pine which was specifically selected because the trees grow very straight," Taylor said. And though the British cyclists -- four-time Olympic gold medallist Chris Hoy among them -- who tested out the decking for the first time seemed happy with the results, Taylor could only look on with envy. "We put a ring of glass all the way around the venue because we thought we could landscape the park up to the glass, allowing anybody to walk up and look in to see the cyclists," Taylor, of Hopkins Architects, said. "[The aesthetic] was fundamental, because most velodromes end up being on a piece of government land somewhere. Whether this goal can be achieved has yet to be seen but lead architect for the cycle-center project, Mike Taylor, told CNN he felt the aesthetic challenge set for his team had been met.
