Normal hotel prices are high, but if you arrive in July, August or on a Friday or Saturday night any other time, three-star hotels abound with amazing summer rates -- you can rent a double room with enough comforts to keep a diplomat happy, including a fancy breakfast, for about $85.

Belgian fries ("frites") taste so good because they're deep-fried twice -- once to cook, and once to brown. My favorite budget meal in Brussels is having simple pub grub in an atmospheric old pub with a gaggle of "beer pilgrims," who've flocked here from around the world to appreciate some of Europe's best brew and selection -- more than 300 Belgian varieties. When in Brussels, try mussels with a side of crispy fries, or frites.
