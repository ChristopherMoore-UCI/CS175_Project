Video obtained by CNN from Syrian rebels, which we cannot verify, shows this scene and the attempts by the rebels, who are engaged in a pitched battle to prevent the regime encircling the main Syrian city of Aleppo, to interrogate their new prisoner. Syria's war has local regime militia, joined by Hezbollah from Lebanon, Iraqi Shia militia, on one side. There are many Afghan immigrants in Iran, trying to find some shelter from the decades of war that have torn apart their land. CNN sent a photojournalist to eastern Afghanistan to follow up reports of recruitment by Iranian agents of mercenaries to fight for the regime. Yet their limited knowledge of the Syrian conflict exposed a complex issue over which their loyalties to their paymasters, Iran, may be tested.
