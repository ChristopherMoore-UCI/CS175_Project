" "It's just clothes after all ...  and, you know, celebrity fashion lines are alright when they capture a personality. Amid all this, how do "professional" designers feel about celebrity big names treading on their turf? "From a business perspective it's clearly a good idea," says UK-based menswear designer William Green, who's currently exhibiting at London Fashion Week. According to Green, it can be "quite frustrating" for those that spend their lives studying and working to build a reputation in fashion to watch as celebrities "waltz in and launch a label overnight." According to branding expert Tim Jeffrey, celebrity clothing brands are particularly mercurial because their success is so closely aligned to just one individual -- whose popularity can slump at the drop of a finely tailored hat. Ross cites singers Gwen Stefani and Beyonce Knowles as stars with sturdy fashion credentials.
