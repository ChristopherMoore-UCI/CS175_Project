Though traditionalist judges and conservative lawyers accuse him of harming the kingdom's image by talking to the media, young people and reformists have offered their support, especially over the Internet, "where people are free to express their views," al-Lahem said. But he said he rejected extremism during law school and joined with the reformists, accepting human rights cases on a pro bono basis in addition to the commercial work that pays his bills. Under Saudi law, women are subject to numerous restrictions, including a strict dress code, a prohibition against driving and a requirement that they get a man's permission to travel or have surgery. "Young people in all fields are asking for reform, in the judicial system, media and elsewhere," he said. Ahead of the postponement Al-Lahem, who has two daughters, predicted he would have his revoked license to practice law reinstated and said he would represent the Saudi woman again.
