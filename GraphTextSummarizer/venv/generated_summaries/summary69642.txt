Netanyahu's Likud Beitenu won between 31 and 33 Knesset seats in the Israel election, TV exit polls reported, winning the most, as expected. One party in Israel never gets a parliamentary majority of more than 60 seats, so parties must rely on coalition-building. Israel defies international criticism of settlement plans "It is a great privilege but it is also a great responsibility," Netanyahu said. -- Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's party got the most votes in Israel's national election Tuesday, but a respectable showing by centrists could slow or halt a rightward swing in the government. Will Netanyahu form a right-wing coalition with Jewish Home and religious blocs such as Shas -- which earned between 11 and 13 seats, exit polls show?
