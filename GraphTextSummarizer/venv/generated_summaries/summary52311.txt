In fact, the third season finale is expected to run more than an hour â€” a move that requires special permission from the network (previously, the show's pilot and its second season finale exceeded an hour). EW.com: 'Game of Thrones' season 3 teaser poster released HBO says in a statement: "All 10 episodes gained a minute or two from past seasons with the finale very possibly exceeding 60 minutes." There's still 10, but you'll get a little more each week than previous seasons. The "Game of Thrones" team is creating a "super-sized" third season of the hit series. Episodes are still being calibrated so exact times could change, but HBO and producers are confident the season will deliver more "Thrones" than ever before.
