Members of the opposition intend to trade him for other men in custody, and they don't want him to be able to identify them down the road. Sa'er agreed to be filmed by CNN as his wounds were treated by opposition activists. Sa'er tells Mounir about a time two police officers captured a man. It was kill or be killed, he says; Sa'er says he was simply carrying out orders.
