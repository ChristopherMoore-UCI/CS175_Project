In Maine, there were as many as 110,000 customers without electricity on Thanksgiving morning, but milder Turkey Day temperatures allowed for workers to cut that number down by more than two thirds by night's end. Tens of thousands spent Thanksgiving just as others did in New England when Turkey Day was first observed in the 17th century: without electricity. "Crews will remain in the field through the overnight hours and into Friday until all customers are fully restored." Despite the setback, the heartiest of New Englanders wouldn't let the lack of electricity prevent them from enjoying the heartiest of meals. In New Hampshire, more than 133,000 customers were still without power early Friday. Many New Englanders were without power -- but this was nothing new for the region.
