Nashrallah accused the rebel forces of belonging to extremist religious movements, and said Hezbollah forces were acting to protect Lebanon. " Hezbollah fighters represent only a tiny minority of foreign fighters in Syria, Nasrallah said. In eastern Lebanon's Bekaa Valley, thousands of Hezbollah supporters watched the speech on a big screen. "If the armed groups control Syria or specific Syrian provinces, especially those on the Lebanese border, then we consider them a great threat to Lebanon, the unity of the nation and all Lebanese, not just Hezbollah or Shiites in Lebanon. It came shortly after an opposition group said that shelling by Hezbollah fighters had killed at least 30 people in the strategically important western Syrian town of Qusayr.
