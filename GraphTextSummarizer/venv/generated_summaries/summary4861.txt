Mickelson beat South Africa's Branden Grace in a playoff on the links course at Castle Stuart in the Scottish Highlands on Sunday for his first win in Europe since claiming a Challenge Tour event in Paris in 1993. " Mickelson and Grace were tied for second behind Sweden's Henrik Stenson heading into the final round. Needing only a par five -- he didn't drop a shot at the 18th in the first three rounds -- Mickelson struck a bogey to complete his round at three-under 69 and was 17 under through four rounds, like Grace. It was the perfect preparation for Mickelson ahead of the British Open that starts Thursday at Muirfield in Scotland. But in the playoff at the same hole he recovered, edging Grace by hitting a birdie.
