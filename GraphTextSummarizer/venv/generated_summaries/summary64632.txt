-- Controlled drugs were found in one of two tour buses carrying rocker Bret Michaels and his band during a traffic stop in northeast Indiana late Wednesday, police said. "Searches were conducted on both buses yielding marijuana on each bus, as well as a quantity of Schedule II controlled substances on the first bus," Long said. "Both K9s alerted for the odor of narcotics coming from the front of the bus," Deputy Aaron Long wrote in his report. Drug detection dogs did "vehicle scans" of the buses after a sheriff's deputy pulled Michael's tour convoy over on the northbound side of Interstate 69, police said. No one was arrested, but the evidence was passed along to the DeKalb County prosecutor for consideration of charges, according to the police report.
