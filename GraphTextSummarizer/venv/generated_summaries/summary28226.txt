As a plume of black smoke billowed from Asiana Airlines flight 214 after it crash landed at San Francisco International Airport last week, images were being captured -- not just of the plane itself, but of passengers ignoring official safety procedures and collecting their carry-on items before evacuating the aircraft. The problem here is with passengers ignoring safety instructions -- if we don't comply, you could have problems. Many commenters chided passengers who did not read the aircraft's safety briefing card or pay attention to verbal safety instructions. A photograph that showed several passengers, including a woman walking away from the smoking wreckage with a black suitcase and smaller white bag in her hands, has been widely circulated. "Regarding some people who criticize me for taking my luggage with me and thus hindering the rescue of other passengers, I have to clarify," wrote Xu on Weibo.
