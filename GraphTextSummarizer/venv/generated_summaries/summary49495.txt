As CNN first reported, congressional hearings could be the upshot of inaction by the NCAA on the UNC scandal; U.S. Rep. Tony Cardenas, D-California, is sending a letter to NCAA President Mark Emmert demanding answers about the NCAA's handling of it. McMillen has advised those pushing for reform -- most recently those behind the attempt by Northwestern University football players to unionize -- to go after the NCAA over the way they handle academic fraud. Several NCAA critics have told CNN they believe the NCAA refuses to look at the fraud at UNC because it might mean conceding their biggest argument against paying players -- that they athletes are paid in the form of an education. There has been some confusion in the last few years about exactly what the NCAA's responsibility is when it came to academic fraud on campus. He said during a forum at the Aspen Institute that academic fraud is "the chink in the armor" of the NCAA.
