" In the past, the controversial cleric -- who is despised by more conservative religious figures -- has said that women may go out in public without a male guardian, wear makeup and even mingle with the opposite sex in appropriate environments, all violations of custom in Saudi Arabia. "You should ask repentance from God, and to back away from this mistake before you meet God with these sins." Although the country's laws do not require the niqab, women who appear in public with uncovered faces may face harassment from religious police or even bystanders for ignoring the custom. "My message to Sheikh al-Ghamdi is to fear God," Saudi Arabia's Grand Mufti Sheikh Abdul Aziz Al Sheikh told the Saudi news site Sabq. The longstanding debate plays out beyond the Gulf state and across the Islamic world, where most mainstream religious leaders argue that the face veil stems from tribal tradition rather than Sharia law. "Later, people confused the hijab, which was imposed only on the wives of the Prophet Mohammed, with what Allah imposed on Muslim women in general," al-Ghamdi said.
