Tension was building throughout the game, Eid said, as Port Said fans threw bottles and rocks at players. The fighting occurred in a stadium in Port Said after the home Al-Masry team beat Cairo's Al-Ahly team 3-1. Port Said is about 125 miles (200 kilometers) northeast of Cairo. While authorities were responding to the fighting in Port Said, a fire broke out during a match in a Cairo stadium. It was unclear whether intense sports rivalries or political strife caused the clashes in the northeastern city of Port Said.
