In order to play in last year's DP World Tour Championship, played at Jumeirah Golf Estates, golfers had to compete in at least two of the three events prior to the Dubai finale. The 2013 Final Series starts with the BMW Masters on October 30 and the WGC-HSBC Champions event on November 9, both set to take place in Shanghai, China. The DP World Tour Championship is the climax of the Race to Dubai, the European Tour's equivalent of the PGA Tour-based FedEx Cup. The world No. 3 welcomed Monday's announcement, which is designed to encourage more players to participate in the Final Series -- the four tournaments, culminating in the DP World Tour Championships, which bring the curtain down on the European Tour season. The European Tour has announced the season-ending DP World Tour Championship will boast an increased jackpot of $5 million to be shared between the top 15 players.
