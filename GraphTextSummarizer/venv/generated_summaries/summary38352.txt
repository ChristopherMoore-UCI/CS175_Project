Jarrett says she also spends "a good deal of time" with Michelle Obama both personally and professionally. The protective partner, Obama, was making sure Jarrett was on the up and up. Now Obama says he runs every important decision by Jarrett, trusts her completely and considers her family. Jarrett sits in on Obama's daily briefings in the morning that deal with national security and the economy. As for Obama's all-male pickup basketball games, Jarrett says that's not where the real power resides.
