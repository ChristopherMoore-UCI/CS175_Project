-- Investigators have no suspect in the stabbing death of an 8-year-old girl in her California home Saturday, a law enforcement official said Sunday. Leila Fowler's brother found the child with "severe injuries" in the Calaveras County, California, home Saturday, and she was pronounced dead later at a hospital, according to Calaveras County Sheriff Capt. Detectives are tracking down dozens of leads phoned into a tip line created Saturday, including some leading to other counties, he said. A search of the family's home overnight Saturday gave investigators a "substantial amount of evidence," he said. Her parents were "nearby at a public event" at the time, Macedo told reporters.
