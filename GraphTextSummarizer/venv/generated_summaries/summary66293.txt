JDRF is funding artificial pancreas trials at 13 sites worldwide, including Yale University, Stanford University, the University of Virginia and the University of Colorado. Russell's research partner, Edward Diamano, an associate professor of biomedical engineering at Boston University, says the device learned Elle's blood sugar patterns and made changes accordingly. For that one weekend, Elle didn't have to draw blood, and she could eat foods she hadn't eaten in large quantities for four years. Shaheen woke Elle up and gave her orange juice to keep her from slipping into unconsciousness. Shaheen was relieved her motherly intuition had told her something was wrong with Elle that night, but she wished she didn't have to rely on it.
