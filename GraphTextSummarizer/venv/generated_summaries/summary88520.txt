-- Two American hikers detained in Iran for years will meet State Department officials in Washington on Thursday, less than a month after they arrived back home on American soil. The details of the meeting are unclear, but the two men acknowledged State Department officials in their first public statement when they arrived home in the United States last month. Shane Bauer and Josh Fattal will meet with U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Deputy Secretary William Burns. Shourd, Bauer's fiancee, was released in 2010, but Bauer and Fattal were freed a year later, after 781 days in captivity and a trial for espionage that Bauer said was based on "ridiculous lies." "There were also U.S. government officials who worked for our release, and some of them found creative ways to try and lessen the tension between the U.S. and Iran.
