-- The death of Osama bin Laden does not necessarily mean the death of al Qaeda, the terrorist network he founded, though experts say none of his most likely successors offer the same combination of charisma, cash and credibility among militant Muslims. A former al Qaeda battlefield commander in Afghanistan perhaps best known for escaping from Bagram Air Base, al-Libi has been active in taped speeches urging resistance and trying to recruit new members. The latest details of bin Laden operation "He's a cleric, he's a speaker, but he's not a fighter," said Cruickshank, an alumni fellow at New York University's Center on Law and Security. The succession challenge is compounded by the fact that, even before bin Laden's death, many experts said al Qaeda appeared to be staggering due to operational and organizational setbacks caused by actions like Predator drone strikes and the intensified allied campaign in Afghanistan and beyond. They include men like Abu Yahya al-Libi, a leading al Qaeda ideologue.
