-- It's been difficult for die-hard fans of "Breaking Bad" to let go of the main character, Walter White -- and it turns out it's not been easy for the actor who portrayed him, either. " The actor has taken on the role of President Lyndon B. Johnson in the Broadway production of "All the Way" and said the current president could learn a thing or two from the former leader.

"With Walter White, over the course of six years, I covered it all. "I initially turned it down -- I thought, 'I can't do "Godzilla" after "Breaking Bad"; that's a huge step down,' " he said.
