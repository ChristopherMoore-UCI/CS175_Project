Ethan, who told CNN via email he doesn't want his full name used out of privacy concerns, says he originally wrote the eponymous app as a way for his friends to get in touch with him. It's gotten so popular that Ethan says the app gets more than one download per minute. However, Ethan decided some ground rules were in order, which include: -Ethan can't respond when he's asleep -No emergency messages -Don't ask Ethan to do your work -Don't fall in love with Ethan Now, people Ethan has never met are depending on him to help them address the minor conundrums of life: this dress or that one? They had a fantastical exchange about dwarves and love, and it signified to Ethan the moment when the app had truly gotten out in the wild. Ethan, in this case, is the creator of the TextEthan app.
