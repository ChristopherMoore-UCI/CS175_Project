If Lohan  violates the rules of her rehab program or fails a drug test before her next court date in February, she will be sent to jail for 180 days, a Los Angeles Superior Court has ordered. -- Actress Lindsay Lohan called 911 to ask for police help during an "incident" at the Betty Ford Center, her lawyer said Wednesday. Lohan checked into the Betty Ford Center on September 27, after it became clear a judge intended to send her to jail because of a failed drug test. Authorities in the Southern California city of Palm Desert confirmed Tuesday that they are investigating a claim that Lohan assaulted an employee at the center. The judge eventually ordered Lohan to stay in the drug rehabilitation program until January 3 instead of going to jail.
