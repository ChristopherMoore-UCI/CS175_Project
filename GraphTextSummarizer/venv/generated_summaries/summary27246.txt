Farmer headed to the sleepy Wisconsin village of Livingston, which was about to become ground zero for the latest meteorite hunt. Watch the video Michael Farmer, whom the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, Illinois, calls the "world's top meteorite hunter," said that as soon as he saw video of the display, he hopped a flight to Wisconsin. On average, prices for pieces of this particular space rock have been set at about $10 to $20 per gram, according to Farmer. " By definition, those pieces are what scientists call meteorites: the remnants of the meteor that don't burn up along the journey and instead make it all the way to the ground. Later that day, the kids combed the school grounds for meteorites during recess.
