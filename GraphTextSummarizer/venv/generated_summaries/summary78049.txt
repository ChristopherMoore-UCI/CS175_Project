The new Apple TV just got a small upgrade, in the form of live video streaming for MLB and NBA games. Some of this could be to reduce Apple's dependence on other companies, so the iPhone is more reliable. Apple has tried to do "social" a bit with Ping, its social network based around iTunes music, and GameCenter, its social gaming service. But integrating your existing online social connections could be useful for many of Apple's products, ranging from the iPhone's address book to the App Store to photo sharing. Google TV isn't a big success, while Boxee, Roku and TiVo Premiere haven't caught on with mainstream consumers.
