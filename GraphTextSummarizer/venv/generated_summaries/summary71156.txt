A growing number of states are bucking our federal government's policy of absolute marijuana prohibition, and the Department of Justice recently signaled it will not challenge state laws that regulate the cultivation and sale of marijuana. According to CDC data on youth drug use, from 2009 to 2011 -- a time when youth marijuana use increased nationally -- the percentage of Colorado teens using marijuana dropped more than any other state in the country and is now below the national average. Federal agencies report that 40% of violent crimes in the U.S. are linked to alcohol use,  whereas those same agencies report that marijuana users usually do not commit violent crimes. Today, marijuana prohibition has proven itself just as disastrous a public policy failure as alcohol prohibition before it. And much like with marijuana today, even under alcohol prohibition most Americans who wanted a drink had no problem finding one.
