The serial entrepreneur sat down with CNN at SXSW for a chat about Jelly, social networking and why seeing Twitter hashtags sometimes seems "surreal." At 9:45 in the morning after his 40th birthday you might expect Biz Stone, best known for co-founding Twitter, to be a little bleary. Despite its lofty pedigree -- its investors include Bono and Al Gore -- Jelly has baffled some tech pundits who don't understand why people would use it when they can just poll their friends directly through Facebook or Twitter. But what Jelly does is blend Twitter and Facebook together. Part social app, part visual search engine, Jelly lets users mine their social networks for answers to such questions as, "What kind of plant is this?" or "How do I hook up this TV?" Jelly is unusual in that instead of computer algorithms like Google's, it relies on human knowledge to help users find the answers they seek.
