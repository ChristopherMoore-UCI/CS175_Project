"It's the first time I've been able to wear a bikini in probably 10 years, that I've felt confident enough to wear a bikini," Hart said on "Good Morning America" on Wednesday. " Hart's been working on weight loss for more than a year, as she first revealed that she'd dropped two sizes in April 2013. "It's not everyday I like to show a lot of skin, but these days, I'm feeling confidant (sic)," she wrote on Instagram on April 8 along with a photo of herself in a revealing pink bikini that presumably will be seen in her upcoming commercial for the weight loss company. "I've been able to be fit and healthy, and have enough energy for my (three) boys," she continued, not to mention energy for her husband, Mark Wilkerson. On Nutrisystem's website, Hart explains she first signed up for the program because she'd been carrying around an extra 30 pounds after the arrival of her third child, Tucker, who turns 2 in December.
