He often cried openly, with flashbacks triggered by something as small as macaroni reminiscent of Abu Salim chow, said his older brother, Nabil Shafei. "He wanted to expose the massacre of Abu Salim." Hussein Shafei told Human Rights Watch about the carnage he witnessed. Tasbeeh Herwees, a Libyan-American journalism student in California, recalled in a blog post the funerals for the Abu Salim victims held in the summer of 2009 when she visited Benghazi. As many as 1,200 prisoners were killed at Abu Salim in the summer of 1996, according to Human Rights Watch. With the Libyan regime on the brink of collapse, Shafei hopes the truth about Abu Salim will finally be known.
