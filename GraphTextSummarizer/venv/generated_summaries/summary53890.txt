-- As winds, rains and fears calmed in the Washington, D.C., area Sunday, hundreds arrived at the newly opened Martin Luther King Jr. National Memorial Sunday afternoon to revel, share stories and celebrate. Sunday's planned dedication of the $120 million Martin Luther King Jr. National Memorial in Washington was to coincide with the 48th anniversary of the historic March on Washington and King's famed "I Have A Dream" speech. But while many of the MLK weekend events went ahead, the centerpiece Sunday dedication was postponed as the East Coast hunkered down for the battering winds and rains of Hurricane Irene. The memorial site, which features a striking 30-foot statue of King gazing out on the iconic Tidal Basin, lies between the Lincoln Memorial and the Thomas Jefferson Memorial on the National Mall. As the clouds cleared Sunday afternoon, visitors to the memorial were greeted by blue skies and mostly intact bleachers that had been placed ahead of the ceremonies.
