Yet the closing ceremony had an antipodean feel as Australia's Gold Coast were handed the honor of hosting the next tournament, before Kylie Minogue performed on stage. Apparently caught up in the excitement of the moment, Australian runner Genevieve LaCaze crashed the stage during Minogue's performance, dancing and waving an Australian flag before being removed by security. "I just saw the opportunity to get on stage with Kylie." Elsewhere Jamaica beat England in the bronze medal match in the netball whilst Australia thrashed New Zealand to clinch gold, destroying their rivals 58-40 in what was one of the Commonwealth Games' few truly world class fields. As many as 70,000 people attended the closing ceremony in Hampden Park after a day of action that began in a deluge and ended with Australia winning the final gold medal of the games as the baton was passed to the country's Gold Coast, who will be the next host in 2018.
