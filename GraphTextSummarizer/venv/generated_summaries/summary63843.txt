"Representatives of police unions are taking advantage of and seizing upon the actions of a lone, troubled individual who shot his ex-girlfriend and then killed two police officers in Brooklyn to smear, discredit and end the broad social movement that has demanded accountability, an end to police misconduct and police violence. A protest against racism and police violence packed sidewalks in New York on Tuesday, despite calls from the city's mayor for a pause in demonstrations. Buildings and landmarks on the New York skyline -- including the Empire State and Chrysler buildings, One World Trade Center and 30 Rockefeller Plaza -- were set to dim their lights for five minutes Tuesday night in honor of slain officers. And in some of his posts, investigators have said, he mentioned the controversial cases of Michael Brown and Eric Garner, African-American men who were killed by police. The protest came hours after a moment of silence at New York's City Hall at 2:47 p.m., three days to the minute since a gunman ambushed New York Police Department Officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu.
