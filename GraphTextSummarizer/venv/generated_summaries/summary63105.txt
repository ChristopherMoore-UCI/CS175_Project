I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven. According to Matthew 16:17-20, Jesus said to Peter: "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah, for this was not revealed to you by flesh and blood, but by my Father in heaven. The Gospel of John records that Jesus had to show up for them to even believe that he had died and risen to heaven. Now, some Catholic churches are alienating women by refusing to allow girls to serve as altar servants. In South Riding, Virginia, at Corpus Christi Catholic Church, the Rev. Michael Taylor announced that the church will no longer train girls to be altar servants.
