Speaking to CNN's Robyn Curnow, Stiglitz expressed optimism about Africa's economic prospects, but he said there should be more discussion about undisclosed bank accounts in the West that are used to facilitate high-level fraud in Africa. "One of the countries that hosted the G-20 and talked all the time about tax corruption, that same country is a haven for corrupt money and refuses to repatriate money that has been stolen from Africa," he said. "There's been a lot of discussion in the G-20 about secret bank accounts as tax agents -- there hasn't been enough discussion of secret bank accounts as corruption facilitators. -- Industrialized countries have been enabling corruption in Africa by providing crooked officials with a haven for their money, according to Nobel economics laureate Joseph Stiglitz. " Stiglitz added that there was reason for optimism about economic growth in Africa, with changes to economic policies in recent years starting to bear fruit.
