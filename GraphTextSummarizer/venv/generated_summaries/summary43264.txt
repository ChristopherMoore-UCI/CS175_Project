Iraqi affairs scholar Reidar Visser suggests the autonomy initiative -- which he notes is the first of its kind outside the Kurdish areas -- "shows that the inhabitants in Basra may care more for their local patriotism than for their religious identity as Shiites." "Basra holds perhaps 60 percent of Iraq's oil reserves, whereas most of the other Shiite areas of Iraq have only insignificant amounts of oil," said Visser, a research fellow at the Norwegian Institute for International Affairs. The Kurds have had their three-province autonomous region in the north for years, and the central government and the Kurds have had their disagreements: The Kurds have used their autonomy to pursue oil contracts that aren't recognized by Iraq's central government. Lawmakers have started a drive that would give the Shiite-dominated province the status of a federal region -- the same legal power as the multi-province autonomous region of Kurdistan in northern Iraq. The move would usher in self-government and could boost oil income in Basra, although the organizers of the drive have indicated they would be more cooperative with the central Iraqi government than Kurdistan is on oil matters. Another idea for an autonomous region has emerged from the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq, one of the parties in the ruling United Iraq Alliance.
