-- Venezuela's president has spoken with embattled Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi about a proposal to bring an international mediation team to Libya, Venezuela's information minister confirmed Wednesday. Earlier this week, Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez said the United States' criticisms of Gadhafi had a clear aim: military invasion. On Monday, Chavez said Gadhafi "has been my friend and our friend for a long time" in remarks broadcast on Venezuelan state television. "All the contacts that Venezuela is making with the Arab world and the entire world is for peace in Libya. But there is no doubt that, regarding Libya, a campaign of lies is being woven -- the same that has been woven about Venezuela for a long time," he said.
