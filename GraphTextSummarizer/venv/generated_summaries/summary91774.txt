Appeals courts differ on Obamacare; Supreme Court case likely FAQ: What the Obamacare court decisions mean for you Watchdog: Last week, the D.C. circuit dealt Obamacare supporters an appeals court setback when it limited subsidies and tax breaks available for millions of people who signed up for coverage through a federally-run insurance marketplace. The court found lawmakers did not violate the Constitution when laying out the so-called individual mandate, which requires most Americans buy health insurance or pay a penalty. Conversely, the Sissel challenge now faces a potentially uphill battle for Supreme Court consideration following the appeals decision. But the court concluded the challenge did not pass muster -- that the politically-charged law approved with only Democratic support in 2010 was not designed mainly to raise money for the government, but to ensure more Americans got health coverage.
