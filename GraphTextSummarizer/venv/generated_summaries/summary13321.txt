U.S. golfers Ben Crane, Bubba Watson, Rickie Fowler and Hunter Mahan first joined forces in 2011 for "Oh, Oh, Oh", and the quartet have once again taken to the mic -- this time to help provide clean water for the people of Ethiopia. " The lyrics to the song -- which includes references to a long list of golf stars including Tiger Woods, Adam Scott, Louis Oosthuizen and Stewart "Stewey" Cink -- were penned by Crane's friend Mat Kearney. I think it's awesome that we will be able to provide clean water and awareness for our brothers and sisters in Ethiopia. "If we can reach new fans and grow the game of golf in the process, that's a huge bonus. The organization's aim is to provide clean water to impoverished communities.
