"Under the banner of his South Sudan Democratic Movement (SSDM) and its military wing, the South Sudan Army, Gen. Athor was considered the most powerful post-election insurrectionist" the Geneva-based independent research project said in its 2011 report on what was then southern Sudan. John Prendergast, co-founder of the Enough Project, said the reported death of Athor "highlights the urgency with which the South Sudan government, with international support, must address inter-communal divisions within the South. The Small Arms Survey says that although both the government of South Sudan and the SPLA have alleged that Athor received support from the Sudan government in Khartoum, there is no independent evidence to support these claims. -- The newly independent Republic of South Sudan has announced the death of a prominent renegade rebel leader. The death of Athor was not part of a government plan, because the government had declared general amnesty to all rebel groups in South Sudan, the vice president told reporters.
