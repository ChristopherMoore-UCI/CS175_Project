According to the prosecutor, the sentence handed down "also takes into account additional income and tax losses for 2008 and 2009 -- when she also failed to file federal returns -- along with her outstanding tax liability to the state of New Jersey, for a total income of approximately $2.3 million and total tax loss of approximately $1,006,517." Right on schedule, singer Lauryn Hill reported to federal prison on Monday to begin a three-month sentence for failing to pay federal income taxes. The musician and mother of six pleaded guilty last year to three counts of failing to file tax returns on more than $1.8 million from 2005 to 2007. The Grammy winning artist was sentenced to three months in federal prison, which she'll serve at a low security female facility in Danbury, Connecticut. After her three-month prison stint, Hill was also sentenced to three months of home confinement and a year of supervised probation.
