In an open letter to the actor issued Thursday, Greyhound President and CEO Dave Leach said he was disheartened to hear about the comments Baldwin made about the company. " Leach then touts the hundreds of new buses the company has added to its fleet as well as the extra legroom, leather seats, power outlets and free Wi-Fi. -- American Airlines has already called Alec Baldwin "extremely rude," and now the actor isn't making any friends at Greyhound either. Greyhound is an American icon, a proud company that many people depend on to get them to their destinations, the same people who watch your films and TV show. You could therefore play 'Words With Friends' during your entire trip and nobody would give you any grief over it," Leach tells Baldwin in the letter.
