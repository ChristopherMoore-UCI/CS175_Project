Inter Milan celebrated their fourth successive Scudetto with a 3-0 home victory against Siena on Sunday as coach Jose Mourinho demanded total commitment from his players. Mourinho has already started looking ahead to the quest for a fifth successive Serie A crown and already has transfer targets in mind, such as Genoa's Diego Milito. "It was important to win, there wouldn't have been much point to our party if we hadn't won," said Mourinho. Coach Mourinho demanded total commitment from Inter as they celebrated another Italian title. Any thoughts they would take their foot off the gas were dispelled as goals from Esteban Cambiasso (45), Mario Balotelli (52) and Zlatan Ibrahimovic (76) secured the win.
