Some 52 Indian citizens and a Bangladeshi national will be sent home soon for their role in an attack on emergency services crews and their vehicles after a fatal traffic accident in Singapore's Little India district earlier this month, according to the police commissioner, Ng Joo Hee. Around 200 foreign workers who were at the scene of the attack but did not directly participate will be issued an advisory, and will be allowed to stay in Singapore, "on condition of continued good behavior," Ng said Tuesday. Most of the 53 individuals, who were being held in prison on Tuesday, have been in Singapore for less than five years, Ng said in a statement. "They have been served with stern police warnings and immigration removal orders, and will be repatriated to their home countries shortly," Ng said. -- Singapore plans to deport dozens of foreign workers who were involved in the country's first major riot in more than 40 years, authorities said Tuesday.
