Makhmalbaf said he has been in contact with fellow Iranian film director Jafaar Panahi, winner of the  "Golden Lion" prize at the Venice Film Festival for his 2000 film "Dayareh" or "Circle," who was jailed for six years in 2010.

They didn't let us make more films, they censored all the books that I wrote, so we come out to do something." Samira's film "Blackboards" won the Cannes Jury Prize, while Hana had to flee Iran while shooting her film "Green Days" amid protests during the Iranian elections two years ago.
