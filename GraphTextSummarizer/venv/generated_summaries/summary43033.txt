-- Danish veteran Thomas Bjorn carded six straight birdies on the back nine at Wentworth to revive his third round in spectacular fashion and take a five-shot lead into the final round of the European Tour's flagship event at Wentworth. In a bunched leaderboard, there were 49 players within five shots of the lead, including FedExCup points leader Jimmy Walker (tied for fifth at six-under and world number one Adam Scott of Australia (tied for 11th, two shots back. "I would have to shoot ridiculously low tomorrow to have any realistic chance but even then Thomas is so far ahead," Northern Ireland's McIlroy told the official European Tour website. Meanwhile, in the Colonial tournament on the PGA Tour, David Toms, Chad Campbell, Chris Stroud and Japan's Hideki Matsuyama shared the lead on seven-under after the third round. Former World No.1 Rory McIlroy recovered from a double bogey on his opening hole to card a 69 to be tied fourth on eight-under with Dutchman Joost Luiten (67) but seven shots behind the rampaging Bjorn.
