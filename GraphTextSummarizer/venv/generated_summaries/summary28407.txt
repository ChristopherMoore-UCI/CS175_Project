Like many of imperial Japan's industrial facilities, Hashima was a destination for hundreds of Korean forced laborers. In the peace museum at Nagasaki, testimonies from Korean forced laborers line the walls, collated by museum director Yasunori Takazane. The island expanded as Japan's demand for coal grew -- upwards in a forest of apartment blocks and outwards by a series of land reclamations. Japan wants Hashima recognized as a UNESCO world heritage site but South Korea objects. As for Hashima, some seem not to want to remember that dark side and focus instead on its contribution as a locomotive of Japan's industrialization.
