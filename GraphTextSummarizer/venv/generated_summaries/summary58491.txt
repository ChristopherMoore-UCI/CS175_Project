-- Record floodwaters inundated parts of southern Louisiana early Tuesday after intense rains caused flash flooding and prompted hundreds of rescues. Stansbury, from Lafayette Parish, said residents knew Monday would be wet but didn't foresee the volume or intensity. "We're still conducting rescues," Lafayette Parish Sheriff's Office spokesman Kip Judice said Monday evening. Maj. Ginny Higgins of the St. Martin Parish Sheriff's Office said flooding affected at least 15 to 20 roads Monday in that parish. Judice, from Lafayette Parish, said water levels were continuing to rise in his area.
