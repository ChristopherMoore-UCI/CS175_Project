It would stand to reason that in real life, time travelers from a future era -- or who had at least visited the future -- might give themselves away by mentioning events that haven't yet occurred. A convention for time travelers was held in May 2005 by then-graduate student Amal Dorai at MIT, but no one living among us from the future showed up, although the event attracted 450 guests, according to Nature. Others have tried in the past to lure time travelers into exposing themselves, Nemiroff and Wilson note in their paper. Renowned physicist Stephen Hawking, similarly, said in a July 2012 interview that he had thrown a party for time travelers, sending out invitations after the party occurred. Since we don't think anyone has built one already, I think we're safe from time travelers for the time being.
