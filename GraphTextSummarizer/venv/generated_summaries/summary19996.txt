On Tuesday Cavendish drew criticism from Tom Veelers after the riders collided as part of a sprint finish, leaving the Dutchman -- Kittel's Argos-Shimano teammate -- on the ground. Expected to have a major say in the overall points classification at the Tour de France, Omega Pharma-Quick Step's Cavendish has only won one stage and trails Cannondale's Peter Sagan by 96 points with sprint friendly stages running out. Holding more than a bike's length lead nearing the end of the 135-mile 12th stage from Fougeres to Tours in northwest France, Cavendish was caught and finished half a wheel behind the German. He was about two bike lengths ahead of the carnage that left teammate Edvald Boasson Hagen nursing shoulder and arm injuries. "I would like to dedicate this win to my team, especially Tom Veelers who had to fight today just to finish," added Kittel.
