Snowfall shut down air traffic for several hours in the afternoon Wednesday. The border closing and flight cancellations come a day after heavy snow paralyzed travel in the Paris region, where officials suspended air traffic at one of Europe's busiest airports, closed several highways and shut down the Eiffel Tower. However, GÃ©rard Gauzet, director of Paris motorways, said Thursday morning that "traffic should be back to normal by mid-afternoon. At Charles de Gaulle airport, "air traffic is almost back to normal," according to an airport spokeswoman. German's second largest airport, in Munich, announced the cancellation of 51 flights, most of them resulting from canceled flights at other airports.
