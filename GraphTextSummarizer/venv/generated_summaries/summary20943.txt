This opportunity to network and exchange business ideas is a benefit of sponsoring a Formula 1 team not to be overlooked Reuters' contract with the Williams F1 team has delivered just that, says Berry: "The team boasts the strongest stable of global business brands as sponsors, some of which are also our key customers or business partners -- for example RBS, Allianz, Accenture and Lenovo. "Indeed, Williams F1 drivers have played a part in promoting Reuters products over the past few years. Obviously, the larger sponsors will receive a good size logo on a visible spot of the car or even become title sponsors such as ING with Renault or AT&T with Williams. We also have the rights to use Williams F1 imagery to enhance our marketing communications materials and customer events." Modern sponsorship contracts in Formula 1 are tailored to the needs of both the sponsor and the team.
