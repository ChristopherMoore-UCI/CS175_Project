"Nowadays our range price of apartments is about $2,500 or $3,000 per meter square," said Agung Wirajaya, assistant VP for marketing development at property developer Agung Podomoro. "If you think 'oh you know I don't have enough money now,' you're not going to then catch up with the race because property prices in Jakarta go up above 10% a year," Abdousaalaam added. In the Indonesian capital of Jakarta, not even the notorious traffic congestion can slow the voracious demand for property. Yet despite the lack of room and high demand adding to the premium of new-builds, some developers say there is still far more value for money to be found in Jakarta than in other popular Asian cities. The World Bank predicts solid future growth for Indonesia's economy although there remains much work to be done in improving infrastructure within Jakarta to ensure further expansion in the property market.
