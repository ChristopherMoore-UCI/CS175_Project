Judge Lois Bloom ordered al Abbadi be held without bail until his trial was completed, as he poses a danger to the community as an al Qaeda operative "with extensive weapon and explosives training," according to Zainab Ahmad, one of the prosecutors handling the case. The complaint, which was unsealed on Tuesday, states that both Alvi and al-Abbadi were members of al Qaeda and had both fought against U.S. forces in Afghanistan. Al-Abbadi had also fought in Iraq, ambushing U.S. military convoys, according to court documents. Both men were arrested in Saudi Arabia and then transferred to U.S. custody. "There is no escape from the reach of our law for violent terrorists, especially if they target our military," Loretta Lynch, the U.S. attorney for the eastern district of New York, said in a press release.
