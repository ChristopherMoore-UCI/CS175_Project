It was Hewitt's first title since downing Federer in Halle in 2010 and his first in Australia since Sydney nine years ago. Both men will now spend the next week preparing for the year's first major. " Federer, playing with a larger racket head this year in a bid to recapture old form, hadn't been broken en route to the final and struck 20 aces in the semifinals against Jeremy Chardy. But two-time grand slam winner Hewitt, a fine returner, broke the Swiss three times in the first set. The victory over the 17-time grand slam champion won't be enough to earn Hewitt a seeding at the Australian Open next week but once again he'll be a player the favorites want to avoid in the early rounds.
