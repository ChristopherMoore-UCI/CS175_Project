The Army, which oversees the National Day of Prayer ceremonies at the Pentagon, feared that if Graham spoke at the Pentagon, Islamic militants would publicize his comments, potentially fueling tensions in Muslim nations like Iraq and Afghanistan, where U.S. troops are deployed. However, the son of famed evangelist Billy Graham has a history of comments that bothered the Pentagon. The group penned a letter to Defense Secretary Robert Gates on behalf of Muslim military members and defense department employees. " Graham later tried to temper his remarks by saying that he had Muslim friends. But I love the people of Islam," he said, adding some of his work has been in Muslim nations.
