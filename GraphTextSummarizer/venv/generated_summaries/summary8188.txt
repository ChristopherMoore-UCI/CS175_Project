The ministry said France "condemns all taking of power by nonconstitutional means" and calls on people in Niger "to show responsibility in the interest of the country," which gained its independence from France in 1960. "The secretary-general has called on the stakeholders in Niger to swiftly revert to constitutional order in the settlement of the political crisis," said a statement from U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. "The chairperson of the commission stresses that the relevant AU instruments systematically condemn any unconstitutional change and, accordingly, he condemns the seizure of power by force that took place in Niger," said a statement from his office. French journalist Diallo Doudacar said the situation in Niger was calm Friday. He said he had been following developments in the nation with concern after a Niger military official announced the constitution had been suspended.
