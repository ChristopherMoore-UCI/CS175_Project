On your next visit to New York City, skip the pricey tourist traps for an inexpensive afternoon jaunt celebrating both river and rail that offers a glimpse into the golden age of passenger and freight train travel. Via Rail's Canadian: Toronto to Vancouver, Canada The 20th Century Limited is now just a memory, but Via Rail's Canadian route offers a taste of modern rail luxury that draws more than 100,000 travelers each year. Rail devotee Posner recommends taking this trip in the off-season, when relatively empty cars grant you the sense of being "on your own private train," but keep in mind that Canadian winters aren't for the faint of heart. Also make time, of course, for the Winnipeg Railway Museum, located right in the station, to view 37,500 square feet of railway artifacts, including the first steam locomotive on the Canadian prairies, the Countess of Dufferin, and an early diesel locomotive. In the morning, draw the curtains on your big picture window to catch a glimpse of the billion-year-old exposed bedrock of the Canadian Shield, peppered with small settlements established at regular intervals to service locomotives.
