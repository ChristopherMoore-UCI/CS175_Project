The hours spent in front of screens have replaced playtime outside school, and too much focus on academics and testing has eroded playtime inside schools. Children spend about half their waking hours in school and what happens there has a big part to play in the inner confidence and social responsibility they develop. One dimension of healthy childhood that gives kids a solid footing in life is having lots of child-centered play throughout the early years and even into grade school. No time for the arts and play and the social and emotional learning that will help children handle what life has in store. This is kids' ongoing way of coping with life and it is crucial for building inner resilience and security.
