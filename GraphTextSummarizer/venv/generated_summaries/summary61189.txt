Falardeau got in touch with the Orlando students through E-Nable, an online volunteer organization started by Rochester Institute of Technology research scientist Jon Schull to match people who have 3-D printers with children in need of hands and arms. The team has made electronic arms for five children and are working with three more kids including Wyatt. "Wyatt felt like he was making a difference for himself and other children." As they got ready to leave the campus, her son told her he can't wait to see what he will accomplish with his new arm. Comprehensive statistics aren't available for the number of children with amputations, such as Wyatt. Children have requested colorful designs inspired by superheroes, Disney's "Frozen," and in Wyatt's case, the blue-skinned men from "Blue Man Group."
