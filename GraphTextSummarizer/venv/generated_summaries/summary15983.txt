"Seeing no reason for police officers or courts to blind themselves to that commonsense reality, we hold that a child's age properly informs the Miranda custody analysis." At no time were the youth's legal guardian or parents notified, and Miranda rights were never administered. Larceny and juvenile delinquency charges were filed, and courts subsequently allowed the confession to be admitted as evidence, concluding J.D.B. was not in custody and talked voluntarily. "It is beyond dispute that children will often feel bound to submit to police questioning when an adult in the same circumstances would feel to free to leave," said Justice Sonia Sotomayor for the court. As seen on countless cop shows on TV, the warnings protect against police coercion, but also establish when a person is "in custody."
