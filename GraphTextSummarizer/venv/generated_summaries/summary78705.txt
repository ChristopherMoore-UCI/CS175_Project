"Celebrities' names were slapped up on signs but they were rarely seen in those establishments and it was simply the name value that they hoped would draw in that celebrity's fans or tourists who hoped to see other celebrities there," Jacobson says. "There's definitely value in a popular celebrity's name," Laurie Jacobson, author of  "Dishing Hollywood," tells CNN.
