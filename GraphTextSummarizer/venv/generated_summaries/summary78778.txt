Van der Sloot went to Peru to escape having to enter the high security section of a psychiatric hospital, Anita van der Sloot said. " But Peru authorities said they had overwhelming evidence pointing to van der Sloot, and when he was transferred to Peru, van der Sloot confessed to the crime, police said. Meanwhile, in a Dutch newspaper article published Monday, van der Sloot says he was "tricked" into confessing to the murder of Flores. According to transcripts of his confession, van der Sloot said he elbowed Flores in the face before strangling her and then suffocating her with his shirt. In the transcript, van der Sloot said that after Flores read the e-mail, she punched him in the face.
