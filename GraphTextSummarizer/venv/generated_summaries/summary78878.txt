Pele, considered one of the greatest football players of all time, said last year that Neymar -- his fellow Brazilian -- was even better than Messi, an Argentinean. -- Not content with having the world's best player, Lionel Messi, on their books, Barcelona have moved to sign Pele's "modern successor" -- Neymar. "His style is beautiful to watch and he has received recognition and praise from the legendary Pele himself, of whom many believe he is the modern successor." Neymar, the current South American player of the year, revitalized Santos, Pele's former club, scoring 138 goals in only 229 matches. With Neymar expected to move on when his contract was due to expire next year, a transfer to Europe was widely anticipated. At 21, he is an established international with Brazil and will be counted on to lead the nation in next year's World Cup on home soil, although he has also drawn criticism from Pele for some of his outings.
