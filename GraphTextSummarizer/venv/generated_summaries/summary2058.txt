The allegations at Clark Atlanta follow the hazing scandal at Florida A&M University that began with the death of drum major Robert Champion, 26, last November. -- A high school marching band played at Clark Atlanta University's football game Saturday night after the university's band was suspended over possible hazing, officials said. Clark Atlanta announced Friday that its Mighty Marching Panthers band would be temporarily suspended because of hazing allegations. It said there is no immediate evidence of hazing or other foul play, but it is investigating. "However, regardless of the findings, Clark Atlanta is prepared to take whatever actions are necessary to ensure a safe, healthy, nonthreatening experience for our student musicians."
