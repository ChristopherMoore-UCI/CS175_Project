"Every international flight is monitored and there have been no significant amounts of radiation," said Army Col. Marc Hutson. -- A charter flight carrying family members of U.S. military service members serving in Japan landed Thursday on U.S. soil in Denver. When she landed in Denver there were service members on hand to help her with Adrian and make sure she had whatever she might need. "Then I heard of radiation positioning in the water in Tokyo and I said, 'It's time to go," she said. The flight contained 144 people who voluntarily left Japan in the wake of the catastrophic earthquake and tsunami and ongoing concerns about the crippled Fukushima Daichi nuclear power plant.
