Hazare only recently rose to national prominence, as his protest seems to have struck a chord with Indian society across the spectrum because corruption is pervasive at all levels of government, observers say. Singh, whose government is roiled in massive corruption scandals, said in a national address earlier in the week that no single measure could handle chronic corruption. Hazare was planning to go on a hunger strike to call for stronger anti-corruption measures when he was detained Tuesday. Amnesty International called Thursday for U.S. President Barack Obama to urge Singh "to respect the rights to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly in the context of anti-corruption rallies taking place in India. " Activists have appealed to government employees to take a day off work in a show of solidarity with Hazare.
