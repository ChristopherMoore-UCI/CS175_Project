On Friday, Westmoreland County District Attorney John Peck told CNN that Hribal is charged with 21 counts of attempted homicide, in addition to 21 counts of aggravated assault and having a weapon on school property. Two victims -- one in critical but stable condition, the other in fair condition -- were still at Forbes Regional Hospital in Monroeville, Pennsylvania, on Friday, hospital spokesman Jesse Miller said. A teenager tackled by a vice principal refused to drop the knives he'd used to stab 21 at his Pittsburgh-area high school, saying, "My work is not done, I have more people to kill," according to a criminal complaint released Friday. In less than five minutes, the scene at the school transformed from a regular morning to sheer terror, as students bled, screamed and -- in a few notable cases -- rallied to help one another. Their alleged attacker -- 16-year-old Alex Hribal -- was eventually disarmed, handcuffed and taken into custody.
