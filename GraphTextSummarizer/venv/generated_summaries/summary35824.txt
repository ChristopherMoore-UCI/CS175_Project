Barca remain a point behind Real in second position and are ahead of third placed Atletico Madrid, which won comfortably against Levante on Saturday, only on goal difference. After taking a three-goal lead in the first half through Nabil Fekir, Alexandre Lacazette Lacazette and Mouhamadou Dabo goals, Lyon conceded two in the second period but held on to claim victory. But the first fixture of 2015 marked the end of a 22-game winning streak for Real Madrid which went down 2-1 to an all-action Valencia side Sunday. "There were key moments in which we could make the second goal," Ancelotti told the Real Madrid website. United had to wait until the second half before goals from Ander Herrera and Angel Di Maria secured a 2-0 victory over Yeovil Town.
