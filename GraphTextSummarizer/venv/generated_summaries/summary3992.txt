-- The Federal Aviation Administration proposed a $2.75 million civil penalty against Boeing Co. on Friday for allegedly using certain parts in 777 construction that did not meet standards and repeatedly missing deadlines to address related quality control issues. The issue did not present an immediate concern for the safety of the plane but manufacturers agree to follow rigid FAA standards when a plane is certified, and that includes rules on parts. "Manufacturers must make it a priority to identify and correct quality problems in a timely manner," said FAA Administrator Michael Huerta. Problems began in 2008 when the FAA said Boeing discovered it had been installing fasteners that did not meet government standards on the long-haul jets. The FAA said Boeing's commercial aircraft division took more than two years after learning about quality control gaps involving fasteners in 777 construction to fully address the problem.
