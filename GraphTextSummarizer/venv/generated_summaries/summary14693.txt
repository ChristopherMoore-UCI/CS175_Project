With Marvel deal, Sony opts to lease rather than sell Spider-Man Badass Digest first reported that the deal was closing. How Superman, Wonder Woman and Batman have changed their looks through the years "Civil War," for which the brothers are in preproduction and which is considered to be a mini-Avengers movie because of the large cast of heroes, has a May 6, 2016, release date. Joe and Anthony Russo, who directed "Captain America: The Winter Soldier" and will return for "Captain America: Civil War," are cementing themselves as Marvel's main movie executors. The brothers will direct both parts of the studio's "Avengers: Infinity War," taking over the billion-dollar franchise from Joss Whedon, who directed the first two Avengers films. They collaborated on "Civil War," which the Russos will begin shooting next month.
