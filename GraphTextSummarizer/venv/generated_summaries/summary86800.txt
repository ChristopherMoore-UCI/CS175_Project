The name "Seven Stars" represents the seven prefectures of Kyushu, the seven carriages of the train and the seven main tourist attractions of the island (nature, cuisine, hot springs, history/culture, spiritual sites, local hospitality and sightseeing). JR Rail says the train will be fitted with furniture that conveys the nobility of traditional Japanese culture. JR East's upcoming Cruise Train won't be the first Japanese train to take the super-luxury route. Yamagata-born Ken Okuyama, well known in automobile design circles, was brought in to style the company's super slick new Cruise Train, due to start chugging down the tracks in spring 2017. Magic, judging by the above images released by Japanese rail company JR East.
