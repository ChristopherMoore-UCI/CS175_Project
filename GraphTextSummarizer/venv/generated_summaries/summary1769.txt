There are also concerns this could set a dangerous precedent for Jordan, a key U.S. ally that has Jihadists and other al Qaeda linked militants in its jails. -- Almost a month after he was kidnapped, Jordan's Ambassador to Libya was freed by his captors on Tuesday in an apparent exchange for a Libyan militant jailed in Jordan. "This is clearly a swap deal -- the authorities in Jordan and Libya can claim otherwise," said Mohamed Eljarh, a Libya analyst and a contributor to Foreign Policy magazine's "Transitions" blog. The ambassador said his kidnapping was an "isolated incident" specifically for the release of Mohammed al-Drissi, the Libyan Islamist militant who was serving a life sentence in Jordan since 2007. Diplomats and officials have been frequently targeted by militias and extremist groups that have grown in size and influence in Libya since the 2011 revolution.
