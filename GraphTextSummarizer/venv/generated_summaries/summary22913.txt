Communication among team members is made possible by head coach Andres Contreras, a Mexico City native and former player in Mexican leagues, who is bilingual. As the members of the team are introduced, fans jump up to cheer them on, clapping and chanting, full of team spirit. The law also allows one additional foreigner born to Mexican parents per team. The season in northern Mexico is four months long. The team is "The Miners" and on a recent night it was playing at home in Cananea, a town of 33,000 in northwestern Mexico, known for its large deposits of copper and other metals.
