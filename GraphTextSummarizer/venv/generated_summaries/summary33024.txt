NRC Chairman Gregory Jaczko is scheduled to visit the Fort Calhoun plant on Monday morning. Although an inflatable water-filled structure called an aqua berm surrounding the plant was punctured by machinery early Sunday morning, key areas of the facility are not in danger of being flooded, the NRC and the owner of the Fort Calhoun plant said. This year's Midwestern flooding has also led to a spate of rumors about the Fort Calhoun plant that OPPD and the NRC have been trying to knock down. With or without the berm, the chances of floodwater getting into the building where the core is kept are almost zero, said Dave Van Der Kamp, with the Nebraska Public Power District. The Fort Calhoun plant, which has been shut down since April for refueling, has as much as two feet of water in places.
