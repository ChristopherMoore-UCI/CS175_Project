-- Spin-bowler Monty Panesar has earned a recall to England's Test cricket squad for the Ashes series against Australia, due to begin on November 25 in Brisbane. He gets the nod ahead of Yorkshire's Tim Bresnan, who has been an ever-present in England squads this summer. James Anderson (Lancashire) Ian Bell (Warwickshire) Tim Bresnan (Yorkshire) Stuart Broad (Nottinghamshire) Paul Collingwood (Durham) Steven Davies (wk) (Surrey) Steven Finn (Middlesex) Eoin Morgan (Middlesex) England and Wales Cricket board (ECB) national selector Geoff Miller is confident they have selected a competitive squad for the series, saying in an official statement: "We believe we've selected an outstanding Test squad for what will be a fiercely contested Ashes series in Australia. "We feel that following an excellent season with Sussex Monty Panesar deserves his opportunity to assume the role as England's second spinner behind Graeme Swann," said Miller.
