A woman prime minister had become so much part of the British way of life that for two or three weeks after Thatcher left office the media had become so accustomed to referring to the prime minister as "she" and "her" that several times TV and radio journalists slipped up on air and had to correct themselves and refer to the incoming prime minister John Major as "he" and "him." In fact, her main legacy for women was merely that she was a woman holding the position of prime minister for 11Â½ years. My son was 5 years old when Thatcher first won election as prime minister, the first woman to do so. As prime minister, Thatcher did almost nothing to promote women's rights actively, but at the same time, an entire generation grew up assuming it was normal to have a woman as prime minister. -- When it came to promoting other women in politics, Margaret Thatcher was a disappointment.
