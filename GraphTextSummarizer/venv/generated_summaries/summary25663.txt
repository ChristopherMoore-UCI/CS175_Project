" As if the culinary gods hadn't blessed San Sebastian enough with Michelin stars and pintxos bars, there are also scores of artisanal producers dotted throughout the historic town. An evening tour led by a donostiarra (a San Sebastian local) takes visitors from one to the next for small bites and pours of local ciders and wines, especially txakoli, a slightly sparkling young white wine. Today that reputation is as much focused on pintxos bars as Michelin stars and, having gradually recovered from an epic lunch, it's time to consider evening options.
