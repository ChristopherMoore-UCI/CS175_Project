Stephens, who reached the semifinals of the Australian Open in January for her best career result, lost in straight sets to Sharapova in Rome last month. World No. 9 Richard Gasquet kept alive France's hopes of a first men's title in 30 years, beating Russia's Nikolay Davydenko 6-4 6-4 6-3 to earn a last-16 clash with Swiss ninth seed Stanislas Wawrinka. The 23-year-old became the first Japanese male to reach the last 16 at Roland Garros since 1938 as he beat home player Benoit Paire 6-3 6-7 (3-7) 6-4 6-1. Jelena Gencic, who also worked with grand slam champions Monica Seles and Goran Ivanisevic, was 77 when she passed away. The U.S. will have four women in the fourth round of a grand slam for the first time since 2004 after Jamie Hampton and Bethanie Mattek-Sands joined world No. 1 Serena Williams and Stephens.
