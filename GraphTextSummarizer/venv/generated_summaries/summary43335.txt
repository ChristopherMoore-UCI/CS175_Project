Hartman said police believe the attacks were copycat crimes spurred by media attention. "We have no reason to believe this is a hate crime," said Officer David Hartman, a New Haven police spokesman. At least nine suspected "knockout" attacks have been reported since October in New York, but police have said they see no evidence of a trend. In New Haven, Connecticut, police said there were seven reported incidents possibly connected to "knockout" assaults, but it was unclear if they were carried out by the same person. The suspect is described as about 5 feet 7 inches to 5 feet 9 inches tall, with short braids, and was wearing a black wool cap, green jacket, and dark-colored jeans, police said.
