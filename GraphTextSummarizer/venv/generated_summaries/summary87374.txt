Spokesman Patrick Ventrell told reporters that Swedish diplomats, who represent U.S. interests in North Korea because Washington has no diplomatic relations with the North, were able to visit Bae, a U.S. citizen, on Friday. North Korea plans to hold a trial against Bae, state media said Saturday, complicating tense relations between the North and the United States. The developments come amid tense relations between North Korea and South Korea and the United States. Bae entered North Korea as a tourist on November 3, according to the Korean Central News Agency. The U.S. State Department on Monday publicly called on the North to release Kenneth Bae on humanitarian grounds.
