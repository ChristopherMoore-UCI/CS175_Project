Two major Apple executives took the stand at the Apple patent trial against Samsung Friday in San Jose, California, discussing the history of the iPhone and iPad and the impact of Samsung on the company. Apple spent more than $647 million marketing the iPhone in the United States, and $457 million on the iPad in the U.S. It has spent money marketing the device in a number of ways, including billboards, magazines, bus shelters and product placement in movies and TV shows. Apple is suing Samsung for $2.5 billion, claiming it copied the design of the iPhone and iPad. Samsung is countersuing Apple for patent infringement and seeks a portion of all iPhone and iPad profits. Damage done Schiller accused Samsung of "ripping off" the iPhone and iPad design, and said the imitations could confuse consumers and create problems for the Apple marketing team.
