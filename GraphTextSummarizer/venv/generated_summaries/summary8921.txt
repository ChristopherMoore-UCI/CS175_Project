A group fighting for access to clean water in developing nations has created a fundraising video that takes such first world gripes and casts them in the stark light of poverty. "Donate to help bring clean water to those in need." The lack of safe drinking water is the world's single largest cause of illness, according to UNICEF. "We're not setting out to humiliate people who have used the #FirstWorldProblems hashtag," said Matt Eastwood, the chief creative officer of the ad agency DDB New York, which created the video. "People are becoming desensitized to suffering and we needed to enter the social space with a provocative approach to get those who are lucky enough to have simple things such as water, food, and shelter to reflect on their 140 characters and support causes like WATERisLIFE," said Kristine Bender, the executive director of the nonprofit. "I used to think that first world problems were hilarious, but now I just feelï»¿ bad." says a comment posted under the video on YouTube.
