"We're surrounded by hundreds of couples who want to get married on 11/11/11," said the Rev. Charlotte Richards, owner of Little White Wedding Chapel on the Las Vegas Strip. At least 75 additional staff members were needed to accommodate the demand at Little White Wedding Chapel. In addition to a beautiful ceremony, Richards said she is offering bridal flowers and dog tags that have the 11/11/11 date inscribed on them. Closer to downtown, the Viva Las Vegas Wedding Chapel is equally abuzz. General Manager Brian Mills calls his establishment "The Fun Chapel."
