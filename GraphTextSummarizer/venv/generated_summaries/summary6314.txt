-- Hundreds of Palestinian security reinforcements were awaiting orders Saturday as part of a joint Israeli-Palestinian operation in the West Bank town of Hebron, officials said. Palestinian security officers assemble Saturday in the West Bank town of Hebron. Forces converged on Jenin and Nablus earlier this year, West Bank security sources said. On Wednesday, two Israeli brigadier generals met with Palestinian security officials at the IDF West Bank headquarters, according to an IDF statement. Hebron is the third city in the West Bank to be reinforced with Palestinian Authority forces.
