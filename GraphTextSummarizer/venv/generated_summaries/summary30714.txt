-- American sprinter Tyson Gay handed world and Olympic champion Usain Bolt his first 100 meters defeat in two years in Sweden on Friday night. Record-holder Bolt, who won three gold medals at both the 2009 world championships and 2008 Olympics, was last defeated by compatriot Asafa Powell -- also in the Swedish capital. France's Teddy Tamgho won the men's triple jump in the absence of world and European champion Phillips Idowu of Britain. "You can get beaten, you have good days and bad days -- it was just one of those days for me," Bolt told British race broadcaster the BBC. In the men's 800m, Poland's Marcin Lewandowski beat Britain's Michael Rimmer in a repeat of the European Championships final last weekend.
