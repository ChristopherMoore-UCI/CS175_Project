In other words, Warren has been divisive and dishonest on the issues of marriage equality and religious freedom -- and on other issues important to many Obama supporters, as well. And while some Religious Right leaders were nervous that Warren would give Obama a platform to talk about poverty and the environment at the August event, Warren thrilled them by eschewing those issues entirely in order to emphasize issues like abortion and marriage that worked to McCain's advantage with the evangelical audience. There is no shortage of religious leaders who reflect the values on which President-elect Obama campaigned and who are working to advance the common good. So much for the values of unity and respect, not to mention the constitutional principle of equality, on which President-elect Obama campaigned. That's not remotely true, but it's a standard tool of Religious Right leaders trying to resist the public's increasing support for equality.
