Will one of the men running for president raise his hand and say loudly and clearly, I oppose racial preferences in admissions to institutions of higher education? Hopes are running high among opponents of racial preferences that a majority of five on the court will declare affirmative action policy unconstitutional in public colleges and universities. But equally likely is the possibility that racial double standards reinforce stereotypes about smart whites and even smarter Asians. The law school's own expert provided data clearly showing racial double standards in admissions -- contradicting her "holistic" claim. In fact, as Justice David Souter pointed out, the law school simply concealed a race-driven admissions process that involved preferences actually greater than those given to undergraduate applicants.
