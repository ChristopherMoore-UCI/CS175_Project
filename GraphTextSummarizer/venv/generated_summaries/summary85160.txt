A bad week for European football continued on Wednesday when world governing body FIFA announced it will not compensate clubs if the 2022 World Cup is moved to November-December. Average temperatures in Qatar are around 25 degrees Celsius towards the end of the year, roughly 15 degrees lower than the traditional World Cup months. In an unexpected move, FIFA announced that the 2021 Confederations Cup will not be held in Qatar. Valcke said the climate rules out Qatar and added that the tournament, which pits the World Cup holders against the hosts and champions of FIFA's six confederations, will be played "in an Asian country," which has still to be determined. This was to cover the costs that Europe's clubs and leagues will spend on rescheduling their championships, many of which run between August and May. But FIFA Secretary General Jerome Valcke dashed those hopes when speaking in Qatar, the country that will host the 2022 finals.
