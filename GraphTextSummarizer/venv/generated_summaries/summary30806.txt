-- German federal prosecutors said Friday they have arrested a man suspected of helping a terrorist cell that allegedly plotted attacks against U.S. troops in Germany. Gelowicz was a leading member of a radical Islamist center in Ulm in southern Germany, and was well known to German authorities, officials said. German authorities have said the three men trained at the group's camps in northern Pakistan. The fourth person, identified in German media reports as Attila Selek, is a German citizen of Turkish descent. U.S. interests in Germany were among the targets of the group's plot, Michael Chertoff, who was the U.S. homeland security secretary, said at the time.
