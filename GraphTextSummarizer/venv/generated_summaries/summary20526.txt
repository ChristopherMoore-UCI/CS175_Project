The government has also been battling Islamic militants, including in Zinjibar, an Abyan province town that had been taken over by militants. In a separate large protest in the city, pro-government demonstrators carried signs of Saleh and chanted, "We are with you, Saleh," according to witnesses. In Sanaa, demonstrators participating in a large protest against President Ali Abdullah Saleh's continued rule could be heard chanting "Saleh will fall" and "The end is near for Saleh," according to eyewitnesses. In recent weeks, government troops have battled both anti-government tribal forces and Islamic militants. On June 3, the presidential compound was attacked, injuring Saleh and other senior officials.
