Bashar Jaafari, the Syrian ambassador to the United Nations, said the remaining issues with the OPCW were technical issues and said that later acknowledgment of other production facilities were "discrepancies." Jaafari said the Syrian government has been cooperating with Kaag and the OPCW. The OPCW team is also in consultations to draw up plans for the destruction of chemical weapons facilities that were previously not disclosed by the Syrian government, including a ricin production facility, Quinlan said. Airstrikes in Syria called 'illegitimate' Separately, Jaafari told CNN on Wednesday that the coalition airstrikes in Syria are "illegitimate." A U.N. official has a message for those worried about chemical weapons in Syria: A plan is in motion to do something about them. "There are additional sites that we've become aware of since the initial declaration of production facilities," Quinlan told reporters after the meeting.
