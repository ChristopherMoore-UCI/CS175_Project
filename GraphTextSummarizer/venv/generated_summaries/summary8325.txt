Fatty says he's hoping the number of people getting Obama art will grow as more visitors arrive and word about the Obamathon gets out. At Fatty's and other tattoo shops in the area, there have been multiple inquiries about getting inked with an Obama image, they say, but only a few people have actually gone through with. The Obama tattoo, Fatty says, is worth $70. On Wednesday, Fatty has plans to tattoo a portrait of Obama's face on one customer. Fatty's also offers a removable option -- the Obama piercing.
