Those sentiments were echoed Monday by Vashti Seacat's friend, Erika Head, who spoke to HLN's Nancy Grace. Attorneys for Brett Seacat say his wife, Vashti, started the fire and shot herself. Brett Seacat says he was sleeping downstairs and heard a noise, KWCH reported. Connie Suderman testified that Seacat called her just hours after his wife's death in April 2011. The counselor also testified that she met with Vashti Seacat shortly before her death.
