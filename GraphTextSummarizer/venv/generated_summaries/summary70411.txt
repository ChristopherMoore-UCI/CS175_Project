Pieper, 21, and Watson, 20, had dated on and off for 18 months, said District Attorney William Fitzpatrick at a Saturday press conference. "Our indication is Ms. Watson desired this relationship to end in early October ... A massive manhunt for the dance major, who'd been missing since November 19, culminated with the discovery of what are believed to be her remains at 10:30 a.m. at Clay Central Park in North Syracuse, the Onondaga County Sheriff's Office said. Fitzpatrick told CNN Syracuse affiliate WSTM that it appeared someone tried to conceal the body, but that it was not buried. The suspect, who was taken into custody Saturday, was arraigned Saturday evening in Clay Town Court, CNN affiliate YNN reported.
