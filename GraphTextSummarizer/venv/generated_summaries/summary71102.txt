Sandy victims among the 'Ocean's 16' Powerball winners Mario Scarnici, of Monmouth Junction, New Jersey, claimed the final third, New Jersey officials said. The other New Jersey jackpot winner was a jointly-held ticket claimed by a group of New Jersey co-workers on August 12. -- New Jersey's second winning ticket in the recent $448 million Powerball lottery jackpot has been presented and a third of the big prize claimed, state lottery officials said Monday. Three winning tickets were sold in the August 7 Powerball draw -- two in New Jersey and one in Minnesota. Having two winning jackpot tickets in the same state is rare -- the last time anything close to that happened was December 22, 1993, when two players in Washington, D.C., had winning tickets.
