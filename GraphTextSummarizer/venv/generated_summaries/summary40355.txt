Texas A&M University quarterback Johnny Manziel hasn't remotely achieved their level of stardom, but when it comes to being Mr. Excitement in college football, man, this kid can flat electrify the crowd with his play and leave his opponents shaking their heads in frustration. Manziel's emergence is excellent for the ninth-ranked Texas A&M Aggies and first-year Coach Kevin Sumlin. And it's only going to get bigger, which says a lot in Texas, where football has long been like a religion. See highlights from Texas A&M's win over Alabama All of that changed last Saturday when the Aggies went to Tuscaloosa, Alabama, for the first time and knocked off the defending national champions and the No. 1-ranked team in the country, the Alabama Crimson Tide. When Texas A&M made the decision to leave the Big 12 to play in the Southeastern Conference, fans and the media alike forecasted a tough few years for the Aggies.
