In tests, GAO investigators got into ports using counterfeit TWICs or authentic TWICs acquired through fraudulent means, and by stating false reasons for needing access. But the GAO said there are ways for unqualified individuals to acquire authentic TWICs, and said the TSA had not established internal controls to protect against abuse. "Yet today, 10 years later and with no approved biometric reader, TWICs are at best no more useful than library cards. "Nearly half a billion dollars has been spent since TSA was directed to issue biometric security cards to transportation workers," Mica said. The Department of Homeland Security has long touted the cards as one of the most important layers in its multilayered system to protect ports from terrorists.
