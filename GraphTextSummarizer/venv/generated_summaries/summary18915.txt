Most of those detained came to the United States on military planes, according to Florida Immigrant Advocacy Center attorney Allison Kent. -- Thirty-three Haitians were released Thursday from immigration detention facilities in Florida, more than two months after they arrived in the United States lacking proper immigration papers in the aftermath of their country's devastating earthquake. At no point did anyone on the ground ask to see the necessary visa documents for the Haitians to enter the United States legally, Kent said. Many of those freed Thursday were released to family members already living in the United States, but they will remain under supervision of federal immigration officials. While all the Haitians released Thursday still face deportation orders, the United States halted deportation to Haiti in response to the devastation of the earthquake.
