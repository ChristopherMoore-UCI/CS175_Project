The controversy focuses on statements that Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Weisbard wrote in a December 19 motion to dismiss the teacher's lawsuit against the state, the warden of the Arizona State Prison Complex -- Eyman, and other prison personnel. " On Tuesday, Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich, a former prosecutor, disputed those characterizations. The instructor who said she was raped was assigned to teach in a medium-security unit that houses sex offenders and special needs prisoners, including those who are mentally ill, disabled and in need of protective custody, court papers said. "The problem with Plaintiff's repeated allegation in this regard is that it is impossible to conclude that such a dangerous situation would have been known and obvious to the defendants without also being known and obvious to the Plaintiff, a teacher who worked on a daily basis in the same environment as the defendants," the Attorney General's Office said in court papers. The instructor wasn't trained in self-defense or how to control the movements of inmates, papers said.
