The quake's epicenter was two miles northwest of Devore, California, where residents told CNN affiliate KCAL that their homes shook, without damage, authorities said. CNN's Michael Martinez reported from Los Angeles and Kara Devlin from Atlanta. Devore is about a 55-mile drive northeast of downtown Los Angeles. The San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department in nearby Rancho Cucamonga told CNN that it didn't receive reports of major damage shortly after the quake. "It was a solid boom and everything shook," Devore resident Tracie Thompson told KCAL.
