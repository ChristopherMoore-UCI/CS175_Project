-- Ferry service between San Francisco and points north will be suspended Tuesday morning in anticipation of an expected protest, a regional transportation agency said. It is unclear what effect any actions might have on traffic on Tuesday on the iconic Golden Gate Bridge, which stretches between the city of San Francisco and Marin County. The announcement was made at 3 p.m. (6 p.m. ET), two hours after the same agency issued a release stating it was "planning to operate all of our services (bridge, bus and ferry) on May 1." The Golden Gate Bridge, Highway and Transportation District announced Monday that there will be no ferry service across San Francisco Bay between the northern California city and Larkspur and Sausalito until about 2 p.m. Tuesday. The Golden Gate Bridge, Highway and Transportation District is in charge of the bridge, which 38 million vehicles crossed last year, as well as transit buses and ferry services that it estimates serve more than 9 million customers annually, according to its website.
