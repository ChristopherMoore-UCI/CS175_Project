From there, Snow began pairing up mothers to mothers, siblings to siblings, spouses to spouses -- Pan Am families with TWA families. " When planes go down, like AirAsia Flight 8501, which left 162 people dead in December, Snow and her team of grief mentors stand by ready to help. "We have 250 grief mentors from air disasters dating back to 1958 -- private, military and commercial air disasters," Snow said. Snow also wrote the book "Surviving Sudden Loss: Stories from those who have lived it" as another tool families could use to deal with their grief. Snow worked for a hedge fund in New York City.
