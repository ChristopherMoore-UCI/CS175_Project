Suspected Boko Haram gunmen decapitated 23 people in a raid on Buratai village in northeast Nigeria's Borno state, residents and a politician said Saturday. Scores of attackers invaded the village at 11 p.m. Friday when residents were mostly asleep and set homes on fire, hacking residents who tried to flee. It is not clear whether the attack was in reprisal over their loss in the previous attack or was linked to the Nigeria general elections ‎that commenced Saturday. They injured several people," said Ibrahim Adamu, a local politician who fled. A paramedic ‎at a government hospital in the nearby town of Biu said 32 people from Buratai were taken to the hospital with gunshot wounds and burns.
