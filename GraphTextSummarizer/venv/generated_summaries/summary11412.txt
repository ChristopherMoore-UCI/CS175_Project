My research team at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health examined cross-sectional measurements of height, weight, waist circumference, percent body fat, blood pressure measurements, cholesterol levels and fasting glucose levels for more than 12,000 adults using information from EHE International's database of patients. Memphis, most obese U.S. city, moving from fat to fit Even when compared with other measures such as waist circumference, waist-to-height-ratio, percent body fat, fat mass index or fat-free mass index, the science shows that BMI is just as good at predicting obesity-related health risks. If your BMI is high, chances are good it's because you have excess fat tissue, which means you're at risk for other health problems, including heart disease related to high blood pressure or high cholesterol, and diabetes. The numbers showed that BMI is the strongest predictor of blood pressure, and the measurement is comparable to other measurements at predicting cholesterol levels. BMI also performed admirably against other measures in predicting fasting glucose levels, which are an important part of diagnosing diabetes.
