Born in the United States to pro-Castro Cuban parents, Gonz치lez returned with them to Cuba where he became an experienced pilot. " Gonz치lez later flew with the Cuban exile group Brothers to the Rescue, which scoured the Florida Straits by small plane looking for Cuban rafters. Gonz치lez was a member of the so-called "Cuban Five," a network of agents in South Florida that the Cuban government said was gathering intelligence to prevent terrorist attacks against Cuba. " Gonz치lez's comments did not bode well for jailed U.S. State Department contractor Alan Gross, who was sentenced in 2011 to a 15-year prison for importing banned communications equipment to Cuba. U.S. officials have dismissed the possibility of talks, saying Gross did not spy against Cuba.
