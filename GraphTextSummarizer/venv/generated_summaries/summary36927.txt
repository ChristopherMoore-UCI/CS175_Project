"The continuing use of suicide attacks in densely populated areas, that are certain to kill and maim large numbers of Afghan civilians, may amount to a war crime," said Nicholas Haysom, head of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan. The claim appears to be the first in Afghanistan by ISIS, CNN's Nick Paton Walsh said. In March, CNN reported on ISIS recruiting in Afghanistan. In February, Mullah Abdul Rauf, a former Taliban commander who had become a recruiter for ISIS in Afghanistan, was killed in a drone strike, according to officials who spoke to CNN. ISIS refers to Afghanistan and Pakistan as the province of "Khorasan."
