Further lanes that dictate the flow of traffic from east and west -- east towards the North Sea and ports in Northern Europe and west towards the Atlantic Ocean -- have also been formed on both the English and French sides of the Channel (see traffic movement in video below). According to Kaimes Beasley of the Dover based Channel Navigation Information Service, such high-value ships passing through the Channel mean coastguards in both England and France must be more organized and vigilant than ever before. Silk Road railways link Asia and Europe But while such advanced technology has been a welcome development, Miller also points out the fundamental rules that govern movement on the Channel remain the same. The world's first sea-traffic separation scheme was set up here in 1972 creating two lanes of traffic that ships must follow to avoid collisions. Huge merchant vessels carrying every category of cargo imaginable -- from iron ore to wheat, and from crude oil to sugar -- sail amongst fishing vessels, passenger ferries, pleasure craft and more unorthodox traffic such as swimmers.
