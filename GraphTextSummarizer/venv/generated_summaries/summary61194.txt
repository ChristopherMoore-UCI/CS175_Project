Starring Leonardo DiCaprio in the title role, along with Tobey Maguire, Carey Mulligan, and Joel Edgerton, the film had been slated to open on Christmas day this year. Warner Bros. announced today that "The Great Gatsby," director Baz Luhrmann's 3-D adaptation of the seminal novel by F. Scott Fitzgerald, has been pushed to Summer 2013. The film would have gone head to head with Quentin Tarantino's "Django Unchained," which also stars DiCaprio in a supporting role as the cruel owner of a plantation in the pre-Civil War south. International distribution chief Veronika Kwan Vanderberg added that the studio believes "The Great Gatsby" "will be the perfect summer movie around the world." In announcing the change, Warner Bros. president of distribution Dan Fellman lauded Luhrmann's singular visual style.
