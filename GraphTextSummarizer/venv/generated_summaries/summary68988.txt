Firefighters called to the scene found Barahona and Nubia's brother suffering from burns and a chemical-related illness, said West Palm Beach Police Department spokesman Chase Scott. Carmen and Jorge Barahona, the adopted parents of the girl, Nubia Barahona, have been charged with first-degree murder. The body has since been identified by the Palm Beach medical examiner as that of Nubia Barahona. The document says that Barahona told police that he drove to West Palm Beach that day "after he placed his deceased daughter in a plastic bag, which he loaded in the rear of his truck." The Barahonas have also been charged with eight counts of aggravated child abuse and eight counts of child neglect.
