What Jay Z did: Jay-Z is a sports enthusiast. Of course, there are a lot of other things Jay-Z's done right in his career, so I suggest checking out "Empire State of Mind." But workers can get the attention of the boss and other leadership by coming forward with new ideas. If you look at what Jay-Z has done with his career, you might realize that what made him successful is what makes many great leaders successful. Don't let a killer keg stand undo your years of hard work.
