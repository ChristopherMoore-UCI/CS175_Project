-- Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska has dismissed the markets rout that followed the Federal Reserve's suggestion it would wind back its stimulus program later this year as "very emotional." Deripaska, speaking to CNN at the St Petersburg International Economic Forum, said the reaction on Russian markets -- which included a 4% drop in stock prices -- was "disproportionate" to the country's economic situation. Kostin said he expected a change in focus of monetary policy, to become more "relaxed." Deripaska said the country produced enough raw materials but now needed to invest money in processing. Russia: We can survive if Fed winds down stimulus Deripaska, who Forbes estimates to be worth $8.5 billion, told CNN the Russian president's plans "wouldn't change anything for us." Deripaska also played down the significance of Russia's pledge to crack down on tax evasion as part of an agreement with other G8 leaders. The Fed's hints it would dial back its cheap money program come as Russia expects a loosening of economic policy under its new bank head, Elvira Nabiullina.
