Adding to what's becoming a lengthy list of run-ins with the law, New York police arrested actress Amanda Bynes on Thursday night after she allegedly tossed drug paraphernalia out the window of her 36th floor Manhattan apartment. Officers were called to her theater district abode after her building manager reported the 27-year-old star was smoking an "illegal substance" in the lobby, Christopher Pisano, a New York police spokesman, said. Bynes had headed back to her apartment by the time police arrived, but she let officers in when they knocked on the door, according to Pisano. The star of "Easy A" and "Hairspray" has lived in New York since last fall, having moved there from the Los Angeles area. Once inside, the officers noticed a bong and other marijuana paraphernalia sitting on the coffee table, which Bynes immediately started to throw out the window.
