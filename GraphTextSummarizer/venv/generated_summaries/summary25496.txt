-- Bolton's first match since the on-pitch collapse of their midfielder Fabrice Muamba last weekend ended with an emotional 2-1 victory over local rivals Blackburn Saturday. Arsenal cruised past Aston Villa 3-0 with goals from Kieran Gibbs, Theo Walcott and Mikel Arteta to cement third spot. But Steven N'Zonzi pulled one back in the second half and Bolton had to survive some nervous moments before sealing victory. They are three points clear of north London rivals Tottenham Hotspur, who held Chelsea 0-0 in the early kickoff at Stamford Bridge to maintain their five-point gap over their rivals for a Champions League spot. Shaun Maloney put Wigan ahead from the penalty spot only for Luis Suarez to equalize early in the second half.
