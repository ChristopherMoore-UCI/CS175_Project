In the sweets category, plain old chocolate is the most popular, but milk chocolate was 37% more popular than dark chocolate in the past month. There were 59% more searches for "gifts for girlfriend" than "gifts for wife" and 292% more searches for "gifts for boyfriend" than for "gifts for husband." When it comes to gifts, flowers and food are still the dominant choices, though there are some signs of creativity in recent search terms. People were far less likely to send an e-card to their boyfriends or girlfriends, perhaps because they were too busy buying them chocolate bacon cookies and roses. Is your paramour into the the textbook red roses and box of chocolates, or would they prefer a romantic home-cooked meal?
