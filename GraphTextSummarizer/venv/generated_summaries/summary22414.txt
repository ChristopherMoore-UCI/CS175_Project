-- Art Capital Group has withdrawn its lawsuit against celebrity photographer Annie Leibovitz and extended the due date for repayment of her $24 million loan, the two sides announced Friday. Art Capital Group said Leibovitz initially approached the company, an adviser to artists and art owners, around June 2008 regarding her "dire financial condition arising from ... mortgage obligations, tax liens and unpaid bills to service providers and other creditors," the complaint said " The tone of the agreement differed markedly from that of a complaint filed July 29 in New York Supreme Court by Art Capital Group, in which the company accused the photographer of "willful and flagrant" breaches of her agreement, adding: "It appears that Leibovitz entered into the sales agreement with no intention of performing or permitting performance under it." One of Leibovitz's best-known photos is of John Lennon with his wife, Yoko Ono, shortly before the Beatles star was assassinated in 1980. In July, Art Capital filed a complaint with the New York Supreme Court, asking it to uphold the sales agreement it signed with Leibovitz, including its right to sell her art and real estate.
