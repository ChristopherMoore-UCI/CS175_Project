They were Al-Shabaab fighters, and security guards at the prison "foiled the attack" and killed seven of the rebels, Somalia's Information Minister H.E. Mustafa Duhulow said in a statement. "These terrorists groups are against the security improvements we are currently experiencing here in Mogadishu," Information Minister H.E. Mustafa Duhulow said in a statement. During the assault on the National Intelligence and Security Agency prison three security guards and two civilians were also killed, 15 others were injured, Security Ministry spokesman Mohamed Yusuf told CNN. The government praised the security forces, saying it shows that Somalia has improved security. The attackers tried to free their fellow Al-Shaabab members held at the prison, who were sentenced to death by a Somali military court tribunal, said police Officer Abdifarah Ali.
