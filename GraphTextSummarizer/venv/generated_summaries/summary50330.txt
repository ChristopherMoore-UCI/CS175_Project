The tabloid News of the World reported that Pakistan players deliberately bowled "no balls," or fouls, at specific points in a game with England in late August, and that the alleged ringleader of the scam made 150,000 pounds (about $230,000). The allegations, which emerged Saturday in the British tabloid The Sun, relate to the third One-Day International between England and Pakistan, held in London on Friday. The paper said its undercover team was able to pass details to ICC inspectors before the match began at the Oval cricket ground in south London. "A source informed The Sun newspaper that a certain scoring pattern would emerge during certain stages of the match and, broadly speaking, that information appeared to be correct," ICC Chief Executive Haroon Lorgat said in a statement. The claims follow a separate alleged scam, also involving the Pakistan team during its ongoing tour of England.
