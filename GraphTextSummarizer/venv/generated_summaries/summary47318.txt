Turner Field is overseen by the City of Atlanta and Fulton County Recreation Authority, which had no immediate statement. Schuerholz said Turner Field needs "hundreds of millions of dollars of upgrades. "We wanted to find a location that is great for our fans, makes getting to and from the stadium much easier, and provides a first-rate game day experience in and around the stadium," President John Schuerholz said in a video message. The team's contract with Turner Field -- which was retrofitted for baseball after the 1996 Olympics -- expires in 2016. -- The Atlanta Braves are planning to leave downtown Atlanta.
