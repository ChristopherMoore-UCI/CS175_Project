" Branson does drag after losing bet Disgruntled customers regularly say LIAT stands for Languishing In Airport Terminals, Luggage In Another Terminal or Leaving Island Any Time. The sarcastic open letter to LIAT Airlines first appeared in The BVI Beacon, a newspaper in the British Virgin Islands, in April, but caught Branson's attention last week. Virgin Group boss Richard Branson, who once received what's widely considered the world's best complaint letter, is sharing another one with his 3 million Twitter followers. Branson found himself on the receiving end of a similar stinging e-mail in 2008 in which a customer said his flight from Mumbai, India, to London was "the culinary journey of hell," and one that resembled a crime scene -- "A CRIME AGAINST BLOODY COOKING." Branson, who posted the letter to LIAT to his blog, said it's a reminder that companies need to focus on what's important. "How to write a complaint letter -- read this hilarious note from a frustrated airline passenger," Branson tweeted.
