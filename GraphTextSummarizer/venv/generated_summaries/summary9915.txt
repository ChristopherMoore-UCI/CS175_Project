Requiring background checks for all gun sales would give the vast majority of gun owners what they want while keeping guns from those who shouldn't have them. The gun lobby's claims that background checks restrict gun ownership and lead to gun registries and confiscations are repeated and often left unchallenged. Congress will likely act only when more gun owners who support policies to keep guns from dangerous people become engaged on the issue. Lax gun laws that allow dangerous people easy access to guns plays an important role in this disparity. Federal law has mandated background checks for guns sold by licensed gun dealers since 1994 without creating a registry.
