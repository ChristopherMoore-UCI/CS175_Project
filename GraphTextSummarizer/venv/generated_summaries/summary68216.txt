Abdelbeset Ali Mohmed al Megrahi, the only person convicted in connection with the Lockerbie airline bombing that killed 270 people, died Sunday, the Libyan government and family members said. The documents also showed that senior Libyan officials warned their Scottish and British counterparts it would be "catastrophic" for British-Libyan relations if al Megrahi died in prison. That indictment set off the first battle over al Megrahi, until Libya handed him and Fhima over in the face of international pressure. " When Washington and London blamed al Megrahi and Fhimah for the attack, Libya refused to hand them over. Gadhafi's son, Saif al-Islam, Gadhafi's son and heir apparent who accompanied al Megrahi back to Libya on August 20, 2009, said  Libya was "very angry" at British efforts to keep al Megrahi out of a separate prisoner transfer agreement.
