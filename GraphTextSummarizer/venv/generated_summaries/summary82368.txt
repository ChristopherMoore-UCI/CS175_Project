Thanks to everyone at the hospital and the track who took such good care of me during my stay in Houston," Franchitti said in a statement. The wreck occurred in the last lap of the race, when Japanese driver Takuma Sato bumped Franchitti's car, sending it airborne into the protective fencing. -- Three-time Indianapolis 500 winner Dario Franchitti was released from a Houston hospital on Thursday, days after he was injured in a serious crash.
