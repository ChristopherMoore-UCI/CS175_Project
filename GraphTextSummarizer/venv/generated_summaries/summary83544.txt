" Another camera crew nearby, from the local television station and CNN affiliate KSDK, recorded what happened to the Al Jazeera crew. Photos and videos from the Al Jazeera America camera crew were widely shared in the wake of Wednesday's incident, which Al Jazeera called an "egregious assault on freedom of the press that was clearly intended to have a chilling effect on our ability to cover this important story." Al Jazeera America, an offshoot of the Qatar-based international news network that recently marked its one-year anniversary, said in a statement that "thankfully all three crew members are physically fine." "We believe that this situation must be investigated along with those involving our colleagues at other media outlets," the network added. The KSDK video showed police officers placing Al Jazeera's lights and other equipment on the ground. "We (a group of three) yelled out to the MRAP (that) we were press and we approached vehicle with hands visible," Winslade said.
