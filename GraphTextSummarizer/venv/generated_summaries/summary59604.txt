Levinson family members have met with local Iranian officials and have traveled there to retrace his steps. In the first few years after his disappearnace, Bush administration officials had said they suspect Iranian authorities seized Levinson and were holding him in a jail inside the country. Salahuddin was detained by Iranian officials in plain clothes and taken away from the room he shared with Levinson to be interrogated about his Iranian passport, he said in the interview. In 2009, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton personally passed a note to Iranian officials at a U.N. conference on Afghanistan in the Hague asking them for help in finding Levinson. The State Department and FBI have consistently denied Levinson was working for the government and have demanded Iran free Levinson -- if it is holding him.
