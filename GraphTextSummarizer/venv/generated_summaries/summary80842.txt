When the colors came off and the jerseys went on, nobody saw gang members: We just saw great athletes playing classic Chicago basketball. From the courts on the West Side to the Hall of Fame, those are lessons that stayed with me my entire life, and they can give other kids from a similar background a better shot. My coaches, mentors and teachers taught me those lessons when I was growing up on Chicago's West Side. It can be the crucial difference for thousands of young people, whose only knowledge of a structured organization comes from gangs. With that money, we can provide an additional 3,200 young people in Chicago a safe alternative to drugs, gangs and violence, one hoop at a time.
