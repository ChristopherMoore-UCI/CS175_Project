-- A U.S. drone strike killed eight militants in southern Yemen on Thursday morning, the latest hit in an intensified U.S. air camaign against al Qaeda and its affiliates in the area, security officials said. Bill Roggio, an analyst on terror and military issues, said 15 U.S. airstrikes this year have targeted al Qaeda entities. The terror plot revealed this week has been described by U.S. officials as involving a device that is an evolution of the bomb smuggled aboard a U.S.-bound plane on Christmas Day 2009 by a young Nigerian, Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab. Roggio said that militants still control territory in northwestern Pakistan despite the intensification of U.S. drone strikes there since 2008. The FBI had offered a $5 million reward for any information leading to the capture of al Quso, who was among the most-wanted terrorists in Yemen.
