The officer wrote that when he answered the phone, Zickuhr allegedy "told me that he currently had 'Snow White' and if I didn't bring $1,000 to a phone booth at Lynwood/Sahara he was going to go to Mexico to kill 'Snow White.'" Several other calls followed before the officer found Zickuhr and Cadeau behind a Las Vegas casino, where he arrested Zickuhr, the report said. Tim Zickuhr, who appeared as a driver in episodes of the History Channel show in 2011, was arrested on kidnapping, extortion and coercion charges by Las Vegas police on December 19. The arrest report describes a bizarre dispute between Zickuhr, 35, and Lisa Cadeau, described as a prostitute who works under the name "Snow White. Zickuhr's lawyer Roy Nelson told CNN Tuesday that his client "maintains his innocence to any criminal wrongdoing. Zickuhr told the officer that "his plan was to place Cadeau on (Craigslist) and attempt to make money off her performing sexual acts," the report said.
