The atmosphere could have fallen a little flat after the Champions League setback against Real Madrid, but it did not stop a capacity 71,000 crowd at the Allianz Arena celebrating Bayern Munich's 24th Bundesliga title in traditional style Saturday. Some have blamed the early clinching of the title for some lackluster performances which followed, including the 5-0 semifinal aggregate reverse to Real which ended Bayern's hopes of defending the Champions League crown. Manager Pep Guardiola was dowsed with the best Bavarian beer as has become the custom, with defenders Jerome Boateng and Daniel van Buyten the main protagonists. Bayern may have to do so without key midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger, who limped off in the first half with a knee injury. Guardiola, whose future at Bayern has been the subject of some speculation, looked a relieved man after it went in, but he will be hoping his team can raise themselves for one final big performance next week.
