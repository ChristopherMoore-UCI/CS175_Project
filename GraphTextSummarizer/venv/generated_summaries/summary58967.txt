In world title action Sunday, Japan's Koki Kameda won the vacant World Boxing Association (WBA) bantamweight title by beating Alexander Munoz of Venezuela by a unanimous decision. -- Brothers Wladimir and Vitali Klitschko have sent Britain's WBA world heavyweight champion David Haye a New Year message, saying they are both ready to fight him in 2011. Meanwhile, Wladimir's bout with another Briton, Dereck Chisora, was called off earlier this month, with the triple champion citing injury, paving the way for an early clash with Haye. "We are now perfectly positioned to get together and make this fight with Wladimir Klitschko. "Despite the fact we know we bring more UK television money to the table, David and I are happy to split the entire pot 50-50 and grant Wladimir the deal he has wanted since day one." Kameda is the first Japanese boxer to win three world titles, following the WBA light flyweight title and the World Boxing Council (WBC) flyweight crown.
