Yet Germond was also known for encouraging new journalists as they joined the pack of political reporters following candidates. "On the campaign trail, he always took newbie reporters under his wing, and traveling with him on campaigns was a joyous way to learn American politics," Borger said. "For Jack Germond, covering politics was a calling, a passion, a profession and a full-time pastime," said Ken Bode, a former national political correspondent for NBC News and a former senior correspondent at CNN. King also described a man willing to encourage a new generation of campaign reporters, describing an evening at the bar of the Sheraton Wayfarer in New Hampshire while covering the state's first-in-the-nation presidential primary. "In the old days, journalists got to know politicians better than they do now," he told People Magazine in 2001, describing a bygone era of occasionally meeting candidates over steak dinners, vodka martinis and late night poker games.
