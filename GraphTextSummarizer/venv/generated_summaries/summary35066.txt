That's the day the real Colbert will retire "Colbert" the character as he signs off from his Comedy Central show, "The Colbert Report," in preparation to take over for David Letterman in 2015. You see, when Colbert takes over Letterman's show next year, he will no longer be "Colbert," but rather the real Colbert. And Colbert's reach will be even greater when he moves to network TV and is no longer just on Comedy Central, which reaches only 85% of the country. Now, before my fellow Colbert fans turn on me, I'm not suggesting Colbert isn't capable of being funny outside of "Colbert." Therein lies Colbert's challenge.
