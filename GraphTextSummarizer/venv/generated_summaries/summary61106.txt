Meanwhile Fulham's Brete Hangeland headed a 94th-minute equalizer to salvage a 1-1 draw at home to Aston Villa, who are still searching for their first Premier League win since September. Park had put United ahead in first half injury time only for Sylvan Ebanks-Blake to equalize for Wolves just after the hour mark with a neat turn and shot. The result leaves United with 23 points from 11 games, with leaders Chelsea on 25 from 10. A sour note for Manchester United was the truncated return of England international midfielder Owen Hargreaves, the long-term injury absentee lasting just a few minutes in his first start for two years before he limped off with a hamstring strain. Third-placed Arsenal will join United on 23 points if they beat promoted Newcastle in another Sunday fixture at the Emirates Stadium.
