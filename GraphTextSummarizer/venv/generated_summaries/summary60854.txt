A 20-something-foot harsh concrete wall was constructed around the West Bank, there were checkpoints installed between towns and villages, and daily clashes between Palestinians and Israeli authorities interrupted our day. My cousins in the West Bank, on the other hand, are worried about grades too, but they also have to worry about checkpoints and random clashes between the Palestinians and Israeli authorities. We lived peacefully in Ramallah, a West Bank city just north of Jerusalem, when we moved there in 1997. The day the four children were killed while playing soccer on Gaza Beach, my friends and I were at St. Pete Beach playing volleyball. My life in America has been very different from my life in Palestine and is much different from the lives of Israeli and Palestinian youth today.
