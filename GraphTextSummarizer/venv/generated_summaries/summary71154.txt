Kwik Trip drops Braun after drug suspension I doubt if many elsewhere would recognize Ryan Braun today if he came walking down the street toward you. There we were that Monday, a day when yet another of the game's great players (Ryan Braun) got expelled for doing something bad, right in the middle of a very entertaining season, witnessing good things galore. -- We still can't watch baseball without a bunch of big dopes getting in our way. Thank goodness this year's All-Star Game hero was the Yankees' heroic figure Rivera, a man whose career has been pure to the point of immaculate in its lack of controversy or reputation stain. He probably wouldn't be mobbed by paparazzi in, say, New York, a city with a history of big baseball stars.
