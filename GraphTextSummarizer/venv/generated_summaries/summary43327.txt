If there's a star to blame here (and, to be clear, I'm not sure there is — I'd bet the amateur look and sound of the movie is what kept audiences away), it's lead actress Julianne Hough, whose first three music-and-dance features since leaving "Dancing with the Stars" have all been relative box office disappointments. Ages dropped like a rock, earning an abysmal $15.1 million in its debut — far less than comparative Broadway adaptations like "Mamma Mia!", which began with $27.8 million in 2008 and "Hairspray" (also directed by "Rock of Ages'" helmer Adam Shankman), which started with $27.5 million in 2007. The animated comedy topped the box office once again this weekend, while "Rock of Ages" and "That's My Boy" delivered majorly disappointing debuts. Some are claiming that Rock of Ages' awful debut is a sign that Tom Cruise, who plays rocker Stacee Jaxx, may have lost his Midas touch at the box office. Hough may be Hollywood's go-to starlet for dance-heavy roles, but she's not yet a legitimate box office draw, and her "Rock of Ages" co-lead, Diego Boneta, certainly is not either.
