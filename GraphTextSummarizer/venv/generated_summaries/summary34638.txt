For somebody who made the England squad after playing just a handful of games for her university side and development squad, Megan's rise has been remarkable. "I can show you several scars and bruises from our upbringing," Megan told CNN's Rugby Sevens Worldwide show. Mike, who signed a two-year deal to play sevens for England in 2012, learned his trade in the north of the country under the guidance of his father, Nick, in the family's hometown of Penrith. " Megan's presence at November's Dubai Sevens was a big shock to both siblings -- especially since she had been trying her luck at netball while at university. While the 24-year-old was always destined to be a rugby star for England, never did he think that he'd be traveling across the world with his sister, Megan, in tow.
