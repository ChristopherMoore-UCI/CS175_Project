Is the most highly anticipated technology IPO in recent years a failure? More "innocent" mistakes than a toddler makes in years. Or Yahoo, or dozens of other companies that were so focused on their quarterly numbers and stock prices that they lost focus of their users and watched them drift away. If we had a more functional Securities and Exchange Commission, perhaps it would have made Facebook redo its IPO filing documents, which would have given some investors pause, and might have forced further tuning of a variety of key accounting metrics, all in full public view. For that reason, investor money is suddenly racing toward social media.
