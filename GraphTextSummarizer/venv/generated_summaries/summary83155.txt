The actual number of children who were kidnapped and killed did not change -- it's always been a relatively small number -- but awareness of the cases skyrocketed, experts said in recent interviews that shed light on the issue of missing children. Barbara Friedman, associate professor of University of North Carolina's School of Journalism and Mass Communication, has said such "heinous crimes are always newsworthy" and "have been reported in the press for as long as there has been a press." "As media became more plentiful and visual in the 1980s, child abductions and child murders allowed for the kinds of images that are at once intimate and universal -- like school photos and grieving families," Friedman said. They advocated tougher rules in cases of children who were abducted by relatives, said Joel Best, a professor of sociology and criminal justice at the University of Delaware. Children abducted by relatives, runaways, and abductions by strangers are the three classifications of what came to be repackaged and rebranded by activists as "missing children" in the late 1970s and early 1980s, he said. Police officers also started to respond more quickly to reports of missing children, experts said.
