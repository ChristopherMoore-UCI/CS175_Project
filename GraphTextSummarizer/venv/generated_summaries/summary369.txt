left dozens of people dead and hundreds wounded in Karbala and Baghdad, prompting Shiite Muslim cleric Muqtada al-Sadr on Tuesday to call for calm, his spokesman said. The fighting was apparently spurred by a security measure that banned people from carrying weapons into Karbala, an Interior Ministry official said. Coalition forces "killed eight terrorists and detained 11 suspected terrorists" during raids targeting al Qaeda in Iraq leaders, the military said Tuesday. A curfew and weapons ban were in effect and Shiite pilgrims were evacuated from the southern Iraqi city of Karbala, where fighting has killed up to 50 people and wounded 247 others, the Iraqi Interior Ministry said. Shiite pilgrims in Karbala were celebrating Sha'abaniya, the birthday of Imam al-Mehdi, the 12th Imam, whom Shiites revere.
