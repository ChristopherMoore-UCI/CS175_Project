As a Korean War veteran, Newman might have told his minders he fought against North Korea. Meeting with authorities The day before Newman was to leave North Korea, he and his tour guide met with "one or two Korean authorities," his son said. According to the traveling companion's account, the authorities then asked the elder Newman to leave the plane with them, Jeff Newman said. Newman's arrest appears to be "an indication that North Korea seems not to be seeking a better relationship with United States," Davies said. North Korea has not publicly acknowledged it detained Newman.
