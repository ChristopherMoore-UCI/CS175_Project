Barcelona coach Josep Guardiola rested Xavi, Sergio Busquets and Daniel Alves ahead of Wednesday's Spanish Cup quarterfinal first-leg against second division Real Betis, giving midfielders Javier Mascherano and Seydou Keita a rare start along with Brazilian Adriano at fullback. Lionel Messi made it 2-0 in the second half with a superb free-kick before late strikes from Andres Iniesta and Pedro put more pressure on Real Madrid, who host third-placed Villarreal on Sunday night. -- David Villa continued his remarkable scoring run against Deportivo La Coruna as Spanish champions Barcelona won 4-0 on Saturday night to move five points clear in La Liga. Mascherano was involved in the opening goal in the 26th minute as he threaded a pass to Messi, who found Villa in space in the penalty area and the former Valencia star fired a shot under the body of goalkeeper Daniel Aranzubia. In the first half, French fullback Eric Abidal thought he had followed up his first goal for Barca in the midweek cup draw at Athletic Bilbao but was flagged for offside to deny him just a third career strike.
