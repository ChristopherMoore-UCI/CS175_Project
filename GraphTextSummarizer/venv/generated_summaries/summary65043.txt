Neville Crichton's Alfa Romeo was leading after the fleet emerged from the first night, but less than five nautical miles separated the New Zealand 100-footer from British entry ICAP Leopard, skippered by Mike Slade, and four-time line honors winner Wild Oats X1, with Australian Mark Richards at the helm. Light winds have ruled out a realistic chance of any of the contenders breaking the race record set by Wild Oats in 2005 of one day, 18 hours and 40 minutes, but the three-way tactical battle is the closest for several years. 100 yachts started the 628-nautical mile "Bluewater Classic" from Sydney Harbor on Boxing Day and it made for the usual impressive spectacle. The annual race was first held in 1945 and has been hit by severe weather conditions in previous years. The forecasted light winds are expected to favor the bigger yachts who can use their giant spinnakers to good effect as they head for Constitution Harbor in Hobart.
