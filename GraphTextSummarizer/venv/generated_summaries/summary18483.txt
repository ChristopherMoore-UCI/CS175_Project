Tenth seed Richard Gasquet set up a last-16 clash with world No. 6 Tomas Berdych, while fellow Frenchman Gilles Simon will take on big-serving South African Kevin Anderson. Australian seventh seed Sam Stosur also went to three sets before beating China's Peng Shuai 6-3 3-6 6-2, earning a meeting with Germany's Mona Barthel -- who beat former world No. 1 Nadal, who has slipped to No. 5 in the world rankings after a seven-month injury layoff, made his comeback last month in three clay court tournaments in South America, testing his troublesome knee. Caroline Wozniacki, another former No. 1, went through to the last 16 with a 6-2 6-1 win over Elena Vesnina and will next face another Russian in 10th seed Nadia Petrova. In the women's draw, top seed Victoria Azarenka came from a set down to beat Belgian No. 28 Kirsten Flipkens 3-6 6-3 6-0.
