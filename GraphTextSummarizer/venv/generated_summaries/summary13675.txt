-- The fiancee of Oregon Gov. John Kitzhaber lived on property that was to be used for growing marijuana, and married an illegal immigrant for money during a period in her life when she was "associating with the wrong kind of people and making mistakes," according to a statement she released Tuesday. Kitzhaber is running for re-election next month, and addressed his fiancee's actions during a gubernatorial debate Tuesday evening. While Kitzhaber and Hayes aren't married, they've been a couple for more than a decade and engaged since this summer, according to local news reports. The man who sold the property to Hayes and her boyfriend told CNN affiliate KOIN that the couple stopped making payments. Cylvia Hayes, 47, admitted to living on a property in Okanogan, Oregon, in 1997 that was supposed to become a marijuana growing operation, but she said it never materialized.
