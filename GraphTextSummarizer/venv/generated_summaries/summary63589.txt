Federal officials on Wednesday warned motorists and auto shops that counterfeit airbags pose a danger to consumers, saying the bags could fail to deploy or even hurt people in car wrecks. Concerns over counterfeit airbags heightened last month when authorities tested 10 fake airbags seized as part of a criminal investigation. The agency said the following people may be most at risk: -- Those who have had airbags replaced in the past three years at a repair shop that is not part of a new car dealership. Morton said earlier this year that customs agents arrested a Chinese broker selling nine brands of counterfeit airbags in the United States. Strickland said his agency is working with automakers to develop a system to verify authentic replacement parts and to raise awareness of the potential risks of counterfeit parts.
