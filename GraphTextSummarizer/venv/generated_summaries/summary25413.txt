Few dispute that there comes a point at which minimum wage is so high that it destroys jobs. U.S. President Barack Obama's proposal to raise the federal minimum wage from the current $7.25 to $10 per hour seems blocked by Congress, but individual states and cities are raising minimum wages within their jurisdictions -- Seattle's mayor, for example, proposes a new $15 minimum. Many people earning minimum wage, such as students, are not living in poor households. And many poor households do not contain minimum wage workers. -- Minimum wages are on top of the political agenda in many countries.
