The High Line (New York) This much-hyped 2.3-kilometer-long linear park sits on a disused section of the New York Central Railroad and connects Gansevoort Street in the Meatpacking District with 34th Street. "Starting from the Peak, the first half is a gradual descent through dense tropical woodland, crossing occasional streams and offering brief glimpses of the city below," explains Peter Hopper, a member of Hong Kong's Italia Running Club. "Sydney is a place with hundreds of running trails, from runs along the city's harbor to longer challenging bush trails in the chains of bush land that dots Sydney suburbs and outskirts," says Joe Degabriele, president of the Sydney Striders Running Club. Starting point: Victoria Peak Trinity Skyline Trail (Dallas) With stunning views over downtown Dallas, the 7.4-kilometer Trinity Skyline Trail starts at the Joppa Preserve's Lemmon Lake in the city's outskirts and finishes at the Trinity River Audubon Center downtown. The route starts from the Xuhui Riverside Public Open Space, near the Chuanchang Lu metro station, and finishes near Expo Zone C. Highlights include the luxurious turreted apartment blocks near Huangpu and, on the final stretch, views of the arched Lupu Bridge.
