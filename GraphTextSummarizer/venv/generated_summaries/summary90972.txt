When Winfrey announced last year that "The Oprah Winfrey Show" would end its 25-year run on syndicated television on September 9, 2011, speculation began that she would return with a new show when OWN launched. "My vision for OWN is to create a network that inspires our viewers and makes them want to be who they are on their best day," Winfrey said in a written statement. " Other shows added to the OWN lineup include, "Visionaries: Inside the Creative Mind," "Your OWN Show: Oprah's Search for the Next TV Star," "Gayle King Live!" Winfrey will "bust out of the studio to explore the world" with her new show, which will be called "Oprah's Next Chapter," Norman said. Winfrey will also host a show called "Master Class," Norman said.
