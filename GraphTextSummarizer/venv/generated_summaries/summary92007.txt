-- Just days after a magnitude 5.8 earthquake cracked the Washington Monument in four places, the National Park Service is trying to protect it from being further damaged by Hurricane Irene, spokeswoman Carol Johnson said Friday. The first rain bands from Hurricane Irene began hitting the South and North Carolina coasts Friday. Engineers for the National Park Service are working inside the Washington Monument to "plug holes and catch anything that they can't plug," Johnson told CNN. These cracks allow the water to get directly through and that is why we are doing everything we can to put in temporary waterproofing," Johnson said. "The crack is about 4 feet long and 1 inch wide and in some places wider and you can see sunlight through the crack," Johnson said.
