I felt I had a better grasp of American culture and my new black identity. In the weeks before leaving Ethiopia, my older brother Yoseph and I used to stay up late talking about how a group of welcoming American friends, a brand new American car and a huge American house would soon be ours. So when some online commenters questioned whether Boston Marathon winner and Eritrean-American Meb Keflezighi is truly "American," it reminded me of my own experience as an immigrant who became a naturalized American citizen and embraced a new identity. When I moved to New York, I felt at home, and met people with a similar understanding of black identity -- one that was varied and nuanced. And so my introduction to American culture began.
