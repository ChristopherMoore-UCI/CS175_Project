Thomas-Rasset downloaded work by artists such as No Doubt, Linkin Park, Gloria Estefan and Sheryl Crow. -- A federal jury Thursday found a 32-year-old Minnesota woman guilty of illegally downloading music from the Internet and fined her $80,000 each -- a total of $1.9 million -- for 24 songs. Illegal downloads of musical files will cost a Minnesota woman $1.9 million, a jury has decided. The judge ordered a retrial in 2007 after there was an error in the wording of jury instructions. Jammie Thomas-Rasset's case was the first such copyright infringement case to go to trial in the United States, her attorney said.
