Iraqi officials said U.S. airstrikes Saturday killed 16 ISIS fighters, and an Iraqi airstrike in Sinjar killed an additional 45 ISIS fighters, Iraq state media reported. Amin said Kurdish forces were able to break the siege by ISIS and help thousands of stranded Yazidis board trucks, which drove them to the Syrian border town of Hasaka near Iraq. Humanitarian nightmare In their effort to create a caliphate across parts of Iraq and Syria, ISIS fighters have slaughtered civilians as they take over cities in both countries. Last week, U.S. President Barack Obama authorized targeted attacks not only to protect Iraqi minorities from ISIS' killing rampage, but also Americans stationed in the Kurdish regional capital of Irbil.
