Raza Bokhari, a spokesman for Musharraf, accused the government of "demonstrating recklessness in its intention to pursue unwarranted treason charges" against him, saying the former president had served the country with "selfless devotion and perseverance." Musharraf took power, and a court subsequently convicted Sharif on hijacking and treason charges. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif accused Musharraf of illegally abrogating the constitution in November 2007. -- Former Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf should stand trial for treason, the country's prime minister said Monday. In the 1990s, when Sharif was prime minister, Musharraf was military chief.
