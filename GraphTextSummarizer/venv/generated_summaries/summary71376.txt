U.S. official: South Africa experienced at hosting crowds U.S. officials are satisfied with security arrangements. "The South Africans hosted the World Cup, so they have experience hosting significant crowds and managing events like this, although clearly this is really a unique event in world history, given the number of leaders coming to pay their respects, as well as the people of South Africa." Presidents set to speak at service Among the speakers at Tuesday's memorial will be President Obama, who like Mandela was his nation's first black president. Tens of thousands of South Africans, dozens of presidents and prime ministers, celebrities and street sweepers are all heading to the same place: a stadium in Johannesburg, where they'll honor Nelson Mandela at a memorial service on Tuesday. With private vehicles banned from the area around the stadium, the government pressed buses from around the country into service and stepped up train service to move the crowds.
