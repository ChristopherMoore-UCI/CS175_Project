-- Top jockey Richard Hughes achieved the remarkable feat of seven winners from an eight-race card in a meeting at Windsor Monday. The record for most successive wins is 12, by the great Gordon Richards, who is the only jockey to be knighted by Queen Elizabeth II. Hughes achieved the first two wins on mounts trained by his father-in-law Richard Hannon, who supplies him with many favorable rides. Hughes, who is heading for the title of champion jockey for the most wins in a season, all but secured the honor for the first time with his remarkable display at the racecourse in the south of England. The 39-year-old Irishman is only the second jockey to achieve seven wins on the same day at a British meeting, the other was Frankie Dettori at Ascot in 1996.
