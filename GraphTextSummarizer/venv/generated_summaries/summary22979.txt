Her husband, Wisdom Jeffrey, is wanted in connection with her death and is now a fugitive, Riverdale Police Chief Samuel Patterson said. " Patterson said Corrissa Friends had moved several times around the Atlanta area to get away from Jeffrey, and that police had been called to the apartment about a domestic dispute the day before the killing. -- A Georgia family whose daughter was killed is battling to get her 9-month-old child back from state custody in New York, where her estranged husband left the baby with relatives after her slaying. Corrissa Friends, 21, was shot to death in her apartment in the Atlanta suburb of Riverdale, Georgia, on August 11, according to police. He said witnesses put Jeffrey at the apartment less than five minutes before the shooting, and police recovered the shotgun used in the killing at the scene.
