"I think it was a tough match, a tough battle, and there were a lot of games that went to deuce and a lot of long games," Sharapova told reporters. -- "How do you solve a problem like Maria?" That was the question Caroline Wozniacki was left asking Sunday after being handed a brutal beating in the final at Indian Wells. Sharapova, 25, started at breathtaking speed, pummeling her opponent with a degree of power which gave Wozniacki little chance. Sharapova then broke Wozniacki in the first game of the second set and then again once more before serving out for the match at 5-2. After breaking the World No.10 in the first game of the match, Sharapova rarely let up, claiming the first set 6-2 after unleashing a series of impressive winners.
