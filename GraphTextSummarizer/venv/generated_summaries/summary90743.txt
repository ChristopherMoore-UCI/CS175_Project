The gunman opened fire on SWAT officers who entered the apartment, hitting two more officers, before police returned fire, killing the suspect, Jordan said. After the officers were shot, the alleged gunman -- Lovelle Mixon, 26, of Oakland -- was fatally shot in a gunbattle with SWAT officers in a nearby apartment complex where he was hiding. Authorities said Saturday night that Mixon had an extensive criminal history and was in violation of parole for assault with a deadly weapon. An anonymous caller directed authorities to a building on an adjacent street where he was believed to be barricaded, said acting Police Chief Howard Jordan. Oakland, California, police Officer John Hege has died after a weekend shooting, a coroner's office says.
