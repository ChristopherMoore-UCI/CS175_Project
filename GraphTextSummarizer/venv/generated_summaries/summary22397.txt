Hiking aficionado Tony Caligiuri promises plenty of hikes for the novice wishing to spend a couple hours in nature. Designated by Congress as a National Wild and Scenic River, White Clay Creek and the surrounding valley offers a nice level hike along the old railbeds (part of a rails-to-trails conversion) and through an old growth forest. White Clay Creek Preserve, Delaware and Pennsylvania Caligiuri hikes the White Clay Creek Preserve at least a couple times a year. Hike about three miles up to Rhododendron Gap. He also loves to hike in New York City.
