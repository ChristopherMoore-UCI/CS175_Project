Translation: Bush needs to make sure he is willing to campaign daily for two years because of his love for country, party and commitment to the his issue set — immigration and education reform, tax changes, energy policy, regulatory policy. While top Bush advisers have been gathering data on what a run would entail, no commitments have been made or asked of potential staff or supporters, one source says. Multiple sources close to Jeb Bush say the former Florida governor's recent public appearances in which, he seems to be thinking out loud about a possible presidential run are actually very similar to the private discussions he is having with friends and colleagues. On the personal side, Bush's concerns seem twofold according to multiple sources. Sources also say that while Bush has said he will decide in "short order" — perhaps sometime early in the New Year — a decision will likely not come in a major announcement.
