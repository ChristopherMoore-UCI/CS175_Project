Svalbard is designed to store duplicates of seeds from seed collections around the world. "At these temperatures, seeds for important crops like wheat, barley and peas can last for up to 10,000 years. "The seed vault is the perfect place for keeping seeds safe for centuries," said Cary Fowler, executive director of the trust. -- A vast underground vault storing millions of seeds from around the world took delivery of its first shipment Tuesday. The inaugural shipment represent 268,000 distinct samples of seeds, with each sample containing a hundred-plus seeds and originating from a different farm or field around the world.
