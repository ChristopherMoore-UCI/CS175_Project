"The queen does not scrutinize and is not consulted on the list of accompanying guests, as they are official guests and not personal invitations," said the spokesman, who asked not to be named in line with policy. "Unless Mr. Barnbrook brings a more acceptable guest along and doesn't turn it into a political stunt, the invitation will be rescinded," Assembly Chairman Darren Johnson said. The party said Griffin will attend the queen's July 21 garden party at Buckingham Palace as a guest of Richard Barnbrook, an elected BNP member of the London Assembly But pressure was mounting Thursday for Barnbrook to pick someone else. "We cannot tolerate any such abuse of the invitation or any potential embarrassment to Her Majesty," the mayor wrote in a letter opposing Barnbrook's choice of guest. Johnson spoke after London Mayor Boris Johnson asked him to intervene in Barnbrook's plans, the assembly said in a news release.
