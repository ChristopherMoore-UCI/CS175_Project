June's rioting in Istanbul's Taksim Square may also have tainted the city's hopes, though Turkish Prime Minister Recep Erdogan tried to persuade IOC members ahead of Saturday's vote. " Tokyo's bid came in at $5 billion to $6 billion, compared to $19 billion pledged by Istanbul, said Ed Hula, editor and founder of aroundtherings.com, which covers the business and politics of the Olympic movement. Tokyo won the deciding vote, 60 to Istanbul's 36, according to an IOC tweet. -- Tokyo has been chosen by the International Olympic Committee to host the 2020 Summer Games. But Tokyo's government has already amassed a $4.9 billion Olympic fund to pay to prepare for the Games, Hula said.
