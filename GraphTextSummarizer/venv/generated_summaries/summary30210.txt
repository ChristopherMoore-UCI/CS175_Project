-- Pope Francis doesn't want a commonly quoted Bible verse chanted as empty words on Christmas Day -- the one about peace on Earth. Peace calls for daily commitment," Francis said in his Christmas Urbi et Orbi message. And then he practiced what he preached, spending three hours at a local hospital bringing Christmas cheer to sick children. The pontiff told tens of thousands of people gathered in front of the Vatican on Wednesday where he wants that peace to happen -- in Syria, South Sudan, the Central African Republic and the Holy Land. "Glory to God in the highest heaven, and on earth peace among those whom he favors," heavenly hosts proclaimed when Christ was born, according to the Vatican translation.
