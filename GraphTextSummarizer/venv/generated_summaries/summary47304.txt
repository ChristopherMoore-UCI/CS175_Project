It has a safe passing law and a Share the Road Campaign; cyclists are allowed to ride side-by-side. The state also has a "complete streets" policy, which means new roads must be designed with cyclists and pedestrians in mind, Wempe said. In each of the top five states -- Washington, Minnesota, Massachusetts, Colorado and Oregon -- the focus of the respective Departments of Transportation is not only on highways but on accommodating pedestrians, cyclists and transportation on ferries and trains, said Matt Wempe, the league's state and local advocacy coordinator. Overall, we see states -- and especially state Departments of Transportation and state legislatures -- lagging behind cities and the expectations of local cyclists, despite the many well documented benefits of a more active lifestyle." The advocacy group's Bicycle Friendly State Program ranks the states each year under a series of criteria, from laws and regulations that govern bicycling to policies for accommodating cyclists and infrastructure funding.
