Thursday, he told CNN that concerns of Willingham's supporters were based on "a lot of misinformation." "I think that's being used very much as a side issue to politicize, through some New York lawyers, the work of the commission," Bradley said. But because Texas started accrediting crime labs in 2003, Cox and others who have backed the family say that would mean cases such as Willingham's and that of another inmate, Ernest Willis, would be dropped. Prosecutors argued that Willingham deliberately set the 1991 blaze -- but three reviews of the evidence by outside experts have found the fire should not have been ruled arson. " Ellis, a Houston Democrat, serves as the chairman of the board of The Innocence Project -- the "New York lawyers" that have supported efforts by Willingham's stepmother and cousins to clear his name. "The commission has been very clear that the commission is going to address the merits of the Willingham case."
