In a straight party-line vote, the GOP members of the HASC voted Thursday to include a provision in the new defense authorization bill outlawing any gay marriage ceremonies on military bases. On Wednesday, President Barack Obama became the first sitting president to publicly support gay marriage, but Panetta declined to follow in his boss's footsteps. So you know, where state law provides for that, then obviously that kind of marriage can take place. As secretary of defense I'm responsible for enforcing the law and giving the best defense advice we can to the president of the United States," said Panetta, who is a staunch Roman Catholic. -- Gay service members who want to marry often can't have the ceremony on military bases in the United States.
