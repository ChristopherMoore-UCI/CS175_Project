These observers say the Ramsey memes are reminiscent of the viral fame foisted upon people like Antoine Dodson ("Hide yo' kids/hide yo' wife") and Sweet Brown ("Ain't nobody got time for that") -- in other words, poor, black people in scary situations whose emotional reactions are turned into punchlines. "Even before the genuinely heroic Ramsey came along, some viewers had expressed concern that the laughter directed at people like Sweet Brown plays into the most basic stereotyping of blacks as simple-minded ramblers living in the 'ghetto,' socially out of step with the rest of educated America. Praise for Ramsey appeared to only cool off marginally Thursday as reports surfaced that he did prison time in the '90s, and again about a decade ago, on domestic abuse charges and for drug and trespassing arrests. Charles Ramsey, the man who, along with fellow neighbor Angel Cordero, helped rescue victim Amanda Berry, has gone from struggling dishwasher to viral sensation overnight. Several images of Ramsey had popped up by Wednesday on Meme Generator, a site that lets people add presumably humorous text to stock photos.
