At the U.S. Open in 1984, Cash lost in the semifinal to Ivan Lendl after a five-set thriller, on the same day as an epic women's final between Chris Evert and Martina Navratilova. He knocked out Mats Wilander and Connors en route to the final, where he beat Czech Lendl to seal his first grand slam title, and give birth to that famed celebration. With John McEnroe and Jimmy Connors also contesting another five-set classic, it is regarded as one of the greatest days in tennis history and became known as 'Super Saturday.' All you have to do is leave your question at the foot of the page and Cash will reveal all on Friday's 1530 GMT edition of World Sport. Cash also made the final of the Australian Open in 1987 but lost to Stefan Edberg in a five-setter, but his moment of destiny was to come at Wimbledon later that year.
