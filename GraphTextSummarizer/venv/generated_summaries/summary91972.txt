The series of bailouts and austerity measures implemented during the last two years has led to a fundamental political crisis affecting both the function of government and the standing of key politicians and political parties. Yet, for the first time in recent memory, the political battle lines in Greece are not drawn between left and right, but between the modernizers and the populists existing in most political parties across the spectrum. The first feed was from inside the parliament building, showing a disconnected political class engaging in their usual micro-political infighting and self-congratulation; the other feed was of ongoing semi-apocalyptic destruction in the streets of Athens. The role of the state and of the public sector is usually at the heart of political debates between left and right. It looks as if public opinion in Greece can tolerate the continuous and widespread destruction of central Athens, but would not accept any police or state action that would contain those few extremist groups that cause mayhem.
