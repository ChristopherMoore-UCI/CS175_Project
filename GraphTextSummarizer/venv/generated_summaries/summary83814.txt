The 34-year-old McMillian had been running for mayor of Clarksdale, a city of about 18,000 people in northwestern Mississippi's Delta region. His campaign motto: "Moving Clarksdale forward." McMillian's short biography on Facebook said he had spent much of his career raising money for universities after he graduated from Jackson State with a degree in elementary education. "Beating is not the cause of death," said Meredith, who confirmed he'd met twice with McMillian's family. It includes a picture of McMillian posing with President Barack Obama. They said McMillian had told "family and close friends that he was very concerned for his personal safety."
