And despite the fact that hoarding has traditionally been seen as a symptom or subtype of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), brain activity in those who cannot de-clutter is also distinct from that of people with typical OCD, the study shows. New research suggests that hoarders have unique patterns of brain activity when faced with making decisions about their possessions, compared with healthy people. Interestingly, however, when people with hoarding disorder made similar decisions about discarding junk mail that didn't belong to them, they again showed unusual levels of activity in the anterior cingulate cortex and insula — but in this case, their brain activity was much lower than normal. The authors suggest that this lack of brain activity could be linked with the "diminished motivation and poor insight frequently observed" in patients who hoard; that is, it may be what allows them to live amidst overwhelming clutter and piles of junk, but fail to clear it out or even be bothered by it. He notes that the new study adds to the evidence that hoarding should be recognized as a specific syndrome that falls not under the standard definition of OCD — only about 18% of people with hoarding symptoms meet the full criteria for OCD as it is currently defined — but within a spectrum of related conditions.
