My being elected as chief confirms to those outside of Indian Country, what we have known all along: Tribes are very egalitarian and women are strong advocates for their people. The word "chief" may conjure up a male image to many peoples' minds, but in truth women such as Ada Deer and Wilma Mankiller have also provided inspirational leadership for Indian Country -- I hope to be able to continue that kind of legacy in my work as chief. My name, Soqsqua Mutawi Mutahash, translated means "Female Sachem Many Hearts" or "Chief Many Hearts." It reflects my life's work: I have cared for many hearts in my past roles as critical care nurse and health and human services director for the tribe. What message does this (being voted as the new Chief of the Mohegan tribe) send both to today's "Indian Country," and the U.S. as a whole?
