-- British police made mistakes over decades in their investigation of sex abuse allegations against late BBC TV presenter Jimmy Savile, a report released Tuesday said. Alleged sexual abuse victims of the late BBC entertainer are suing both the British broadcaster and the Savile estate, attorneys for the victims said last month. "It is imperative that children and other victims of sexual crimes have the knowledge, the means and the confidence to report what has happened to them," he said. Police began their latest investigation in late 2012 after a TV documentary broadcast in October sparked a flood of sexual abuse claims against Savile. The report by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary said not only did police around the country fail to "join the dots," but policies made it difficult for victims to come forward to report the crimes.
