It is a giant 5-foot diameter new species of jellyfish that slimed a beach in Australia last month, much to the delight of Lisa-ann Gershwin, a scientist at Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization. "I've been ... working with jellyfish for a long time here and I've seen a lot of big jellyfish but this one's really big," ABC quoted her as saying. She told the Herald she has been working to get a scientific name approved for the new jellyfish, which she believes is related to previously identified jellyfish in the area called lion's mane, and sometimes "snotties." Sure enough this thing is an absolute menace this season; it's been around in large numbers," Gershwin told the Herald. "We don't actually know what's going on that's led, not only to this species, but many, many types of jellyfish blooming in massive numbers," she told the Herald.
