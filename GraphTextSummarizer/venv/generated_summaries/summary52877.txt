The ACLU had filed a request under the Freedom of Information Act, asking for court docket information on current and past cases of those tracked using mobile location data. -- Information about how and when the government gathers and uses cell phone location data to track certain criminal suspects should be made available to the public, a federal appeals court ruled Tuesday. "It would, for example, provide information about the kinds of crimes the government uses cell phone tracking data to investigate." The government has strongly opposed efforts to disclose information about their covert surveillance program in certain classified cases. For cases that resulted in an acquittal, dismissal or were sealed for national security purposes, the appeals court ordered a lower court to re-examine the issue.
