The meeting in Bata will bring down the curtain on a tournament -- hosted at the last minute by Equatorial Guinea after Morocco declined because of Ebola fears -- which has seen some fine football but also been blighted by crowd trouble inside and outside the stadiums. They are two of the continent's acknowledged football powerhouses and later Sunday either Ivory Coast or Ghana will end a long and frustrating wait to be crowned Africa Cup of Nations champions. Ivory Coast, with a host of talented players such as Manchester City's Yaya Toure and the club's new signing Wilfried Bony, has come on strong after needing to beat Cameroon to reach the knockout stages. Overshadowed by the violent scenes was a solid team performance by the Black Stars, with Andre Ayew, the son of the legendary Abedi 'Pele' Ayew, rounding off the scoring with his third goal of the competition. Ghana's 3-0 semifinal win over the hosts saw the worst scenes, with a helicopter deployed to disperse fans at the Estadio de Malabo and the game held up for several minutes.
