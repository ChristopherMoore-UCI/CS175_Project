"We understand that at 1600 hours -- that is to say at 4 p.m. (4:30 p.m. ET) -- there was a blackout on a national level that was produced by an explosion, which is being investigated" in the Guri hydroelectric power station, Caracas Mayor Juan Barreto said. The head of the country's electric authority, Hipolito Izquierdo, told state-run Venezuelan Television that 60 percent of the power had been restored by 7 p.m. local time (7:30 p.m. ET) and predicted that power would be fully restored before 9:30 p.m. (10 p.m. ET). In taking the line out of service, power was disrupted to other areas, he said. -- Power returned slowly to Venezuela on Tuesday night, a few hours after widespread outages blacked out nearly half the country, trapping people in elevators, stalling subways, filling streets with pedestrians and forcing hospitals to switch to emergency generators. "Normally, these blackouts don't occur very often," said Javier Alvarado, president of Caracas Electricity.
