In 2008, however, appeals courts in Atlanta and San Francisco found searches of every inmate coming into a prison population are justified, even without specific suspicions. The justices will decide whether corrections officials should have a less intrusive, "reasonable suspicion" standard that would prevent the kind of search currently permitted in at least 32 states, including New Jersey. "At the time Mr. Florence was admitted into the facility, the policy and the practice were to ask him to take off his clothes, take a shower and be subject to a visual search," said Carter Phillips, who will argue Burlington County's side of the case before the high court. Local jails in New Jersey at the time of Florence's arrest were subject to federal monitors after allegations that minority motorists and their passengers were being unfairly targeted for police stops and arrests. The case is Florence v. Board of Chosen Freeholders of the County of Burlington, New Jersey (10-945).
