New Tunisian government could be announced Monday News reports out of Mauritania say a man set himself on fire Monday in front of the presidential palace. It is too soon to know whether the reports coming in of self-immolations are connected, and whether those lighting themselves on fire are hoping to spark protests in their countries. Now, reports are coming in from other countries in the region -- Egypt, Algeria, and Mauritania -- that other demonstrators are turning to self-immolation. In Egypt, Abdo Abelmonem Gafr, a baker from a town outside Cairo, set himself on fire outside the parliament building in the capital on Monday, an Interior Ministry official said. The popular protests in Tunisia that have caused upheaval in the government were sparked by Mohamed Bouazizi, a 26-year-old unemployed college graduate, who set himself on fire in protest.
