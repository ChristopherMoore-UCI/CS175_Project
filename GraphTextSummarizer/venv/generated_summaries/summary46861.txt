Ciudad Juarez Mayor Jose Reyes Ferriz said Lara, who maintained what was apparently a second home in Juarez, was killed outside that house as he walked to his car. Reyes said he had a long partnership with Lara as both mayors rallied for more support for border cities in the war against drug cartels. Lara, who became the mayor of Guadalupe in 2007, had apparently taken up residence in Juarez to protect his family, Reyes told CNN. -- Gunmen shot and killed the mayor of the Mexican town of Guadalupe as his wife and child watched, the mayor of nearby Ciudad Juarez told CNN. Reyes said violence increased in Guadalupe since 2,000 federal troops arrived in Juarez early in the year.
