A grand jury in Missouri now has more time decide whether Ferguson police Officer Darren Wilson should be charged for the shooting death of teenager Michael Brown. Outrage over the shooting led to days of protests in Ferguson and a heated debate over whether Brown's race played a role in his death. The grand jury will mull testimony and decide whether they believe Wilson committed a crime when he shot Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old, on August 9. Brown was black, like two-thirds of his neighbors in Ferguson. St. Louis County Judge Carolyn Whittington has extended the grand jury's deadline until January 7, said Paul Fox, the county's director of judicial administration.
