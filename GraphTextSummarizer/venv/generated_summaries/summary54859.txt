-- South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford, already under fire for an extramarital relationship, should be impeached for abusing state finances, a Republican state senator said Monday. Last Friday, South Carolina first lady Jenny Sanford said she and her four boys were moving out of the governor's mansion in Columbia and back to their home in Charleston for the upcoming school year. A Republican senator in South Carolina says Gov. Mark Sanford should be impeached over financial violations. "The two flights by Gov. Sanford were in violation of the South Carolina Code of Regulations," Thomas said in his letter. Sanford said then that he intended to continue as governor and would try to rebuild his relationship with his wife and family.
