In 2008, with the growing success of the concert events, Staglin co-founded the International Mental Health Research Organization (IMHRO) which allows for additional financial support across the nation and increases the ability to fund and propose research opportunities that might not otherwise be studied in the field of mental illness. From the moment they learned of their son's illness, Staglin and his wife, Shari, took on the disease and delved into the world of mental disorders in an attempt to end brain disease and the cultural stigmas attached to them. Brandon Staglin is an example of the success that's possible with the right support, Garen Staglin said. What started out as a community gathering to discuss mental health has turned into a major annual event with celebrity performances, top professionals and a sold out dinner that has raised more than $114 million for research efforts. So the Staglins, who own Staglin Family Vineyards in Rutherford, California, decided to throw their own small benefit for mental health in their backyard.
