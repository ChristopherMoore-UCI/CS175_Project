-- After pleas to spare the life of British aid worker Alan Henning went unanswered by the so-called Islamic State terror group, his family is "numb with grief" with the news that he has been beheaded. " A taxi driver from near Manchester in northern England, the 47-year-old Henning was part of a team of volunteers who traveled to Syria in December 2013 to deliver aid -- food, water and medical supplies -- to people affected by the country's devastating civil war. " Henning appears to be the fourth Westerner to be beheaded on camera by ISIS. " UK authorities believe at least 500 British citizens have gone to Iraq and Syria, many of them to fight with ISIS and other Islamist groups -- and that most will try to return, bringing their extremist views with them. ISIS then claimed its first British victim, aid worker David Haines, according to video that appeared online on September 13.
