Hirabe, 48, director of Radio Shabelle, was shot in the head five times, and Tajir -- identified in the statement as Ahmed Omar Hashi, 47, Radio Shabelle's news editor -- was shot twice in the stomach. The assassination of Mukhtar Mohammad Hirabe of Shabelle Media follows last week's abduction of a station director for TV Universal. CNN regularly works with Somali journalists who are employed by Shabelle Media. Colleagues carry the body of Somalia's Shabelle radio network's director, Mukhtar Mohammad Hirabe, on Sunday. His colleague Ahmed Omar Tajir was hospitalized.
