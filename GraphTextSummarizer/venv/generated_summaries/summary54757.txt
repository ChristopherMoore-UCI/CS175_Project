Sharper also is being investigated for a sexual assault that allegedly happened in New Orleans on September 24, New Orleans police spokeswoman Remi Braden told CNN on Saturday. After eight seasons with the Packers, including a loss to Denver in Super Bowl XXXII, he moved to the Minnesota Vikings for four years. He signed as a free agent with the New Orleans Saints in 2009, which led to a Super Bowl ring that first season. The Miami Beach, Florida, resident has been "linked to two sexual assaults in west Los Angeles" that allegedly happened in October 2013 and this month, an LAPD news release said. Sharper, 38, was arrested Friday afternoon by the Los Angeles Police Department's sexual assault section of its robbery-homicide unit, according to LAPD spokeswoman Sally Madera.
