During my one-week stay with New Life, I witnessed entire bunk beds get built from scratch in a matter of days, boxes of medicine get organized, and water filters get distributed to the outskirts of Haiti. "These kids don't just need basic provisions, they need love and they need brothers and sisters to play with them and teach them," says John Poitevent, a pastor at Christ Fellowship, in Palm Beach, Florida, which supports New Life. It's my last day in Haiti, and I'm on a trip to bring food, water and supplies to Haitians still displaced by the 2010 earthquake. Here I was taken in with open arms by one of Haiti's ultimate volunteers, Miriam Frederick. In Haiti, even a few drops of water can stop a boy's tears.
