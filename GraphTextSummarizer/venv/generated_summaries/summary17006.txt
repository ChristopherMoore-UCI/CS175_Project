-- Raul Gonzalez became the leading scorer in Real Madrid history after scoring twice in the 4-0 Primera Liga victory at Sporting Gijon on Sunday. Raul celebrates in familiar style after breaking Di Stefano's Real Madrid record against Sporting Gijon. The win was Real's eighth consecutive Premier Liga success and ensured the defending champions closed the gap to runaway leaders Barcelona to 10 points. Raul is also the all-time leading scorer in the Champions League and has helped the capital club claim six Primera Liga crowns during almost 15 years' service at the Bernabeu. On Saturday, Barca had to come from two goals down to draw 2-2 at Real Betis with Samuel Eto'o scoring both goals to take his tally to 23 goals for the season.
