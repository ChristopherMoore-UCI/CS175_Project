In short, the Transition addresses the cost barriers, weather sensitivity, long door-to-door travel time and lack of ground mobility that has thus far kept personal aviation from playing a significant role in meeting our transportation needs. We founded Terrafugia in 2006 to develop a solution to many of the barriers to the more widespread use of personal aviation: Our work led to the development of a new kind of aircraft, which we call the "Transition." Watch Anna Dietrich's TED Talk I co-founded Terrafugia as a graduate student in the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics at MIT. While it is not the "flying car" of "The Jetsons," the Transition is a state-of-the-art solution to improving personal mobility today. The Transition can also use any of more than 5,000 public-use airports in the United States, letting the operator avoid the congestion of commercial hub airports while also flying over traffic jams on the roadways. From the reactions we get to the aircraft whenever we have the opportunity to share it, it's clear that even with its practical approach, the Transition is rekindling a shared dream of more personal freedom.
