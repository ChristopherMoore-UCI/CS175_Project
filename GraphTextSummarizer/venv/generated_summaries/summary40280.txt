Officials accepted a bid from an unauthorized vendor who offered Nike gear at half the price, according to Adly el-Shafie, the commercial director of Nike's only agent and distributor in Egypt. "Nike's authorized distributor in Egypt sent two official communications to the EOC on this issue weeks ago and on July 20, 2012, Nike also sent a written communication to the EOC requesting the Committee to take immediate action." -- Members of Egypt's Olympic team were given fake Nike gear to wear during training in London, athletes and a distributor said. In a statement Thursday, Nike said it was discussing the allegations with Egyptian officials and trying to reach a solution for Egypt's Olympic team, which has 113 athletes competing in 19 sports. El-Shafie said he notified Egyptian officials twice that they had purchased counterfeit gear from an unauthorized distributor, but received no response.
