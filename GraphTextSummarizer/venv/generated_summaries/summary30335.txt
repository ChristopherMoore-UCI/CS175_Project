Apps have to be approved by Apple before they can be sold, meaning fewer spam apps and viruses make it through to consumers. The iPhone may have helped kill the BlackBerry, but it gave birth to a new beefed-up genre of mobile devices. Mobile phones had limited Internet access before the iPhone, but the device's browser was a huge improvement, displaying webpages more like they actually looked on a desktop computer. It also means the company can reject apps as it pleases -- say, when a feature competes with an Apple product -- to the occasional displeasure of the developer community. The Foxconn plant was called out for producing Apple products, although it also assembles products for other major electronics companies including Microsoft, Nintendo, Sony and Intel.
