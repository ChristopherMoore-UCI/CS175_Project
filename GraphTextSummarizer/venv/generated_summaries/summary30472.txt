The remaining crews spent Monday getting together to "reflect, reset and review," said 153rd Air Expeditionary Group commander Col. Jerry Champlin, according to a U.S. Northern Command press release. Some North Carolina Air National Guard members died and others suffered serious injuries when their C-130 tanker crashed around 6:30 p.m. MT (8:30 p.m. ET), spokesman Lt. Col. Robert Carver said Monday.
