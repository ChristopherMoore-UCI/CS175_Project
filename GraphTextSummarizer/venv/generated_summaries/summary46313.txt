In 2015, church officials said requests to build new churches that had long been ensnared in red tape began to receive government approval. In December, Cuban President Raul Castro thanked Pope Francis for his role in the secret talks that led to a prisoner swap between Cuba and the United States and the start of negotiations to restore full diplomatic relations. While church officials said several new Catholic houses of worship are in the works, the first will be built in Sandino, a remote town at the end of a pothole-cratered road in Cuba's westernmost province. In the first years of the revolution, thousands of Catholic priests were jailed or forced into exile, and church property, including the Jesuit school that Castro attended, was seized by the Cuban government. The Sandino church has been 56 years in the making, ever since Fidel Castro took power and Cuba became an officially atheist state.
