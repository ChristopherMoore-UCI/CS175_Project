Another organization, ShelterBox, relies on donations to send emergency shelter and other life-saving equipment to families in Haiti and other areas hit by disaster. Many of the volunteers in Haiti are medical aid workers who are sent to Haiti through organizations such as Doctors Without Borders. Make personal hygiene kits  If you're looking for something more hands-on, several organizations, such as Heart to Heart International, allow you to make personal hygiene kits that will be shipped to Haiti. ShelterBoxes include a disaster relief tent for a family of up to 10 people; a children's pack containing coloring books, crayons and pens; a range of other survival equipment, including mosquito nets to prevent the spread of malaria; a basic tool kit; and a wood-burning or multifuel stove. On the foundation's website, you will see that $35 could provide six mosquito nets to help prevent the spread of malaria and other illnesses; $55 could buy life-saving medical supplies; $125 could purchase a tent to provide shelter for a family of five; and $600 could provide two portable toilets for use in crowded camps.
