If you've played a PES game before you'll know what to expect, which is both a plus and a minus, depending on your point of view. Game modes are much the same as before, including the venerable Master League, but the new addition of Be A Legend, where you try to take one player to the top, does not feel finished. For a series that's always short on official team and league licenses -- leading to silly-sounding approximations of players' names (Ryan Gills anyone?) -- Pro Evolution Soccer 2009 (PES) has a tough task on its hands. Online play is not great and given the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 are built for broadband multiplayer, PES is lagging -- literally.
