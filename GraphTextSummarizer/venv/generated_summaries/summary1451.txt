"We're on a path to al Qaeda's destruction, and the president has committed that we're not going to rest until al Qaeda is destroyed as an organization in the Afghan-Pak area, as well as in other regions of the world," John Brennan, U.S. President Barack Obama's chief counterterrorism adviser, told CNN's "State of the Union." -- Nearly a year after commandos killed Osama bin Laden at a compound northern Pakistan, U.S. officials "still have work to do" in order to defeat al Qaeda, a top counterterrorism official said Sunday. " The United States also has its sights set on al Qaeda targets in Yemen and Africa, he said. Officials believe Ayman al-Zawahir, the longtime deputy of bin Laden who took over leadership of al Qaeda after his death, remains in that region, Brennan said. "I just know that President Obama, when the time came for him to make a momentous decision like that, he took the action that did bring bin Laden to justice." Speaking to reporters Friday, U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said there was no "silver bullet" that would destroy al Qaeda.
