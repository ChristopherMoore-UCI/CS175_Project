League leaders Chelsea made a complaint over "inappropriate language" used by ref Mark Clattenburg during Sunday's controversial 3-2 home defeat by Manchester United. Terry missed Sunday's Stamford Bridge clash with second-placed United, who now trail Chelsea by just a point, as he served the second game of his ban. " "We have lodged a complaint to the Premier League match delegate with regard to inappropriate language used by the referee and directed at two of our players in two separate incidents during (the) match," Chelsea said in a statement said on Sunday. Suarez himself was at the center of a racism row earlier this year, receiving an eight-match ban after being found guilty by the FA of racially abusing Manchester United defender Patrice Evra. The Clattenburg case came on the same afternoon as referee Andre Marriner earned the wrath of Everton manager David Moyes, who felt that Uruguay striker Luis Suarez should have been sent off for a bad tackle in Sunday's Merseyside derby against Liverpool, which ended 2-2 at Goodison Park.
