That's not to say the situation hasn't provoked a crisis of faith among many Livestrong supporters, especially those who were inspired by Armstrong's accomplishments as a cyclist and cancer survivor. As long as people like Schuster continue to view Livestrong as an entity separate from its fallen founder, the cancer charity will likely withstand whatever controversy befalls Armstrong, charity experts said. -- In a sense, Fred Schuster has a permanent reminder of disgraced cyclist Lance Armstrong etched into his skin. "My decision to get the tattoo had absolutely nothing to do with Mr. Armstrong, and subsequently, these revelations do nothing to diminish the meaning it has for me. "I still support the Livestrong cause and I am still in awe of what Lance Armstrong was able to do, doping or not, but both the foundation and Lance are now tainted," he said in a CNN iReport.
