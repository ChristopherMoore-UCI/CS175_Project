-- A law enforcement official confirms members of the Westboro Baptist Church, known for its controversial practice of picketing military funerals, participated in training for law enforcement officials at Quantico Marine Base in Virginia. The story about staff training sessions between the FBI and Westboro Baptist Church members was first reported by NPR News on Wednesday. Other controversial groups, including the Ku Klux Klan, have taken part in similar training sessions. There was a fourth session at a facility in Manassas, Virginia, before a halt was called to Westboro's involvement. The purpose, according to the official, is "to expose law enforcement to these groups, see what they are about, and understand their perspective."
