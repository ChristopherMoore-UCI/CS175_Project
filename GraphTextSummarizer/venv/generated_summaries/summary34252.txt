Paris Jackson: Superstar's daughter builds own identity in spotlight Prince, Paris and Blanket Jackson and their grandmother Katherine Jackson are suing  AEG Live, accusing their father's last concert promoter of negligently hiring, retaining or supervising  Dr. Conrad Murray, who was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in Jackson's death. Paris, Prince Jackson testimonies shown in Jackson death trial Paris made millions cry two weeks later when she spoke at the public memorial for Jackson. On Monday, in the Jackson family's wrongful death lawsuit, Jackson lawyers informed AEG Live attorneys that Prince will be the next witness after a doctor who is an expert in medical conflicts of interest completes his testimony Tuesday. Jackson lawyers argue that the promoter and producer of the "This Is It" shows pressured Murray to get Jackson to rehearsals but failed to get Jackson help despite numerous red flags that he was in trouble. "The symptoms that Mr. Jackson was exhibiting were consistent with what someone might expect to see of someone suffering from total sleep deprivation over a chronic period," Dr. Charles Czeisler, a Harvard Medical School sleep expert, testified Friday at the trial.
