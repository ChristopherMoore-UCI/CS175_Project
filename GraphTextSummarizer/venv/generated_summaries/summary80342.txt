Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said Saturday in a statement that the material shows that President George W. Bush authorized spy agencies to collect contents of some overseas communications, as well as the bulk collection of domestic phone calls and e-mail metadata. Large sections of the newly released material were blacked out to "protect information that remains properly classified for national security reasons and because of the great harm to national security if disclosed," said the office of the Director of National Intelligence. "President Bush issued authorizations approximately every 30-60 days," the Director of National Intelligence office said Saturday in a statement. The disclosure that the National Security Agency has been collecting metadata has stirred provoked from civil liberty groups worried about the impact on privacy rights. -- The Obama administration has released more once-secret national security documents, this time detailing the origins of increased electronic surveillance to collect foreign intelligence in the months after the 9/11 attacks.
