The arrival of Android signals the opening round of the battle between Google and its rivals such as Apple to create software for the next generation of mobile phones that allows users to connect seamlessly to the internet. Ernest Doku, from mobile phone comparison Web site Omio.com, told the British Press Association: "Despite the popularity of the Google brand, the G1's design lacks the inherent 'cool' factor that made the iPhone 3G such a mass market success for Apple. The G1 makes use of applications such as Google Maps, instant messaging through Google Talk, as well as high-speed internet browsing and a 3-megapixel camera. The G1 represents Google's first foray into the mobile phone market. The first mobile phone powered by Google has gone on sale in the UK -- its first foray into the European market.
