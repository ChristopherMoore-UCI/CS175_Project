The 2022 World Cup should be played in November and December, but don't worry -- the final won't ruin your Christmas holidays. A FIFA task force has recommended that the tournament in Qatar be moved from its traditional June and July slot, but the organization's secretary general, Jerome Valcke, has told CNN that the final won't take place on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day. The National Basketball Association and college basketball seasons will also just be getting underway in November. November and December mark the latter parts of the extremely lucrative college and professional American football seasons, and Fox is one of three networks with rights to the National Football League through the 2022 season. The month of December is traditionally hectic in the English Premier League with games scheduled throughout the month, but even in Spain's La Liga, Germany's Bundesliga, Italy's Serie A and France's Ligue 1, those leagues' winter breaks don't begin until well into December.
