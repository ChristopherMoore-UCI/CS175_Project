-- U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia has been fined $70 for allegedly rear-ending an automobile in a minor four-car collision, a United States Park Police spokesman confirmed Wednesday. Scalia was on hand when oral arguments began at 10 a.m. Tuesday in one of the biggest cases of the term, a discrimination claim by female workers against Wal-Mart Stores. Scalia was not injured in the accident, which occurred Tuesday when the 75-year-old high court justice's car rear-ended another vehicle on the George Washington Memorial Parkway in suburban Virginia, according to Sgt. The accident didn't prevent Scalia from arriving at court on time Tuesday. The narrow and winding four-lane divided parkway travels along the Potomac River past the nation's capital, and is popular among both commuters and tourists.
