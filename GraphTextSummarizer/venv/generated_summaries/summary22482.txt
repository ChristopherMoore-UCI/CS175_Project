No, "six strikes" isn't a phrase from some esoteric version of baseball played on Mars — it's a colloquialism for a new anti-piracy warning system designed to track copyright infringers and help internet service providers (ISPs) take progressively punitive measures to discourage or prevent said infringers from engaging in further copyright-violating activities. I'm assuming this scenario applies, more or less, anywhere you'll find shared Internet provided by a "six strikes"-participating ISP. We could put it to a complex-wide vote, but even if a majority were in favor of taking action, say somehow shutting off file-sharing activity entirely, now we're talking about an all or nothing "fix" that also blocks legitimate file sharing — sharing anything not copyrighted, e.g. game or application demos, some music (freely released albums, for instance), public domain materials (Project Gutenberg's texts, for instance, or public domain art). CCI says it now expects what it calls the "Copyright Alert System" to kick off in early 2013, adding: "Our goal has always been to implement the program in a manner that educates consumers about copyright and peer-to-peer networks, encourages the use of legal alternatives, safeguards customer privacy, and provides an easy-to-use independent review program for consumers to challenge alerts they believe they've received in error. Each unit in the complex pays for shared Internet equally as part of our monthly association fees.
