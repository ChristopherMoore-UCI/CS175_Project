The Sacramento Choral Society was holding what police called a "well-publicized" event to sing the "Hallelujah Chorus" in the mall's food court, scheduled for 7:30 p.m. "Come join our large Chorus of area Singers as they burst into Handel's Hallelujah Chorus much to the surprise and delight of Shoppers in the Food Court of the recently reopened Westfield Galleria at Roseville," the society's website trumpeted ahead of the event. "At 6:45 p.m., the Roseville Police and Fire communications center received reports that people in the food court heard popping noises and felt floor movement," a police statement said. The governor's order suspended the normal one-week waiting period for mall employees to seek unemployment benefits. A large section of the mall burned on October 21, after a man set it on fire while barricaded inside a video game store, during a standoff with police. -- Two months after a California mall was closed following a devastating fire, authorities had to close it again Monday night after Christmas singers clogged the shopping center.
