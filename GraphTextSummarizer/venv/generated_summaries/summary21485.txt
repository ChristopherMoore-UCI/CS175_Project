That was the apparent lesson Thursday when two fighter jets under the direction of the the North American Aerospace Defense Command intercepted a general aviation plane that had flown Thursday into temporarily restricted air space over Los Angeles, NORAD said. Accompanied by the F-16s, the Cessna 182 landed without incident, where it was met by local law enforcement, NORAD said. The F-16s were scrambled from March Air Reserve Base in Riverside, California, and intercepted the errant Cessna 182 around 11:30 a.m. (2:30 p.m. ET), said NORAD. The restriction of the airspace coincided with travel to the West Coast by President Barack Obama. CNN Rosalina Nieves contributed to this report story from Los Angeles.
