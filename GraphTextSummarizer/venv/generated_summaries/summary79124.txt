The response of ISIS fighters to the initial strikes may give military officials clues on what to target next. The first wave of strikes was expected to last into the early hours of Tuesday morning in Syria, CNN's Sciutto reported. The bombing has focused on the ISIS stronghold of Raqqa, a city in northern Syria. Some analysts have suggested that ISIS had already started dispersing its assets and fighters after President Barack Obama's warning of action in Syria earlier this month. The Pentagon also said ISIS fighters were hit in the strikes but didn't specify how many.
