They were extremely engaged in the process, asking questions of every witness, requesting specific witnesses, requesting specific information and asking for certain physical evidence," said McCulloch. All eyes and ears were on St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch late Monday when he announced there would be no indictment in the shooting death of Michael Brown. "However, once the autopsy findings were released showing that Michael Brown had not sustained any wound to the back of his body, no additional witnesses made such a claim and several witnesses adjusted their stories in subsequent statements. As opposed to eyewitness accounts, McCulloch stressed the importance and reliability of physical evidence. "The most significant challenge encountered in this investigation has been the 24-hour news cycle and its insatiable appetite for something -- for anything -- to talk about, following closely behind with the non-stop rumors on social media," McCulloch said.
