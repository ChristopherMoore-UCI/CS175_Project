Increasingly, everywhere -- whether New York City, Venice, the Jersey Shore or Jamaica -- people who grow up adjacent to water, to idyllic views, lovely beaches, traditional architecture, can no longer afford to live there. Their homes, their neighborhoods are, in the modern economy, the harsh reality of present day, "undervalued." Traditional ways of life, like fishing, seem quaint anachronisms when the simple fact is that you can make a lot more money carrying a golf bag for a tourist, or making blender drinks at Margaritaville. I stayed behind that day, lounging about Goldeneye, Ian Fleming's former sanctum sanctorum, where he wrote all the Bond novels, getting familiar with the feeling of owning a grotto and drinking many excellent rum punches. I sent him and the crew to Margaritaville with every intention of depicting the place as a blight on paradise, but the boys apparently had a wonderful time. Thanks also to Chris Blackwell, owner of Goldeneye, creator of Island Records, legendary mentor to Bob Marley.
