"Through his associate, Ping bribed Andorran bank officials to accept cash deposits into less scrutinized accounts and transfer the funds to suspected shell companies in China," it said in a statement. Among them were more than a few "vory v zakone," the top echelon of Russian organized crime, according to Spanish officials. Spanish officials say some 20 suspect operations at the bank are being examined. BPA processed about $2 billion in transactions by shell companies related to the scheme. "This money-laundering network worked closely with high-ranking government officials in Venezuela, resident agents in Panama, and an Andorran lawyer to establish Panamanian shell companies," the Treasury said.
