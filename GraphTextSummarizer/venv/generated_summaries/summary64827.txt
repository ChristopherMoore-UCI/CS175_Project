The discoverers When the Nobel announcement came down, the Higgs boson's discoverers in Geneva, Switzerland, broke out the champagne, said lead physicist Joe Incandela. Certain particles will attract larger clusters of Higgs bosons, and the more of them a particle attracts, the greater its mass will be. The universe is filled with Higgs bosons. As atoms and parts of atoms zoom around, they interact with and attract Higgs bosons, which cluster around them in varying numbers. The Higgs boson, or the "God particle," which was discovered last year, garnered two physicists the Nobel Prize in physics on Tuesday, but it didn't go to the scientists who detected it.
