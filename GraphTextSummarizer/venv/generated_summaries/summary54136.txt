Murray, hired as Jackson's personal doctor while he rehearsed for his comeback concerts, admits he was giving Jackson propofol as a sleep aid, but Chernoff said the amount was much smaller than what was found in Jackson's body during the autopsy. "There is no way that Dr. Murray pumped Michael Jackson full of propofol sufficient for major surgery," Chernoff said. " Murray knew Jackson had trouble sleeping, but did not know he was using propofol as a sleep aid, Chernoff said. -- Michael Jackson's last physician, Dr. Conrad Murray, wasn't the one who gave the pop star a fatal overdose of propofol, according to Murray's attorney, hinting at the defense strategy in the involuntary manslaughter case against his client. By 10:40 a.m., after giving Jackson several other sleep aids, Murray said he gave Jackson 25 milligrams of propofol through an intravenous tube attached to Jackson's leg.
