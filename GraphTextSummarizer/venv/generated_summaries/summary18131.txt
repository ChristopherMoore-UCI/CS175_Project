We never really heard anything from her," neighbor Caitlyn Talbot told CNN affiliate WXYZ. Bouchard, the country sheriff, noted that her body was inside a closed vehicle inside a closed garage -- and, thus, not exposed to outside air or other factors that might contribute to decomposition. Never seen anything like this before," said Undersheriff Mike McCabe of Oakland County, just outside Detroit. And McCabe said  one of the neighbors cut the grass for years. Authorities told WXYZ that the house appears to have black mold inside, and that detectives entered the building Thursday wearing hazardous material suits.
