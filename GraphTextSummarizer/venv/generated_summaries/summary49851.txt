"Investigators continue to monitor the Internet to uncover other fundraising scams arising from this tragedy, and any individuals who attempt to profit through these schemes will be prosecuted," U.S. Attorney David B. Fein of Connecticut said in a statement. Alba is charged with one count of making false statements to federal agents. Right there," said CNN investigative producer David Fitzpatrick. The federal indictment accuses Nouel Alba of Bronx, New York, of using "her Facebook account, telephone calls and text messages to falsely claim to be an aunt of a shooting victim and supply fictitious details about the aftermath of the tragedy in order to solicit donations on the pretext that she was collecting on behalf of the family for the child's 'funeral fund,'" the U.S. Attorney's office in Connecticut said. Remembering the Sandy Hook shooting victims When the FBI agents investigating charity scams contacted Alba, she "falsely stated that she did not post information related to Newtown on her Facebook account, have contact with anyone about such postings, or recently access her PayPal account," the prosecutor's office said.
