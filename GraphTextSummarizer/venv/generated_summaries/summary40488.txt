A late goal from Arda Turan sealed victory for Spanish champions Atletico Madrid over Juventus. A double from Markus Rosenberg helped Malmo to a 2-0 victory over Greek club Olympiakos in Sweden, while French side Monaco and Zenit St Petersburg drew 0-0 in Russia. The other match in Group B saw English Premier League club Liverpool beaten 1-0 by FC Basel in Switzerland. The Bulgarian club, transformed by multi-millionaire businessman Kiril Domuschiev, stood a mere 13 minutes away from a draw with European champions Real Madrid. Just four minutes later Javier Hernandez -- on loan from English club Manchester United -- won a penalty but Ronaldo's effort was saved by Vladislav Stojanov.
