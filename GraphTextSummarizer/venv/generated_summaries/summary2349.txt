City defeated West Ham 2-0 at the City of Manchester Stadium Sunday putting them out of reach of second placed Liverpool who themselves defeated Newcastle United 2-1 at Anfield. Triumphant City fans invaded the pitch to congratulate their heroes at the final whistle, setting off flares and blue smoke bombs before clearing away so the trophy could be presented. Victory on the final day means they finish the season two points behind City in second place. We need to bounce back and try go one better (next year). Everton secured fifth position and a place in next season's Europa League with a 2-0 victory away to Hull City while Tottenham overcame Aston Villa 3-0 at White Hart Lane.
