According to ABC, in June doctors diagnosed Chavez with prostate cancer but said he could live for five years or more with treatment. Cancer has spread in Hugo Chavez's colon, spine and bones, and the Venezuelan president could have only nine months to live, Spain's ABC newspaper reported Monday, citing medical records provided by unidentified intelligence sources. The ABC newspaper report details what it says are doctors' differing estimates of Chavez's life expectancy during the course of his treatment. In June, Chavez said doctors in Cuba had removed a cancerous tumor from his body but did not specify what type of cancer it was. He announced in October that treatment had cured him of cancer, but the government has released few details about his health.
