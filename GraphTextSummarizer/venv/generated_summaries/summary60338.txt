The protesters railed against tough government actions against peaceful marchers and a failed assassination attempt on a senior opposition leader in Sanaa on Wednesday, witnesses said. Yemen's Republican Guards started shooting and fired tear gas at demonstrators after they refused to disperse and end a march, witnesses said. A child was killed and six other people were wounded on Thursday when security forces shot at protesters in Yemeni city of Taiz, a medical team said. Saleh is being treated in Saudi Arabia for wounds he received last month in a failed assassination attempt. The nation's president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, is the object of the protesters, who want him to leave his position.
