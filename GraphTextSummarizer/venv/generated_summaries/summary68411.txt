Beckham sustained the injury last month while playing on loan for Italian giants AC Milan, shattering his hopes of playing in a fourth consecutive World Cup finals for England. -- Los Angeles Galaxy midfielder David Beckham has revealed he is set to miss the entire Major League Soccer (MLS) season with the Achilles injury that ended his 2010 World Cup dream. "I won't be running for another three months so I won't be playing again until probably November," Beckham told American broadcaster ABC. While Beckham accepts his injury needs time to heal, he admitted there is a temptation to push along his recovery. The former England captain has said he will not be able to start running on his ankle for another three months, and is now targeting a November return.
