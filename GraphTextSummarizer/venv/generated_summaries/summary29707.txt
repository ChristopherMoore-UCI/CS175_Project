" A camera mounted to the officer's car showed the police officer -- identified by CNN affiliate WHIO as Officer Jonathan Seiter -- pulling over 64-year-old Otto Coleman on what appeared to be a routine traffic stop. For less than a minute, Pierce pounded Coleman repeatedly on his head to help subdue him until more help arrived. While the danger was real -- especially with the suspect in arm's reach of the officer's gun -- Pierce told HLN's Jane Velez-Mitchell that her thought process Saturday night was simple: The police officer needed help, and she was in a position to give it. Pierce said that police initially handcuffed her, before soon realizing her part in the battle and releasing her. "That could have been my father or grandfather," Pierce said of her decision to help Seiter.
