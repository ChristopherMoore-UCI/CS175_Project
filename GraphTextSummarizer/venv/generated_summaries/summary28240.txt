Lawler made his name in wrestling in the 1970s, but he became famous beyond the wrestling world for a 1982 bout with comedian Andy Kaufman. The Great Ruse: Andy Kaufman, the comedic genius who rocked wrestling Kaufman, who had begun wrestling women during his nightclub act, accepted a challenge from Lawler, who accused him of demeaning the sport. A few weeks later, the pair appeared on "Late Night with David Letterman" and got into an argument that ended with Lawler slapping Kaufman, followed by Kaufman delivering a profanity-laced tirade and being chased off the set. Lawler was inducted into the Connecticut-based WWE's Hall of Fame in 2007 and played himself in the 1999 Kaufman biopic "Man on the Moon." Kaufman trash-talked both the wrestler and the crowd in Memphis, Tennessee, before the match, and the 6-foot, 243-pound Lawler trounced the skinny comedian, who was hauled away in a stretcher.
