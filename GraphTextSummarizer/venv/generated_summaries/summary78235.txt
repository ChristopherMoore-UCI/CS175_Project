A second U.S. Navy destroyer was searching waters off Somalia for pirates who hijacked a Japanese-owned ship, military officials said. In May, a U.S. Navy advisory warned merchant ships to stay at least 200 miles off the Somali coast. In June, the ship USS Carter Hall fired warning shots in an attempt to stop a hijacked Danish cargo ship off Somalia, but the American vessel turned away when the pirated ship entered Somali waters. The USS James E. Williams ordered pirates to give up their weapons, the Navy says. Four other ships in the region remain in pirate hands, the Navy said.
