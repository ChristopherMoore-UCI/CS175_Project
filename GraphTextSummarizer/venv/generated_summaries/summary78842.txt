"The attack by insurgents in Kunduz was an attempt to intimidate Afghans and members of the international community trying to improve the lives of all Afghans," said NATO's International Security Assistance Force in a statement. The Taliban said the building was a base for U.S. Special Operations troops, which the U.S. military denied. DAI said four of the dead worked for its security subcontractor, Edinburgh International, and that several more EI staff were wounded as were two DAI staff members. -- New U.S. commander Gen. David Petraeus arrived in Afghanistan Friday, a day marred by violence in a part of the troubled nation that was relatively peaceful a year ago. The pre-dawn raid started when a suicide bomber on foot and another in a car detonated at the gate of the compound, said Mohammad Omar, the provincial governor.
