After that point, as word slowly spread, doctors began to quietly experiment with artificial insemination with donor sperm, working only with infertile heterosexual couples, turning to friends of the couple or -- once again -- their medical students. Until recently, families had to consist, at least at the outset, of a mommy and a daddy, each biologically necessary to bring children into being. They are children, hundreds of thousands of them, growing up in families no longer constrained by nature's original dictate. Opponents claim that children raised by same-sex parents are wounded in some fundamental way by being denied the "normal" benefits of having both a mother and father at home. But the first case of insemination with donor sperm happened in the 19th century, when a doctor in Philadelphia used sperm from one of his best-looking medical students to impregnate a supposedly infertile woman.
