It is the work of Dr. Jack Kevorkian, the man who bore the notorious nickname "Dr. Death." Kevorkian told CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta in 2010 that serving eight years in prison had not changed his view of assisted suicide. "Paralysis" is typical of the series of paintings that depict some aspect of disease and human suffering. Other paintings comment satirically on what Kevorkian viewed as the hypocrisy of the medical code of ethics. Most people though don't realize that Kevorkian was also a longtime painter.
