Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin signed a bill on Friday that would allow the state to perform executions with nitrogen gas if lethal injection is ruled unconstitutional or becomes unavailable. The governor's office said the first alternative for execution is lethal injection, followed by nitrogen gas, the electric chair and the firing squad. Last year, the state came under scrutiny when it took 43 minutes to kill convicted killer Clayton Lockett. Robert Dunham, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, told the Washington Post that the same "painless" argument had been used to advance the use of lethal injections. Oklahoma's executions have been put on hold while the U.S. Supreme Court reviews its use of lethal injections.
