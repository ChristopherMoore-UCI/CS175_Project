"Together with our team of experts, Terri's Network believes Jahi's case is representative of a very deep problem within the U.S. healthcare system -- particularly those issues surrounding the deaths of patients within the confines of hospital corporations, which have a vested financial interest in discontinuing life," the Terri Schiavo Life & Hope Network said in a statement. " Jahi's family said Tuesday that it had found a facility in New York willing to take her. "We have done everything to assist the family of Jahi McMath in their quest to take the deceased body of their daughter to another medical facility," hospital spokesman Sam Singer said. According to family members, Jahi went into cardiac arrest. " Family attorney Christopher Dolan had accused the hospital of being "hell-bent" on ending Jahi's life.
