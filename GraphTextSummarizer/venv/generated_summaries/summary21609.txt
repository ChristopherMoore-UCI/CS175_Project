Jennifer Carter told the station that restaurant workers already had turned off the appliances because people inside had smelled gas. Residents who live near JJ's said they reported smelling gas to the utility company about an hour before the explosion, according to CNN affiliate KCTV. The number of injured had dropped from previous reports because there was "a lot of confusion with people coming into the emergency room." Officials at three hospitals indicated at least 14 people were hospitalized, including three in critical condition and three in serious condition. Garrett said gas lines have been shut off.
