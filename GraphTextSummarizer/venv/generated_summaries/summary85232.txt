Peter Smerdon, chief spokesman for the World Food Program, the agency responsible for delivering aid to Somalia, would not comment on the U.S. funding controversy but said investigations into whether Al-Shabaab is assisted by U.N. aid assistance are "ongoing." Although one U.S. government source said aid continues to flow to Somalia and hasn't been suspended, another said aid might not reach "some parts of the country" because of Al-Shabaab, the al Qaeda-linked terror group that is trying to overthrow the government. The issue of breakdowns in humanitarian aid in Somalia has long concerned the United States. The U.S. government, concerned about the challenges in delivering assistance in a country wracked by civil war, says allegations that Al-Shabaab is stopping aid from reaching the people are under review. "According to humanitarian principles, we have to serve people and need to deal with those in charge," Gbeho said.
