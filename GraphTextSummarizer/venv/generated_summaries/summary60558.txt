(Full story) Black power: Of all the many occasions on which the Games have been used as a stage for political dissent, however, few, if any, were as powerful or eloquent as the moment at the 1968 Mexico City Olympics when Tommie Smith and John Carlos stood on the winner's podium and gave a Black Power salute in protest at continued racial oppression in their native United States. Owens at Berlin: In the history of the modern Olympics few, if any, performances have captured the popular imagination in quite the same way as that of American Jesse Owens at the 1936 Berlin Games. Few feats can compare with the record-shattering leap that won American Bob Beamon the long jump gold medal in Mexico City in 1968. But everyone watching the race went away speaking of American Mary Decker and South African Zola Budd. The fact that modern long distance running is so closely associated with athletes of east African origin is largely due to Abebe Bikila's pioneering success in Rome in 1960.
