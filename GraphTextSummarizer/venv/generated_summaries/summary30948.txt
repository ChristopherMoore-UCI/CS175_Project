I wrote articles and appeared on television and radio to promote human rights and non-violent struggle; I was invited to address Israeli audiences and receive Israeli citizens in Gaza itself. It was very normal to see tens of Israelis citizens walking freely along Gaza streets, shopping and making conversation. Twenty years ago, how to make peace with Israel was a daily topic for the Palestinian people. Both the Israeli and Palestinian governments might be able to reach a peace agreement, but achieving culture of peace remains distant. On the other side of the border, an influential Israeli camp was advocating making peace with the Palestinians.
