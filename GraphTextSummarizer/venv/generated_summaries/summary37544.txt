-- The Red River at Fargo, North Dakota, reached "major flood stage" early Wednesday as the National Guard and a small army of volunteers filled sandbags to keep the waters at bay. As of about 7 a.m. Wednesday (8 a.m. ET), the river stood at 30.34 feet, 12 feet above the flood stage of 18 feet and past major flood stage. "We know how difficult this is for our customers, and we appreciate their patience," said John Miksad of Con Edison. "We're making some good headway here," he said at midday Wednesday, as volunteers finished a sandbag dike. "God bless 'em for showing up, because without volunteer help, we'd never get this done," said Callies, 44, who owns a collection agency with his brother.
