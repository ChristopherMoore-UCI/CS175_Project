But knowing all the concerns and questions about safety aboard cruise ships, I'd want answers before I took a cruise. What we found will be unsettling for anyone who has taken or is thinking of taking a cruise: allegations of inadequate safety briefings and chaos in the minutes after the collision; a captain who failed to sound a general alarm for almost an hour, meaning vital, lifesaving assemblies at lifeboat stations did not take place; and a crew that felt unable to act without clear orders from their captain. Schettino is still awaiting trial on multiple charges of manslaughter, causing a shipwreck and abandoning ship. Concordia disaster focuses attention on how cruise industry operates Since the night the Concordia capsized January 13, CNN has continued to dig to figure out what happened aboard the ship and why. Costa is introducing new rules about safety briefings, mandatory additional life jackets and, crucially, new equipment is being introduced to accurately track all of Costa's ships and notify headquarters if the captain decides to take a detour.
