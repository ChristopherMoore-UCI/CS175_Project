"People have pointed to how there's too much academic pressure on adolescents in Japan which creates stress and leads to bullying in schools; other people talk about how Japanese cases of bullying can be group orientated," says Sachiko Horiguchi, an anthropologist at Tokyo's Temple University. The new anti-bullying task force will be responsible for identifying cases of serious bullying at an early stage and giving advice to education boards and schools, said Hirofumi Hirano, Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, at a press conference Tuesday. The case has prompted the government to set up a special team to help schools and board of education curb bullying. She is convinced bullying at school was one of the main reasons Yumi killed herself. The school also spoke to students, but school officials found no information that connected to her suicide, they said.
