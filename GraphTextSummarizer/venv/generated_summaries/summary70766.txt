Turn on HBO, listen to a black comic, and all you hear is n---, n----, n----." -- Talk radio host Dr. Laura Schlessinger has issued an apology for saying the N-word several times during an on-air conversation with a caller this week. I'll say it again -- that was wrong." Schlessinger was referring to a call she got on her show Tuesday from an African-American woman who said she was married to a white man and was getting fed up with her husband allowing his family and friends to say things that she felt were racist. iReporter: "Dr. Laura, thanks for opening the debate" The Rev. Al Sharpton decried the incident during an interview with "AC 360" on Thursday. Schlessinger and the caller began bickering back and forth toward the end of the call, and the caller said she was upset that the talk show host had used the word.
