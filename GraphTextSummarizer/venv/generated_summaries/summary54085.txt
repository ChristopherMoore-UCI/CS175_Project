-- British broadcaster Sky News Wednesday criticized the jail sentences given to three of its drivers in Zimbabwe, where a court found them guilty of possessing broadcast equipment without authorization. Zimbabwe "once had the highest literary rate in sub-Saharan Africa and a vibrant media system," Rhodes said, but since the elections, draconian press laws had increasingly limited the access to information. Press freedom groups say Zimbabwe has some of the world's most restrictive laws for journalist accreditation. There have been numerous media reports from Zimbabwe made without the government's authorization, prompting the arrests of several journalists. The accreditation law's Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act blocked some foreign media and shut down several independent newspapers during the 2002 elections.
