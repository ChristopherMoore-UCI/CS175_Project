DiMaggio's sister: Hannah Anderson was 'trouble' Few details had been released about the deaths of Christina and Ethan Anderson. In August, Christina Anderson, 42, and Ethan were killed by family friend James Lee DiMaggio, who then set fire to his house and kidnapped 16-year-old Hannah, authorities said. Those were some of the grisly details released this week by the San Diego Medical Examiner's office investigating the deaths connected to the Hannah Anderson kidnapping case, a case that captured the nation's interest last month. San Diego County deputies searching DiMaggio's charred home found a handwritten note, handcuff box, camping equipment, a DNA swab kit, two used condoms and letters from Hannah, according to an affidavit. This led to a multi-state manhunt that ended with the FBI shooting DiMaggio, 40, in the Idaho woods and Hannah's rescue.
