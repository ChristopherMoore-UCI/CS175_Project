-- The trial of a soldier accused of killing Afghan citizens for sport is scheduled to begin Wednesday at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington. Authorities allege Gibbs kept finger bones, leg bones and a tooth from Afghan corpses. In all, officials charged 12 U.S. soldiers in what they called a conspiracy to kill Afghan civilians and cover it up, along with charges they mutilated corpses and kept grisly souvenirs. Several soldiers are charged with taking pictures of the corpses, and one soldier is charged with stabbing a corpse. Both are part of a larger case that involves several other soldiers, all accused of similar killings.
