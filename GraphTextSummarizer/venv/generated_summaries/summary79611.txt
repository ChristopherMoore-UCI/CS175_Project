Sixth seed Tsonga was in irresistible form on Tuesday as he atoned for the intense disappointment of his quarterfinal exit against Novak Djokovic last year, when he lost despite creating four match points. " Tsonga -- who lost his only grand slam final to Novak Djokovic at the 2008 Australian Open -- has triumphed in only one of his three meetings against Ferrer, when defeating the Spaniard at Wimbledon in 2011. The 28-year-old must now beat Spanish fourth seed David Ferrer, who saw off compatriot Tommy Robredo in a 6-2 6-1 6-1 win, in the semifinal if he is to replicate Yannick Noah's 1983 triumph. Ferrer made light work of beating Robredo as he reached the semifinals at Roland Garros for the second year in succession, the key difference being that -- like Tsonga -- he has not dropped a set this time around. Novak Djokovic takes on Tommy Haas while Rafael Nadal will try to continue his domination of Paris when facing Switzerland's Stanislas Wawrinka.
