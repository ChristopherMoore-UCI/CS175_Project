Avri Roel Downey joined the party @ 3:22 a.m. on November 4th," Downey said in his Facebook post. "After 9 months of intensive development, Team Downey is pleased to announce our 2014 fall/winter project," Downey shared on Facebook. The 49-year-old actor and his wife, Susan, welcomed their second child together on November 4, and "Avengers" star Downey is positively giddy about his new baby girl. " Downey is also dad to son Exton, whom he welcomed with Susan in 2012, and 21-year-old Indio, his son from a prior marriage. He's promised he'll "post pics here + there when I'm not too busy staring ..." The actor isn't the only celebrity who had a reason to celebrate on November 4: Kelly Rowland, too, is now a proud parent.
