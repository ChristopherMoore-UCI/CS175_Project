She became the second person known to have contracted Ebola in the United States, and the second nurse from Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas to get the virus after caring for an Ebola patient. Several days later, Vinson was diagnosed with Ebola after returning to Dallas from a trip to visit family in Ohio, where she was planning her wedding. Learning that her colleague, nurse Nina Pham, had contracted Ebola was a shock, Vinson said. Going forward, Vinson said it's clear that more planning is necessary for U.S. hospitals to better handle Ebola. Vinson, who was declared Ebola-free last week after treatment at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, spoke with CNN's Don Lemon in an exclusive interview that aired Thursday.
