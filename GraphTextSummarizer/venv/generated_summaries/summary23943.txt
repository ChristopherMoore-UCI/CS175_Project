Michael Wolfe says new media give voice to Muslims who weren't fully recognized by mainstream media. The entries provide a fascinating snapshot of what ordinary American Muslims think about the present state of their community, from the grand-prize-winning "Arab in America" -- a spoof about the challenges of finding a job and blending in -- to the youth-category winner "Green Blue Sea," about a young scuba diver's reverence for the natural world. For the first time, ordinary Muslims can speak directly to their non-Muslim neighbors -- and share their views on just about anything -- without the mainstream media as intermediaries selecting their talking heads, pundits and experts. The ultimate impact this will have on society at large remains to be seen, but with many ordinary Muslims finally speaking for themselves, and people of other faiths taking part in the conversation, the future is looking brighter. For those, like American Muslims, who have often found themselves left out of mainstream media discourse, the possibilities are now vastly improved.
