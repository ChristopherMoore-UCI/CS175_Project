But as CNN first reported in 2007, the units -- built originally as campers -- led to widespread complaints that high levels of formaldehyde were causing respiratory ailments and irritation for those living in them. -- Companies that made and set up trailers used as emergency housing after Hurricane Katrina have agreed to a nearly $43 million settlement with people who say they were hurt by formaldehyde in the units. More than $37 million of the settlement will come from seven companies that made travel trailers that the Federal Emergency Management Agency deployed across the hurricane-stricken Gulf Coast after Katrina, Meunier said. The settlement has been submitted to a federal judge in New Orleans, said Gerald Meunier, a lawyer for plaintiffs in the class-action lawsuit. The remainder of the settlement will come from contractors who installed the units, Meunier said.
