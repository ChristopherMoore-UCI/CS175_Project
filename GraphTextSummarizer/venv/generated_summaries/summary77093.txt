Tompkins said viewership of Web video was high Tuesday partly because it was available on so many sites -- and because many workers were trapped at their desks during the inauguration. Although the inauguration set records for Web video, it's unclear exactly how the ceremony ranked against other news events in terms of total hits online. If anything, he said, the trouble with streaming video should show companies there's great consumer demand for video online. -- With many workers stuck at their desks during the late-morning swearing-in of President Obama on Tuesday, more people than ever went online to watch live video of the historic inauguration. "Just as massive crowds filled the National Mall in Washington, millions of users flocked to online video feeds," James M. Klatell wrote in a CBSNews.com blog entry Tuesday.
