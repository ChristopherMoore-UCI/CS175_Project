"DMX has promised to 'beat his ass,' but no contract or paperwork has been signed or agreed to yet," DMX spokesman Domenick Nati told CNN Wednesday. "They should send Floyd Mayweather to the ring and tell George Zimmerman it's DMX," he tweeted. He said last week that he was accepting offers for someone to step into the ring for a three-round, pay-per-view fight with Zimmerman. Not only will he break every rule in boxing,  he said, he'll "beat the living (expletive)" out of Zimmerman. Although no contract has been signed, a promoter is negotiating with rapper DMX to fight him, according to the promoter and a rep for DMX.
