Duvall was a member of the Assembly's Utilities and Commerce Committee and the Rules Committee, according to Assembly Speaker Karen Bass. Assemblyman Mike Duvall said he was resigning so his actions didn't remain a distraction for colleagues. "I am deeply saddened that my inappropriate comments have become a major distraction for my colleagues in the Assembly, who are working hard on the very serious problems facing our state," Duvall said in a statement on his Web site that had been set up for his 2010 run for the Assembly. According to the California State Assembly Web site, Duvall served two terms as an assemblyman, beginning in 2006. Former Republican Assemblyman Mike Duvall was at an appropriations committee meeting in July when a microphone picked up his licentious conversation.
