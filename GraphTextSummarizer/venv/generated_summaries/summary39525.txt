-- Hundreds of South Koreas were left in limbo after North Korea shut its borders Monday at the start of joint military exercises between the United States and South Korea. When Pyongyang took the action, 573 South Koreans were staying at the Kaesong industrial complex, north of the demilitarized zone, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported. "We emphasize that currently the first priority is the safety of our citizens." Eighty South Koreans had applied to cross the border into South Korea on Monday, Kim said, but had not been cleared to do so. North Korea said the military phone lines with the South, the last remaining communications channel, will remain closed until the 12-day military exercises end on March 20, according to Yonhap. North Korea's bellicose announcement came on the first day of annual joint military drills between South Korea and the United States.
