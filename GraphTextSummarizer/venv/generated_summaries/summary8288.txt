Complete coverage of Ferguson shooting and protests Read more about the flash point in the Heartland at CNN.com/US How it was received: Despite Shabazz' efforts on behalf of Ferguson protesters, he has a very controversial past. Under Holder, the Justice Department has intensified its scrutiny of police departments, launching 20 investigations of police practices and alleged discriminatory enforcement patterns in the past five years. How it was received: His low profile may be helping him to avert criticism over actions taken since Brown's shooting, but Knowles has been in the line of fire with other officials over the disproportionate number of white officers on the police force of his majority African-American town. Critics denounced the delay as a PR stumble that coincided with another one -- the release of a video that police said showed Brown robbing a store minutes before he was shot.
