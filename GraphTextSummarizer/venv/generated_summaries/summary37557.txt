Local activists have demonstrated for months, protesting not only the Boyd shooting, but other shootings by city police officers since 2010. Officers fired a shotgun and nonlethal beanbag pellets at Boyd, while other officers were caught on camera throwing flash-bang grenades. Keith Sandy and Dominique Perez were ordered to appear at a preliminary hearing, the date of which has not yet been set, said District Attorney Kari Brandenburg of New Mexico's Second Judicial Circuit. Helmet and body cameras worn by dozens of city police who converged on the campsite showed Boyd with two small camping knives in his hands. Two Albuquerque, New Mexico, police officers will face first-degree murder charges in last year's shooting of a homeless man in the hills above the city, a prosecutor announced Monday.
