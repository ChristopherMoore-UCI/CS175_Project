" Love and his colleague Steve Bowen, who between them have clocked up more than 62 hours on real spacewalks, took a dip in the swimming pool at NASA's Johnson Space Center last week to practice climbing out of a mockup of the Orion spacecraft onto a fake asteroid. But NASA says it's working on plans to send astronauts into space to land on an asteroid. " Astronomers find first asteroid with rings Study: Solar system full of 'rogue' asteroids "We're working on the techniques and tools we might use someday to explore a small asteroid that was captured from an orbit around the sun and brought back by a robotic spacecraft to orbit around the moon," said Stan Love, one of the astronauts participating in the tests. Astronauts would then travel on the Orion spacecraft to explore the asteroid and collect samples.
