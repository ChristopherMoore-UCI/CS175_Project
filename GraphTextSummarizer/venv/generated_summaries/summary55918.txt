However, once I stepped into Kurt's archive, I discovered over 200 hours of unreleased music and audio, a vast array of art projects (oil paintings, sculptures), countless hours of never-before-seen home movies, and over 4000 pages of writings that together help paint an intimate portrait of an artist who rarely revealed himself to the media. Written, directed and produced by filmmaker Brett Morgen, "Montage of Heck" will be released by HBO in 2015. Speaking of the project to NME in 2013, Morgen said he envisioned "Montage of Heck" being like "this generation's 'The Wall' -- a mix of animation and live action that'll allow the audience to experience Kurt in a way they never have before." Called "Kurt Cobain: Montage of Heck," the documentary is the first to have the backing of Cobain's relatives. "Montage of Heck" will of course use plenty of the band's work throughout the film, including both songs and performances.
