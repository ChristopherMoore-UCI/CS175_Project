As I outlined in my November 2011 speech in Osawatomie, Kansas, we can put more people to work in jobs funded by government contracts, where government can ensure high wages and benefits. Vote for me, and government benefits and government employment will compensate for the wage increases the private job market does not deliver. They should be rebuilding our roads and our bridges, laying down faster railroads and broadband, modernizing our schools -- all the things other countries are already doing to attract good jobs and businesses to their shores. "Yes, business, and not government, will always be the primary generator of good jobs with incomes that lift people into the middle class and keep them there. But today that worker has a safer car, a bigger house, and smarter appliances.
