Abdullah, who won an award for his work during the exchange, and his colleagues were on board Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 when it disappeared somewhere over the Malacca Strait early in the morning of March 8. It was on March 2 that Abdullah flew to Malaysia. When news of the flight's disappearance broke over two weeks ago, Chinese media initially blurred Abdullah's name from the passenger manifest, fearing that a Uyghur separatist attack was to blame for the flight's disappearance. In many ways -- more than just distance, at least -- it is a long way from the remote city of Kashgar in the restive northwest Chinese province of Xinjiang to Kuala Lumpur, the bustling, teeming capital of Malaysia. Prior to taking the position in Kashgar, Abdullah studied in Beijing for a year at the Chinese Academy of Oil Painting.
