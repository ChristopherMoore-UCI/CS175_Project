For example, instead of just 10 episodes a season, Martin told The New York Times he wishes HBO would grant "Game of Thrones" 13, so that "we could include smaller scenes that we had to cut, scenes that make the story deeper and richer." Goldblatt, a Facebook employee, is one of the generous contributors to Martin's recently announced charity auction benefiting the Wild Wolf Sanctuary and the Food Depot of Santa Fe in New Mexico. -- "Game of Thrones" fan Dave Goldblatt is preparing to die -- and by the pen of George R.R. Martin no less. As it is, the highly acclaimed "Game of Thrones" draws an average of 18.4 million viewers per episode -- and that's even with gruesome scenes such as a recent death by exploding head. And for a contribution of $20,000, Martin offered to create a character in honor of the donor and put him or her in an upcoming "Song of Ice and Fire" installment, with a bonus of the character meeting one of Martin's famously ghastly deaths.
