The pressure is on Paul Ryan on Wednesday night to do even more than Ann Romney. It is true, as analysts like Ezra Klein have written, that Ryan hasn't provided a big lift in national polls, but he has brought a new vitality -- not only to the party (just wait for the hall to erupt Wednesday night when he is introduced) but to Romney himself. While some offer dissent, there is general agreement across the political spectrum that Ann Romney stole the show on opening night. Those in the hall will want red meat, far more than they got from Chris Christie on Tuesday night, but many in his television audience will be deciding whether they want him at the center of national power -- and only a heartbeat from the presidency. Opinion: Ann Romney did great, but won't move needle What must Paul Ryan deliver?
