" Rosberg, who failed to repeat his performance in last week's Bahrain Grand Prix, finishing fifth, will be joined on the track by fellow Mercedes driver Michael Schumacher. "I am absolutely delighted to be returning to Hockenheim as a Grand Prix winner," he said on the Mercedes F1 website. Rosberg's career-first F1 win at this month's China Grand Prix is Mercedes' first victory since Fangio in Italy in 1955. Now a new generation of Mercedes stars will be paying homage to the racy little number -- and its most famous driver -- ahead of the DTM season opener this weekend. -- It's no wonder the illustrious Silver Arrow has a special place in the Mercedes team's hearts.
