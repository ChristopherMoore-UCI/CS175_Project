By the way, Iowa women: Is this enough to motivate you to get some women on your Supreme Court? Otherwise, all kinds of firings may arise that use this excuse to get rid of women employees. Let's be real honest here: If the only way this man and woman could protect their marriage is to remove an attractive woman from their midst, then I'd say this marriage has a lot more problems than just an attractive dental assistant. But the court said firing an employee for being too attractive, despite no inappropriate behavior on her part, is not sex discrimination because gender is not the issue. The guys saw the issue, at least in part, as protecting the institution of marriage rather than an infringement on a woman's right to work.
