"There is a very important difference between honor killing and violence against women in the form of domestic violence. " "The apparent reason behind these cold-blooded shameful murders was that the four completely innocent victims offended your twisted notion of honor, a notion of honor that is founded upon the domination and control of women, a sick notion of honor that has absolutely no place in any civilized society." -- Three members of an Afghan immigrant family, who were found guilty of murder in what the judge called "a completely twisted concept of honor," intend to appeal their convictions. But the jury also heard from an expert witness on honor murders -- a term CNN is using in the interest of clarity rather than the more common "honor killings" because the latter phrase does not properly describe the alleged crime. And the purification is through blood." Sometimes, such murders occur with the "buy-in" of women in the family, said Irshad Manji, director of the Moral Courage Project at New York University, who also authored the book "Allah, Liberty and Love."
