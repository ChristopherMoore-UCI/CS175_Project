Army machine gunner Colby Buzzell posted unfiltered blog entries from Iraq about his combat experiences. But beyond that, soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan are encouraged to blog about military life, said Army Public Affairs Spc. When U.S. Army machine gunner Colby Buzzell began blogging about his combat experiences from a military base in Mosul, Iraq, he wasn't looking for attention or trouble. In the first major war of the Internet age, Buzzell and other soldier bloggers in Iraq offered readers around the world unfiltered, real-time glimpses of an ongoing conflict. Buzzell's Iraq blog lasted just 10 weeks, but it helped pave the way for others to follow.
