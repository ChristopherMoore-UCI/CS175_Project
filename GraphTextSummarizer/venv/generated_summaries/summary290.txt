Foreclosures happen for many reasons, some of which are beyond the borrower's control: • Economic hardship related to job loss, reduced hours at work, medical issues or divorce; • Unaffordable payments when a loan resets to a higher annual percentage rate; • Buying a house that was more costly than the borrower's income could reasonably support long-term, and • Increased cost of living, which places more demands on consumers' budgets, forcing them to make hard choices about which debts to pay. As I write this, it seems as though new proposals to help consumers avoid foreclosure appear daily. Delinquent homeowners likely will receive a Notice to Cure Default that lists HUD housing counselors they can contact, as well as hardship program options. In other words, let's begin living the true American dream, one of financial responsibility that is celebrated by all. Gail Cunningham says foreclosure is more than a financial failure, it's an emotional ordeal.
