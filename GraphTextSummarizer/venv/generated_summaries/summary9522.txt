The U.S. will keep a larger force in Afghanistan for the first few months of 2015 than it initially planned to, outgoing U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said on Saturday. The drawdown of U.S. forces in Afghanistan will be "gradual" compared with the withdrawal of troops from Iraq, the first official said. He said that President Barack Obama authorized the change in force size in order to provide military commanders "flexibility." "The President's authorization will not change -- it will not change our troops' missions or the long-term timeline for our withdrawal," Hagel said. The decision is due to the late signing of the Bilateral Security Agreement, which allows a specified amount of U.S. troops to remain in Afghanistan after the combat mission ends this year. Hagel arrived in Afghanistan on Saturday in order to assess the nation as the United States begins the drawdown of its forces in the New Year, he said.
