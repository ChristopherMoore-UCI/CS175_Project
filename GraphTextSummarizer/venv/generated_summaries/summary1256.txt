According to a biography culled together by the University of Southern California, Vasquez was "probably the most notorious bandit California ever saw. -- Tiburcio Vasquez, a 19th century outlaw, is remembered in historical accounts as a notorious criminal who terrorized southern California. "We see him as a fighter for social justice of the Mexican-Californio whose rights have been deprived." Estrada said he believes that Vasquez was falsely accused of murder. An account of Vasquez's life, written in 1948 by the Historical Society of Southern California, also hints at a more noble side of the bandit. He and his gang went into hiding in the canyons of Southern California after a "string of infamous robberies and murders" in 1873, the biography says.
