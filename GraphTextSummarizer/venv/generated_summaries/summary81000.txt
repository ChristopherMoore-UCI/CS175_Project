Italian inventor Lucien Gambarota, who designed California Fitness's method of storing energy and using it to power lights and music in the gym, told CNN the concept is straightforward. "The project (dance floor) in itself doesn't save a lot of energy. "One of the oldest types of energy used by people is muscular energy -- so this is nothing new." The general concept is known as energy harvesting, which simply refers to the gathering of energy from one source and applying it to power an object. A second method using wheels to generate energy under a slightly moving floor will be used at the soon-to-be-opened Club Watt.
