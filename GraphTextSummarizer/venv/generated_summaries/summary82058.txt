Tamerlan Tsarnaev, the big brother of accused bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, filed that request with U.S. immigration on January 23, 2013, as part of his application to become a naturalized U.S. citizen. The year before the April 15, 2013, bombing, Tamerlan Tsarnaev traveled to the restive Dagestan region, hoping to meet with Canadian boxer-turned-jihadist William Plotnikov. A few months before the Boston bombings, the suspected mastermind of the terror attack, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, wanted to change his name, a U.S. government official told CNN Wednesday. Russian troops killed Plotnikov in July 2012 while Tsarnaev was in the region. Tsarnaev flew out of Dagestan two days after Plotnikov was killed and investigators have been looking into whether Tsarnaev left because of Plotnikov's death, according to another source briefed on the investigation.
