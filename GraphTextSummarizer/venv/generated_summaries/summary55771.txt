I come from Lebanon, a country that has seen more than its share of conflict and war, but it is also a country that embraces life and peace. But in Lebanon, we have seen how sports, and especially running, can have a positive impact on individuals and ultimately on communities and countries. We ran for peace through a government shutdown, protesters' barricades in the city, an Israeli offensive on the country, and internal armed conflicts. Many troubles have plagued Lebanon over the past 11 years of our work, but on Marathon day we always managed to bring people together in spite of their differences. This year the slogan of our Banque du Liban Beirut Marathon, which will take place on November 10, is "Run for Lebanon."
