The violin's owner, acclaimed violinist Min Jin Kym, noticed her case containing the violin and bows was missing and called police. "We're delighted to have recovered the violin after a long and very complex investigation," said Detective Chief Inspector Simon Taylor, who led the hunt. Stradivarius violins were made by the world's most celebrated violin maker, Antonio Stradivari, in the 1600s. He said members of other police forces, an insurance company, and antique dealers helped with the investigation. It is thought that from 1666, the Cremona, Italy-born Stradivari made 1,116 instruments, of which more than 600 are still in existence, including violas, cellos, mandolins and guitars.
