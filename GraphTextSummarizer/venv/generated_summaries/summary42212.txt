Using classified and commercial satellite imagery, the United States estimates there are up to 40,000 Russian troops on the border with eastern Ukraine. Kerry: 'Contrived pretext' for intervention U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry discussed the situation in eastern Ukraine twice on the phone Wednesday with his Russian counterpart, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. Meanwhile, the separatist protests in eastern Ukraine have entered their fourth day. The two officials talked about "the importance of resolving the security situation in key cities in eastern Ukraine peacefully and through dialogue, and they both rejected the use of force to obtain political objectives," State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said.
