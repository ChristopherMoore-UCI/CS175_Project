The Nuremberg trials after World War II maintained this focus, attending most to the Nazis' aggressive crimes against peace -- bringing war to the world like the Kaiser had before them -- than atrocities in general or crimes against humanity in particular. Yet on another level, the years since Abu Ghraib have marked a radical new stage, because of how central law has been to our debates about war: In fact, over the 20th century, the world took real strides towards the goal of "humanizing war," though perhaps only because the century also made war itself so much worse. -- The guns of August 1914 unleashed a debate that is still with us: Can the laws of war actually impose limits on how war is carried out? It is about a legacy we have lost, rather than one we have realized: that of aiming, through the laws of war, to bring war itself to an end.
