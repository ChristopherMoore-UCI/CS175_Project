The photographs of Prince William and Kate Middleton, facing the flashing cameras of the world's press, were uncannily like those of William's parents, the Prince of Wales and Lady Diana Spencer, when they announced their plans to marry in 1981. The nation fell in love with Diana, and the nation has once again fallen in love with the woman who wears her ring. The press may not have been tamed but they have certainly been given boundaries that never existed in Diana's day. Once the press identified Diana Spencer as a possible candidate, they hounded her mercilessly until Charles was told by his father that he must make his mind up and either marry this girl or let her go. When asked on the day of their engagement whether they were in love, the Prince of Wales famously replied, "Whatever love is."
