This is a day where people are getting together to celebrate a holiday," Lt. Gov. Bob Duffy told reporters in Webster. After his 1981 manslaughter conviction, Spengler was given an indeterminate sentence, said Monroe County District Attorney Sandra Doorley. By then, Spengler was living in a home in Webster, likely with his sister, who was still unaccounted for Monday afternoon. Through 2006, Spengler was on supervised parole, during which time Doorley said she wasn't aware of any events suggesting he had gotten into further trouble. That's when and where, Police Chief Gerald Pickering said, Spengler presumably set his and his sister's home ablaze, lugged weapons up a hill, then waited.
