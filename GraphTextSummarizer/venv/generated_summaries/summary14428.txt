Koukliati is in South Africa as part of an initiative by the education ministry in her country to teach the Greek language to expats living abroad. For a woman whose country is on the brink of financial collapse, Greek teacher Julie Koukliati is surprisingly cheerful. Koukliati is quick to add, however, that many of her friends and family are inquiring about South Africa, where three weeks ago she started a new job teaching Greek at a private school in the city of Pretoria. South Africa has its own unemployment problems, but a deficit in specialized skills could see the once dwindling Greek community burgeon again. When asked how she feels about the fact Greek teachers are losing their jobs back home while she is paid to teach foreigners, Koukliati insists she's still serving her country.
