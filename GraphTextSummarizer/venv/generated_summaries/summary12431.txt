Pyongyang has stepped up its rhetoric against South Korea's President Lee Myung-bak and his government since Kim Jong Un took over as North Korean leader last December after the death of his father, longtime leader Kim Jong Il. The footage and fresh threats against South Korea come just one week after the United States and North Korea agreed on a nuclear deal after years of deadlock. North Korea shelled Yeonpyeong Island in November 2010, killing four South Koreans, claiming it was responding to a South Korean military drill in the area. The United States and South Korea are currently carrying out annual joint military drills, which North Korea has condemned as a provocation. The United States has long said improved inter-Korean relations are crucial for success in nuclear talks, but the recent increase in rhetoric against South Korea and its president make that appear unlikely in the short term. -- New video broadcast on North Korean television shows a military unit carrying out live-fire drills in sight of a South Korean island.
