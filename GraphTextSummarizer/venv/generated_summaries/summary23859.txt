Tallahassee Police encountered Brendon, 43, at a hotel "in a state of confusion" with toothpaste on his face, rips in his clothes and pants wet from an overflowing toilet he allegedly caused, according to a police report. Nicholas Brendon, the actor who played Buffy's sidekick Xander on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer," was arrested Friday on a charge of criminal mischief and property damage in Tallahassee, Florida. Hotel management asked to press charges, the report said, noting that Brendon was cooperative as he was placed under arrest. This goes beyond a few months in a rehabilitation center, or a quick dose of anti-depressants: Nicholas' struggle will go on for years, but he has a strong support system behind him that will guide him through the uphill battle that is chronic depression. Brendon was arrested under similar circumstances in October and February.
