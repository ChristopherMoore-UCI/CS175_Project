'Mama Wu' inspires other Chinese parents of gay children "In China, we consider carrying on the family line of paramount importance, but we don't value the happiness of individuals," said Li Yinhe, a sociologist with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. While society at large has loosened up on homosexuality, Li said, family pressure on gay people remains strong because of deep-rooted Confucian ideas and the government's one-child policy - making Wu's words and actions all the more powerful. Now, gay community activists say a small but growing number of young gay men in big cities are tying the knot with lesbians to both placate families and maintain their lifestyles. "I didn't have too much of a struggle about my sexuality." Wu now devotes her time and energy to speaking up for gay acceptance by family and society. "We have to give them hope," Wu said, quoting iconic gay American politician Harvey Milk.
