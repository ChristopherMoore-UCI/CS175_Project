Having three leaders -- of Jordan, Israel and Palestine -- on at the same time had worldwide relevance. PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat, King Hussein of Jordan and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. Just getting to go there two weeks later, to walk among the rubble, to interview firemen and policemen, the first responders, to go to the burn center at the hospital, to see what happened up close -- it was living history. So all things considered, I chose this for its impact and importance -- it had the largest viewership in cable history at the time. It was the worst thing to ever happen to the United States in modern history.
