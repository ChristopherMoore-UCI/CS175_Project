"Maybe she knows somebody who can help out," Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Stephanie Sautner said, warning Lohan she had 21 days to sign up for counseling. Lohan tested positive for alcohol use, a violation of probation rules, in February, the report said. Lohan entered drug rehab last year to avoid a jail sentence imposed by another judge. While Lohan is in compliance with her community service, fines and shoplifting counseling requirements, but she has not signed up for the court-ordered psychological counseling, the judge said. Group counseling, which probationers attend, is often free or low-cost, but Judge Sautner agreed with Lohan's lawyer, Shawn Holley, that Lohan's celebrity status makes that unworkable.
