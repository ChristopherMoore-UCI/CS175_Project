The New York Times this week quoted an MIT economist, Michael Greenstone: "I think the greatest, most astonishing fact that I am aware of in social science right now is that women have been able to hear the labor market screaming out 'You need more education' and have been able to respond to that, and men have not. As men (on average) finish less education, as male wages (on average) decline, men become less attractive as marital partners. The core of the problem seems to be the decline of male wages relative to female wages. It's important to note that men in full-time work continue to earn more than women in full-time work. On average, however, children born to married mothers and fathers are more likely to finish college, more likely to avoid prison and more likely to form marriages themselves than children born to single parents.
