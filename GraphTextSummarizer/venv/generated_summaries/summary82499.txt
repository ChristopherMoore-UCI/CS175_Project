The weekend's other wide release, Warner Bros' creepy "Orphan" -- starring Peter Sarsgaard and Vera Farmiga -- pulled in $12.8 million from an audience that was 55 percent female. "The Ugly Truth," a raunchy R-rated rom-com that pits Katherine Heigl and Gerard Butler in a battle of the sexes, scored an impressive $27 million bow, a career best for both Heigl and director Robert Luketic ("Legally Blonde"). The quirky rom-com posted a hefty $19,176 per-site average and a 95 percent increase over its debut last weekend. Neither the magic of Harry Potter nor the combined star power of Katherine Heigl and Gerard Butler was enough to keep a crew of wise-cracking guinea pigs from scurrying to the top of the box office this weekend.
