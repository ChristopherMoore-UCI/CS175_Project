"We've got people still evacuated only because we expect those thunderstorms, those high-intensity, short duration type of rainstorms," Glendora Police Chief Timothy Staab told CNN affiliate KCAL Saturday night. Mandatory evacuation orders Severe rain that soaked much of southern California has subsided in many Los Angeles suburbs, though residents of at least two communities remained under mandatory evacuation orders. Authorities lifted a mandatory evacuation order for Monrovia early Sunday, but others remained in effect for Glendora and Azusa, CNN affiliate KTLA reported. "The Ventura County sheriff's helicopter was able to break through the weather system, and has successfully hoisted all four of them out," Mike Parker, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, told CNN's "New Day Sunday. The only lighting that we had was our rescuers with flashlights on their helmets and the ones that they were holding," Parker said.
