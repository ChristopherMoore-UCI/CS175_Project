A study released last week suggests that almost half of children who have food allergies have been bullied -- sometimes by having food thrown at them. At Owen's new school, there is a special table where children with common allergies can -- in theory -- sit together for lunch, isolated from kids who bring food that would be unsafe for the allergic group. In kindergarten, Owen Kellogg came home sobbing one day because another boy at school had told him that he had a peanut, and that he was going to force Owen to eat it. "Immediately, when there's a diagnosis of food allergy, there's a little bit of a stigma." The new study furthers the mounting evidence that many kids with food allergies may endure social ostracism while also trying to eat safely.
