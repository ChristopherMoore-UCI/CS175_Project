Barcelona star Samuel Eto'o is one of a number of top footballers who have spoken out against racism. Memorably, Eto'o started to walk off the pitch in protest during a match at Real Zaragoza in 2006 after being taunted by home supporters chanting monkey noises only to be persuaded to return by his Barcelona teammates and the club's coach, Frank Rijkaard. " With black players regularly subjected to monkey chants in Spanish stadiums, Eto'o believes determined action is needed before verbal abuse spills over into physical violence. Eto'o admits that racism is so widespread in Spain that he no longer dares take his family to matches. Real Zaragoza were fined just 9,000 euros ($13,800) for the abuse directed by their supporters at Eto'o.
