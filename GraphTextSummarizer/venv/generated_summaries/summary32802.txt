Search and rescue teams are combing through Passaic County, evacuating residents who are still stuck inside their flood-ravaged homes in the wake of Hurricane Irene, said Edward O'Connell, a spokesman for the county's Office of Emergency Management. About 1,700 residents have been evacuated from their homes in Wayne, Towa, Little Falls, Paterson and Woodland Park communities, said O'Connell. Evacuees are being transferred to several area shelters or taken to the homes of family members living on higher ground. "They are expecting it to crest sometime today and the other rivers will be rising a little bit as well," O'Connell said. Alex Popov of the Paterson, New Jersey, Police Department.
