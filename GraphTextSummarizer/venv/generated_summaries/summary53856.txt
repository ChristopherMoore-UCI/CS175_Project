Even though they've managed to lose a substantial amount of weight -- Lauren went from a size 32 dress to a size 12, and Justin went from size 58 pants to a size 36 -- the couple struggles with the psychological side effects of such a massive physical change. Justin and Lauren started their new exercise routine by doing simple activities such as walking around the park and swimming. Two years earlier, Justin's wife, Lauren Shelton, had had her own medical scare; her gallbladder had to be removed because of weight-related complications.

Both Lauren and Justin had been asked not to get on rides at a theme park because of their size.
