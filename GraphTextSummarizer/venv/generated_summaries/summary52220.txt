" OPINION: Make Olympics in Russia "the gayest ever" Moscow, a city of more than 11 million people, has only a handful of gay night clubs, none of which would allow CNN's cameras inside. The gay rights group, All Out, has delivered a petition with hundreds of thousands of signatures denouncing Russia's stance on gay rights. International rights groups have called the legislation highly discriminatory, as anti-gay attacks are on the rise in Russia and are sometimes perpetrated by the police themselves. Because people will say that it's gays who sabotaged and boycotted the Olympics and people will just burn us with our hearts. It bars discussion of gay rights and relationships within earshot of children.
