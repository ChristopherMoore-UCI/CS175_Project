Jaycee Lee Dugard was kidnapped in 1991 from a bus stop near her home in South Lake Tahoe, California, and discovered last week. " Tina Dugard said Jaycee's mother's smile is "as wide as the sea." "Her oldest daughter is finally home," she said. Police said Thursday that the man charged with abducting and raping Jaycee Lee Dugard had been accused of raping a 14-year-old in 1972, but those charges were dropped for unknown reasons. Tina Dugard speaks to the media Thursday about how her niece Jaycee is reconnecting with her family.
