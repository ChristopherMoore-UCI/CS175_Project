Two Road to Hope members found a radio and sent a mayday message, Hyda said, and soon thereafter they saw military jets flying around the ship. Our priority remains that there be a safe resolution to this incident." Greece's Foreign Ministry said Thursday that the ship -- sailing under a Maltese flag -- is heading toward the Greek island of Crete but was still in international waters. Road to Hope's Facebook page stated that four Libyan naval vessels and two fighter jets had surrounded the ship, before it headed into international waters. In a release, fellow Road to Hope official Ellie Merton wrote that all 10 had used mobile phones to contact friends and family. As many as seven Libyans, including customs inspects and border police, were also being held on the ship, according to Road to Hope.
