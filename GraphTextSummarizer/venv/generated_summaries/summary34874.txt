Meanwhile, London-based Tibetan advocacy group, Free Tibet, has claimed a Tibetan Monk was shot in the head, while at least six others received gunshot wounds, when Chinese security forces opened fire on a crowd in Tawu County in northwestern Sichuan Province on July 6. -- Just days after reports that Chinese police fired on a group of Tibetans marking the Dalai Lama's birthday, one of China's most senior officials vowed to continue with the fight against the exiled Tibetan leader. So far, more than 100 people have resorted to self-immolation, Tibetan advocacy groups have said. Independently verifying reported self-immolations inside China is often difficult because of restrictions on reporting from the restive areas and the reluctance of local officials to comment on the accounts provided by foreign groups such as Free Tibet. The Dalai Lama, who fled to India in 1959 after a failed uprising, has long denied China's assertion that he's seeking Tibetan independence.
