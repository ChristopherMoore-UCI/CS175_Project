Fuel cells generate electricity by converting hydrogen and oxygen into water. Learn more about fuel cells Â» "I need a car," says Petra Svenisdottir, an intern at Reykjavik Energy. The hydrogen gas is produced by electrolysis -- sending a current through water to split it into hydrogen and oxygen. Retired University of Iceland Professor Bragi Arnason has come up with a solution: Use hydrogen to power transportation. It won't be easy because of current technological limits and the high cost of storing large amounts of hydrogen, but Arnason feels confident it can happen.
