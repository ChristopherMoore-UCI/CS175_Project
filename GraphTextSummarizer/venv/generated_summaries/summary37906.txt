The warning against The Grove, the University of Mississippi's storied tailgating area, also prompted campus police to add additional law enforcement resources to address fan safety around the stadium ahead of the matchup, known to fans as the Egg Bowl. Authorities are investigating an anonymous threat against the University of Mississippi's signature greenery ahead of the school's big football game Saturday against bitter rival Mississippi State. A note received Tuesday on the Oxford, Mississippi, campus of Ole Miss said, "What's going to happen to ya'll on the field Saturday Aint nothing compared to what's going to happen on your beautiful campus. " TSUN, a reference to Ole Miss, stands for "The School Up North" -- both a geographical and snarky term for Oxford's location 100 miles northeast of the town of Starkville and Mississippi State and widely used when discussing the schools' matchup. "This longtime football rivalry has separated families and friends for generations, but while it's spirited, our attention has been focused mostly on the football field," Ole Miss police Chief Calvin Sellers said in a statement.
