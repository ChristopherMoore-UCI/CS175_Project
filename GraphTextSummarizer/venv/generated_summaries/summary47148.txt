An estimated 46,000 gallons of a water-and-oil mixture was spilled before the source of the leak -- a pipe rupture -- was identified Monday, according to the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation (ADEC). The ruptured 18-inch line, owned by oil company BP and which usually carries a mixture of 75 percent water and 25 percent oil, has been repaired. In an incident report on its Web site Wednesday, ADEC described the rupture as being "consistent with an overpressure scenario," caused by ice inside the pipe. The North Slope's biggest spill to date happened in 2006 when a corroded pipeline dumped 200,000 gallons of crude oil. "It is not a pool of oil spreading out across the ground," Reinhart said, comparing its consistency to that of a snow cone.
