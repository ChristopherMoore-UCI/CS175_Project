Engineer Rene Aguilar said all the pieces of the broken drill bit that were in the hole drilled by the Plan B operation had been removed, and drilling could begin again soon. Officials are sending down two packs a day to be split among the miners who smoke, Chilean Mining Minister Laurence Golborne said. A second customized bit was expected to arrive later Tuesday, and Aguilar said a camera was being lowered into the hole to check it out before drilling restarts. -- Officials working to free 33 trapped miners in a collapsed Chilean mine said Tuesday they had cleared a drilling hole that was blocked by a shattered drill bit. Brandon Fisher, whose Pennsylvania-based company Center Rock Inc. is rushing the replacement bit for Plan B to the site, described what happened when the drill hit the beam.
