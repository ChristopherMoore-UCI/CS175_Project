"It's not going to be popular with some people, but I think this actually is a good time to bring it up because immigration is tied so closely with our economy, and what drives economic growth is economic development. I believe there is a real chance of passing comprehensive reform this year, and the Senate panel on immigration will begin a series of meetings and hearings later this month with an eye towards meeting that goal," said Schumer, the chairman of the Senate subcommittee on immigration. Trevino argues that immigration is tied to economic growth, and therefore timely. The White House insisted that Thursday's New York Times story reporting that President Obama would start addressing immigration "isn't news." As a senator, Obama supported immigration legislation backed by President Bush, which would have increased funding and improved border security technology, improved enforcement of existing laws, and provided a legal path to citizenship for some illegal immigrants.
