This all seems particularly senseless to me because just two weeks ago on our own family vacation, we introduced our own 9-year-old to the joys of target shooting and the responsibility of gun safety. Because when you introduce kids to the sport of shooting guns, you are taking on a great responsibility. And gun ranges should know better than to hand one to a novice shooter passing through on vacation, let alone one as young as 9. Arizona laws require a person to be at least 21 years old to carry a firearm, but the laws do not apply on private property or if the minor is accompanied by a parent or certified instructor. Understand, I love shooting guns and so do my kids.
