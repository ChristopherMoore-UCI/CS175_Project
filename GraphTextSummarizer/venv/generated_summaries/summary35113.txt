Andaz Peninsula Papagayo Resort, Costa Rica Designed by local talent Ronald Zurcher, this Costa Rican retreat engages with its natural surroundings and local traditions. Hoshino Resorts KAI Aso, Japan Bathing in hot-spring water is an essential part of staying at a ryokan, a Japanese inn, and Hoshino Resorts KAI Aso, at the foothills of an active volcano, updates the cleansing ritual to new heights. Its 156-room Cincinnati property married designs by starchitect Deborah Berke with local craftsmanship: It commissioned Rookwood Pottery, the city's heritage ceramic producer whose roots date back to 1880, to manufacture Berke's whimsical bathroom tiles that mimic ears, lips, breasts and other body parts. Fresh air and natural light are prized commodities, as are stunning views of skylines or natural landscapes. And curating regional aesthetics and incorporating interesting materials is also top of mind; local supplies and recycled construction resources are layered with classically opulent stone, glass, wood and other substances.
