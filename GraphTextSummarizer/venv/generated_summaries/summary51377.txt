In 2012: Glenn Campbell talks about Grammys, living with Alzheimers "Sadly, Glen's condition has progressed enough that we were no longer able to keep him at home," Campbell's family said in a statement to Rolling Stone. It contrasts Campbell singing in the studio with home video and clips from throughout his career. Our family wants to thank everyone for their continued prayers, love and support." Campbell, who was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2005 and is best known for his hits like "Rhinestone Cowboy" and "Wichita Lineman," took his Alzheimer's in stride. Because of the progression of the disease, the 78-year-old Campbell was admitted to a special care facility in Nashville in April. The poignant music video that accompanies it spans Campbell's career.
