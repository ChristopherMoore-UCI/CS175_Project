In Madrid, demonstrations turned violent and two police officers were injured, Spanish national police said on Twitter. -- Tens of thousands of protesters amassed in Madrid and other Spanish cities on Saturday to voice their anger over harsh austerity and the way the country's being run in the wake of its financial crisis. CNN's Laura Perez Maestro reported from Spain and Per Nyberg from London, while Laura Smith-Spark wrote from London. Spain has witnessed frequent public demonstrations since thousands of Spaniards took to the streets in 2011, inspiring the global "Occupy" movement with their protest camp in Madrid's Puerta del Sol. The situation has compelled growing numbers to demonstrate against what they see as the gross unfairness of everyday life in Spain in 2013, where struggling citizens are evicted, even as hundreds of homes lie empty.
