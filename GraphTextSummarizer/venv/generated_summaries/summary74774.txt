The suspects are two men who are believed to have been traveling in a gray vehicle, said Lt. Wilfredo Rivera, of CataÃ±o Police. Camacho was rushed to a nearby hospital, said Dr. Ernesto Torres, of the Centro Medico of Rio Piedras. During his career he beat such legendary boxers as Roberto Duran and Sugar Ray Leonard and he held several championships. Rafael Rosa, of Bayamon Police, identified the driver killed in the attack as Adrian Mojica. Torres told CNN affiliate WAPA TV the bullet appeared to have entered the left side of the boxer's face and is now lodged in his right shoulder.
