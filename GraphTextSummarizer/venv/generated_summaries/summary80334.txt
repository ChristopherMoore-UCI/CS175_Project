• Other significant parts of our sanctions regime remain intact, including: -- Sanctions against the Central Bank of Iran and approximately two dozen other major Iranian banks and financial actors; -- Secondary sanctions, pursuant to the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act (CISADA) as amended and other laws, on banks that do business with U.S.-designated individuals and entities; -- Sanctions on those who provide a broad range of other financial services to Iran, such as many types of insurance; and, -- Restricted access to the U.S. financial system. Fareed Zakaria: What critics are getting wrong about the Iran deal Unprecedented transparency and intrusive monitoring of Iran's nuclear program Iran has committed to: • Provide daily access by IAEA inspectors at Natanz and Fordow. Oil sanctions alone will result in approximately $30 billion in lost revenues to Iran -- or roughly $5 billion per month -- compared to what Iran earned in a six month period in 2011, before these sanctions took effect. Humanitarian transactions have been explicitly exempted from sanctions by Congress so this channel will not provide Iran access to any new source of funds. The vast majority of Iran's approximately $100 billion in foreign exchange holdings are inaccessible or restricted by sanctions.
