As for economy, complimentary food will be available only on flights longer than 6½ hours, some international flights and all intercontinental flights, Clark said. " Though Clark said she was unsure whether Continental was the last major U.S. airline to offer complimentary meals to all passengers, she doesn't see the transition as negative.
