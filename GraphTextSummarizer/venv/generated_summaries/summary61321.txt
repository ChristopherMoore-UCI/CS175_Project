The road, running south from Ilovaisk, was the escape route for Ukrainian soldiers when the town finally fell to pro-Russian separatists after a three-week siege. Mariupol is Ukraine's fourth-largest city with a population of more than 400,000, an uneasy mixture of pro-Ukrainian and pro-Russian viewpoints that has exploded into violence several times since the unrest began. In an interview with CNN Tuesday, the youthful commander of rebel forces in Ilovaisk, who gave his name as Givi, was contemptuous of Ukrainian troops, who he claimed vastly outnumbered his men. The rebels have established a corridor from the city all the way to the coast in which there is no sign of Ukrainian forces. But their chaotic retreat marked one of the bloodiest defeats for Ukrainian security forces in their war to reclaim the east.
