" Britney Spears kicks off Las Vegas casino residency When Spears appeared on Jimmy Fallon's "The Tonight Show" on Tuesday, the late-night host decided to help a girl out. For example, if you get nervous on a date and accidentally call her Ms. Spears, you'll get an "It's Britney, b***h" in response. Britney Spears is now single and ready to mingle -- maybe even on Tinder. The 32-year-old pop star has had a very public breakup from ex-beau David Lucado in recent weeks, and has joked about being back on the hunt for "hot guys." So before the show you did something cool: you let us sign you up for the dating app Tinder," Fallon told a bewildered Spears.
