Israel's government is missing an opportunity to secure the country's future and build a coalition of nations to counter increasing Iranian influence, according to analyst Fareed Zakaria. He has within his coalition members of the orthodox right in Israel who still very much hold to a view that the Jewish state should be on most, if not all, of the land of greater Israel, which includes the West Bank. ... "If that really is the case, shouldn't Israel try to be supportive and deepen the relationship with the one country whose military, political and economic support is going to be absolutely crucial in dealing with this threat, that is, the United States? "If the Iranian threat were really the overriding threat to Israel, wouldn't it be willing to subordinate other issues and make some progress on the Palestinian issue because it would help the moderate Arab states who also share the worries about the rise of Iran, and would allow the moderate Arab states to form a kind of tacit alliance with Israel? But it's a far cry from the man who wants to present himself as an international statesman or even an important figure in Israel's history. I think it's short-sighted, in terms of demographics, regional politics, in terms of the technology of terrorism, pushing this problem away when there will be more Palestinians with the potential for being more radicalized, perhaps a greater international coalition arrayed against Israel.
