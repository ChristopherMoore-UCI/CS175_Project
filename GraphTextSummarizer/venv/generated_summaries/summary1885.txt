The New York area also awoke to a winter weather advisory, with 2 to 5 inches of snow in the city followed by rain but a higher amount in interior New Jersey, the Lower Hudson Valley and Southern Connecticut. The major storm on track to hit the Northeast starting Monday night could heap the heaviest snowfall from coastal New Jersey and New York City, to Boston and coastal Maine. Blizzard conditions are possible in New England on Tuesday, with forecast models showing more than two feet of snow in Boston and as much as a foot in New York. For large swaths of the Northeast, Saturday arrived with a messy mix of sleet, snow and rain -- with parts of Pennsylvania and New Jersey receiving as much as 8 inches of snow before the storm set its sights on New England. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo urged drivers in the Hudson Valley, New York City and Long Island to exercise caution.
