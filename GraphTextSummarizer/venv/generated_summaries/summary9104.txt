But now, six years after Barbaro captivated the racing world with his electrifying Kentucky Derby win, Matz is back at Churchill Downs with another bay colt, Union Rags. Those who were at Kentucky's Churchill Downs that May day in 2006 would have been forgiven for thinking that they had just witnessed the second coming of 1973 Triple Crown winner Secretariat as Barbaro took control of the race coming off the last bend. Michael Matz has spent a lifetime working with horses -- first as a member of the U.S. showjumping team that won the silver medal at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, and more recently as a trainer of racehorses. And few would begrudge Matz the fairytale ending he never had with Barbaro. Although he was checked over by a vet and eventually reloaded, in many ways Barbaro's race was over before it began.
