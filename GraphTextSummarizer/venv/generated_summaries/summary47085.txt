"I would always tell her that she was one of the greatest vocalists of our time." Among her songs were "Lovergirl,"  "Portuguese Love," "Ooo La La La," and "I'm a Sucker for Your Love." " "The enduring influence of Teena's inspirational, trailblazing career, could only have been made possible through her brilliant song-writing, showmanship and high energy passion which laid the ground work for the future generations of R&B, hip-hop, and soul," said Gene Rumsey, chief label officer with Concord Music Group. While no cause of death has been released, the singer's publicist Lynn Jeter said that Marie suffered a grand mal seizure -- a neurological event, marked by loss of consciousness and violent muscle contractions, according to the Mayo Clinic -- a month ago. "I am horrified by the sudden death of my darling Teena Marie," Motown founder Berry Gordy said in a statement sent by his publicist. Marie was found dead by her daughter after apparently dying in her sleep, manager Mike Gardner said.
