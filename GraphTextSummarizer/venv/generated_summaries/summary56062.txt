Much more than a source of discomfort, the growing frequency of heat waves in cities poses a significant public health threat. -- Extreme heat in major U.S. cities this week signals more than the arrival of the dog days of summer. An analysis of weather records at Georgia Tech reveals that the average number of heat-wave days in large U.S. cities each year had increased from nine in the mid-1950s to 19 by the mid-2000s. Because of these two effects -- one global, the other local -- most large American cities are warming at more than twice the rate of their outlying rural areas and the planet as a whole, and this accelerated pace is at the root of the increasing frequency of heat waves. Programs already under way in New York, Los Angeles and other cities to plant millions of trees can measurably cool the air and dampen the extremity of heat waves over time.
