When their national teams are playing, visiting police officers will be at Poland's police headquarters in Warsaw, the nerve-center for security operations during the event. "We are absolutely the best prepared for Euro 2012 and welcome everybody who wants not only to see football games, but also to see how hospitable we are and how beautiful the country is." Poland is following on from lessons learned at recent big European tournaments, like Euro 2008 in Austria and Switzerland, and Germany's staging of the World Cup in 2006. Last year's Polish Cup Final between Legia Warsaw and Lech Poznan was a high-profile example of how domestic football in Poland is still blighted by hooliganism, as violent fans clashed with police and water cannons had to be used to control the crowd. However police in the capital have spent years preparing for Euro 2012 and reducing the potential of trouble from homegrown and international football hooligans. Poland has a lot riding on the tournament it is co-hosting with Ukraine, and is no stranger to football violence.
