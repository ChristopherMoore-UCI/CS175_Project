The jets, that are designed for use by the Navy, Air Force and Marines, were grounded on February 21 due to a crack in an engine component that was discovered during a routine inspection in California, the Pentagon said. "No additional cracks were found during inspections," the Pentagon's F-35 program office said in a statement. The U.S. military cleared the F-35 fighter jet to fly again after the fleet of jets were temporarily grounded. The program has been beset by cost overruns and various technical problems during development. The nearly $400 billion Joint Strike Fighter is the Pentagon's most expensive weapons system.
