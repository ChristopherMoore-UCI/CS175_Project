-- Three North Korean doctors serving at a hospital in Nigeria's northern Yobe state were killed early Sunday morning, police said. On Friday, nine health workers who were administering polio vaccinations were killed in Kano, the biggest city in northern Nigeria. There were mixed reports initially on where the victims were from, but the police chief of Yobe told CNN they were North Korean physicians assisting at Potiskum General Hospital as part of a government agreement. "At this point we cannot say if they are Boko Haram, hired killers or common criminals, but we have cordoned off the area and are in the process of interrogating them," Commissioner Sanusi Rufa'i said. The government in Pyongyang has not confirmed that the victims were North Korean nationals.
