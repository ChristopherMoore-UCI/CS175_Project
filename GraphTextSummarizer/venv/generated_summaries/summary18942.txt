John Phillip Bradford, 62, died in the elephant enclosure at Dickerson Park Zoo, according to Springfield Police Department spokeswoman Lisa Cox. "This is very sad day for the Zoo family, as well as our community as a whole," zoo director Mike Crocker said in a written statement. -- A 41-year-old elephant named Patience charged and killed a Springfield, Missouri, zookeeper who had come to feed her Friday. He was the manager of elephants, and had worked at the zoo for 30 years, according to a zoo statement. The other two workers were unharmed, Cox said.
