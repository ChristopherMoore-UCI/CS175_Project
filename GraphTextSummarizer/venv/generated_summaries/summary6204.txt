A club spokesman said: "We have lodged a complaint to the Premier League match delegate with regards to inappropriate language used by the referee and directed to two of our players in two separate incidents in today's match." Later Sunday, Chelsea said they had made a formal complaint against referee Clattenburg, accusing him of using "inappropriate language" to two of their players. Dutchman Van Persie then connected with an Antonio Valencia cross to make it 2-0. -- Nine-man Chelsea lost 3-2 to Manchester United in a pulsating and controversial top-of-the-table English Premier League clash at Stamford Bridge Sunday. The score was tied at 2-2 just after the hour mark when Branislav Ivanovic was shown a straight red for pulling down Ashley Young after he was played through by Robin van Persie.
