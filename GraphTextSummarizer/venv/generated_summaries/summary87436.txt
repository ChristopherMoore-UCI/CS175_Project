The 52-year-old New Hampshire man, who took hostages six years ago at one of Hillary Clinton's campaign offices, was not in his Manchester halfway house when he was supposed to be Sunday afternoon, according to the New Hampshire Department of Corrections. Eisenberg has a history of mental illness and substance-abuse problems, authorities say. In 2007, he entered Clinton's campaign office in Rochester, New Hampshire, with road flares strapped to his chest. In an interview with CNN in 2007, Eisenberg said he took the hostages to raise awareness about mental health issues. "I wanted to sacrifice myself for mental illness and bring about the discussion about mental illness," Eisenberg said.
