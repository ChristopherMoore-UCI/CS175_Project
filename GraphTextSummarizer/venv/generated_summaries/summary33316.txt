As President Obama ratchets up the pressure on Congress to pass health care reform this year, he's following in the footsteps of the 42nd president. Mary Matalin, a Republican strategist and CNN contributor, predicted a repeat of history for Obama, should health care fail. -- With his push for health care reform on the line, the president delivered a message of urgency to the public: President Bill Clinton, pictured in 1994, greets members of a crowd following a speech on his health care reform plan. "I think the time is critical for President Obama because at the end of the year, Congress goes off and takes a recess ... and so you end up having a pretty narrow time frame, and then when they come back in January -- guess what, it's an election year," Crowley said. Sen. Jim DeMint, R-South Carolina, said last month that if Republicans can stop Obama on health care, "it will be his Waterloo."
