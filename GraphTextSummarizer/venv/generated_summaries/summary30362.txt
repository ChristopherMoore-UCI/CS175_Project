After considerable soul-searching, Arieff traveled in 2008 to Anand, a city in western India that has earned a reputation in recent years as the capital of India's so-called "rent-a-womb" industry. In western India, where I was, it was slow and quiet. Her search for a solution brought her to India, where she found a woman willing to carry her and her husband's embryo in a controversial practice known as foreign gestational surrogacy. So yes, there is a lot of corruption and exploitation with surrogacy in India but that was not the case in our journey. With a lot of clinics in India you never meet the surrogates and that's weird, so there are definitely a lot of horrible things that happen in India with surrogates.
