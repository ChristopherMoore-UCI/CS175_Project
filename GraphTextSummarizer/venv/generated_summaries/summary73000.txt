To donate to Save the Children's Syria Children in Crisis Fund, which provides relief and support for Syrian children seeking refuge in Lebanon, Iraq and Jordan, please click here. Regionally, Save the Children has reached 80,000 children and families so far and is working to triple our response in Lebanon, Iraq and Jordan. UNHCR estimates that the number of refugee children in the region has surpassed 250,000, and that number continues to climb. In Al Qaem, Iraq, the anger and despair of the refugees is palpable. As winter tightens its grip on Syria's neighboring countries, stories like those I heard in Al Qaem are far from unique.
