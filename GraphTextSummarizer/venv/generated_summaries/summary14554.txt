Close to 9 in 10 of the patients WHO health professionals are seeing with Ebola are dying, said Dr, Stephane Hugonnet, who returned from southeast Guinea last weekend. The Ebola outbreak in coastal West Africa is still contained to Guinea and Liberia, the World Health Organization announced Tuesday, despite rumors of the virus spreading to other countries. They are working to prevent the spread of infection, primarily in health care facilities, and are sending personal protective equipment to surrounding countries. "What is really important is to inform the population of Guinea and Conakry about this disease, as this is the first time they are facing Ebola," Jasarevic said. The outbreak has "rapidly evolved" since originating in the forests of southeastern Guinea.
