"I know all of our performers are looking forward to having a smiling audience in those seats this evening," said Steve Payne, circus spokesman. On Sunday, during a show in Providence, Rhode Island, eight performers plummeted to the ground when a hair-hang apparatus -- which holds performers by their hair -- failed. Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus will return to the ring Thursday for its first show since an accident sent nine performers to the hospital. Payne said that an investigation is ongoing and that all the carabiners linked to the incident were replaced as a precaution. Among the performers who remain in the hospital, three are still in serious condition, the spokesman said.
