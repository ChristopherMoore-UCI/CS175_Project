The ministry said Russia's Foreign Ministry, the Federal Security Service and the Defense Ministry were alerted to the attack, and the Russian government established contact with rescue centers in nearby Seychelles and Kenya. A day earlier Russia's navy said the Neustrashimy and a British frigate, HMS Cumberland, had rebuffed pirates' attempts to seize the Danish ship MV Powerful in the Gulf of Aden. The pirates raced toward the ship, the Captain Maslov, in a high-speed boat late Thursday afternoon and attacked as it headed from Colombo, Sri Lanka, to Mombasa, Kenya, the ministry said. " Two alleged pirates were killed during shooting between those aboard the small boat and Cumberland crew members, the statement said. The ship is owned by Cyprus' Diataxis Shipping Company and is operated by a Russian shipping company, FESCO Transport Group.
