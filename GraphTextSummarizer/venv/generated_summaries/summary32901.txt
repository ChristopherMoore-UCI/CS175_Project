The scene of devastation is staggering in Debaltseve, the town at the heart of the battle between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian separatists in recent days. Hours after Kiev pulled its troops out of Debaltseve, Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council said it would ask for U.N. peacekeepers to be sent to eastern Ukraine. The leaders of Ukraine, Russia, France and Germany spoke Thursday by phone in an attempt to patch up the deal, rocked by the fierce fighting for control of Debaltseve, a strategic railroad hub. Debaltseve: Inside the ghost town Ukraine's Poroshenko has not hesitated to point the finger at Russia over the fighting this week in Debaltseve. The ramifications for the West are huge because the 10-month-long conflict in eastern Ukraine has hiked tensions with Russia to a level not seen since the end of the Cold War, affecting trade and raising the specter of a Russian threat to Eastern Europe.
