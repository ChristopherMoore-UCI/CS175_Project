A gunshot struck the home of CNN anchor Lou Dobbs this month, and police in New Jersey are trying to determine whether the bullet was fired intentionally or was a stray. Dobbs, who has been a vocal critic of illegal immigration, is the anchor and managing editor of CNN's "Lou Dobbs Tonight." When asked whether police would refer the case to federal authorities if it turned out to be an attack, Jones said, "state police work regularly with other officers at local, county and federal levels and draw on any of resources when appropriate." Dobbs' wife saw damage to the siding, Jones said. Steve Jones said Thursday that his department received a call from Dobbs' wife, who heard a shot and said a bullet hit her house.
