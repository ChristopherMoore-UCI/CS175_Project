We feel that some of the agenda that African women such as Congolese women want to put forward to end the war is not being listened to because there is another agenda so that the illegal trade of natural resources will continue in the Congo. The Guinean activist was named "Inspirational Woman of 2012" by the UK group "Women 4 Africa." CNN: "Make Every Woman Count" publishes an annual report detailing the treatment of women in each country to remind people that African women are watching. By using the power of social media, of the internet, really reaching women around Africa and in the diaspora here and that is what we are really trying to do -- to really give African women the voices they deserve that we haven't seen so far. But ultimately, in 2020, we want to look back and say "we have at least achieved this in this country" -- for example "in the Democratic Republic of Congo, we have achieved more women in parliament, the end of violence against women, the end of sexual violence. It's easy to say that African women's voices need to be heard but often there is a huge price to be paid when African women speak out.
