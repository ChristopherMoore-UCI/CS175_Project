Some 15 states considered whether to create new medical marijuana laws, 14 weighed creating new medical marijuana programs and 14 considered decriminalizing marijuana, according to an analysis of current state marijuana legislation efforts performed by the National Conference of State Legislatures for CNN. In the effort to get marijuana-related ballot initiatives, pro-pot legalization advocates have also netted the support of older voters who perhaps may be more likely to suffer from ailments they hope marijuana can alleviate, and those who were born during the 1960s and 70s and bore witness to looser cultural attitudes about drug use, marijuana policy experts said. "If anyone's electoral strategy is to bring out new voters, one area they would target is young adults and marijuana legalization." A CNN/ORC International poll conducted in January found that a little more than half of those surveyed — 55% — supports marijuana legalization. If voters approve a closely-watched ballot initiative in November, Florida could become the first Southern state to allow medical marijuana.
