-- Prize money at this year's U.S. Open will be increased by over $2 million to a record $25.5 million, organizers announced Wednesday. In other tennis news Wednesday, Lukas Rosol, who sent second seed Rafael Nadal crashing out of Wimbledon in one of the biggest upsets in the tournament's history, made an early exit from the ATP tournament in Stuttgart. These record-breaking figures will be supplemented by potential bonuses from the Emirates Airline U.S. Open Series Bonus Challenge. The top three men's and top three women's finishers in the Emirates Airline U.S. Open Series will be awarded an additional bonus prize of up to $1m at the end of the grand slam, provided they earn points in at least two series events. "We believe the additional prize money, as well as how it will be strategically distributed, will help alleviate some of the pressure," said Jon Vegosen, U.S. Tennis Association (USTA) President and Chairman of the Board.
