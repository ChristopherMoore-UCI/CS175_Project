At a hearing Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Alexandria, Virginia, Judge Anthony J. Trenga  told the government that it should make arrangements to allow Mohamed to return before the end of this week unless it could produce evidence against him. U.S. State Department spokesman Philip Crowley denied Mohamed was being detained at the behest of the United States. The lawsuit says Mohamed came to the United States from Somalia with his family when he was just 3 years old, grew up in Virginia and is now a naturalized citizen. Stuck in limbo between the country he calls home and the place he was visiting on what his lawyer describes as a journey of self-discovery, Gulet Mohamed of Alexandria, Virginia, has been trapped in Kuwait for nearly a month, according to a lawsuit filed Tuesday in federal court in Virginia. But Mohamed's lawyer, Gadeir Abbas, says in the lawsuit that the U.S. government is impeding his client's basic right to return and live freely in the United States.
