But Beckham has been frequently used by PSG coach Carlo Ancelotti, though the Englishman was criticized by the French press for his performance against Barcelona -- one of Ibrahimovic's former teams -- in the Champions League quarterfinals last week when the sides played to a 2-2 first-leg tie in Paris. However Ibrahimovic believes that the former England captain's experience will help PSG as it seeks to upset Barcelona and also claim the French league title for the first time since 1994. After Lionel Messi gave Barca a first-half lead, Ibrahimovic drew PSG level from an offside position in the 79th minute before Xavi restored the visitors' one-goal advantage with an 89th minute penalty. But instead of the visitor walking away with a 2-1 victory, Blaise Matuidi boosted PSG's second-leg prospects with a deflected effort four minutes into injury time. Besides Ibrahimovic's offside goal, the Catalans were upset that German referee Wolfgang Stark allowed play to continue when Javier Mascherano and Jordi Alba collided in the second half, leaving both Barcelona defenders prone on the ground.
