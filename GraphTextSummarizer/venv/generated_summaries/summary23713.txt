India has also launched what it calls a National Mission for Clean Ganga involving various stakeholders, including religious figures and environmentalists. Some of the corpses were half-burnt, and many just skeletal remains, said Saumya Agarwal, the chief of the riverside district of Unnao where the bodies were recovered. Efforts to contain river pollution date back to 1986, but little success has been achieved. The ashes are then scattered into rivers. "These bodies and decomposed skeletons from dismantled graves surfaced when the water level dropped as low as to the riverbed," she said.
