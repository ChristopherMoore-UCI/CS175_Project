Hidden inside and outside of the bar, other Outlaws members were ready to fight and threaten the Desperados with weapons. Campbell said members of an ATF Special Response Team pulled up to a house in Old Orchard to arrest Thomas Mayne and Kenneth Chretien when shots were fired at them from the house. According to the court document, Outlaws members planned an assault where they would send three of their smaller members into a bar occupied by the rival gang in an effort to lure them into a fight. Among the examples mentioned in the indictment is a 2005 incident where members of the Outlaws struck a member of a rival motorcycle club with a vehicle. Also mentioned in the indictment is the 2009 Outlaws assault of members of the Desperados Motorcycle Club in Virginia.
