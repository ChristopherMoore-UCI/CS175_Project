Interest, meet Pinterest: Site helps users catalog their passions How successful is Pinterest? The web-based "pinboard," which launched almost two years ago, barely got a mention on Silicon Valley news sites until six months ago, when early adopters suddenly realized that a site with millions of monthly users had sprung up almost unnoticed by the tech press. And the third is that "people-centric" recommendations are being augmented by "topic-centric" networks -- which is to say that while Facebook lets you explore the Web through information shared by friends, newer social networks organize content by topics of interest. Demographics are surely a large part of Pinterest's success: While technology's early adopters have sprung upon other interest-driven networks like Quora, these sites now suffer from a form of "cumulative disadvantage" in which mainstream users are put off by how tech-centric they've become. That's because Pinterest didn't take the usual route of Web-based startups: romancing early adopters and technology journalists before attempting to "cross the chasm" to mainstream adoption.
