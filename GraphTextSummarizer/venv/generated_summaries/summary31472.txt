-- Hosts Brazil claimed top spot in Group A at the troubled Confederations Cup with 4-2 win over Italy in Salvador Saturday. Shortly afterwards, Neymar, who has scored three goals in the competition, was substituted by coach Luiz Felipe Scolari, rested ahead of a last four clash in Belo Horizonte next Wednesday. Demonstrators have taken to the streets to highlight the cost of Brazil hosting next year's World Cup and the 2016 Olympics against a background of sub standard public services and corruption. Before the match in Salvador at the Arena Fonte Nova, Italy coach Cesar Prandelli had advised his squad to stay inside their hotel because of security fears, but only limited protests were reported there. Neymar whipped in a free kick and after Fred's header was palmed clear by Italian goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon, Dante pounced to slot home the rebound.
