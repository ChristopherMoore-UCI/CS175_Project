Shortly after the killer's suicide in December, Anchorage police Detective Monique Doll described Keyes as a murder addict, saying police interviews with him showed he got "an immense amount of enjoyment" from killing. Koenig was one of at least eight people Keyes admitted to killing, but he may have taken other lives, police have said. Keyes' notes were released by the FBI on Wednesday after they were cleaned up at the bureau's lab in Quantico, Virginia. "Israel Keyes never expressed in any way, shape or form that he was ashamed of or regretted his actions," Doll said in December. But a read of them does give a glimpse into Keyes' mind, apparently describing how it felt to take a life and the disdain in which he held much of American society.
