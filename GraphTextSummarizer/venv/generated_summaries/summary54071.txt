Boudina, one of his friends later told French investigators, was longing to fight alongside jihadists in Syria, and had decided to leave before the dragnet came down, according to officials. According to French officials, they first joined the Syrian al Qaeda affiliate Jabhat al-Nusra and then are suspected of joining the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), which now refers to itself as the Islamic State. After learning he was on his way back from Syria, they had put his father's building -- in Mandelieu-La Napoule, just up the coast from Cannes -- under surveillance in case he surfaced there, according to French security officials. Following a long trail According to French security officials, Boudina had set off for Syria in late September 2012 with a childhood friend -- Abdelkader Tliba, a French-Tunisian who worked as a cook in grand restaurants on the Cannes seafront -- just days after Jeremie Louis-Sidney, an alleged fellow member of their close-knit radical circle, had thrown a grenade into a Jewish grocery store in Sarcelles, a suburb of Paris, injuring a shopper. French security services feared the duo might have plans to launch an attack when they returned to France, according to counterterrorism officials, but had no idea what, if anything, was planned.
