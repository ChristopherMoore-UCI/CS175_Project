Not only does NOAA report that we are experiencing more extreme weather events, but the UN's Internal Displacement Monitoring System reports that those events are having a greater impact than ever before. While those of us who work in the field of environmental policy and sustainability management believe that human-induced climate change is partially responsible for these trends, let's ignore for a moment the causes of this problem and start thinking about what to do about the impact of extreme weather events. This is because the planet has more people than it used to. This means that when floods, fires, winds and earthquakes hit, more people are in harm's way. We need to devote more public resources to pay for emergency response and reconstruction from weather-related catastrophes.
