Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a longtime friend of the Clinton family, thinks the former Secretary of State will decide whether she'll run for president in 60 days. I'm really hoping she runs, but I'm leaving that decision to her," McAuliffe told U.S. News & World Report on Thursday. John Podesta, Bill Clinton's former chief of staff and current Obama adviser, told PBS' Al Hunt on Friday that he will join Hillary's campaign if she asks. When asked whether his close ties to Clinton would land him the VP spot, McAuliffe said he's "just happy to support her." The Virginia governor's projection means Clinton will have made up her mind by mid-January 2015, which matches the time frame Clinton said she plans to make her widely anticipated decision.
