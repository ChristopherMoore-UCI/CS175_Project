Several months later, Luis Andros, a U.S. citizen who is originally from Greece, and his wife, Iris Botros, left their restaurant business in North Carolina for Egypt. Iris Botros and her husband, Luis Andros, are accused of trying to smuggle twins out of Egypt. Separately, they visited orphanages in Egypt. Botros, who is originally from Egypt, visited another orphanage run by the church. Khalil Adil El Hamani, the attorney representing Hagelof, says Egyptian authorities want to prove that all the defendants are from one gang and are trafficking children, so as to make the case seem to be a giant conspiracy.
