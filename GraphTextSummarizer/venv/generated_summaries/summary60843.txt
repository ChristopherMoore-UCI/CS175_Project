A group of around 700 people turned out Saturday morning at the gates of Sanaa University to give their support to the Egyptian people following the ouster of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, said Fuad Dahaba, a member of parliament for the opposition Islah party. -- Brief clashes erupted Saturday in Yemen between hundreds of pro- and anti-government demonstrators who staged rival rallies in the capital. Anti-government protests have recently spread across Yemen, inspired by the revolts that ousted the Tunisian and Egyptian presidents. Yemen "expresses its respect for the choice and the will of the Egyptian people," a government official said, according to Saba news agency. A day after the clashes, Yemen said it is confident the military council that took over Egypt will steer the nation through the political crisis, the Yemeni official news agency reported Saturday.
