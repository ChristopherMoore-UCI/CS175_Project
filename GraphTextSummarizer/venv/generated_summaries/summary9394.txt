Around the world, city leaders are not wasting time debating the science of climate change or waiting around for international treaties to be signed; we are taking action. It creates a forum for cities to share best practices and resources -- and even to collaborate with other cities and institutions. That puts cities on the frontlines of the battle against climate change -- and more and more cities are leading the charge. For instance, C40 has now formed partnerships with the World Bank and other international organizations that have expertise and resources, which are helping cities take bolder actions more quickly. Thanks to C40's research, we know that C40 Cities have taken more than 4,700 actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the possible effects of climate change.
