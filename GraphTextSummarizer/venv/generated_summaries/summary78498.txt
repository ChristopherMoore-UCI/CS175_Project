The aluminum plant at the heart of the deadly toxic red sludge spill in Hungary will resume production at the end of the week, government officials said Wednesday. Some 500,000 cubic meters of toxic red sludge is in the plant's reservoir, whose wall shows signs of ruptures and cracks, said Gyorgi Tottos, a spokeswoman with Hungary's emergency services department. The red sludge leaked from a reservoir at the plant in Hungary and streamed through villages and into the Danube, Europe's second largest river. Workers in Hungary have been racing to build three emergency dams to stem an expected second toxic spill from the plant. " The company said it has performed extensive maintenance work and renovations in the past decade and had followed safety regulations.
