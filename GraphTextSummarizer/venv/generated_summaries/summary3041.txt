Yes, Democrats have to persuade swing voters, but there isn't enough persuasion in the world to make up for a 17 percentage-point difference between Democratic base precincts and Republican base precincts; that's a nearly a 2 million vote difference in these five key states alone. In these key battleground states, 65-plus performing Democratic precincts (precincts that vote Democratic at a rate of 65% or better -- in other words, Democratic base) turned out at 34%, while Republican 65-plus precincts (precincts that vote Republican at a rate of 65% or better -- base Republican) turned out at 51% as a percentage of registration. While base Republican precincts remain fairly energized from presidential to midterm elections, Democratic base precincts do not. If Democratic base precincts across the battleground states turn out on average 17 points lower than Republicans precincts in November, Republicans will take the Senate and swell their majority in the House of Representatives along with their numbers in statehouses across the country. In key battlegrounds, Republicans have a 17-point advantage in the actual voter turnout between base Democratic precincts and base Republican precincts.
