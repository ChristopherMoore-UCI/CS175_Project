For 35 years, Wosniak worked one-meter underground in one of the coal mines dotted across the small town of Lens, in northern France. -- Seventy-nine-year-old Henri Wosniak had only ever seen France's beloved revolutionary painting -- "Liberty Leading the People" -- on postage stamps. Boasting hundreds of masterpieces on loan from the Louvre in Paris, the slick â‚¬150 million ($204 million) museum has become an unlikely art haven, sitting in the shadow of Lens' looming slag heaps. Happy Birthday This week marks the first anniversary of Louvre-Lens, and already 750,000 people have visited the sleek glass and polished aluminum building, 200 kilometers north of Paris. For retired miner Wosniak, the biggest thrill was seeing the gallery's star attraction -- Eugene Delacroix's "Liberty Leading the People" -- a painting commemorating the 1830 revolution and familiar to everyone in France.
