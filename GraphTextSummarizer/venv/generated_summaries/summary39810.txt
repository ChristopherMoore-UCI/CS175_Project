The airport is still only partially rebuilt, while much of the city is a mix of mangled steel structures, concrete shells that used to be houses, roadside graveyards, tents and crowded temporary homes known as "bunkhouses". The storm surge destroyed thousands of homes on the coastal strip. At the Alejandro Hotel a sheet hangs from the roof with the words "Tacloban Tindog" ("Stand Up Tacloban"). New timber is in short supply. There are no hard rules about where to rebuild but it is clear that the government sees these new rebuilt homes as temporary.
