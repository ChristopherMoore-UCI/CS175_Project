Environmentalist Ma Junhe waters saplings at his ecological forest site in Minqin, China. " The sinking underground water table is testimony to the desertification that has been threatening the survival of Minqin, an oasis town precariously sandwiched between two large, expanding natural deserts in western China. "The environment started to deteriorate rapidly." After high school Ma had traveled across southwestern China as a pharmaceutical salesman. But Ma doubts the authorities' ad hoc approach -- such as shutting down factories and construction sites to reduce air pollution -- would work in combating desertification. In 2005 Ma returned home and created a web site titled "Saving Minqin."
