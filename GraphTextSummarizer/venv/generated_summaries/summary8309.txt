The 19th century was notable for two stretches of great-power peace of roughly four decades each, punctuated, however, by major wars among great powers and culminating in World War I, the most destructive and deadly war mankind had known up to that point. If the balance of power shifts in the direction of other powers, the world order will inevitably change to suit their interests and preferences. The first half of the 20th century saw the two most destructive wars in the history of mankind, and in prior centuries war among great powers was almost constant. We take a lot for granted about the way the world looks today -- the widespread freedom, the unprecedented global prosperity (even despite the current economic crisis), and the absence of war among great powers. If they gain greater relative influence in the future, we will see fewer democratic transitions and more autocrats hanging on to power.
