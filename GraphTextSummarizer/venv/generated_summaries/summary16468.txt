Garth Brooks works weekends in Vegas His youngest daughter Allie graduated high school in May, relieving Brooks of his paternal duty to drive his kids from his farm in Owasso, Oklahoma, to school each morning and be there for every soccer match. The traffic, noise and "potential antisocial behaviour" by Brooks fans could add up to "an unacceptable level of disruption" for Dublin residents, the council said. " Several dozen angry fans gathered outside the stadium Tuesday to protest with chants and signs, demanding the shows be allowed. The country star's promoter confirmed Tuesday it was canceling "The Garth Brooks Comeback Special Event" in Dublin because the city council there would only approve three concerts -- not the five that Brooks wanted. Fans have only seen him perform since then at a few benefit concerts and a weekend residency in Las Vegas.
