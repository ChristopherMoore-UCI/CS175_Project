Ancelotti is rumored to be a key figure in a game of managerial musical chairs which could see the Italian move to Real Madrid to replace Jose Mourinho, who is reportedly on the brink of a return to former club Chelsea. Spain's Rafael Benitez acted as interim Chelsea manager from November, leading the club to Europa League triumph and a third-place finish the league. The celebrations of Paris Saint-Germain's first French title in 19 years have only just finished but the Qatari-owned club already face a fight to keep hold of one of the their most valuable assets -- manager Carlo Ancelotti. "I think he signed a pre-contract with Real Madrid, but I can't imagine Real Madrid will make him sign an agreement or there will be a problem in law," he told Al-Jazeera. Real are certain to finish second in the Spanish First Division and sit 13 points behind champions Barcelona with just fixtures against Real Sociedad and Osasuna remaining.
