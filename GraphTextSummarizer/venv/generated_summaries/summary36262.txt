On "Jimmy Kimmel Live" Wednesday night, host Kimmel concocted a small get-together between Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox and Lisa Kudrow. Before long, Aniston and Kimmel's re-enactment of "Friends" -- on a replica of the set, no less -- was boosted by the appearances of Cox and Kudrow. It may sound dumb -- especially since Monica and Ross were siblings on "Friends" -- but as Kimmel replied to Aniston's criticism, "Is it dumber than living in a huge apartment in New York City for eight years, even though you work at a coffee shop? Yet the actors themselves, from Aniston and LeBlanc to Kudrow, have warned fans to lower their expectations. In April, Cox told David Letterman that a full "Friends" reunion was pretty unlikely, considering she couldn't even get all of the stars in one place for dinner.
