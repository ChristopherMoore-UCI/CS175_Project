" Massey first made her allegation two months after she retired in an affidavit in support of a mariner in a $15 million lawsuit against Coast Guard employees. Most of the cases were settled or resulted in guilty pleas without reaching a courtroom, and some were dismissed, but overall Coast Guard prosecutors had a 97 percent success rate, the Baltimore Sun reported. Inspector General Richard L. Skinner's 53-page report is a nearly complete victory for the Coast Guard's administrative law judge program, which hears cases brought against merchant mariners, and a repudiation of retired Administrative Law Judge Jeffie J. Massey, who claimed the system was rigged in the Coast Guard's favor. Massey, a judge from July 2004 until March 2007, said in a court affidavit and later testified before Congress that Chief Administrative Law Judge Joseph N. Ingolia specifically told her in 2005 that she should always rule for the Coast Guard. "Instead, they assert that (Ingolia) only instructed her to follow Coast Guard's regulations."
