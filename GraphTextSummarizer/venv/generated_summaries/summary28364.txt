-- Tributes are flowing for Scottish author Iain Banks, who has died aged 59 after a short battle with cancer just days before the release of his final novel. He added: "Right now I'd like to kick cancer in its sniggering head, but instead I'll take a single malt." Fellow Scot Irvine Welsh, the author of "Trainspotting," called Banks "one of the finest writers and greatest imaginations ever," and said his debut novel "was one of those books that changed my life (and) made me want to be a writer." The rapid passing of the writer, known for his love of malt whisky and strong political views -- he tore up his passport in 2003 in protest at the Iraq War -- drew an outpouring of grief from fellow authors and fans alike. Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond described Banks as "one of Scotland's literary greats who always approached life with extraordinary vitality. " Banks released a statement in April revealing he had been diagnosed with late-stage cancer of the gall bladder, after suffering what he believed was a back strain.
