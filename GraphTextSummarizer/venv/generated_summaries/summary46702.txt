-- As ballots were being counted in Somaliland, a breakaway republic in northwest Somalia After the fall of Somali dictator Siad Barre in 1991, Somaliland declared its separation from Somalia, according to the CIA World Factbook. Voters cast ballots under threats of violence from al-Shabaab, the primary Islamist group leading an insurgency in and around the capital city of Mogadishu in southern Somalia. In an audio message to local media, the group's leader, Sheik Mukhtar Abdirahman Abu Zubeyr -- himself a descendant of Somaliland -- called democracy "the devil's principles" and warned people in Somaliland not to adopt it. The northwestern region of Somaliland achieved independence from Britain on June 26, 1960, followed by the rest of Somalia, which became independent of Italy five days later on July 1, 1960, and joined Somaliland to form the state of Somalia.
