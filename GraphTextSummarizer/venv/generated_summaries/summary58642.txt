In 1950 when Trick-or-Treat for UNICEF began, kids simply decorated old milk cartons to collect change. It turns out that although my grandmother did establish the U.S. Fund for UNICEF, and was president for over 25 years, and while she was a great lady, she did not, in fact, invent Halloween. But I bet that this year, like last year and many years prior, there's still change behind that couch and in those old coats. But if I then mention the little orange Trick-or-Treat boxes on Halloween, suddenly everyone knows UNICEF. Since Halloween 1950, that "simple plan," that "nothing big," has raised more than $144 million for UNICEF.
