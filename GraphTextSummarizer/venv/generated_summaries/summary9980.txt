Angelina Jolie, 36, and Brad Pitt, 48, a Hollywood megastar couple since 2005, are engaged, Pitt's representative said Friday. Jolie was previously married to actor Jonny Lee Miller and actor Billy Bob Thornton. Jolie, the daughter of actor Jon Voight and actress Marcheline Bertrand, won an Oscar for her role as a mental patient in the 1999 film "Girl, Interrupted." Despite ongoing reports that Jolie and Pitt began their love affair during the making of 2005's "Mr. and Mrs. Smith" -- while Pitt was still married to Aniston -- Jolie insisted to the UK's Stylist magazine in 2010 that their relationship began after the film. Pitt, who grew up in Springfield, Missouri, was nominated for an Oscar and won a Golden Globe for his role in the 1995 science fiction film "Twelve Monkeys."
