"I think it's great because cycling used to be a European sport and now we see Australian riders, North Americans and the British coming forward," Gilles Simon, the cycling editor of L'Equipe, the French sports newspaper so closely associated with the Tour, told CNN ahead of the race's start on Saturday. Away from the battle for yellow, Mark Cavendish, who joined Wiggins at the powerful and well-funded Team Sky for 2012, will be defending the maillot vert (green jersey) of the points winner as he bids to add to his fast mounting tally of 20 stage victories in the Tour. "The biggest hope for us is that another rider can do the same as Voeckler," admitted Simon, who singled out Pierre Rolland, winner of the white jersey last year for best under-25 rider, for a possible high finish. Between 1999 and 2005 seven straight wins for American Lance Armstrong threw a spanner in the spokes of the Tour's traditional powerbrokers, and the trend has continued apace. And what of French chances in their home Tour?
