The charges were outlined in a probable cause affidavit filed by police, but Portwood, 20, will not be arrested until the Madison County, Indiana, prosecutor files formal charges, Carroll said. Two of the three charges are felonies because the couple's 1-year-old child apparently witnessed the violence, according to Anderson, Indiana police spokesman Mitch Carroll. "According to police documents, on August 14, 2009, Portwood shoved Shirley against a wall, slapped him on the face and choked him," Carroll said. Gary Shirley, the 24-year-old boyfriend, and Portwood gave statements to police last month admitting to the incidents, he said. -- MTV's "Teen Mom" Amber Portwood faces felony domestic violence charges in her Indiana hometown because of incidents on her reality TV show -- where she is seen shoving, punching, slapping and choking her boyfriend, a police spokesman said.
