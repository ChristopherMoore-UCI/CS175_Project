" Nadal will play 10th seed Mardy Fish in the last eight after the American battled past sixth seed and last year's runner-up Tomas Berdych 7-6 6-4 6-4. The 22-year-old returned and ensured the third set went into a tie-break but made a series of unforced errors to hand his Spanish opponent the upper hand before Nadal powered to victory in the fourth. He had been surprised to see William and Kate in the Royal Box on Centre Court and joked to reporters afterwards he would have liked advance warning. The Swiss will now face France's Jo-Wilfried Tsonga who overcame seventh seed David Ferrer 6-3 6-4 7-6. Six-time Wimbledon champion Roger Federer dropped the first set against Russian 18th seed Mikhail Youzhny but recovered to triumph 6-7 6-3 6-3 6-3.
