New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and conservative activist and neurosurgeon Dr. Ben Carson tied for third in the poll, gaining a nod from 8% of Republican voters. Get ready: 2016 starts now While Romney nabbed the top spot among 707 Republicans surveyed following several months of stumping for candidates on the midterm campaign trail, he and his family have said it's unlikely he'll pursue a bid -- though he hasn't shut the door on a potential run altogether. Carson has attracted a small but loyal following among the party's conservative base, taking third place in the Conservative Political Action Conference straw poll this year -- an informal measure of the GOP base's enthusiasm for candidates. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush came in second as 11% of voters said they would pick him as the Republican nominee if the primary were held today. While respondents were split among the 15 Republican names listed in the poll, Democratic voters' preferred candidate is unquestionably former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton who pulls 57% of support in a field of six potential candidates after 610 Democrats were surveyed.
