While some candidates trained their sights on Cain, others tried to sully former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, who has solidified his lead in national polls and in New Hampshire, a state central to his nomination strategy. -- Herman Cain, the latest Republican presidential candidate to surge in the polls, found himself in the hot seat Tuesday night at a debate in New Hampshire centered on economic matters. He added, "Can we trust you with your lack of experience that you won't continually give Washington the ability to take freedom away from freedom-loving people?" Bachmann said the plan would do little to create jobs and would simply offer the government a new way to collect tax revenue. "We need something that's doable, doable, doable." Two candidates competing with Cain for conservative voters in the leadoff caucus state of Iowa, former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania and Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota, sharply questioned Cain's economic credentials. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich attacked the current Federal Reserve chairman, Ben Bernanke, and said the central banking system should be subject to greater oversight.
