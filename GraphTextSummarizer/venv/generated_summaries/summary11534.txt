The toy was thrust into the political spotlight during last year during a highly publicized gaffe by Mitt Romney's senior campaign adviser, who compared his candidate's positions to an Etch A Sketch. Fascinated by the invention, American Henry Winzeler, founder and president of The Ohio Art Company, licensed L'Ecran Magique for $25,000 and introduced it as Etch A Sketch in the United States in 1960. "It's almost like an Etch A Sketch. " Jane Labowitch, a 21-year-old art student in Chicago, said she has played with an Etch A Sketch since she was 4 years old. So it was fitting that Labowitch would remember Cassagnes with an Etch A Sketch of him.
