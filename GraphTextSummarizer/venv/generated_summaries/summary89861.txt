King said he saw Herter Brothers furniture from the same estate in Alfred Hitchcock's "Psycho," filmed in 1960 on Universal's lots. Movie studios were scouring the country for cheap furniture for their props departments, King said. You can watch post-1942 Warner Brothers period films to find them. The Herter Brothers -- German immigrants who set up their furniture-making shop in New York City after the Civil War -- also made furniture for the White House, where some pieces remain. But recent decades have see a steep rise in values for Herter Brothers craftwork, he said.
