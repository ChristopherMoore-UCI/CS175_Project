So if your Twitter handle is, say, @ILoveCookies, you got a tweet from the Patriots account that included a photo of the jersey with @ILoveCookies on the back, along with a thank-you note. The "custom digital jersey" was actually a photo of the back of a Patriots jersey displaying a fan's Twitter handle where the player's name appears. That's what happened to the NFL's New England Patriots this week, when the football team's attempt to reward their followers on Twitter turned into a social media manager's worst nightmare. It all began Thursday morning, when the Patriots tweeted they were celebrating reaching 1 million followers by thanking fans with "custom digital Pats jerseys." When a Twitter user with the name @IHateN*****ss asked for a jersey of their own, the Patriots cheerfully responded.
