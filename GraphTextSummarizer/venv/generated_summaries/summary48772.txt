Manning, who is also the subject of a court martial, faces charges that include aiding the enemy, wrongfully causing intelligence to be published on the Internet, theft of public property or records, transmitting defense information, and fraud and related activity in connection with computers. WikiLeaks, the international online group that publishes secret government documents it receives from outside sources, set off a firestorm a year and a half ago when it made public on its website U.S. diplomatic cables and other sensitive documents, most of them pertaining to the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper told an information-sharing conference in January that plugging leaks of classified materials is still a challenge for the community as it develops new systems to protect information, while at the same time ensuring the right people have access to it. Prosecutors charge that Manning put software on secure computers that allowed him to download classified material and burn it to a compact disc. He said changes have already been made to monitor information and keep track of who has access to it.
