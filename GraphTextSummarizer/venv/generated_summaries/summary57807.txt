Nearby there's "PrefabCorp" - a hypothetical merger of all existing Russian prefabricated housing suppliers, and "Ark-Stroy" -- a booth selling above-ground bunkers based on Russian social housing blocks, designed for post-apocalyptic living. There's a great sense of theater here, and underneath is a well-considered comment on both the state of modern architecture and the means by which new ideas are communicated and sold. In a playful, tongue-in-cheek turn, 20 fictional companies have set up shop across rows of mock sales stands -- most with a dedicated agent -- offering commercial, distinctly Russian-themed solutions to the problems of contemporary architecture. Sat in a fresh white shirt without so much as a bead of sweat on his tanned, furrow-less brow, Koolhaas appears remarkably calm for a man who's just spent the last four years managing this colossal undertaking, often referred to as the "Olympics of Architecture. To echo Koolhaas, it's also a bold reminder that architecture is -- or at least should be - about a great deal more than blueprints, digital renderings and scale models.
