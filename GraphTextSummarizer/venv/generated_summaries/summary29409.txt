-- CNN's Piers Morgan calls the on-screen relationship between "The King's Speech" actors Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush "one of the great bromances we've ever seen in the movies." Firth, with his co-stars Geoffrey Rush and Helena Bonham Carter, joins Morgan tonight at 9 to talk about their movie, which leads the Oscar race and has dominated the awards shows so far. "The King's Speech" dominated the British Academy of Film and Television Arts awards Sunday, with Firth winning lead-actor honors and co-stars Helena Bonham Carter and Rush claiming supporting-actor wins. "If you do happen to be lucky enough to be sitting in that little televised box," said Rush, "you know, it's probably the best acting you have to do in your entire career." "Somebody told me you're supposed to keep your mouth open because your mouth will fall open anyway," said Firth, who is nominated for best actor. When Morgan asked Firth to describe Rush, the actor said, "I would describe him as my geisha girl." Geoffrey Rush appeared via satellite from Australia. When asked whether he had trouble reverting from the stammer to his normal speech pattern in everyday life, Firth said, "It's bizarre how contagious the stammer is."
