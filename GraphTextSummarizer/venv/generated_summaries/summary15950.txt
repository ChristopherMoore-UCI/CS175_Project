Smart abruptly left the courtroom during Wednesday's testimony by defense witness Paul Whitehead, a forensic psychiatrist who treated Mitchell, CNN affiliate KSTU reported. "Mr. Mitchell was talking with Ms. Smart about having babies to the point where Ms. Smart actually picked out a name in case that happened," Whitehead testified. Federal prosecutors are expected to follow the defense with several days of rebuttal testimony against Brian Mitchell, who is charged with snatching Smart from the bedroom of her family's Salt Lake City home in 2002. Utah teenager Elizabeth Smart rested their case Thursday afternoon, a day after the young woman stormed out of court during testimony. Nine months after her abduction, Smart was found in the company of Mitchell -- a drifter and self-described "prophet" who called himself Immanuel -- and his wife, Wanda Barzee.
