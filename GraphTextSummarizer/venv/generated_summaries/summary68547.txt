Aerosmith have moved the release date for "Music From Another Dimension," their first album in 11 years, back from August 28th to November 6th, frontman Steven Tyler revealed during a call to Cleveland radio station 100.7 WMMS. One of those tracks could be the blues-tinged rocker "Oh Yeah," which the band debuted last week at the Minneapolis kick-off of their Global Warming tour, which finds them trekking across North America alongside Cheap Trick throughout the summer. "We accomplished what we set out to do, which was write some stuff so we could represent who we were in the old days," Tyler told WMMS. The group debuted the record's first single, "Legendary Child," during the season finale of "American Idol" last month, but the song has failed to gain traction on both the Billboard and iTunes charts. Tyler also mentioned on-air that Sony will release two more singles before the album drops in November.
