Los Angeles police issued an emergency protective order effective for five days starting Thursday, but the actor's lawyer could ask a judge to extend it. A journalist accused of striking Brad Pitt at the "Maleficent" premiere has been charged with four misdemeanors, Los Angeles City Attorney spokesman Rob Wilcox said Friday. He was already on three years of "formal diversion" -- a form of probation -- in Los Angeles for crashing the Grammy stage during Adele's acceptance last year, according to the Los Angeles city attorney's spokesman. Ukrainian TV reporter Vitalii Sediuk was charged with one count of battery, one count of assault and two violations of the Los Angeles municipal code, Wilcox said. Pitt was signing autographs Wednesday at the area of the red carpet where fans are allowed to gather when Sediuk allegedly jumped the rope and hit  the actor in his face, according to Los Angeles Police Sgt.
