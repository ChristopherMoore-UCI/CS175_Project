-- Eliot Spitzer, who resigned as governor of New York in the wake of a prostitution scandal, is looking at a return -- this time as comptroller of New York City. "I accepted responsibly for what I did," Spitzer told CNN late Sunday night. "It is ripe for greater and more exciting use of the office's jurisdiction." Besides serving as governor, Spitzer was New York's attorney general. In running for comptroller, Spitzer said he's looking for forgiveness and a second chance. Since stepping down, he has worked as a commentator for various news outlets, including CNN.
