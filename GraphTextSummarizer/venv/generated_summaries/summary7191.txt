Piven: There's a great documentary called "Slasher" about car salesmen that I took a look at, and I went to a bunch of lots, and I've also been sold a lot of cars, and I'm what's known as a sucker. From drama to comedy, Piven has starred in more than 40 films on the big screen and has won critical acclaim for his role as super agent Ari Gold on HBO's "Entourage." Watch why part of Piven's interview had to be bleeped out Â» James Brolin would go home to his wife, Barbra Streisand, at night, and I would say, "James, is she OK with all this?" Anything is possible, even in some 40 some movies in your career, but this is the first lead in a while, I mean did it take you a while to get into the used car salesman character? Jeremy Piven stars as a used car salesman in "The Goods."
