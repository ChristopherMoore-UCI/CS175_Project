The National Conference of State Legislatures reports: • 48 states and the District of Columbia allow religious exemptions from vaccines • 20 states allow philosophical exemptions. They're more likely to have vaccine safety concerns and to "perceive fewer benefits associated with vaccines," a study found -- despite the scientific evidence and debunking of a study that suggested vaccines could trigger autism. According to the CDC, in the United States: • 95% of children in kindergarten have had vaccines for preventable diseases, including two doses of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. Opponents of vaccines against diseases like measles are simply on the "wrong side," CNN chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta says. Even within states that have high exemption rates, "vaccination exemptions have been shown to cluster geographically, so vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks can still occur where unvaccinated persons cluster in schools and communities," the CDC says.
