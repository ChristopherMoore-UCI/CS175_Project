See more photos of Warsaw's places and people » To get a feel for the city that was known as the Paris of Eastern Europe before World War II, stroll down Nowy Świat Street, lined with restaurants, cafes, bookstores and small shops. Modern Warsaw is a mix of shiny new skyscrapers, tree-lined boulevards, ornate prewar buildings and somber concrete communist relics. "Fall in love with Warsaw," the capital invites visitors in a slogan printed on posters all over town. There are buds and blooms adding color all over the capital, from the quaint Old Town to the bustling city center to the massive concrete apartment blocks left over from the communist era. Bustling Nowy Świat Street flows into elegant Krakowskie Przedmieście Street as you near the Old Town, Stare Miasto.
