Jonathan May-Bowles caused an uproar when he thrust the paper plate covered in foam towards the face of News Corp. CEO Murdoch at a hearing before lawmakers in London last month. The foam pie incident was captured live on television as Murdoch and his son James answered questions from lawmakers over alleged wrongdoing by the staff of News Corp.'s British arm, News International. -- A man who threw a shaving foam pie at media mogul Rupert Murdoch while he testified over the British phone hacking scandal has been jailed for six weeks, court officials told CNN Tuesday. The swift reaction of Murdoch's wife, Wendi Deng, who leapt to defend her 80-year-old husband and smashed Bowles's hand with her own, also attracted wide media interest. May-Bowles pleaded guilty last week to assaulting Murdoch, the British Press Association reported.
