An affiliate of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula claimed responsibility for that explosion, which killed at least 101 soldiers and injured more than 220 as troops prepared for a national ceremony. -- A suicide bomber attacked police officers and cadets outside an academy in Yemen's capital on Wednesday, killing at least 10 people, according to a statement from the Yemeni Embassy in Washington. The attack signals that al Qaeda is trying to demoralize the police force and scare people from joining the security forces, the official said. The blast happened around 1:30 p.m. at the police academy in downtown Sanaa, four Interior Ministry officials said.
