After seeing photographs of the aftermath, Brutter resolved to build a product to help save lives of people trapped in structurally unsound buildings during earthquakes. Brutter and Bruno estimate that 300 million children live in areas of the world prone to earthquakes with weak school buildings. "The earthquake-proof table started when I was a student in industrial design at the Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design, Jerusalem," says co-inventor Arthur Brutter. This was the concern guiding Arthur Brutter and Ido Bruno when they dreamed up the earthquake-proof table -- an invention that aims to provide affordable protection to people in earthquake-prone areas of the world. Dr Richard Luckett, a seismologist at the British Geological Survey, says that this estimation strikes him as reasonable: "there are a lot of cities in regions where large earthquakes can be expected and many of these are in the developing world."
