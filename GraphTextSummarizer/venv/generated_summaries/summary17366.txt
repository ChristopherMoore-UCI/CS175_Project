Transport coordination efforts are run entirely by Roth, who spends many hours on his cell phone inquiring about the location of volunteers and Palestinian families. Roth joined the group, called Parents Circle - Families Forum, and befriended many Palestinians. Since 2006, Roth and his team of volunteers have been giving Palestinians a lifeline. More than 500 times in the past two years, Yuval Roth and his volunteers have driven Aya and her mother roundtrip from a checkpoint near the West Bank border to Rambam Medical Center, which is an hour away in Haifa, Israel. Nominations are open for 2011 CNN Heroes Even though differences exist, including some language barriers, Roth believes that the program helps Israelis and Palestinians learn from and respect each other.
