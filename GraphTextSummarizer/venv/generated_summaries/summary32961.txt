The long days of multiple repetitions, weights and stretching with the physical therapists reinforced a mental strength that I had developed over years of elite competition. All the things that I learned from playing hockey could be translated to competing in figure skating. In competition, I struggled a bit. However, the possibility of recurrent injury and perhaps never walking pain-free again steered me in the direction of figure skating. Going into the U.S. trials, I decided to stick with jump passes that were more familiar to me.
