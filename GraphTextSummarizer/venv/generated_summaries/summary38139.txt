While each cited different reasons, both Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas say they're now more interested in running. "And that's a question I'll have more clarity on after this mid-term, because I can promise you this: the one place where I will not be able to do that from is a Senate that is still run by [Majority Leader] Harry Reid that allows no votes on anything of substance or importance. One factor Cruz said is impacting his decision to seek higher office: the debate in the Republican Party on how deeply the United States should be enmeshed in global crises. Rubio says the current Senate gridlock is limiting his ability to advocate for the kind of policies he sees as critical for moving America forward and that the White House might be a better place for that. In an interview with ABC News, Cruz again denounced President Barack Obama's foreign policy and said he thinks voters want the United States to play a more prominent role in world affairs.
