"Senior police and military officers who failed to act upon knowledge of Ampatuan crimes have not been investigated; investigations into the source of the family's weapons have lacked transparency and independence; and the national institutions responsible for accountability -- the Justice Department, the Ombudsman's Office, and the Commission on Human Rights -- have done nothing significant to address the situation. The Ampatuan family and its forces are "one of the most powerful and abusive state-backed militias in the Philippines," says a new 96-page report released by Human Rights Watch, called "They Own the People." The executive secretary in the administration of former President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo categorically denied the allegations leveled in the report, saying that the administration's "earnestness to promote, protect and fulfill human rights has always been clear, and not even the unceasing efforts of critics, including ill-prepared reports, will diminish or discredit it." "In addition to the 58 killed in the Maguindanao massacre, the family is implicated over the years in the killing of at least 56 people, including relatives of opposition politicians, landowners who resisted forced acquisition of their property, eyewitnesses to Ampatuan crimes, including their own militia members, and even children," the rights group's report says. The trial of Ampatuan Jr. and his alleged accomplices has been delayed repeatedly, most recently because of a defense request for more preparation time.
