However, in a statement issued last Friday, a representative for Scott said, "The figures quoted in the media regarding the financial status of LS Fashion Limited are not only highly misleading and inaccurate but also extremely hurtful and disrespectful to the memory of L'Wren Scott." "The long-term prospects for the business were encouraging. Ms. Scott was very focused on doing what was right for her global business and for the support of her team," the statement said. "I give all my jewelry, clothing, household furniture and furnishings, personal automobiles, and other tangible articles of a personal nature...to Michael Philip Jagger," Scott wrote in her will, according to a document released by the Manhattan Surrogate's Court Thursday. Jo Wood, the ex-wife of Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood, told CNN last week that the finances of Scott's fashion business may have played a role in her suicide. Her death was ruled a suicide, according to the New York City medical examiner, who determined Scott killed herself by hanging.
