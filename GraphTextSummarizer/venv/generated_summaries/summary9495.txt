The 2014 event in Russia cost an estimated $50 billion and IOC members are concerned that candidates will be frightened off applying to host the Games. The next Winter Games takes place in Pyeongchang, South Korea, in 2018. Gian-Franco Kasper, president of the International Ski Federation (FIS) and an influential member of the IOC, says the entire bidding process and cost of the Games needs to be addressed when the governing body meets in Monaco next month. "We'll have an extraordinary IOC session in December," Kasper told CNN, referring to the IOC meeting on December 8 and 9. Earlier this month, Thomas Bach, president of the IOC, said there would be a proposal to "change the philosophy of the bidding" for future editions of the Games.
