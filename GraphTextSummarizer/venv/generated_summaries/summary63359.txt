The incident reportedly took place during Iranian military maneuvers in southern Iran. The black and white aerial footage, which Iran claims was from a RQ-170 spy plane, was aired by Iranian news agencies and placed on YouTube. "IRGC's electronic warfare systems detected electronic signals, which indicated that foreign drones intended to enter our country," said Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Lt. Gen. Hamid Sarkheili, Fars reported. In December 2012, Iran's navy claimed that it had captured another U.S. drone, after it entered Iranian airspace over the Persian Gulf. At the time, U.S. officials acknowledged that the drone was missing and President Barack Obama asked Iran to return it.
