"We'd like to say this was an isolated incident, but I can't say that with any certainty," Denver Police Chief Robert White said Wednesday afternoon as he asked members of the public to help investigators. -- Denver police opened a homicide case Wednesday after firefighters found five people dead inside a bar that was set ablaze. Reports of a fire at Fero's Bar and Grill came in around 1:50 a.m. Wednesday. Arson investigators were also looking into what caused the fire, police said. Firefighters working to put out the blaze found four women and one man dead, police said.
