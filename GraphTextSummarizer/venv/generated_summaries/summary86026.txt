A U.S. Navy official in the region said that operations in proximity to Iran's regular navy have been "formal and correct," but added that IRGC forces "rarely respond" to U.S. Navy attempts at ship-to-ship communications with them. U.S. Navy ships would not want IRGC vessels sailing too close to them because of that concern, they said. IRGC forces earlier this year seized a group of British sailors at the northern end of the Gulf and held them for several days. Several U.S. Navy officials said the move is militarily significant for the United States because of the IRGC's terrorist affiliation. Mullen said Iran made a "strategic decision" in recent months to "essentially give the entire Gulf to the IRGC over the next four or five years.
