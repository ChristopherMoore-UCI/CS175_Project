-- Ten days after grounding its fleet of drones, federal border officials Friday says they have determined the cause of a January 28 drone crash and are returning the remaining aircraft to the sky to continue patrolling U.S. borders. On January 28, a flight crew ditched the unmanned aircraft in the ocean 20 miles southwest of San Diego after concluding they were unable to return it to its base in Sierra Vista, Arizona. In 2006, the agency lost another unmanned aircraft when it lost communications with it as it patrolled the southern border. Officials say the generator on the aircraft -- a $12 million variant of the Predator B -- failed, forcing operators to ditch the plane in the Pacific Ocean. In that instance, the aircraft was programmed to go to a pre-designated airspace and "loiter" in the event of a loss of communications.
