-- Three African men suspected of ties to al Qaeda in North Africa have been arrested in Ghana and flown to New York to face charges that they engaged in drug trafficking and supported terrorism, federal officials said Friday. The Drug Enforcement Administration, which announced the criminal complaint, said the suspects will appear Friday in federal court in New York. While such a relationship is long-standing in Afghanistan, it has not been common in Africa, officials said. The alleged plot involved shipment of cocaine from Africa to Europe, with al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb helping facilitate the trafficking. Authorities said the apparent ties between the suspected African terror group members and the cocaine traffickers appear to represent an increasingly global effort to use the drug trade to support terrorism.
